That relief was granted, but execution has now been stayed by a single Justice of the Court of Appeal of Tanzania pending appeal to that Court. Any decision by this Tribunal on the Claimant\u2019s Emergency Request for Recommendation of Provisional Measures addressed to those judicial proceedings has been deferred at the request of the Parties.\n\n2.\n\nAt the first session of the representatives of the Parties with the Tribunal, held on 14th June 1999, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 13 and 20, a timetable was fixed for the future conduct of the arbitration, including for the making and hearing of any request for provisional measures which IPTL might see fit to make now that the Tribunal was fully constituted and seized of the dispute.\n\n3.\n\nAs anticipated, IPTL filed a Request for Provisional Measures, in which it sought a recommendation, pursuant to Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that TANESCO:-\n\n(i) Permit commercial operation of the Facility;\n\n(ii) Pay to IPTL US $32,607 million, as accumulated capacity payments which it alleged had been due since deemed commercial operation of the Facility on 15th September 1998; and\n\n(iii) Continue to pay capacity payments at the rate of USD $3,623 million per month (or, alternatively, US $3.4 million per month as allegedly previously agreed by TANESCO) until final determination of the issues in the arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nFurther written submissions followed, and a hearing took place before the Tribunal in London on 18th and 19lh October 1999, IPTL being represented by Mr Sentner and Mr Penski of Messrs Nixon Hargrave, Devans & Doyle LLP, and TANESCO being represented by Mr Hawkins of Messrs Hunton & Williams. In the course of the hearing, Mr Sentner withdrew IPTL\u2019s request for a recommendation relating to the claimed lump-sum in respect of accumulated capacity payments, and amended the first recommendation sought to clarify that IPTL not only wished to have permission to operate the Facility, but effectively sought a recommendation that TANESCO co-operate in doing all that was necessary to enable such operation to commence, which necessarily included the completion of operational tests, and the connection of the Facility to the Tanzanian electricity grid.\n\n5.\n\nA number of issues were argued, including in particular the following.-\n\n(i) Did the Tribunal have jurisdiction to entertain the request or to make the recommendations sought?\n\n(ii) Was the request one for conservatory measures or. in effect, for specific performance of the Agreement?\n\n(iii) Would the effect of making the recommendations sought be to maintain the \"status quo\"?\n\n(iv) Did IPTL demonstrate an urgent need for the relief sought?\n\n6.\n\nBefore considering these matters, we observe that both Parties concentrated a great deal of attention in their written and oral submissions on the \"merits\" of the dispute. As we sought to make clear in the course of the hearing, we think it neither appropriate nor indeed possible for us at this stage to form or express any concluded view on the merits. Our decision is required to address only the issues formulated by the parties and recited above.\n\nDo we have jurisdiction?\n------------------------\n\n7.\n\nIt was common ground that our jurisdiction (if any) must flow from one of two sources, namely:-\n\n(i) English arbitration procedural law, and in particular the Arbitration Act 1996; and/or\n\n(ii) the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.\n\nThe former was argued by IPTL to be applicable because in paragraph 18(c) and (e) of their Agreement, the Parties had provided that the \"arbitration shall be conducted in London, England\" and that \" [t]he Law governing the procedure and administration of [the] arbitration....shall be the English law.\" The latter was agreed to be applicable because the Parties\u2019 Agreement refers disputes to arbitration under the ICSID Convention and Rules.\n\n8.\n\nWithout determining whether or not it applies vel non, we note that the English Arbitration Act grants considerable powers to arbitrators, and in particular, under section 38(4), the power to give directions in relation to the preservation of property. However, section 39 provides that the Tribunal only has power to order on a provisional basis relief which it would have power to grant in a final award (including, in particular, a provisional order for the payment of money or disposition of property) if the parties agree to confer such power on the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nRule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which follows Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, provides, under the heading \"Provisional Measures\n\n\"At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"\n\n10.\n\nAs we understand it, IPTL sought to found jurisdiction on section 39 of the English Arbitration Act and Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules, which latter provision it contended constituted an agreement by the Parties to extend the powers of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nWe conclude that we have jurisdiction to make the recommendations sought, provided that they satisfy the requirements of Rule 39, which is all the power the Tribunal would have even if section 39 of the English Arbitration Act applied (as to which it is unnecessary for us to reach or express any conclusion).\n\n**Is this an application for conservatory measures? Would the recommendations sought maintain the \"status quo\"?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nAlthough neither Article 47 nor Rule 39 uses the phrase \"conservatory measures\", it is implicit in those provisions and it is our understanding that it has been so construed and applied. Provisional measures for the preservation of rights in our view contemplate measures that will prevent the erosion of rights pending final resolution of the dispute. We accept that the rights which such measures can be invoked to protect are not limited to proprietary rights, and are not limited to rights over corporeal things. They can include, for example, contractual rights.\n\n13.\n\nHowever, there is in our view a distinction to be drawn between the protection of rights and the enforcement of rights. It was no doubt in appreciation of this that Mr Sentner sought to contend that the recommendations sought would have the effect of maintaining the \"status quo\". His justification for this was the assertion that IPTL enjoyed rights under the Agreement which, in the absence of the recommendations sought, would be likely to be eroded, since there was a risk that the lenders to IPTL. whose rights to foreclose on the loan security (the Facility) had already accrued, would do so and thus deprive IPTL of ownership of the Facility; and a real risk that, by the time any final award in the arbitration were to be issued, TANESCO, and its owner, the Tanzanian Government, would not be in a financial position to be able to honour it, since no revenues would have been generated by the Facility in the meantime.\n\n14.\n\nThis submission requires a degree of speculation. There was no evidence put before us to the effect that the lenders have been contemplating foreclosure other than the letter of Bumiputra-Commerce Bank Berhad Corporate Banking dated 16th November 1999 threatening \"drastic steps to recover the loan granted\" should \"the situation remain unchanged by end November 1999.\" We doubt, however, whether the lender would regard such a step as in its financial interest, since the Facility could not be sold to be operated by a purchaser without the co-operation of TANESCO. It may be that, by the time our final award is issued, assuming that we were to uphold IPTL\u2019s claim and make a substantial monetary award in its favour, TANESCO would be unable to satisfy it. But there is some precedent for the view that conservatory or provisional measures under Rule 39 should not be recommended in order, in effect, to give security for the claim. See e.g. Atlantic Triton Co. Ltd v Guinea (Case No. ARB/84/1) 3 ICSID Reports 3; see also Paul D. Friedland, \"Provisional Measures In ICSID Arbitration\", 2 Arb Inf 1 335, 348.\n\n15.\n\nIn our view, Mr Hawkins was right in his submission that what IPTL sought, in reality, was specific performance of the Agreement and/or an interim mandatory injunction requiring such performance. As we understand it, the \"status quo\" can be summarised as follows: IPTL, on the one hand, is contending that the Agreement remains in being and requires the Facility to be put into operation, whereas, on the other hand, TANESCO is contending that it was entitled to cancel the Agreement, and in any event that the applicable Reference Tariff, agreement upon which it is alleged is necessary before the Facility can be operated, has not yet been agreed; and, pending resolution of the dispute, the Facility has been standing idle. Far from seeking to maintain that \"status quo\", the recommendations sought by IPTL were plainly directed to affect a fundamental change to it.\n\n16.\n\nWe do not go so far as to conclude that \"provisional measures\" under Rule 39 can never include recommending the performance of a contract in whole or in part, it is not necessary for us to go that far. But where what is sought is, in effect, performance of the Agreement, and where the only right said to be preserved thereby is the right to enjoy the benefits of that Agreement, we consider that the application falls outside the scope of Rule 39, and therefore is beyond our jurisdiction to grant.\n\n17.\n\nIt is said that TANESCO would not suffer any harm if the recommendations were to be made, since the electricity produced and put into the grid would be readily saleable at a profit to TANESCO. This may well be, although there was evidence from Dr Swales to the effect that Tanzania\u2019s immediate needs for further electricity may not be so substantial as at one time had been thought. But we do not think that the balance of convenience, or, looking at it from a different perspective, the balance of harm, can be a sufficient ground on its own for granting this sort of relief - if the nature of the relief is beyond that contemplated by Rule 39.\n\n**Has IPTL demonstrated an urgent need for the relief sought?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nNor are we persuaded that IPTL has demonstrated an urgent need for the relief sought. As we have indicated, we have serious doubts about the assertion, unsupported by evidence, that the lenders may foreclose, or at least do so in the foreseeable future. Further, whilst it may be that TANESCO's ability to satisfy a substantial monetary award, save out of income from the sale of electricity from the Facility, may be in doubt, if our final award were to be in IPTL s favour, and the Facility is ultimately put into operation, IPTL will receive its agreed tariff payments for the full contractual period of 20 years. All it will have lost will have been the use of the money over a period when it will have been committed to repayment of capital and interest under its loan facility. There is no reason to believe that TANESCO would be unable to satisfy any award of damages in respect of this, out of its revenues on the sale of electricity produced. There is, admittedly, a great deal of uncertainty, but the burden at this stage must be on IPTL to make out its case of urgent need. It has not done so.\n\n19.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal declines to make the recommendations sought."}, {"Title": "Decision on Preliminary Issues", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2000-05-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Preliminary Issues\n------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nAt the hearing before the Tribunal on 18 and 19 October 1999, it was proposed by the Tribunal, and agreed between the parties, that the parties should address certain issues of construction and / or law, arising in the arbitration, to be determined by the Tribunal on a preliminary basis. A schedule for the filing of submissions on the formulation of the preliminary issues, and written memorials and counter-memorials in relation to such issues, as finally formulated by the Tribunal, was agreed and ordered.\n\n2.\n\nSubsequently, in the course of correspondence between the parties\u2019 legal representatives, the Secretariat of ICSID and the Tribunal, the issues to be determined as preliminary issues were defined as follows:\n\n1. Was or is TANESCO entitled to terminate the PPA?\n\n2. If not, what are the effects (if any) on the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations under the PPA of:\n\n(a) the change from low speed to medium speed diesel engines; and / or\n\n(b) any other alleged differences between the Facility as built and that provided for in the PPA and/or any other agreements between the parties?\n\n3. How is the final Reference Tariff to be calculated, in the light of the said change and any other differences which may be established?\n\n4. What was the effect on the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995, and, in particular, did Addendum No. 1 on its true construction have the effect that the final Reference Tariff was to be calculated by reference to the reasonable and prudently incurred cost of the Facility as built; and what were \"the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\"?\n\n3.\n\nWritten memorials were filed on behalf of the parties in relation to the above issues on 26 January 2000, together with witness statements and documents relied on. Reply submissions were served on behalf of the parties on 28 February 2000, together with further witness statements and documents.\n\n4.\n\nBefore the hearing, both parties provided the Tribunal with copies of the legal authorities to be relied on.\n\n5.\n\nAn oral hearing on the preliminary issues took place before the Tribunal at the Fleet arbitration Centre, London on 13, 14 15, and 16 March 2000, TANESCO being represented by Mr Robert W. Hawkins, Mr John Jay Range and Mr Brett A. Bakke of Messrs Hunton & Williams, and IPTL being represented by Mr Robert C. Sentner, Mr Christopher M. Paparella and Miss Nancy P. Hill of Messrs Nixon Peabody LLP.\n\n6.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, the Tribunal was informed that none of the witnesses whose statements had been served on either side was required to be called for cross-examination.\n\n7.\n\nAn application was pursued on behalf of TANESCO, following its request filed on 7 March 2000, for postponement of the hearing pending the disclosure by IPTL of further documents which had been requested. The Tribunal, after deliberation, refused this application.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing the hearing, and in accordance with directions agreed between the parties, and given by the Tribunal, short post-hearing briefs dated 20 April 2000 were served on behalf of both parties.\n\n9.\n\nThe record in relation to the preliminary issues then being closed, the Tribunal has considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, both written and oral, together with the evidence adduced, and has reached its unanimous decision on the preliminary issues (which is intended to be final in relation to those issues which it determines, and which will be incorporated in our Final Award in due course) as follows:\n\n10.\n\nHaving had the benefit of the parties\u2019 respective submissions, and in light of the way the parties put their case, it appears to the Tribunal that the preliminary issues ordered can and should be considered under three broad headings, as follows:\n\n(1) Was the PPA a valid and binding contract? This question involves two sub-issues, namely:\n\n(i) Did the PPA never become binding because of the failure of a condition precedent (namely the approval of the Government of the Republic of Tanzania)?\n\n(ii) Was the PPA void for uncertainty (a question which involves consideration of the meaning and effect of Addendum No. 1)?\n\n(2) If the PPA became a valid and binding contract, was TANESCO entitled to serve Notice of Default, and is TANESCO entitled to give notice of termination accordingly? This question sub-divides into:\n\n(i) issues of construction / agreement; and\n\n(ii) issues of waiver and / or estoppel.\n\n(3) If the PPA was and remains in force, how should the Reference Tariff be adjusted pursuant to Addendum No. 1? In addition to the meaning and effect of Addendum No. 1 (see (1)(ii) above), this question raises the issue whether the actual costs taken for the purposes of the adjustment must be such costs as are reasonable and were prudently incurred.\n\n11.\n\nWe believe that in seeking to answer the above questions, we shall effectively have covered the listed preliminary issues, and we proceed to consider them in the above order.\n\n**(1) Was the PPA a valid and binding contract?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Did the PPA never become binding because of the failure of a condition precedent?\n\n(ii) Was the PPA void for uncertainty?\n\n12.\n\nIn relation to the first sub-issue, TANESCO\u2019s contentions can be summarised as follows:\n\n(1) It was made clear to IPTL that TANESCO required the approval of the Tanzanian Government before committing itself to the PPA;\n\n(2) The Government in turn made it clear to TANESCO that its approval was dependent upon an effective mechanism for adjusting the Reference Tariff in the PPA to take account of any changes in the assumptions upon which it had been based;\n\n(3) The Government\u2019s stance was communicated to IPTL;\n\n(4) The mechanism stated in Addendum No. 1 was not effective to achieve that purpose, and, accordingly, a condition precedent to the efficacy of the PPA was not satisfied.\n\n13.\n\nIn relation to the second sub-issue, TANESCO contends;\n\n(1) That Addendum No. 1, although expressed as an \"Addendum\", was an integral part of the PPA;\n\n(2) That its meaning and effect were so uncertain that it should be regarded as void for uncertainty on two grounds - first, because the assumptions underlying the Reference Tariff were not stated in the PPA, and it was therefore impossible to derive from the words used the parties\u2019 presumed intention as to the assumptions to which the Addendum was intended to refer; and second, because there was no machinery provided in Addendum No. 1 for adjusting the Reference Tariff to take account of any changes in the relevant assumptions;\n\n(3) That the mechanism for the adjustment of the Reference Tariff for which Addendum No. 1 purported to provide was such a fundamental part of the parties\u2019 bargain that it could not be severed, and, accordingly, the whole contract should be regarded as void and of no effect\n\n**(i) Condition precedent - Government approval**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIt was not suggested that there was anything in the terms of the PPA itself that expressly provided for Government approval as a condition precedent to the efficacy of the bargain, although such provisions are not uncommon where government agencies or government-owned commercial enterprises are involved. Nor does TANESCO argue for an implied term. In advancing its argument, and despite Article 19.5 of the PPA The \"Entire Agreement\" provision, TANESCO relies on correspondence during the period leading up to the signature of the PPA, some of which passed between government departments, some of which was communicated to TANESCO, and only a portion of which was passed on to otherwise involved IPTL.\n\n15.\n\nIn doing so, TANESCO relies specifically on Section 101 of the Tanzanian Evidence Act, 1967, which provides, in its material parts:\n\n\"When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved..., no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted, as between the parties to any such instrument or their representative in interest, for the purposes of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms:\n\nProvided that -...\n\n..... (c) the existence of any separate oral agreement, constituting a condition precedent to the attaching of any obligation under any such contract, grant or disposition of property, may be proved....\"\n\nIt is contended that the same principle must apply, *a fortiori,* where reliance is placed on other written communications.\n\nIt is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider in this context whether the question of the admissibility of the correspondence relied on should properly be regarded as a matter of substantive law (in which case Tanzanian law would apply), or procedural law (in which case the laws of England, as the seat of arbitration, would apply), since the Tribunal is satisfied that English law would also permit reference to such correspondence for this purpose. In any event, Article 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules would give the Tribunal full discretion in this regard.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, in the opinion of the Tribunal, there is nothing in the correspondence or in the record of meetings leading up to the signature of the PPA which, upon analysis, supports TANESCO\u2019s contention.\n\n17.\n\nFollowing meetings between representatives of IPTL and the Government of Tanzania that concluded on 15 December 1994, and a further meeting between Mr Rugemalira of IPTL and the Commissioner for Energy and Petroleum Affairs on 21 December 1994, at which it was confirmed that IPTL\u2019s proposal was \"technically acceptable\" to TANESCO, on 28 December 1994, Mr Mollel, the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals, wrote to IPTL stating:\n\n\"I am pleased to inform you that the Government has endorsed your proposal and has directed the facilitation of the implementation of the Project subject to the following:\n\n(a) IPTL will proceed immediately to conclude a [PPA] with [TANESCO] substantially upon the terms as outlined in your draft PPA but with amendments as agreed between IPTL and TANESCO.....\"\n\n18.\n\nOn 4 January 1995, the Managing Director of TANESCO wrote to IPTL asking for additional information and data, including project cost estimates and details of financing sources. He added:\n\n\"In summary we require information and data that enabled you calculate the capacity and energy charges you proposed in your document dated 21 November 1994...\".\n\n19.\n\nIPTL replied on 11 January 1995, responding to the queries raised and stating a project contract price of US $163,000,000 including US $14,000,000 for gas conversion equipment.\n\n20.\n\nDiscussions then took place on 16, 17, and 19 January 1995 between representatives of IPTL and TANESCO in the presence of representatives of the Government of Tanzania, in the course of which IPTL was again requested to provide clarification on what were described as \"two key items\", namely (a) the tariff and (b) a breakdown of capital costs. At the meeting, a number of amendments to the draft PPA were discussed and agreed. It was recorded that the signing of the PPA was still subject to the approval of TANESCO\u2019s Board of Directors, and further that TANESCO would promptly make its recommendations to the Government for \"final endorsement\".\n\n21.\n\nA Cabinet Meeting was held on 3 May 1995, at which it was agreed that the President should be advised that the Government in principle should approve the PPA; that the Cabinet\u2019s Economic and Finance Committee should meet immediately to review and discuss in detail technical issues regarding rates for Capacity Charge, Energy Charge, Capacity Utilisation and a stand-by letter of credit as approved at the experts\u2019 sessions; that TANESCO should be permitted to sign the PPA; and that the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals also should be permitted to sign an Implementation Agreement with IPTL immediately. It was recorded that the President concurred with the above and ordered its implementation.\n\n22.\n\nAccordingly, on 16 May 1995, the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals wrote to TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director, with a copy to the Secretary to the Cabinet, informing him of the approvals given at the Cabinet Meeting, and continuing:\n\n\"On that basis, TANESCO and our ministry have been permitted to sign with IPTL contracts on Power Purchase Agreement and Implementation Agreement. However, we have been asked not to state Capacity Charge rates until we have submitted...an explanation on the rates. This means, for the time being we will only agree on the formula and criteria that will eventually produce the rates.\"\n\nThe letter ended:\n\n\"Please take the necessary action to sign an agreement with IPTL as soon as possible with attention to the stated conditions...\"\n\n23.\n\nTwo days later, on 18 May 1995, the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals wrote to IPTL, informing it that Government approval had been granted for TANESCO to sign the PPA. His letter continued:\n\n\"The Government has however required us to review and elaborate on Capacity Charge, Energy Charge and Standby Letter of Credit with a view to bringing down the cost of the project. Your Cooperation in this respect will be highly appreciated...TANESCO and the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals stand ready to sign the above agreements accordingly....\"\n\n24.\n\nIPTL replied on the same day, noting the stated approval, and attaching notes clarifying and elaborating upon the Capacity and Energy Charges. Its letter continued:\n\n\"Regarding the suggestion that we sign the Agreements without indicating the Reference Tariff we have contacted our Financial Advisors on the matter and regret to report that this will not be acceptable as such document will remain unbankable.\"\n\n25.\n\nOn 25 May 1995, IPTL wrote to the Principal Secretary to the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals, with copies to the Chief Secretary, the Economic Advisor to the President and the Managing Director of TANESCO, recording an agreement with the Minister discussed that morning that, since the PPA did not specify a final tariff but was only quoting a reference tariff \"on the basis of the January 1995 assumptions\", the parties should go ahead and sign \"if the Chief Secretary will also confirm that this is not in conflict with the decision of the Cabinet..\n\nThe letter continued:\n\n\"We have since consulted the Chief Secretary and he is in agreement that signing the Agreements with a tentative reference tariff is within the spirit of the Cabinet\u2019s decision...We have agreed that if I let you have sight on the revised PPA to satisfy yourself that it only talks about a reference tariff you will instruct TANESCO to sign tomorrow..\n\n26.\n\nOn 30 May 1995, Mr Rugemalira of IPTL sent a Memorandum to his colleague, Mr Daya, stating:\n\n\"I refer to our telephone conversation when I informed you that Government wants us to give the assumptions on which we have based to arrive at the capacity charge...and the Energy charge.....\"\n\nOn the following day, 31 May 1995, Mr Rugemalira wrote to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals, with copies to the Chief Secretary, the Director General of the Investment Promotion Centre and the Managing Director of TANESCO, listing the assumptions used to determine the capacity charge \"contained in...the proposal submitted...in November 1994 which was the basis of negotiations and agreements reached in January, 1995...\"\n\nThe letter continued:\n\n\"[W]e have made a provision in the agreement with TANESCO that any changes in the stated assumptions will result in adjustments in the Reference Tariff proportionately...[W]e agreed with the Minister and the Principal Secretary...that in view of the clarifications we provided you would seek the approval of State House so that we sign the PPA immediately as directed by the Cabinet but mentioning the Reference Tariff...\n\n...We request you to authorise TANESCO to sign the PPA now...and any justifiable changes can be done by way of side memoranda or addendum to the Agreement...\".\n\n27.\n\nOn 5 June 1995, the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals wrote to the Secretary to the Cabinet, referring to his letter of 16 May 1995, and stating:\n\n\"...To avoid wasting any more time, we have reached an agreement with IPTL that the contract should be signed now stating \"Reference Tariff\u2019 of 10 US dollar cents per kWh with an understanding that this price may change depending on realistic changes which may occur in the utilized criteria...\n\n...Before authorising TANESCO to sign the contract with IPTL, stating Reference Tariff, I seek your approval...\"\n\n28.\n\nThe Secretary to the President replied the following day stating:\n\n\"...[T]he correct meaning of those directives is that your ministry and the Electricity Company should satisfy themselves with the terms of the contract prior to signing it. It is important that the contract should contain a clause, which will provide an opportunity for both sides to review the agreed tariff rates in accordance with any changes in the utilized criteria...\".\n\n29.\n\nOn 7 June 1995, the Principal Secretary of the Ministry wrote to TANESCO stating that TANESCO could now sign the contract with IPTL.\n\n30.\n\nIn fact, we understand that the PPA had already been signed on behalf of TANESCO on 26 May 1995, but was still retained by it until 9 June 1995, when it was handed over at the same time as Addendum No. 1 was signed.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the effect of the correspondence to which we have referred was to render Government approval a condition precedent to the efficacy of the PPA. Whilst we accept that the Government wanted the PPA to provide a mechanism for adjusting the Reference Tariff, primarily so that TANESCO could obtain the benefit of any \"savings\", and that IPTL was made aware of this, it was never provided, or indeed suggested to IPTL that it was necessary for there to be any formal Government approval communicated to it, nor that those negotiating and ultimately signing and returning the PPA on behalf of TANESCO lacked authority to do so. Indeed, lack of relevant authority was not pleaded or relied on per se. We further conclude that, although the Government expressed its desire to TANESCO in clear terms, in the end it left it to the relevant Ministry and in particular to TANESCO to satisfy itself that the terms of the PPA provided the mechanism for adjustment which the Government wanted. On this basis, the Minister of Water, Energy and Minerals authorised TANESCO to sign the PPA in the terms it did.\n\n**(ii) The alleged inefficacy of the adjustment mechanism provided in Addendum No. 1**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAppendix B to the PPA provides for the payment of a Reference Tariff, which is comprised of two elements, namely a \"Capacity Charge\", designed to compensate IPTL for establishing the facility to generate electricity at the contract rate, and an \"Energy Charge\", to compensate for the costs of providing electricity from the facility so established, as required by TANESCO. The former obviously would have included the costs of the design and construction of the facility as well as financing costs; the latter would include fuel costs and ongoing maintenance.\n\n33.\n\nIn the correspondence to which we have referred above, it was clear that the Tanzanian Government and TANESCO required some adjustment mechanism to take account of any changes in the assumptions upon which the Reference Tariff had been based. Although they had in mind receiving the benefit of any savings, they conceded that IPTL should be compensated for any increases.\n\n34.\n\nParagraph 1 of Addendum No. 1 provided as follows:\n\n\"Before commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff mentioned in Table I of Appendix B will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any and all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement..\n\n35.\n\nAs appears from the correspondence which we have set out in extenso above, the Tanzanian Government inquired as to the assumptions upon which the Capacity Charge and the Energy Charge had been based; this inquiry was passed on by Mr Rugemalira to Mr Daya; and on 31 May 1995, IPTL wrote to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals setting out in detail the assumptions used to determine the Capacity Charge.\n\n36.\n\nIt will be apparent that, although the request made by the Government and passed on related to all assumptions, the assumptions stated in the letter of 31 May 1995 only covered those underlying the \"Capacity Charge\", and not those on which the \"Energy Charge\" had been calculated.\n\n37.\n\nIt is common ground that the letter of 31 May 1995 was \"on the table\" in front of the parties\u2019 representatives when they negotiated and agreed the terms of Addendum No. 1.\n\n38.\n\nIt seems to us, and was, we think, common ground between the parties\u2019 legal representatives at the hearing, that Addendum No. 1 could be construed in a number of ways:\n\n(1) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to those set out in Appendix H to the PPA, which related only to tax and duty matters;\n\n(2) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to those set out in the letter of 31 May 1995 to which we have just referred;\n\n(3) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to all the assumptions which had been made by IPTL in arriving at the Reference Tariff, whether or not expressed in that letter;\n\n(4) That the meaning of Addendum No. 1 was so uncertain that it should be rejected as void and meaningless.\n\n39.\n\nOn behalf of TANESCO, it was submitted that the Tribunal should adopt construction (4), with a \"fallback\" of (3), while IPTL contended primarily for construction (2), with a \"fallback\" of (1).\n\n40.\n\nThe starting point must be the actual words used, which must be literally applied, unless their literal meaning is insensible or obviously does not reflect the mutual intention of the parties. In this context, the Tribunal was, not surprisingly, referred to that part of the speech of Lord Hoffman in *Investors Compensation Scheme Limited* v *West Bromwich Building Society etc [1998] 1 All ER 98,* at page 115, where he said:\n\n\"The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meaning of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax...\n\nThe \"rule\" that words should be given their \"natural and ordinary meaning\" reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they blatantly could not have had......Many people, including politicians, celebrities and Mrs Mallaprop, mangle meanings and syntax but nevertheless communicate tolerably clearly what they are using the words to mean...\"\n\n41.\n\nThe Tanzanian Evidence Act, 1967, to the extent to which it applies, provides in Section 104 as follows:\n\n\"When language used in a document is plain in itself, but is unmeaning in reference to existing facts, evidence may be given that it was used in a peculiar sense\".\n\n42.\n\nUpon a literal construction of the words, the only assumptions \"stated in the PPA\" were those in Appendix H, which referred to assumptions concerning taxes and duties of various kinds. But it was, as we understand it, common ground that it was not the intention of either party to limit Addendum No. 1 in this way; and for this reason, we should be inclined to reject this construction, unless we were driven to it as the only construction which would result in the survival of the contract.\n\n43.\n\nWe should also have been inclined to reject alternative construction (4), as an admission of defeat. It was again, we think, common ground that a tribunal should strive to give some meaning to every provision in a contract - especially one which has been specifically negotiated and agreed, as was Addendum No. 1. As is stated in the 28th edition of Chitty on Contracts, Volume I \"General Principles\", paragraph 2-133 at page 149:\n\n\"The court will make considerable efforts to give meaning to an apparently meaningless phrase...\".\n\n44.\n\nThis leaves the Tribunal with a choice between alternatives (2) and (3). In support of the latter, Mr Hawkins, for TANESCO, placed repeated emphasis on the reference to \"...any or all the underlying assumptions..but chose, as indeed he had to, to ignore the word \"...stated...\u2019\u2019.Not only did TANESCO\u2019s \"fallback\" construction involve, in effect, striking out part of the clause; in the view of the Tribunal it makes little commercial common sense. It would mean that the parties had agreed to adjust a Reference Tariff by reference to changes and assumptions which IPTL had never communicated to TANESCO. In fact, as has emerged in the evidence, there was a mathematical model constructed in 1995 on which it is said that the Reference Tariff was based; but TANESCO did not know that at the time, and in any event was unaware of its contents.\n\n45.\n\nAs has been seen from the exchanges of correspondence among the Tanzanian Government, TANESCO and IPTL during the period leading up to the signature of the PPA, the Government was anxious not only that TANESCO should benefit from any savings in the assumptions underlying the PPA, but also to be informed what those assumptions were. The only assumptions which were reported to TANESCO in response to the Government\u2019s enquiries were those set out in the letter of 31 May 1995.\n\n46.\n\nIt is true that the Government\u2019s enquiry related to all the assumptions underlying or utilised in the PPA, and in the enquiry referred to in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s Memorandum of 30 May 1995, which gave rise to the 31 May 1995 letter, had apparently specifically requested assumptions used as the basis for both the Capacity Charge and the Energy Charge. But it was only given the latter, and although this may at first sight appear odd, there may have been good reason for IPTL so limiting its response to the enquiry. As IPTL stated in its 31 May 1995 letter, the main factor which could alter the assumptions and thus the Tariff would be the project cost. Furthermore, under the terms of Addendum No. 1 as agreed, the Reference Tariff was not going to be subject to continual adjustment throughout the period of the PPA, but was to be the subject of a once and for all adjustment \"[b]efore commencement of commercial operations...\", depending on the effect of changes that \"will have taken place\". By that time, the project cost would have been known, together with all or most of the other costs and charges involved in the design and construction of the facility, as well as its financing, and putting it into operation. Whilst changes in design might have caused some re-assessment of the assumptions used for the purposes of arriving at the Energy Charge, such as maintenance costs and fuel consumption costs, the actual figures for those aspects of IPTL\u2019s expenditure to be recovered from the Energy Charge portion of the tariff would only change in the course of the performance of the PPA, which was to last for a minimum of 20 years.\n\n47.\n\nIn relation to alternative construction (2), as was again emphasised by Mr Hawkins, Addendum No. 1 refers to the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA, and not to those stated in the letter of 31 May 1995. However, it is common ground that the letter was before the draftsmen of Addendum No. 1, and, taking the totality of the evidence, including in particular the communications which led up to the drafting and signing of Addendum No. 1, which we have set out at some length above when considering the question of Government approval, the Tribunal concludes that the mutual intention of the parties was to refer to the assumptions set out in that letter. Although the representatives of both parties appear to have been extremely fluent in the English language, it may not have been their first language, and the explanation could well be that, rather than using the wrong words, they simply used the wrong syntax and intended to refer to \"...any or all of the stated assumptions underlying the PPA...\". But this involves a degree of speculation, which is not necessary to our decision.\n\n**(iii) The mechanism for adjustment**\n--------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThis problem falls into a somewhat different category. It is not so much a question of the parties purporting to make an agreement but failing to make it clear what their mutual intention was, as it is a question of the parties not having made any provision for the mechanism whereby the Reference Tariff was to be adjusted.\n\n49.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the clear and unanimous view that the PPA must be read as subject to an implied term that the adjustment made must be such as would be appropriate and reasonable to take account of the changes. Whilst we anticipate that there may be problems and indeed disagreements in applying the test of reasonableness, the fact that there is an arbitration clause in the PPA, under which we were appointed, means that any dispute as to precisely how the Reference Tariff should be adjusted may be determined by this Tribunal, and, indeed, there is a further period reserved later this year for any hearing which may be necessary for this purpose.\n\n**(iv) The consequences of the possible voidness of Addendum No. 1**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nSince the Tribunal has concluded that Addendum No. 1 is not void for uncertainty, the consequences of its alleged voidness on the PPA as a whole becomes a wholly academic question. However, as the matter was argued, we think we should make it clear that, even if we had reached the conclusion that paragraph 1 of Addendum No. 1 was void for uncertainty, we should not have gone on to hold that the whole PPA thereby foundered.\n\n51.\n\nAlthough we accept that Addendum No. 1 was an integral part of the PPA, especially in as much as it was signed at the same time as the signed PPA was handed over by TANESCO to IPTL, it nevertheless constituted a \"gloss\" on a contract already agreed in principle. Certainly, the PPA could stand without it. Had the point been taken at an early stage, before the parties and in particular IPTL had begun to implement the PPA, we should have been doubtful whether it was the mutual intention of the parties that the contract without Addendum No. 1 should be binding on them; but since, by the time the point was taken, IPTL had spent an enormous amount of time, effort and money in implementing the PPA over a period of some years, the suggestion that all of this had been done under a purported contract which was in reality void and of no effect is extremely unattractive.\n\n52.\n\nIt may seem illogical to adopt a different view of the consequences of the alleged voidness of Addendum No. 1, depending upon the extent to which the PPA had been purportedly performed, but the question must be: Must Addendum No. 1 be taken to have been of such importance to the PPA that the parties (applying an objective test) must be taken to have concluded that the contract could not stand and operate without it? Whatever the parties may have concluded had the question been posed in June 1995, after the PPA had been substantially performed by IPTL by designing, constructing and commissioning the power plant at a cost of over US $150,000,000, in our view the question only permits one answer: The PPA must stand unamended.\n\nThus, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal concludes that the PPA did not lack efficacy because of the non-satisfaction of a condition precedent, and it was not void for uncertainty; thus, the PPA constituted a valid and binding contract.\n\n**(2) Notice of Default**\n-------------------------\n\n**(i) Construction / Agreement**\n--------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nTANESCO asserts that it was and is entitled to terminate the PPA, having delivered to IPTL on 9 April 1998 a valid Notice of Default pursuant to Article XVI of the PPA. That Article provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n\"16.1. THE SELLER Events of Default - Termination by TANESCO.\n\nEach of the following events shall be an event of default by THE SELLER [IPTL] (each a \"SELLER Event of Default\"), which, if not cured within the time period permitted (if any), with the prior written consent of the GOT [Government of Tanzania], a copy of which consent shall be provided to THE SELLER with any notice provided under Article 16.3 shall give rise to the right on the part of TANESCO to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 16.3;...\n\n\u2026\n\n(c) the failure of THE SELLER to comply with any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such failure shall continue uncured for 90 Days after notice thereof by TANESCO, provided that if such failure cannot be cured within a period of 90 Days with the exercise of reasonable diligence, then such cure period shall be extended for an additional period of 90 Days so long as THE SELLER is exercising reasonable diligence to cure such failure;...\"\n\nThat Notice of Default (referred to in Article 16.3 of the PPA as a \"Notice of Intent to Terminate\") asserted specifically that IPTL was \"in default on its obligation to supply and install slow speed diesel generating sets in accordance with Section 1.1 of Appendix A to the PPA.\"\n\n54.\n\nIt is common ground that IPTL in fact installed ten *medium* speed diesel generators of 10 MW each and that the aforementioned Section 1.1 of Appendix A to the PPA specifies that \"[e]ach generating unit shall be *slow* speed diesel generating sets\" (of which five of 20 MW each were envisioned). [Emphasis added]. It likewise is agreed that IPTL has not cured the asserted default but that TANESCO at no time has proceeded to issue a Termination Notice.\n\n55.\n\nThe first issue thus raised is whether the installation of slow speed diesel generating sets as provided in Section 1.1 of Appendix A to the PPA constituted one of IPTL\u2019s \"material obligations\" under the PPA within the meaning of Article 16.1(c). A threshold question is raised by the parties as to whether what is \"material\" in this context is to be determined by reference to the terms of the PPA alone, or instead should (or may) be judged on the basis of judicial precedents or other substantive provisions of the applicable law (which is Tanzanian law). The Tribunal holds that Article 16 of the PPA constitutes an agreed termination scheme which must be judged on its own. The standards that otherwise exist under the applicable Tanzanian law governing a party\u2019s right to terminate a contract, absent such a special arrangement, are not pertinent to our task. It would be correct, however, as IPTL contends, for the Tribunal to consult such law for any guidance it might give as to the meaning of the word \"material\" were the Tribunal to be in doubt as to such meaning. The Tribunal is not, however, in doubt on this point.\n\n56.\n\nTANESCO directs our attention in particular to Sub-Section 1.5.13 of Appendix A and Articles 4.1(b), 7.1(f) and 9.1(a) of the PPA as supporting its assertion that the installation of slow speed diesels, as specified in Section 1.1 of Appendix A, is a material obligation. The lattermost provision (Article 9.1(a)) stipulates, in pertinent part, that IPTL shall...\"construct... the Facility... in accordance with this Agreement\"; and \"Facility\" is defined in Article 1.1 by reference to Recital 1, *i.e.,* \"described more specifically in Appendix A.\" Article 4.1(b) provides, as one of the \"Conditions Precedent to [TANESCO\u2019s] Purchase Obligations\", that:\n\n\"...Not less than 30 Days prior to the Commencement Date, THE SELLER shall submit to TANESCO the general layout drawings of the Facility, which submission shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that (i) the Facility, when constructed in accordance with such general layout drawings, will (A) conform with the Description of the Facility...\"\n\nIt is relevant that \"Description of the Facility\" is defined by Article 1.1 \"as described in Appendix A.\" Thus the critical references in those two Articles are to Appendix A as a whole, and hence are not limited to Section 1.1 thereof (which contains the PPA\u2019s sole reference to \"slow speed diesel generating sets\").\n\n57.\n\nSub-Section 1.5.13 of Appendix A, which falls, as does Section 1.1, under the heading \"FACILITY DESCRIPTION,\" provides as follows:\n\n\"All specifications referred to the above are indicative only and may be changed, modified and/or altered as THE SELLER deem fit to carry out the performance requirements. Such changes, modifications and/or alternations [sic] shall be mutually agreed with TANESCO.\"\n\nTANESCO argues that since this is a Sub-Section of Section 1.5, \"Specific List of Equipment,\" all other Sub-Sections of which (1.5.1-1.5.12) list individual plant components, its effect is limited to those other Sub-Sections and cannot apply to Section 1.1 (or, presumably, to any of the other Sections, namely 1.2-1.4, collected under the rubric of \"1.0 FACILITY DESCRIPTION\"). On this basis TANESCO argues that the specification of \"slow speed diesel generating sets\" in Section 1.1 of Appendix A was immutable, and therefore clearly material. In any event, TANESCO argues, it did not agree with the change to medium speed diesels as 1.5.13 would require. This point is treated separately below.\n\n58.\n\nAgainst this, IPTL advances a number of points which to the Tribunal are persuasive. First, it avers (something which TANESCO has not contradicted) that any change, as took place, from five 20 MW slow speed engines to ten 10 MW medium speed diesels necessarily entails a number of alterations in the \"Specific List of Equipment\" detailed in Sub-Sections 1.5.1-1.5.12. Since, it is suggested, the one cannot be altered without disturbing the other, the tolerance of change memorialized in Sub-Section 1.5.13 perforce extends to Section 1.1. TANESCO\u2019s letter of 21 January 1998 to IPTL enclosing a Table I detailing 30 variations from the original specifications of Sub-Sections 1.5.2-1.5.12 that accompanied the change appears to confirm this. Second, the statement in Sub-Section 1.5.13 that the specifications therein are \"indicative only\" and may be changed \"as THE SELLER [IPTL] deem fit to carry out the performance requirements\" leads to the conclusion that IPTL, in its sole discretion, may initiate and implement changes compatible with the contractually fixed performance goals, subject only to the need for informal agreement with TANESCO. A third point, which IPTL does not appear to have pursued so precisely, is that under Article 1.2(ix) of the PPA:\n\n\"unless otherwise provided herein, whenever a consent or approval is required by one Party from the other Party, such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\"\n\nIt would appear, in context, that it would have been unreasonable for TANESCO to have withheld its agreement to the change to medium speed engines so long as their use would not prejudice achievement of the agreed performance goals, threaten the integrity of the overall TANESCO grid, or otherwise impair any other contractual objective.\n\n59.\n\nThis brings us to Article 7.1 (f) of the PPA:\n\n\"Without the prior written consent of TANESCO (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), THE SELLER shall not make, or permit to be made, any material modification to the design or construction of the Facility if such modification could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on TANESCO\u2019s rights under this Agreement or the TANESCO System.\"\n\nIPTL reads this as expressly empowering it unilaterally to have substituted medium speed diesels for slow speed ones, so long as such change \"could [not] reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on TANESCO\u2019s rights\" under the PPA or on its grid. IPTL argues, in effect, that no particular plant specification could be material in and of itself, since IPTL\u2019s right to make modifications is limited only by the requirement that it eschew any unconsented \"material adverse effect\" that \"could reasonably be expected.\" TANESCO\u2019s rejoinder that Section 7.1(f) simply imposes a limitation and has no authorizing force is unpersuasive. IPTL might have added that Section 7.1(f) scotches any notion that even such a major change as occurred could *per se* have material character when it indicates that it could be unreasonable for TANESCO to withhold its consent to a modification notwithstanding its reasonable expectation of a material adverse effect - a curious notion, indeed, as the Tribunal sees it.\n\n60.\n\nIt thus appears to the Tribunal, based on the PPA\u2019s terms alone, that the use of slow speed diesels was not a material obligation of the PPA. While neither the parties\u2019 dealings leading to conclusion of the PPA nor their conduct thereafter has played any role in the Tribunal\u2019s reaching this conclusion, it may be noted that both, which are discussed in another context below, also support the view that neither party ever regarded the installation of slow speed diesel generating sets as a material obligation of the PPA.\n\n61.\n\nA further question arises, however, as to whether IPTL\u2019s obligation under Article 7.1(f) not to act in a certain way is itself a material one within the meaning of Article 16, thus permitting TANESCO to terminate the PPA upon any breach thereof by IPTL. (It should be noted that TANESCO did not advance this argument, relying instead basically on its contention that Section 1.1 of Appendix A constituted a material obligation to install low speed diesel generating sets, and citing Article 7.1(f) in support). In this connection, one must first consider whether IPTL\u2019s change from slow to medium speed diesel engines without TANESCO\u2019s prior written consent was a \"material modification\" that \"could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on TANESCO\u2019s rights\" under the PPA within the meaning of Article 7.1(f), which, if accomplished without TANESCO\u2019s prior written consent, would constitute a breach of Article 7.1(f). As to this latter issue, while the Tribunal has found that the installation of slow speed diesels was not a material obligation of the PPA, doubtless the change to medium speed machines did effect a \"material modification to the design or structure of the Facility\" within the meaning of Article 7.1(f). The dispute as regards the possibility of a breach of Article 7.1(f), therefore, is solely over the character and likelihood of any resulting effect.\n\n62.\n\nAs regards a possible breach, the Tribunal notes that what \"could reasonably be expected\" necessarily is to be judged as of the time the challenged modification was made. Hindsight has no place here. TANESCO claims that its rights under the PPA could reasonably have been expected to suffer a material adverse effect in two respects. The first is financial: Various higher costs reasonably could have been anticipated, which then would have increased the tariff chargeable to TANESCO under the PPA in a degree constituting material adversity. This contention appears to the Tribunal, however, to be debatable to an extent which precludes a determination that a material adverse effect \"could reasonably be expected.\" The available evidence suggests, if anything, that the overall capital acquisition costs associated with medium speed generators are generally less than those connected with low speed diesels. While TANESCO presents evidence that the resulting operating and maintenance costs might be higher, IPTL, while not conceding the point, accepts that on a proper interpretation of the PPA any such increases are for its account and hence will not increase the tariff charged to TANESCO. This being the case, TANESCO could not reasonably have been expected to suffer any adverse effect on the tariff it must pay, let alone a material one.\n\n63.\n\nFollowing the hearing held on these preliminary issues, and in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, TANESCO submitted further documents, lately produced to it by IPTL, as well as additional testimony, in support of a supplemental written submission dated 10 April 2000, making further arguments directed to its contention that \"a material adverse effect\" on its rights under the PPA \"could reasonably be expected\" from the use of medium speed engines.\n\n64.\n\nCiting, in particular, a \"Preliminary Tender Adjudication Report\" and a \"Tender Adjudication Report (Update)\" prepared in September and December of 1995, respectively, by the concern that became the Independent Engineer under the EPC Contract, which evaluated the competing bids for that contract, TANESCO argued that the cost of converting Wartsila medium speed engines to gas was higher than for Hyundai\u2019s slow speed engines; that Wartsila\u2019s final bid for engines (including such conversion) was higher than the competition; that the Hyundai slow speed diesels were technically preferable, in that they were more reliable, less expensive to operate and maintain, and had been proven to be convertible to gas; that Wartsila, in direct communication and contact with Mechmar, quoted for certain portions of the EPC Contract prices \"far below\" those proposed in the formal tendering process; and that Wartsila\u2019s final EPC Contract price was $9.1 million higher than Hyundai\u2019s, potentially resulting in a higher tariff.\n\n65.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the lately-produced documents on which TANESCO relies, when read as a whole, present a somewhat different picture than emerges from TANESCO\u2019s discussion of them.\n\n66.\n\nThe \"Preliminary Tender Adjudication Report\" of September 1995, for example, makes clear that it \"covers the preliminary evaluation of the three submitted Tenders\" and that its \"purpose is to short-list the tenderers for negotiation/final clarification.\" In its conclusion, that report ranks Hyundai first and Wartsila second, immediately following which it notes that the tender process \"did not resolve all the technical and commercial issues\" and \"[c]onsequently there are a number of outstanding items having financial impact... which still require clarification or confirmation before entering into a contract.\" Finally, \"[a]s a result of the preliminary evaluation [both Hyundai and Wartsila] are short-listed\" (MAN B&W having been eliminated). The report concludes:\n\n\"It is recommended that further negotiations be carried out with these two tenderers before the award is made.\"\n\n67.\n\nThe second such report, the \"Tender Adjudication Report (Update)\" of December 1995, provided \"the detailed commercial and technical evaluation of the two short-listed Tenders.\" It ranked Wartsila engines first as to price, \"[b]ased on the initial capital cost\", but opined that Hyundai had \"given the most attractive techno-commercial offer, notwithstanding that the [Wartsila] offer has a higher [internal rate of return],\" which \"is mainly due to the lower initial capital cost of [Wartsila], for both the [fuel oil] and Natural Gas operating regimes.\" After detailing certain advantages of slow speed engines, the report stated:\n\n\"This is the case of purchasing a cheaper plant against a technically better plant that is likely to perform reliably in the long run.\"\n\nThe report concluded by recommending \"that both of the Tenderers...be requested to have a face to face, across table meeting\" to discuss five described issues, \"after which a Final Tender Evaluation Report may be drafted, which will contain a recommendation for the Award of Contract to the most attractive offer.\"\n\n68.\n\nThe anticipated final \"Tender Adjudication Report\" then was issued in January of 1996. It covered \"the technical aspect of the two\" proposals but did \"not include the economic/financial aspects which Mechmar Corporation has instructed that they are conducted by Fieldstone Private Capital Group.\" Thus the report noted that it \"cannot make a complete recommendation for Contract Award\" since it \"is the responsibility of Mechmar Corporation to combine technical and financial reports before deciding on the Award.\" The report gives Wartsila and Hyundai exactly equal total points in its \"Tender Evaluation Table,\" which, like the earlier reports, includes evaluation of commercial terms as well as technical issues. The report\u2019s \"Conclusion\" bears repeating:\n\n\"The two (2) short-listed Tenderers have been fully evaluated on project programme, experience, commercial terms and technical aspects of their offers.\n\nThe replies received from each of the two Tenderers, after the Tender Clarification meetings, *resolved all major technical issues.* Commercial issues were to be resolved by negotiations...\n\n*From the technical evaluation, both of the offers are equivalent.* The Project Financial is being carried out by the Financial Adviser. Based on the Project Financial and this technical evaluation, a final decision may be made.\"\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\nAs appears from the Tribunal\u2019s decision communicated in its letter of 5 May 2000, the Tribunal has concluded that the recently produced documents do not justify the scheduling of a further hearing on the issues addressed in this Interim Award, or an order for depositions.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal already has indicated the reasons for its conclusion that the provision of the PPA which referred to slow speed diesel engines was not a \"material obligation\" of the PPA, and that the installation of medium speed engines as opposed to slow speed engines could not \"reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on TANESCO\u2019s rights\" under the PPA. Nothing that TANESCO most recently has put forward affects the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on theses two crucial issues. IPTL\u2019s reasons (or motives) for installing medium speed engines are irrelevant; what is pertinent is whether IPTL has complied with the terms of the PPA. To the extent that the evidence on which TANESCO concentrates is argued to support a conclusion that the eventual EPC Contract price was, as TANESCO alleges, \"inflated\" due to an \"unholy alliance,\" this is to be dealt with, as the Tribunal has indicated above (and will detail below), in connection with determining the tariff TANESCO is to pay.\n\n70.\n\nThe second of its \"rights under\" the PPA on which TANESCO claims that IPTL\u2019s substitution of medium speed machines reasonably portended a material adverse effect is its right under Article 2.2 to negotiate \"a further term of 5 years\" following the initial 20 year term of the PPA:\n\n\"The initial term of this Agreement or subsequent extension periods may be extended for a further term of 5 years if either TANESCO or THE SELLER requests an extension of this Agreement. The parties shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations to reach an agreement on the extension of this Agreement, on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to both parties, provided always that the agreement on such extension is reached at least 1 year prior to the end of the initial term or subsequent extension periods, as the case may be. If the Parties cannot agree to the terms and conditions for the extension of this Agreement, THE SELLER will be permitted to contract with any other party for the sale of dependable capacity and electrical energy from the Facility and TANESCO shall deliver to the SELLER any necessary' Consents for such sale, provided, however, that TANESCO shall have no obligation to assist in such sale unless otherwise required by law.\"\n\nTANESCO adduces evidence (which IPTL counters) indicating that medium speed diesels may last only 15-20 years whereas the usual life of slow speed engines is 25 years. It contends that the restricted life span of medium speed diesels prejudices its prospects of a five-year extension.\n\n71.\n\nQuite apart from the fact, however, as IPTL points out, that Article 2.2 only imposes an obligation to negotiate in good faith, which might or might not actually result in a contract extension, TANESCO\u2019s arguments overlook the fact that Article 2.2 expressly contemplates the possibility of multiple \"subsequent extension periods\" - not just one - which could take the PPA well beyond the life expectancy of even the hardiest slow speed diesel. Consistent with this fact, the PPA elsewhere expressly undercuts any notion that IPTL is obligated to furnish turbines with a life span greater than 20 years. Article 4.1(b), under the heading \"Conditions Precedent to [TANESCO\u2019s] Purchase Obligations,\" on which TANESCO strongly relies elsewhere, requires delivery prior to construction of \"a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that... (iii) the Facility has a useful life no shorter than the initial Term [under Article 2.1],\" *i.e.,* 20 years. Therefore, on this point as well, the Tribunal finds that TANESCO\u2019s claim of an expectable material adverse effect is not supported. Accordingly, IPTL did not act in contravention of Article 7.1(f) of the PPA, and hence the Tribunal need not decide whether the same constituted a material obligation within the meaning of Article 16.\n\n72.\n\nIn summary, then, the Tribunal rules that IPTL has not failed to comply with any of its material obligations under the PPA and hence that TANESCO has no right to terminate the PPA as provided by its Article XVI.\n\n73.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is persuaded that through its own acts and omissions related to the change to medium speed engines TANESCO agreed to such change and thereby deprived itself of any right it might otherwise have had to take issue with such change (other, of course, than to question the tariff it is to pay, as is discussed below). TANESCO cannot complain now of that to which it has failed to object in the particular circumstances set forth below and to which it consequently has agreed.\n\n74.\n\nThe first written proposal IPTL submitted to TANESCO, under date of 21 November 1994, presented both slow and medium speed diesels:\n\n\"The types of engines considered in this project are the medium speed and low speed engines.\"\n\nThe draft PPA submitted therewith likewise specified in its Appendix A at Section 1.1 \"either medium or low speed diesel generating sets.\" These references doubtless reflected the fact that IPTL had solicited and received preliminary bids for both types of engines (two for medium speed engines, from Stork-Wartsila, the eventually successful bidder, and MAN B & W, and one for low speed ones, from Hyundai).\n\n75.\n\nMeetings between representatives of TANESCO and IPTL leading up to execution of the PPA were held 28 November, 13, 14, and 15 December 1994 and 16, 17, and 19 January 1995. No evidence indicates that at any of those meetings there was any discussion of the speed of generating sets to be specified in the PPA. What is represented as a first draft of the PPA, however, date-stamped \"25 JAN 1995\", refers in Appendix A at Section 1.1 to \"either medium or low speed diesel generating sets.\" It is agreed that shortly thereafter, on 27 and 29 January 1995, a representative of Stork-Wartsila, which in its preliminary bid had offered only medium speed engines, met in Tanzania with TANESCO\u2019s Director of System Control and Transmission, Mr. Saleh, who \"recall[s] general discussions along [the] lines [of] the advantage of using 10 MWs units in the proposed power plant.\" As detailed above, a number of meetings took place in late May and early June of 1995 resulting in the conclusion and signature of the PPA and its Addendum No. 1. No evidence indicates any discussion whatsoever during those meetings focusing on the speed of generating sets to be installed.\n\n76.\n\nMore than a year following conclusion of the PPA, but well before execution by IPTL of a contract for construction of the Facility, TANESCO again was introduced to Stork-Wartsila, which it is agreed was already well known at TANESCO in that TANESCO already had in its plants 50 or so Wartsila engines. Various personnel of the two met on 23 July 1996, apparently because Stork-Wartsila had been selected by IPTL to construct the projected new power plant. IPTL and Stork-Wartsila signed their contract for such construction on 4 February 1997. It provided for the installation of 10 medium speed diesel engines of 10 MW each.\n\n77.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with the \"Condition Precedent\" contained in Article 4.1(b) of the PPA, IPTL under date of 15 April 1997 transmitted to TANESCO (which contends that the same occurred only on 6 May 1997) general layout drawings of the project together with a statement from the project\u2019s \"Independent Engineer.\" As the parties agree, the layout drawings clearly show ten engine installations and under \"Remarks\" on each sheet note \"10 x 18 W 38,\" which it is agreed denotes a specific Wartsila medium speed generator type. The drawings concededly were reviewed by TANESCO\u2019s then Director of Diesel Plants at the direction of TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director, transmitted through TANESCO\u2019s Deputy Managing Director for Technical Services. Although the Director of Diesel Plants then commented on them in writing, he has indicated in these proceedings that at the time he \"was unfamiliar with the terms of the PPA,\" and was \"therefore unaware of the specifications for the power plant IPTL was to build;\" that the drawings\u2019 reference under \"Remarks\" to \"10 x 18W 38\" \"did not come to my attention\" at the time; and that in any event it \"would not have been of any significance to me had I seen it as I did not know what it meant.\"\n\n78.\n\nIt is not disputed that the certificate of the Independent Engineer complied with the requirements of Article 4.1(b) in all respects, save one: TANESCO asserts that the certificate\u2019s recitation that the plant, \"when constructed in accordance with the general layout drawings and the technical specification,\" *\"[m]eets generally* with the Description of the Facility\" was false, was intentionally misleading, was calculated to conceal the fact that medium speed diesels were to be installed, and, indeed, by failing to fulfill the stated condition precedent leaves TANESCO free of any obligation to pay IPTL for electrical energy or capacity. (Emphasis added.) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions above regarding material obligations, however, dispose of any notion that the substance of the certificate was not appropriate. Moreover, the Tribunal discerns no serious difference between \"meets generally\" and the requirement of Article 4.1(b) for a certification that the plant \"wz'/Z... *conform* with the Description of the Facility.\" (Emphasis added.) On the face of it, Article 4.1(b) was substantially satisfied. What is pertinent for present purposes is the fact that, with full opportunity to review the general layout drawings, the Managing Director of TANESCO responded to them and the certificate by simply replying two days after TANESCO states that it received them, *i.e.,* on 9 May 1997 stating \"We have noted Independent Engineer\u2019s certification of the facility conforming to the requirements of the PPA\u2019s Article IV Clause 4.1(b).\" In doing so the Managing Director declined to sign a \"suggested form of reply\" also enclosed by IPTL with its letter dated 15 April 1997, which would have recorded express \"agreement\" by TANESCO that such requirements had been met.\n\n79.\n\nSomewhat over a month later, on 12 or 13 June 1997, IPTL, TANESCO and Stork-Wartsila personnel met in Tanzania. While there is dispute as to whether anything was said regarding the speed of diesels to be installed, it is noteworthy that TANESCO emphasizes that the meeting focused on issues relating to the interconnection of the new plant to be constructed by Stork-Wartsila with TANESCO\u2019s existing power grid. This view of the meeting tends to be confirmed by the text of a contemporaneous (17 June 1997) memorandum of TANESCO\u2019s Manager Electrical Plant and Maintenance directed to its Director System Control and Transmission, and by two subsequent letters, one to IPTL from the latter dated 19 June 1997 that refers to the meeting and is headed \"CONNECTION OF IPTL SYSTEM TO TANESCO GRID AT KUNDUCHI,\" and the other dated 22 August 1997 and addressed to that same Director on behalf of Stork-Wartsila that refers to the meeting and bears the subject heading \"Connection of IPTL 100 MW diesel power station to Tanesco grid at Kunduchi sub-station.\" These documents tend to support IPTL\u2019s contention that TANESCO was not actually concerned with how the plant would generate the specified amount of power; rather it was concerned to achieve a compatible connection with its grid. As IPTL notes, too, the first of those communications, which is an internal TANESCO memorandum, refers to \"all ten proposed D/G [presumably diesel generator] sets.\"\n\n80.\n\nIt is agreed that site work for the plant began in August 1997. Concurrently, as of 28 August 1997, IPTL reported to the Principal Secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals (but apparently not to TANESCO itself) that \"[m]anufacture and works testing of all 10 engines has been completed.\"\n\n81.\n\nOn 4 September 1997 TANESCO, IPTL and Stork-Wartsila met to \"clarify technical details\". The Managing Director of TANESCO has confirmed that \"[i]n mid-September 1997, I was aware that construction activities were underway\" on the project. On 18 September 1997 he wrote to IPTL inviting it to meet \"in order to review the underlying assumptions in the PPA and [its] Addendum No. 1... and to review the reference tariff in the PPA in light of... recent developments,\" *i.e.,* financial closing and the award of construction and supply contracts. The Managing Director\u2019s letter requested \"in advance all the necessary information and documentation\" relevant to such tariff review. IPTL replied very preliminarily by letter of 14 November 1997.\n\n82.\n\nCuriously, perhaps, on 12 November 1997 the firm of London Economics, appointed (apparently by the Government of Tanzania or TANESCO) \"to provide an independent review of the project,\" wrote to TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director inquiring \"whether [\u2018the proposed diesel plant\u2019] is a slow or medium speed diesel, and whether the station will be a ten by 10 MW station or a five by 20 MW station.\" Presumably prompted by this query, two days later, on 14 November 1997, TANESCO, by a letter signed \"for: MANAGING DIRECTOR\", inquired specifically of IPTL *\"whether the units will be slow or medium speed,* the number of units to be installed and their sizes, a precise date for commissioning the plant etc.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n83.\n\nIPTL replied to this query by letter of 26 November 1997, which enclosed \"[t]echnical details of the diesel Generation Plant of which there are 10 units each generating a nominal 10 MW.\" Those \"technical details\" in turn stated explicitly that \"[t]he engines shall be of four stroke, *medium speed.\"* (Emphasis added.) TANESCO takes the position that only with this notification did it become aware that Stork-Wartsila intended to install medium speed engines, rather than slow speed ones as specified in Section 1.1 to Appendix A to the PPA. Although there is almost no evidence on the subject, it does not appear to be disputed that as of this date the ten engines had not yet been shipped from their place of manufacture in The Netherlands. Rather, it is asserted by IPTL, and not challenged by TANESCO, that they began to be transported from The Netherlands to Tanzania sometime in December 1997 and that transportation from their point of arrival in Tanzania to the site started sometime in January 1998. However, no doubt IPTL was already under a contractual obligation to Stork-Wartsila in respect of them.\n\n84.\n\nWhen, so far the record before us shows, TANESCO next communicated with IPTL, on 10 December 1997, it was not to respond to the disclosure in the latter\u2019s 26 November 1997 letter that it would install medium speed diesels. Instead, it responded specifically to IPTL\u2019s earlier letter, of 14 November 1997, which very preliminarily had addressed tariff issues as requested by TANESCO in its letter of 18 September 1997. This latest letter requested further specific supporting documentation.\n\n85.\n\nWhen IPTL responded to this 10 December 1997 letter on 13 January 1998, it included among the various documentation it enclosed a \"technical description of the facility\" which was, in effect, a reconstituted Appendix A to the PPA which in Section 1.1 specified \"ten (10) generating sets\" of which \"[e]ach generating unit shall be medium speed diesel generating sets.\"\n\n86.\n\nEight days later (by letter of 21 January 1998) TANESCO responded by noting:\n\n(1) \"There have been significant changes to the type, rating and quantities of equipment to be installed,\" which changes (as noted earlier) were described extensively in a Table I enclosed therewith (which expressly noted the change to medium speed diesels).\n\n(2) \"[C]ontrary to the provisions of... Item 1.5.13 of Appendix A to the PPA, TANESCO\u2019s consent for these changes has not been sought.\"\n\n(3) \"[I]t appears to us that these changes are not reflected in the tariff calculations. Our view is that there should be significant cost reductions resulting from these changes which should be reflected in the corresponding reduction in the tariff rates...\"\n\nNo indication was given that TANESCO believed that a material obligation of the PPA had been breached, or that the medium speed diesels were not acceptable. The focus of the letter was entirely on the effect the changes should have on the tariff. Indeed, the letter reiterated TANESCO\u2019s earlier demands for \"missing information and documents\" - according to TANESCO in these proceedings, principally the EPC Contract - because \"we have to meet to review the tariff on the basis of the signed agreements and contracts.\" Incidentally, the reference in numbered point (2) set out above, to Item 1.5.13 of Appendix A to the PPA, suggests that, contrary to its submission before the Tribunal, TANESCO did regard that provision as applicable to a change in speed of the diesel engines (as the Tribunal has determined above).\n\n87.\n\nThe fact that TANESCO\u2019s concerns about the use of medium speed diesels were solely tariff-related was confirmed five days later, on 26 January 1998, when the Managing Director of TANESCO wrote to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, referring to TANESCO\u2019s 21 January 1998 letter to IPTL as \"registering our concern that consent for this change was not sought nor have we seen any reduction in the energy charges that IPTL will invoice TANESCO.\" TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director also pointedly invited the Ministry to \"take up with IPTL any unfulfilled obligations under the Implementation Agreement [between IPTL and the Government of Tanzania] and the Generation License [issued by the Minister of Energy and Minerals]\". \"In this way we will be tackling the problems that have come to light recently in their totality.\" The objective of this intended coordinated pressure was clearly stated by TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director: \"Our intention is to renegotiate the tariff after we have reviewed [the] documents\" awaited from IPTL, specifically the EPC Contract and certain financing documents. Again, no objection was registered as to the actual use of medium speed diesel generating sets.\n\n88.\n\nParticularly telling is the Principal Secretary\u2019s 9 February 1998 response specifically to this letter. In it \"[t]he Ministry wishes to be advised *whether the change of type of engines from slow speed to medium speed* plus other changes in project scope... as per your table I attached to your [21 January 1998 letter to IPTL] *does not constitute a default* as per the prevailing PPA signed between you and them.\" (Emphasis added). The Principal Secretary then ventures an answer to his own question:\n\n\"Earlier IPTL had written to you to assure you that their Engineer had substantiated that the machines are according to specifications as per the PPA and you had made some replies. Don\u2019t those replies constitute authority to change the scope as allowed by the PPA and thus meaning that they have not breached the contract?\"\n\nThe Principal Secretary clearly was referring to the correspondence exchanged between IPTL and TANESCO 15 April and 9 May 1997 as discussed above in which TANESCO had \"noted\" IPTL\u2019s submission of general layout drawings and a certificate of the Independent Engineer in pursuance of Article 4.1(b) of the PPA. He went on to express the same objective as TANESCO had posited: \"Those, and any other general advice on the subject which will assist in putting pressure on IPTL to draw them to renegotiate the [Implementation Agreement] and the PPA will be appreciated.\"\n\n89.\n\nIt is against this background that one must judge the fact that during a further two months, until 9 April 1998, when TANESCO issued its Notice of Default, TANESCO continued to undertake no action whatsoever to call into question the technical appropriateness of the installation of medium speed diesel engines.\n\n90.\n\nRoughly contemporaneously with the exchange just described between TANESCO and the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, IPTL responded to TANESCO\u2019s 21 January 1998 communication, by letter of 5 February 1998 comprising five pages, the first three of which largely set forth the pertinent economic, technical and practical reasons why IPTL had chosen to proceed with medium speed rather than slow speed diesels in order to meet its contractual obligations to TANESCO. In its \"Conclusion\" to this letter IPTL noted that it \"had read Clause 7.1(f) of the PPA and in good faith that states only material changes would require the consent of TANESCO.\" It went on to express the view that its scope of responsibilities as an IPP had not changed. Just over three weeks later, by letter of 27 February 1998, IPTL delivered to TANESCO copies of the EPC Contract and certain financing documents \"in the spirit of cooperation\" and under an injunction that their confidential character be respected.\n\n91.\n\nThe reaction of TANESCO to the disclosure of these documents was to request IPTL by letter of 11 March 1998 to provide \"at your earliest convenience\" a series of other agreements \"which we need in order to verify the project costs and financing terms and conditions.\" The letter concluded with an invitation \"for discussions on the PPA...in Dar es Salaam beginning on Thursday 26 March 1998.\" Here, too, no substantive objection was raised to the installation of medium speed diesels.\n\n92.\n\nUnder cover of a letter of 23 March 1998 IPTL delivered what appear to be the requested documents, and proposed instead of 26 March 1998 \"that we meet in Dar es Salaam for the clarification meeting on the reference tariff under the PPA on the 8th and 9th of April 1998.\" It appears to be agreed that that meeting then in fact was set for 14 April 1998. Prior to that meeting, by letter of 6 April 1998, IPTL informed TANESCO that \"load testing of the first three Diesel Generator Units [of ten in total] is scheduled to start on May 15th 1998 and that the Initial Operations Date (IOD) will be June 1st 1998.\" Then, just prior to the 14 April 1998 meeting scheduled to discuss the reference tariff under the PPA, TANESCO, by letter of 9 April 1998, delivered its Notice of Default.\n\n93.\n\nIt appears that when the parties met on 14 April 1998 IPTL \"refused to negotiate or discuss the final tariff \u2018unless and until\u2019 TANESCO withdrew the Notice of Default,\" as TANESCO recorded in a letter to IPTL the very next day, 15 April 1998. TANESCO\u2019s focus on tariff reduction is reflected again in its statement in that letter that \"consensual resolution of the matter raised by the Notice of Default may be possible in the context of final tariff negotiations and...the parties should certainly explore such means of resolving the matter.\" Again, on 22 April 1998, in a letter \"urg[ing] IPTL to return to the negotiation table,\" TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director reiterated:\n\n\"that *the issues relating to substitution of the diesel engines* raised in the Notice of Default *are essentially economic issues* and that final tariff negotiations and discussions of the Notice of Default should move forward on a parallel basis, thereby maximizing chances of resolving all issues in the most expeditious, cost-effective manner.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe record before us indicates that the parties indeed did meet again on 14 and 15 May 1998 to discuss both issues. On 15 May 1998 TANESCO submitted to IPTL an extensive request for documents \"in connection with the parties\u2019 negotiations of a final tariff\u2019 which related \"primarily to IPTL\u2019s project costs.\" This request later was followed by others. Thereafter matters ultimately led to this arbitration.\n\n94.\n\nFrom the foregoing recitation of facts, spanning the period 21 November 1994 to 15 May 1998, the Tribunal concludes that TANESCO did not really care, one way or the other, whether slow or medium speed diesels were installed (which, as previously noted, tends to confirm the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion, set forth earlier, that use of the former was not a material obligation of IPTL under the PPA); therefore, as TANESCO came to know that medium speed diesels were contemplated, which the Tribunal concludes occurred not later than 26 November 1997, it effectively consented to their installation. This is evident from the fact that engine type seems never to have been discussed during the negotiations leading to the PPA; from the seemingly indifferent manner (so far as engine type was concerned) with which senior TANESCO personnel reviewed the general layout drawings in May (or April) of 1997; and from TANESCO\u2019s concentration at critical times on the project\u2019s interconnection with its overall power grid. Most striking, however, is the fact that when TANESCO was incontrovertibly confronted with the reality of having medium speed engines, it never once objected to them or even hinted at the possible presence of a ground for declaring a default and invoking its right to terminate the PPA under Article XVI. To the contrary, while bemoaning the fact that its consent had not been asked, it unwaveringly focused solely on bringing about a tariff reduction. Even when its \"owner,\" the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, expressly speculated on the possibility that the installation of medium speed engines constituted a breach (and then surmised that it did not), a full two months before TANESCO issued its Notice of Default on 9 April 1998, TANESCO did not react. It can only be concluded that TANESCO, having heard IPTL\u2019s explanations for its choice of medium speed diesels and having considered the various expert reports it had received from Acres International (which had rendered a report to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals in September 1996, which TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director states did not come to TANESCO\u2019s attention until \"late September of 1997,\" that discoursed extensively on the comparative merits of the two types of diesels for this project) and London Economics, decided to accept the change but to pursue its tariff implications.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that prior to 9 April 1998 the change to medium speed diesels had been \"mutually agreed with TANESCO\" within the meaning of Sub-Section 1.5.13 of Appendix A to the PPA. It will have been noted that Sub-Section 1.5.13 does not require that such agreement be in writing. Since the PPA elsewhere, e.g., in Article 7.1(f), does contain express requirement for \"written consent,\" the omission of such stipulation in Sub-Section 1.5.13 must be understood to dispense with any need for a writing. This result is not affected by Article 19.8, which requires:\n\n\"This Agreement may be modified or amended, and any provision hereof may be waived, by an instrument in writing and sighed by both Parties.\"\n\nAgreement within the meaning of Sub-Section 1.5.13 of Appendix A constitutes fulfillment of a requirement of the PPA and not a modification, amendment or waiver of any provision thereof.\n\n96.\n\nThis disposes finally of any claim that IPTL breached the PPA in any respect, material or otherwise, in installing medium speed diesels.\n\n**(ii) Waiver / Estoppel**\n--------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions set out above, it is strictly speaking unnecessary to deal with the alternative submission advanced on behalf of IPTL that, by operation of one, or other, of the doctrines of estoppel, waiver or election, TANESCO is precluded from contending that IPTL was in material breach of the PPA by installing ten medium speed diesel engines instead of five slow speed diesel engines, by failing to obtain TANESCO\u2019s agreement to the change in the indicative specifications in Appendix A, and / or by failing to obtain TANESCO\u2019s prior written consent as required by Article 7.1(f) of the PPA to the change, by reason of its standing by and / or inducing IPTL to proceed with the project after learning of the proposed change.\n\n98.\n\nThere was an interesting debate as to whether the doctrines, or any of them, were matters of procedure, and, thus, governed by English law, or whether they were matters of substance, and therefore governed by the law of Tanzania. There is no clear guidance to be derived either from authority or from academic writing. However, the Tribunal is content to proceed on the view which appears to be most favourable to TANESCO, namely, that each of the doctrines is a matter of substantive law, and therefore governed by the law of Tanzania. For what it is worth, and without deciding the point, the Tribunal considers that this is more likely to be the correct view, because application of, for example, the principles of promissory estoppel may create substantive rights.\n\n99.\n\nAscertainment of the current law of Tanzania on estoppel, waiver and election is rendered uncertain by two factors. First, by the Judicature on Application of Laws Ordinance of 1920, Tanzania adopted the law of England as it stood at that date. The law so adopted has, of course, been modified from time to time by subsequent Tanzanian legislation but, with one exception, that is of no relevance to the problem under consideration. Unfortunately, there appears to be a difference of opinion between two of the advocates representing TANESCO as to whether the law of Tanzania is to be taken to have developed along the same lines as English law since 1920, or to be \"frozen\" as at that date. Mr Morrison expressed the view that if, by reason of subsequent English decisions there have been any developments in any concepts of English law which were part of that law in 1920, then such decisions will be regarded as persuasive authority before a Tanzanian court. Further, as we understand it, the development of any such doctrine by any superior court of standing in other common law jurisdictions would be of similar persuasive authority. Mr Mkono adopted a different view. He submitted that it was irrelevant how English common law developed after 1920: unless there were a lacuna in the law of Tanzania in the particular field, developments in England were of no authority whatever. Mr Morrison\u2019s view appears to have been supported by the \"expert\" witness statements of Dr Kabudi and Mr Bumani, filed by the parties respectively at an earlier stage of the proceedings in relation to the Applications for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal accepts their view, which appears to accord with common sense, and was further tacitly adopted by the parties by the citation of a considerable body of comparatively recent English authority on other aspects of the arbitration. It should be added, for completeness, that no argument was advanced to the effect that any of the more recent English decisions referred to both in the written submissions and in oral argument should be taken as inapplicable on the ground that local conditions, or any other factor, made the decision inapplicable to Tanzania.\n\n100.\n\nThe second problem arises from the provisions of Section 123 of the Tanzanian Evidence Act, under which an intentional statement, representation or omission is required in order to make out a claim of estoppel. However, there is nothing to suggest that this statutory provision is intended to be exhaustive, and excludes the application of other forms of waiver or estoppel as these have developed in England and other common law jurisdictions.\n\n101.\n\nIn the absence of full argument on the point, it is inappropriate for the Tribunal to determine whether there is a distinct legal concept or doctrine of \"waiver\" in Tanzanian or indeed in any common law system. According to its strict legal connotation, waiver is an intentional act, done with full relevant knowledge, whereby a person abandons a right by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right. However, the better view is that, apart from estoppel or a new agreement, abandonment of a right will only occur where the person said to have waived the right is entitled to alternative rights which are inconsistent the one with the other, as, for example, the right to require continuing performance of a contract and the right to treat it as having been repudiated for essential breach (see, for example, *Kammins Ballrooms Co Limited.* v *Zenith Investments (Torquay) Limited [1971] AC 850* at p.883). On this view, this category of waiver is, in truth, an example of the doctrine of election. Another category of waiver is where a person is prevented from asserting, in response to a claim against him, a particular defence, or objection, which would otherwise have been available. Here, waiver is said to arise when that person agrees not to raise the particular defence or so conducts himself as to be estopped from raising it. In these circumstances, the authorities dealing with waiver do not call for special consideration separately from election and estoppel.\n\n102.\n\nTurning to election, the broad principles applicable are not in doubt. The doctrine only applies if a person has alternative rights which are inconsistent the one with the other. It is this concurrent existence of inconsistent rights which explains the doctrine: because they are inconsistent, neither one may be enjoyed without the extinction of the other, and that extinction confers upon the elector the benefit of enjoying the other - a benefit denied to him so long as both remained in existence. Generally, it is sufficient if one party has been consciously led by the other party to believe that the latter has decided not to rescind, to exercise a contractual right to terminate or to treat the contract as at an end on grounds of repudiatory breach, or that the reasonable inference from the actions of that party, or indeed from its inaction, is that it has decided not so to do. Where a right to elect exists, the party enjoying such right is not generally bound to elect at once: it may wait and consider which way to exercise its election, so long as it can do so without causing prejudice to the other party. But in most commercial contexts, a failure to exercise a right to rescind, cancel or terminate within a reasonable time will be taken to evidence an election to affirm the continuing existence of the contract.\n\n103.\n\nEstoppel is a label which today covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories. These include estoppel by conduct, estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel, proprietary estoppel, estoppel by acquiescence and estoppel by convention. All these categories are directed towards the same fundamental purpose, namely, protection against the detriment which would flow from a party\u2019s change of position if the assumption or expectation that led to it were permitted to be denied. The foundation of the doctrine is in all cases the concept of unconscionability.\n\n104.\n\nThe factual material relied upon by IPTL has been fully set out earlier. It is IPTL\u2019s case that if this material is insufficient to justify the conclusion that TANESCO agreed to the change from low speed to medium speed diesel engines, such material is at least sufficient to found an estoppel.\n\n105.\n\nBut for one matter, the Tribunal would have been inclined to conclude that, even if we were wrong in our conclusion that there was an agreement to the change, the facts which we have recited would nevertheless have been amply sufficient to give rise to an estoppel by convention (the parties having apparently acted on the basis of a common assumption that IPTL was contractually entitled to install medium speed diesel engines), or at least an estoppel by acquiescence (TANESCO having stood by without comment or protest in the knowledge that IPTL was taking steps to have the medium speed engines shipped and installed, between, at the latest, November 1997 and April 1998).\n\n106.\n\nThe one matter which causes us to hesitate to draw such a conclusion at this stage is that both estoppel by convention and estoppel by acquiescence, in common with other types of waiver and estoppel, are the children of equity; and it is axiomatic that \"he who seeks equity must do equity\", and that \"he who seeks equity must come with clean hands\". TANESCO has asserted, particularly in the light of documents recently disclosed by IPTL, that IPTL should be disentitled from relying on any equitable defence, because these documents suggest that there were \"shady dealings\" between IPTL, Mechmar and Wartsila, who formed an \"unholy alliance\", which resulted in an artificially inflated EPC Contract price (an allegation which, if persisted in, will no doubt require further investigation at the hearing fixed for July). Further, TANESCO has also recently raised an allegation that the PPA was procured by bribery, or at least that IPTL was guilty of attempting to bribe TANESCO and / or Tanzanian Government representatives.\n\n107.\n\nTANESCO has made application to the Tribunal, inter alia, to defer its decision on TANESCO\u2019s termination claim and IPTL\u2019s waiver / estoppel defence until it has been afforded the opportunity of cross-examining a number of IPTL witnesses, whom it has identified. Whilst the Tribunal has, nevertheless, decided to proceed to its decision on the termination claim as argued (on the basis that the documents disclosed do not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, affect its conclusions, and the answers of the witnesses concerned to the questions which TANESCO would wish to ask them would similarly not affect such conclusions), different considerations could apply in relation to the waiver and estoppel points.\n\n108.\n\nIn these circumstances, and since, in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the issues of construction, it is unnecessary for the waiver or estoppel points to be determined, the Tribunal has decided to withhold any decision on these points, at least for the time being.\n\n**(3) Tariff Adjustment**\n-------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe result of our conclusions in sections (1) and (2) above, is that the Reference Tariff falls to be adjusted \"upwards or downwards\", depending on changes that have taken place in any of the underlying assumptions stated in IPTL\u2019s letter of 31 May 1995 (see paragraph 35 above). This letter listed twelve assumptions said to have been used to determine the capacity charge contained in the Mechmar proposal submitted on 21 November 1994, and which was the basis of negotiations and agreements reached in January 1995 (see paragraph 26 above).\n\n110.\n\nIn the absence of detailed submissions from either side as to precisely how any of the assumptions listed have changed, and as to how such change should be reflected in an adjustment to the tariff, we consider that it would be dangerous for us to express any preliminary views at this stage, even in general terms. We anticipate that these matters will be canvassed in detail before us at the July hearing.\n\n111.\n\nThere are, however, two points that should be mentioned. First, it was said on behalf of IPTL that the \"IRR\" (the Internal Rate of Return) stated in the letter of 31 May 1995 should have been 22.31%, and that the figure of 23% was an error. Second, it was submitted on behalf of TANESCO that in applying any adjustments to the Reference Tariff, one should apply a test of reasonableness and prudence to the costs incurred by IPTL.\n\n**The IRR**\n-----------\n\n112.\n\nIn so far as we have concluded that the \"base line\" for the purposes of any adjustment under Addendum No. 1 should be the assumptions stated in the letter, whether or not there was a unilateral error on the part of IPTL should be of no consequence. However, in the course of the hearing, IPTL very fairly volunteered the correction, which would deem to operate in TANESCO\u2019s favour, and it further seems to be common ground that the necessary correction should be made. Accordingly, the \"IRR\" figure should be amended to read \"22.31%\".\n\n**Reasonableness and Prudence**\n-------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that, in circumstances where the consideration to be paid by one contracting party is dependent upon sums paid or payable by the other contracting party to a third person or persons, there is an implied obligation on the paying party to act prudently and reasonably in its dealings upon which the consideration will depend. We consider that this principle applies equally where, as in this case, a *prima facie* price, payable by one party, falls to be adjusted by reference to the other party\u2019s expenditure.\n\n114.\n\nIn the present case, it is suggested on behalf of TANESCO that IPTL and Mechmar, on its behalf, did not make a reasonable or prudent EPC Contract with Wartsila, and, in particular, that it was unreasonable to accept Wartsila\u2019s final tender price in circumstances where Hyundai had reduced its tender to a lower figure. There are also allegations that there was underhand dealing which resulted in a falsely inflated EPC Contract price.\n\n115.\n\nA considerable amount of evidence has already been put before us on these matters, for the purposes of TANESCO\u2019s application for further documentary disclosure, and in support of its application for the questioning of witnesses or postponement of our decision on certain issues (applications which we have dealt with separately, and as to which we say nothing further in this Award).\n\n116.\n\nThese are, however, amongst the matters with which we anticipate the Tribunal will have to grapple when we deal with the tariff adjustment issue in detail at the hearing in July.\n\n117.\n\nAlthough this was not specifically canvassed at the hearing, it seems to us that the burden must be on the party alleging a breach of what must be an implied term, to establish the lack of reasonable or prudent conduct on which it relies, after having had the benefit of full relevant discovery (which we have now ordered in this case).\n\n118.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief, IPTL raises the further point that, if there is an implied term that the costs incurred must be incurred reasonably and prudently, TANESCO must exercise its right to contend that any costs were unreasonably or imprudently incurred, and therefore either not to be taken into account, or to be subject to adjustment, \"in a commercially reasonable fashion\", and that TANESCO failed so to do. IPTL further contends that for this reason, TANESCO should be taken to have waived its right so to claim, or to be estopped from doing so. This is, we think, a new point, which was not argued at the hearing, and as to which we think it right to express no view at this stage.\n\n**Conclusions**\n---------------\n\n119.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal therefore concludes as follows:\n\n(1) That the PPA was not subject to an unsatisfied condition precedent as alleged or at all, and was not void for uncertainty; and accordingly was a valid and effective contract between the parties;\n\n(2) That TANESCO was not entitled to serve Notice of Default and was and is not entitled to give notice of termination pursuant thereto;\n\n(3) That the Reference Tariff should be adjusted in accordance with Addendum No. 1 by reference to changes that had taken place, before commercial operations would have commenced but for TANESCO\u2019s purported Notice of Default, in any of the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, with the following qualifications, namely:-\n\n(i) that the figure of 23% for \"IRR\" should be amended to read \"22.31%\";\n\n(ii) that it is open to TANESCO to prove that any costs incurred by IPTL relating to any of the listed assumptions were not reasonably and prudently so incurred.\n\nWe therefore answer the Preliminary Issues listed in paragraph 2 above:\n\n(1) Not on any grounds argued and dealt with in this decision.\n\n(2) None, save that there may be consequences on the cost of the Facility and therefore on the adjustment to the Reference Tariff to be carried out pursuant to Addendum No. 1 to the PPA.\n\n(3) & (4) The \"underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\" were those listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter to the Principle Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, and the effect of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995 was as summarised in sub-paragraph (3) above."}, {"Title": "Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2001-02-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties:**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\"), is a Tanzanian corporation, being a public utility wholly owned by the United Republic of Tanzania, and charged with responsibility for the generation, supply and transmission of electric power throughout the country.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent, Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\"), is similarly a corporation incorporated in Tanzania. It was formed as a \"joint venture\" company between VIP Engineering & Marketing Limited, a Tanzanian engineering company, and Mechmar Corporation (Malaysia) Berhard, a Malaysian corporation.\n\n**B. The Contract:**\n--------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of a Power Purchase Agreement (\"PP A\") dated \"as of\u2019 26 May 1995 between TANESCO and IPTL, whereby IPTL agreed to design, construct, own, operate and maintain an electricity generating facility with a nominal net capacity of 100 megawatts, to be located in Tegeta, Tanzania (approximately 25 kilometres north of Dar es Salaam) (the \"Facility\"), and to operate the Facility and deliver electricity generated thereby to TANESCO for an initial period of 20 years, subject to extension for further periods as therein provided. We refer to the project as \"the Tegeta Project\".\n\n4.\n\nUnder Article V of the PPA, the price to be paid after the Initial Operations Date of the first unit comprised three basic elements, namely:\n\n(1) A \"Capacity Payment\";\n\n(2) An \"Energy Payment\";\n\n(3) A \"Test Energy Payment\", to be applied before the applicable Commercial Operations Date.\n\n5.\n\nUnder Appendix B, a \"Reference Tariff\u2019 was to be established, comprising a \"Capacity Purchase Price\" (which in turn consisted of two elements, namely a \"Capital Component\" and a \"Debt Component\"), and an \"Energy Purchase Price\" (also consisting of two elements, namely a \"Fuel Cost Component\", and a \"Variable Operations and Maintenance Costs Component\"), which was subject to escalation/variation in accordance with the detailed provisions of Appendix B so as to arrive at the actual price or tariff to be payable.\n\n6.\n\nUnder Article IV it was a condition precedent to the obligation of TANESCO to purchase electrical energy and capacity from IPTL that IPTL should have fulfilled certain conditions, including in particular under Article 4.1(b) the submission, not less than 30 days prior to the Commencement Date of a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility, when constructed in accordance with the general layout drawings submitted therewith would (inter alia) conform with the Description of the Facility; and under Article 4.1(c) the provision, as soon as available but in any event prior to the Initial Operations Date of each unit, of a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility has been designed and constructed (inter alia) in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the general layout drawings.\n\n7.\n\nAddendum No. 1 to the PPA, dated 9 June 1995, provided (inter alia):\n\n\"Before commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff mentioned in Table I of Appendix B will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement\".\n\n**C. Ancillary Agreements:**\n----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 8 June 1995, an Implementation Agreement and a Guarantee Agreement were entered into between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and IPTL.\n\n**D. The Commercial Background:**\n---------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe above contractual relationship was entered into against the background of a severe shortage of electric power within Tanzania, which was apparently due in part to developments in the economy which stimulated significant growth in the demand for electricity, coupled with problems experienced within Tanzania\u2019s existing hydrogenerated power system. A firm of international consultants, Acres International Limited (\"Acres\"), had been involved in advising the Government of Tanzania and TANESCO on a continuing basis since the late 1970's. By 1995, the need for further generating capacity was regarded as urgent.\n\n**E. Jurisdiction and the Establishment of the Arbitral Tribunal:**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nArticle XVIII of the PPA provided (inter alia) agreed machinery for the resolution of disputes. By Article 18.3, it was agreed that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the PPA should be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedures for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\") established by the Convention on the Settlement Investment of Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"), and that for the purposes of consenting to the jurisdiction of the Convention it was agreed that IPTL was a foreign-controlled entity, unless the amount of the voting stock in IPTL held by non-Tanzanian investors should decrease to less than fifty per cent of its voting stock. Such arbitration was to be conducted in London, England and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, before a tribunal of three arbitrators - one to be nominated by TANESCO, one to be nominated by IPTL, and the third to be nominated by the party - nominated arbitrators or failing their agreement by the High Court of England and Wales.\n\n11.\n\nDisputes did arise between the parties, as hereinafter more particularly defined, which were duly referred to arbitration pursuant to the aforesaid contractual provision - the Request for Arbitration being lodged with ICSID on 25 November 1998, and formally registered by the Secretary General on 7 December 1998.\n\n12.\n\nTANESCO and IPTL nominated the Honorable Charles N Brower of Messrs White & Case LLP, 601 Thirteenth Street, NW, Suite 600 South, Washington, DC, United States of America, and the Honourable Andrew Rogers QC of 233 Macquarie Street, Level 7, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia respectively as arbitrators, and the two arbitrators so nominated agreed to the appointment of Kenneth Rokison QC of 20 Essex Street, London WC2R 3AL, United Kingdom to be third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was fully constituted on 24 March 1999.\n\n13.\n\nThe arbitral proceedings have been conducted throughout in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, under the auspices and administration of the Centre in Washington, DC. Jurisdiction in this case has at no time been contested by either party. TANESCO was designated by Tanzania as an agency of that state pursuant to Article 25(1) of the Convention on 24 September 1998, and TANESCO\u2019s consent to arbitrate disputes with IPTL in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules as provided by Article XVIII of the PPA was expressly approved by the Government of Tanzania by Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement. IPTL, although a Tanzanian corporation, has at all material times been owned and controlled to the extent of at least 70% by nationals of Malaysia. Both Tanzania and Malaysia are parties to the ICSID Convention.\n\n**F. Events Leading to the Development of the Disputes and the Arbitration:**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn due course, on 4 February 1997, an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (the \"EPC Contract\") was concluded between IPTL and Stork-Wartsila Diesel B.V. (\"Stork-Wartsila\"), a company established in The Netherlands, for the purpose of constructing the generation plant required to perform the PPA. In addition, on 21 May 1997, IPTL entered into a Fuel Supply Agreement (the \"FSA\") with Galana Petroleum Limited (\"Galana\") and Total International Limited (\"Total\") for an initial term of 5 years to supply the fuel necessary to operation of the Facility.\n\n15.\n\nAs the Facility was being constructed and the prospect of commencing commercial operations came nearer, the disagreements between the parties which ultimately led to this arbitration developed. In particular, TANESCO took issue with the fact that the EPC Contract with Stork-Wartsila called for the provision of ten 10 MW medium speed diesel engines, instead of the five 20 MW slow speed diesels originally stated in the PPA. Further, it was becoming necessary for the parties to discuss adjustment of the Capacity Purchase Price as foreseen in Addendum No. 1 to the PPA.\n\n16.\n\nThese events took place against the background of apparent controversy within Tanzania regarding a competing project, known as the SONGO-SONGO Gas-to-Electricity or \"SONGAS\" Project, in respect of which agreements had been initialled on 23 March 1997 between (inter alia) the Government of Tanzania, TANESCO, and two Canadian companies, Ocelot Energy Inc. (\"Ocelot\") and TransCanada Pipelines Limited. This rival project was to be built by Canadian interests and financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. There was evidence in the arbitration that, notwithstanding the urgency with which the PPA had been concluded in 1995, pressures were thereafter exerted both on and within the Government of Tanzania and TANESCO to defer it, if not eliminate it, in favour of the SONGAS Project.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 April 1998, on the eve of scheduled discussions between TANESCO and IPTL on the adjustment of the tariff for the Capacity Purchase Price, TANESCO served on IPTL a Notice of Default asserting that IPTL was \"in default on its obligation to supply and install slow speed diesel generating sets in accordance with Section 1.1 of Appendix A to the PPA\" and calling upon IPTL to cure such default within 90 days as required under Article 16.3 of the PPA\n\n18.\n\nNegotiations proceeded somewhat sporadically during the course of the summer and early autumn of 1998 with the participation of the Tanzanian Government, TANESCO, and its legal and technical advisers, Hunton & Williams and Acres respectively, together with IPTL. However the parties remained at loggerheads regarding both adjustment of the Capacity Purchase Price and the substitution of medium speed diesels for slow speed diesels.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 November 1998 the Request for Arbitration was lodged on behalf of TANESCO, asserting two claims:\n\n(1) That medium speed diesel engines had been substituted for the required slow speed diesels without obtaining the prior written consent of TANESCO, thus entitling TANESCO to terminate the PPA; alternatively\n\n(2) That, pursuant to Addendum No. 1 the Capacity Purchase Price was to be \"cost based\", but IPTL was refusing to share relevant information with TANESCO and the cost seemed excessive, so that in the event that the PPA could not be terminated the tariff should be adjusted.\n\n**G. Subsequent Developments:**\n-------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn 14 December 1998, TANESCO gave to IPTL Notice of Intent to Terminate pursuant to Article 16.3(a) of the PPA, which was copied to IPTL\u2019s lenders, stating that, barring consensual resolution of the matter, TANESCO reserved its right to terminate the PPA pursuant to Article 16.3(c).\n\n21.\n\nMeanwhile on 30 November 1998, five days after lodging of the Request for Arbitration with the Centre, IPTL filed a petition in the High Court of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam, directed against TANESCO and three officials of the Government of Tanzania, seeking both a declaration that commercial operations of IPTL's facility should be deemed as having commenced 15 September 1998 and an order for payment to IPTL by TANESCO of a \"Capacity Payment\" in the amount of $3,623,000 monthly beginning on that date.\n\n22.\n\nOn 7 December 1998, being the same day the Request for Arbitration was registered by the Secretary General, TANESCO petitioned the Tanzanian High Court to stay the proceedings recently commenced against it.\n\n23.\n\nOn the following day, 8 December 1998, IPTL submitted to the same Court a \"Notice of Objection on a Preliminary Point of Law\" asserting in effect that TANESCO had waived its right to pursue this arbitration.\n\n24.\n\nOn 5 March 1999 the High Court of Tanzania sustained the preliminary objections of IPTL and proceeded immediately to grant the relief requested by IPTL in its original petition. Leave was given to TANESCO to appeal and it sought a stay of execution pending such appeal.\n\n25.\n\nIn response, on 7 April 1999, IPTL applied for an order of execution in the amount of $23,670,266.67, that being the accumulated sum of the monthly \"Capacity Payments\" due pursuant to the High Court's Order up to 1 April 1999. Thereafter IPTL agreed that it would not execute for a limited period of time.\n\n26.\n\nWhen the Tribunal convened its initial session with the parties on 14 June 1999, TANESCO had already issued a request for an order of provisional measures from the Tribunal directed at a cessation of all the above proceedings in the Courts of Tanzania.\n\n27.\n\nIn the course of that session, it was clarified that IPTL was willing further to stay its hand in relation to the proceedings in Tanzania, but that it would itself seek provisional measures from this Tribunal substantially to the same effect as it had obtained from the High Court of Tanzania.\n\n28.\n\nThereafter, on 28 June 1999, IPTL filed with the Tribunal a request for the following provisional measures:\n\n(1) Permitting commercial operations of the Facility to commence;\n\n(2) Requiring TANESCO to make monthly Capacity Payments in the amount of $3,623,000, or, in the alternative, in the amount of $3,400,000 (an interim monthly payment which TANESCO previously had agreed with IPTL, subject however to approval of the Government of Tanzania, which had not been forthcoming); and\n\n(3) Requiring Tanzania to pay forthwith a lump sum of $32,607,000, being the accumulated monthly Capacity Payments due from 15 September 1998 to May 1999 in accordance with the order of the High Court of Tanzania.\n\n29.\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Tribunal convened to hear both parties\u2019 applications for provisional measures. In the meantime, on 8 July 1999, the order of the High Court of Tanzania had been stayed by a single Justice of the Court of Appeal of Tanzania, pending determination of the appeal thereof, and the parties then requested the Tribunal to defer consideration of TANESCO's request for provisional measures directed at the Tanzanian court proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nAt this hearing IPTL revised its request by (1) withdrawing its demand for a lump sum payment of the alleged \"arrears\" accumulated in respect of the order of the High Court of Tanzania, and (2) requesting that the requested order permitting commercial operations also enjoin TANESCO to co-operate with IPTL, including conducting operational tests and connecting the Facility to the Tanzanian power grid. The demand for a monthly Capacity Payment remained.\n\n31.\n\nOn 20 December 1999 the Tribunal issued its Decision On The Respondent\u2019s Request For Provisional Measures, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix A and which is incorporated herein by reference. The relief that had been requested by IPTL was denied by the Tribunal on the ground that it would change rather than maintain the status quo by ordering performance of the PPA, and thus was outside the scope of Arbitration Rule 39, and that there was insufficient demonstration of urgency in that IPTL, should it prevail on the merits, would in any event receive tariff payments over 20 years as foreseen by the PPA and would lose only the interim use of funds, for which an award of damages would on the face of it be an adequate remedy.\n\n32.\n\nBy the time of the hearing resulting in that Decision it had become clear that it would be appropriate to determine as a preliminary matter certain issues of construction of the PPA and law. It was ordered, therefore, that the parties should make written submissions with respect to the following preliminary issues:\n\n1. Was or is TANESCO entitled to terminate the PPA?\n\n2. If not, what are the effects (if any) on the parties' respective rights and obligations under the PPA of:\n\n(a) the change from low speed to medium speed diesel engines; and/or\n\n(b) any other alleged differences between the Facility as built and that provided for in the PPA and/or any other agreements between the parties?\n\n3. How is the final Reference Tariff to be calculated, in the light of the said change and any other differences which may be established?\n\n4. What was the effect on the parties' respective rights and obligations of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995, and, in particular, did Addendum No. 1 on its true construction have the effect that the final Reference Tariff was to be calculated by reference to the reasonable and prudently incurred cost of the Facility as built; and what were \"the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\"?\n\n33.\n\nA hearing was held 13, 14, 15 and 16 March 2000 on these preliminary issues, and on 22 May 2000 the Tribunal issued its Decision On Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix B and which is incorporated herein by reference. As set forth in paragraph 19 of that Decision, the \"Conclusions\" of the Tribunal on the Preliminary Issues were as follows:\n\n(1) That the PPA was not subject to an unsatisfied condition precedent as alleged or at all, and was not void for uncertainty; and accordingly was a valid and effective contract between the parties;\n\n(2) That TANESCO was not entitled to serve Notice of Default and was and is not entitled to give notice of termination pursuant thereto;\n\n(3) That the Reference Tariff should be adjusted in accordance with Addendum No. 1 by reference to changes that had taken place, before commercial operations would have commenced but for TANESCO's purported Notice of Default, in any of the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira's letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, with the following qualifications, namely :-\n\n(i) that the figure of 23% for \"IRR\" should be amended to read \"22.31%\";\n\n(ii) that it is open to TANESCO to prove that any costs incurred by IPTL relating to any of the listed assumptions were not reasonably and prudently so incurred.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to answer the Preliminary Issues listed in paragraph 32 above as follows:\n\n(1) Not on any grounds argued and dealt with in this decision.\n\n(2) None, save that there may be consequences on the cost of the Facility and therefore on the adjustment to the Reference Tariff to be carried out pursuant to Addendum No. 1 to the PPA.\n\n(3) & (4) The \"underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\" were those listed in Mr Rugemalira's letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, and the effect of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995 was as summarised in sub-paragraph (3) above.\"\n\n34.\n\nAt the time of the hearing on Preliminary Issues, and at the date of our Decision on those issues, a date had already been fixed for what was hoped would be the final hearing in this matter, to consider remaining issues in relation to the fixing of the tariff, to take place during the last week in July 2000.\n\n35.\n\nBetween the date of the hearing on Preliminary Issues and the date of our Decision, on 20 April 2000 TANESCO submitted a request to the Tribunal for an order for discovery concerning alleged payments and/or gifts made or given, offered or promised by agents of IPTL to officials of the Government of the Republic of Tanzania or TANESCO, including the provision of Answers to Interrogatories and a Request for Admissions in relation to such payments or gifts.\n\n36.\n\nReference to allegations of bribery or attempted bribery had been made earlier in the course of the proceedings, but TANESCO had never formally pleaded such allegations or sought to raise them by way of claim or defence.\n\n37.\n\nThe request was supported by the unsworn statements of Mr Patrick Rutabanzibwa, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of the Republic of Tanzania and formerly the Commissioner for Energy and Petroleum Affairs in that Ministry, Mr Prosper A.M. Victus, the Assistant Commissioner for Energy (Petroleum and Gas); and Mrs Esther Masunzu, the Assistant Commissioner for Energy (Electricity).\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal declined to make any of the orders requested, on the ground that no allegation of bribery had been pleaded, and that it would in any event not be right to order the answering of questions on oath when the only basis for the allegations upon which the questions were based was unsworn statements.\n\n39.\n\nThe request was renewed on 26 May 2000, when TANESCO submitted its Reply on the Merits, in which it pleaded for the first time a claim to be entitled to rescind the PPA on the basis of its allegations of bribery, which it purported to raise as an \"Ancillary Claim\" pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (which by its paragraph (2) must be presented not later than in the Reply). The renewed application was supported by the Statutory Declaration of Mr Victus, and sworn statements of Mrs Masunzu and Mr Rutabanzibwa.\n\n40.\n\nOn 6 June 2000 IPTL raised objection to the assertion of the bribery claim and the renewed request for discovery, on the grounds (inter alia):\n\n(1) That it was not an \"ancillary\" claim, but was a claim which should have been asserted, if at all, in TANESCO\u2019s Memorial on the Merits in January 2000;\n\n(2) That, even assuming the truth of the facts alleged in the witness statements, TANESCO had failed to make out a prima facie case for rescission of the PPA; and\n\n(3) That if the plea were to be allowed, it would jeopardise the July hearing date.\n\nAlternatively, in the event that the Tribunal was minded to permit TANESCO to proceed with its plea of bribery, IPTL sought an order for immediate production by TANESCO of all documents relevant to the plea.\n\n41.\n\nOn 12 June 2000 the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision that it would permit TANESCO to raise the bribery issue pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and ordered both parties to produce any documents in their possession, custody or power relating to that issue. But it declined to order the wide-ranging Interrogatories or the Request for Admissions proposed, which sought the answers to questions concerning possible bribery and attempts at bribery by employees and agents of IPTL generally, on the ground that no allegations of bribery or attempted bribery had been made against any representatives of IPTL except Mr Rugemalira. The Tribunal made it clear that the addition of the bribery allegations would not be permitted to delay the July hearing, which had been scheduled for some time.\n\n42.\n\nOn 27 June 2000 the Tribunal ruled that TANESCO should produce relevant documents in the files of its counsel emanating from the Government of Tanzania, even though the original documents had never been in the possession, custody or power of TANESCO itself.\n\n43.\n\nThese documents were produced by TANESCO\u2019s Counsel, Hunton & Williams, under cover of a letter dated 5 July 2000, on the basis of an express agreement as to their confidentiality (which in the view of the Tribunal would have applied in any event). In the penultimate paragraph of its letter, Hunton & Williams stated:\n\nThe investigation in Tanzania is not complete. In the light of this fact, we have been instructed to advise that TANESCO will not proceed further at this time with respect to its bribery allegations but will make oral application at the hearing later this month for an extension of time to present its case with respect to the bribery claims.\n\nTANESCO further purported to \"reserve all rights regarding its bribery claim\" under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and under Tanzanian law.\n\n44.\n\nMeanwhile, on 29 June 2000 IPTL served its Reply Counter Memorial (or \"Rejoinder\") on the Merits and on 10 July 2000 served its Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff. On 11 July 2000 TANESCO served its Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff.\n\n45.\n\nAn oral hearing took place before the Tribunal at the International Dispute Resolution Centre, 8 Breams Buildings, London on 21, 21, 24, 25 and 26 July 2000, at which TANESCO was represented by Mr Robert W. Hawkins, Mr John Jay Range and Mr Brett A. Bakke of Hunton & Williams, and IPTL was represented by Mr Robert Sentner and Mr Chris Paparella of Nixon Peabody LLP.\n\n46.\n\nOral evidence was given by Mr William Matthews, Mr Alfred Lippert, Dr Martin Swales, Mr B.E.A.T. Luhanga, Mr Donald Wessel, Mr James Rugemalira, Datuk Majid, Mr Willy Lim and Mr Donald Chambless.\n\n47.\n\nAfter the close of the oral hearing, and pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal, IPTL filed a written submission dated 18 August 2000 on its claim for Damages for Breach of Contract, and each party filed a Post-Hearing Memorial dated 12 September 2000. Thereafter, on 2 October 2000, each party filed a written submission on the Award of Arbitration Costs.\n\n48.\n\nAt the start of the July hearing and upon the application of TANESCO, the Tribunal received \"information\" from Mr Rutabanzibwa (although he was not formally called as a witness) as to the progress of the investigation in Tanzania of the allegations of bribery, which had apparently started in late 1997, had thereafter proceeded somewhat sporadically, but which was said to be continuing. On the basis of this information, Counsel for TANESCO asked for an extension of time of 3 months to make additional filings in relation to these issues.\n\n49.\n\nMr Hawkins declined the invitation of the Tribunal to apply to withdraw the allegation, and, after considering the application, the Tribunal refused to grant the extension requested, and indicated that since the allegation remained on the record, it must be dealt with on its merits on the basis of the material put before it.\n\n**2. The Remaining Issues:**\n----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe issues which were canvassed before the Tribunal and which we are called upon to determine include the following:\n\n(1) The issue of alleged bribery;\n\n(2) Did IPTL and/or the parties fail to perform conditions precedent to Commercial Operations, including:\n\n(1) Failing to provide a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility when constructed would conform with the Description of the Facility, or that the Facility had been designed and constructed in all material respects within the terms of the PPA and the general layout drawings?\n\n(2) Failing to agree the Reference Tariff?\n\n(3) Was TANESCO in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to the negotiations concerning the fixing of the tariff, and if so what are the consequences?\n\n(4) Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to the negotiations and in particular to the disclosure of relevant documents and information, and if so what are the consequences?\n\n(5) Did IPTL and Stork-Wartsila conspire together falsely to inflate the EPC price?\n\n(6) Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to any costs and expenses which it would have input into the amount prima facie payable by TANESCO as the Capacity Payment element of the tariff, and in particular in relation to the procurement of the EPC Contract?\n\n(7) Was IPTL in breach of its implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to the procurement of the FSA, and if so what consequences flow?\n\n(8) Were any breaches on the part of either party waived, or is any complaint or remedy barred by estoppel?\n\n(9) What adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff stated in the PPA?\n\n(10) What if any further orders should be made?\n\n(11) What if any order should be made in respect of the costs of the arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal), and/or the legal and other costs of the parties?\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal considers these issues in the above order as follows. In so doing, it makes the following observations.\n\n(1) The Tribunal will not repeat at length any of the arguments which were canvassed or the decisions made in the course of earlier stages in the proceedings culminating in the Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures and the Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, both of which are appended hereto and incorporated herein;\n\n(2) Insofar as any issue depends on an application of principles of law, the Tribunal has sought to apply the law of the Republic of Tanzania, as it has sought to do throughout this arbitration, including the Decisions referred to in paragraph 51(1) above, that being the governing law of the contract expressly designated by the parties by Article 19.4 of the PPA.\n\n**3. The Issue of Bribery:**\n----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn the light of TANESCO\u2019s having pleaded this issue in its Reply on the Merits, and in the light of TANESCO\u2019s having declined the invitation of the Tribunal to withdraw the allegation, we must consider it on its merits and on the basis of the material before us.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the allegation fails and must be dismissed. Even if the evidence presented on behalf of TANESCO were to be accepted (and we emphasise that it was very much disputed on behalf of IPTL and had at all times been vigorously denied by Mr Rugemalira), we conclude that it would have been insufficient to establish the plea.\n\n54.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits of 26 May 2000, TANESCO invoked Sections 19, 23 and 24 of the Tanzanian Law of Contract Ordinance. It is first of all contended that part of the \"consideration\" for the PPA (said to be \"bribes given by IPTL'S agents........to induce the PPA's execution\") was unlawful, and the PPA is therefore void. Alternatively, it is contended that the PPA is voidable on the ground that consent was \"procured by coercion\".\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it has not been suggested that any unlawful payment was made to TANESCO, being the party with whom IPTL concluded the PPA. Further, as we read the evidence, the only sum said to have been paid by Mr Rugemalira and not rejected was the sum of 100,000 Tanzanian shillings (the then equivalent of less than US$200) said to have been contained in a \"holiday gift package\" given to Mrs Masunzu during the Christmas season of 1994. According to the notes of her interview before those investigating the allegations in Tanzania, which she adopted for the purposes of her evidence, she was twice offered $20,000 - in 1994 and again in 1996 - but refused on both occasions. Although Mrs Masunzu is said to have admitted that, by her taking the 100,000 Tanzanian shillings, \"Mr Rugemalira succeeded in getting her assistance in direct support of the IPTL project\", there is no evidence to suggest either (i) that, but for the alleged bribe, she would have cast any vote or used any influence against the IPTL project, or (ii) that her support was crucial or indeed made any difference.\n\n56.\n\nThe evidence of Mr Rutabanzibwa and Mr Victus only alleges attempts at bribery, which were rejected. There is no suggestion that these alleged attempts caused either Mr Rutabanzibwa or Mr Victus to favour IPTL's cause. Indeed, one might have thought that, as men of honour, as they purport to be, the attempted bribes would have had the very opposite effect.\n\n57.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal repeats its conclusion stated in paragraph 119(1) of its Decision of 22 May 2000 to the effect that the PPA was an effective contract between the parties.\n\n**4. Did IPTL fail to perform a condition precedent to commercial operation by its failure to procure an Independent Engineer's Certificate that the Facility when constructed would conform to the contractual description, or that the Facility had been designed and constructed in all material respects within the terms of the PPA and the general layout drawings?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal has already effectively dealt with this allegation in its Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, and in particular paragraphs 77 and 78 thereof, in which it was concluded that the Certificate of the Independent Engineer which IPTL provided clearly satisfied the requirements of Article 4.1(b) of the PPA in all respects save one, namely that it stated that the plant when constructed in accordance with the general layout drawings and technical specifications \"meets generally with the Description of the Facility\", rather than that it \"will conform\".\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the difference was not a serious, let alone a material one, and accordingly, on the face of it, Article 4.1(b) was substantially satisfied. Furthermore, we observed that the response of TANESCO's Managing Director to the Certificate provided was simply to note the Independent Engineer's certification of the Facility \"conforming to the requirements of the PPA's Article IV Clause 4.1(b)\", from which it appears that, at the relevant time, TANESCO shared the conclusion which the Tribunal reached.\n\n60.\n\nSo far as the obligation under Article 4.1(c) is concerned, it will be observed that the PPA itself introduces a degree of flexibility, insofar as the Certificate relating to the Facility \"as built\" is only required to confirm the Facility\u2019s compliance with the agreement \"in all material respects\". In the light of our earlier conclusions expressed in our Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, this provision presents no problems to IPTL.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is nothing in this point, which was only canvassed briefly in TANESCO's Memorial and does not seem to feature in its Post-Hearing Memorial.\n\n**5. Did either party fail to perform a condition precedent to commercial operation, namely to agree on the Reference tariff?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nTANESCO relies on the wording of Addendum No. 1, which provides that \"Before the commencement of commercial operations, the Reference Tariff......will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place in any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\". The Tribunal has concluded that the \"underlying assumptions\" referred to are those set out in IPTL's letter of 30 May 1995.\n\n63.\n\nThe PPA makes no provision for the agreement of the parties to such adjustment, and no provision as to what is to happen if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the adjustment to be made. TANESCO contends that, absent such provision, there is no room for an implication by necessity. If the parties are ultimately unable to agree, the arbitration clause provides machinery for resolving the parties' dispute; meanwhile, nothing further can happen.\n\n64.\n\nIPTL challenges the assertion that Addendum No. 1 should be read as a condition precedent, providing, in effect, that the appropriate adjustment to the Reference Tariff must be agreed before commercial operations can commence. That is not what Addendum No. 1 says: rather, it provides that there shall be the appropriate adjustment. This is a mutual obligation of the parties. If agreement cannot be reached on the amount of any such adjustment before the commencement of operations, it can always be adjusted with retroactive effect once an agreement or, absent agreement, an arbitral award is made.\n\n65.\n\nIt is true that a retrospective adjustment would be possible. But that is not what Addendum No. 1 contemplates. What should be the amount of any provisional payment in the meantime? Should it be the unadjusted amount? Or the minimum amount conceded by TANESCO? Despite the immediate and instinctive feeling expressed by the Tribunal that it cannot have been the mutual intention that the Facility should stand idle while any dispute concerning the appropriate adjustment was finally settled by agreement or arbitration, it is not easy to identify the precise scope of any term which business efficacy requires to be implied.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal is reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there is no basis for implying a term to the effect that commercial operations should begin notwithstanding the lack of agreement on the adjusted Reference Tariff. Similarly, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that there is was any implied term requiring the parties to proceed on the basis of a provisional or interim tariff pending agreement between the parties or a decision by the relevant tribunal charged with the resolution of any dispute.\n\n67.\n\nHowever, now that the Tribunal is charged with that task, there is no reason why we should not decide what if any adjustment is appropriate and for commercial operation to commence in accordance with our decision. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that each party in its Post-Hearing Memorial seeks an order for the commencement of commercial operations at an appropriate date.\n\n**6. Was TANESCO in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to any negotiations concerning the fixing of the tariff, and if so what are the consequences?Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to such negotiations and in particular the disclosure of relevant documents and information, and if so what are the consequences?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nLengthy delay in the commencement of commercial operations was clearly not in the interest of either party, and the Tribunal concludes that business efficacy requires the implication of a term that the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an endeavour to agree the appropriate adjustment with the minimum of delay. Each party accuses the other of a lack of good faith in this respect. TANESCO asserts that the primary reason for the failure to achieve any progress in the tariff negotiations which took place between about April and September 1998 was the refusal by IPTL to accept that it was under any obligation to incur project costs reasonably and prudently, or to provide TANESCO with documents and other information necessary to demonstrate that project costs (a) had actually been incurred and (b) had been incurred reasonably and prudently. IPTL, on the other hand, asserts that TANESCO was not prepared to embark upon negotiations in good faith at all, in circumstances where it was alleging that, by reason of the substitution of medium speed for low speed diesel engines, the Facility had not been built in accordance with the contractual description and IPTL was thereby in default. Once the Notice of Default had been served on 9 April 1998, IPTL was met at the purported tariff negotiations by Acres as well as representatives from TANESCO's lawyers, Hunton & Williams. According to IPTL, it did supply substantial documentation, including giving access to its current electronic financial model, and proposed the appointment of an independent engineer to assess the reasonableness of the project costs and agreed to be bound by his decision - but TANESCO would not agree.\n\n69.\n\nIt is the view of the Tribunal that, in the negotiations which took place from April to September 1998, both parties were guilty of a degree of posturing, and, as we have concluded in our Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law and hereinafter in this Decision, neither was adopting a stance which we consider to have been wholly justified. The contemporaneous record shows that, once the Notice of Default had been served, it was IPTL who, at the meeting between the parties' representatives on 14 April 1998, initially refused to engage in any discussions on the final tariff until the disagreement over the issue of alleged default had been resolved (a stance repeated in IPTL's letter the following day), while TANESCO and the Government of Tanzania expressed themselves as willing for discussions to move forward \"on a parallel basis\" and urged IPTL to participate. True, IPTL soon changed its stance, and in a letter dated 24 April 1998 expressed its willingness to start final tariff negotiations even if the Notice of Default were not withdrawn, and negotiations continued thereafter. However, progress was undoubtedly hampered by the fact that IPTL said that neither it nor its advisers were able to provide documentation relating to the bidding process for the EPC Contract, being the biggest single item of expenditure. Further, although TANESCO did not withdraw its Notice of Default (which the Tribunal held in its previous Decision was not justified in the circumstances), it did not use this as a ground for not continuing the negotiation process. Indeed, the parties reached agreement at a meeting on 29 October 1998 on the tariff to be applied during the interim period while the disputes between the parties were being reviewed and resolved through the dispute resolution mechanism, but the agreement reached was made subject to the approval of the Government of Tanzania, which was unfortunately not forthcoming. However, in any event, as we have concluded, there was no obligation to agree upon an interim tariff. It was against this background that IPTL launched proceedings in the Tanzanian Courts for interim mandatory orders requiring TANESCO to make monthly capacity payments. The positions of the parties were then \"polarised\", and remained so during the course of the arbitration.\n\n70.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that IPTL's allegation that TANESCO failed and refused to negotiate in good faith after April 1998 is not made out, and that, at all events, such failure and/or refusal was not the sole or effective cause of the fact that a tariff was not agreed with the result that commercial operations did not commence. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that IPTL\u2019s claim to damages fails, and that it is therefore unnecessary to consider the details of the quantum of its claim.\n\n71.\n\nSo far as the counter-allegation by TANESCO is concerned, the Tribunal concludes that its complaint as to IPTL\u2019s reluctance to provide relevant documents and other information, so as to enable TANESCO to assess the reasonableness and prudence of its conduct, is made out, even though IPTL might reasonably have concluded that the provision of further documents and information at that stage would have been unlikely to bear fruit. But in the event, since TANESCO claims no damages for IPTL\u2019s breach in this respect, the point is academic.\n\n**7. Did IPTL and Stork-Wartsila conspire to inflate the EPC Contract price?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nIn our Decision of May 2000 (paragraph 69), we mention the suggestion that there was what had been described as an \"unholy alliance\" between IPTL and Wartsila which resulted in a falsely inflated EPC Contract price. TANESCO suggests that this was motivated by a decision to maximise the project cost so as to increase IPTL's gross return, which had been fixed as a percentage of its equity contribution; or some other ulterior motive.\n\n73.\n\nThis was plainly an allegation of dishonesty, and accordingly carries with it a correspondingly heavy burden of proof, especially as the allegation, if true, would have had to have involved a very well-known and well-respected international engineering corporation. Apart from relying on the fact that the Stork-Wartsila final bid price in January 1996, which was accepted, was higher than the rival Hyundai bid and higher than the price which Stork-Wartsila had bid in September 1995, TANESCO relies on what are described as secret \"t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\" meetings between IPTL's agents, Mechmar, and Stork-Wartsila in August and September 1995, when Stork-Wartsila and Mechmar were discussing a form of joint venture or \"Construction Consortium\", under which performance of part of the EPC Contract (including in particular all tanks, oil-fired boilers, civil works of the power plant, staff housing and access road and water pipeline) was to be sub-contracted to Mechmar Energy.\n\n74.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal there was nothing even prima facie sinister about the joint venture proposal, which, as the evidence put before us concerning other projects and their costs demonstrates, was by no means extraordinary. Furthermore, despite the plea in TANESCO's closing written submissions that the evidence of bad faith by Mechmar/ IPTL is \"overwhelming\", as TANESCO itself was at pains to point out, at the time the parties to the proposed joint venture were discussing the prices in the latter part of September 1995, the price for that part of the work which was to be carried out by Stork-Wartsila appears to have been very much in line with its proposal of 7 July 1995, which in turn was \"comparable\" with its earlier proposal of 23 March 1995, with an appropriate adjustment to take account of changes in the (\"Dfl \")(Dutch Guilder)/US$ exchange rate.\n\n75.\n\nIn any event, we do not consider that the allegation really advances TANESCO's case. If we were to conclude that the award of the EPC Contract to Stork-Wartsila at the price agreed in January 1996 was unreasonable in the circumstances, especially bearing in mind the lower rival Hyundai bid at the same time, IPTL's motive does not matter. IPTL will in those circumstances have been in breach of the term which the Tribunal has concluded should be implied, namely that IPTL must have acted reasonably and prudently in the procurement of the EPC Contract and other contracts, and the damages to which TANESCO would prima facie be entitled would be such as to put it in the financial position in which it would have been had IPTL and its agents acted reasonably and prudently. So, if the Tribunal concludes that the EPC Contract should have been procured at a lower price (either from Stork-Wartsila or Hyundai), the tariff must, in the result, be calculated on the hypothesis that such lower price had been agreed.\n\n**8. Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to any costs and expenses which would have an impact on the amount prima facie payable by TANESCO as the Capacity Payment element of the Reference Tariff, and in particular in relation to the procurement of the EPC Contract?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAs the Tribunal concluded in its Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, the Capacity Purchase Price element of the Reference Tariff fell to be adjusted by reference to any changes in the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter of 31 May 1995.\n\n77.\n\nWe further concluded that it was for IPTL to establish what costs and expenses were incurred under each head, and that TANESCO then had the burden of establishing, if it could, that any part of such costs or expenses was unreasonably or imprudently incurred, on the basis of the information and in particular the documents which IPTL was obliged to furnish.\n\n78.\n\nAn analysis of TANESCO\u2019s attack on the amounts claimed by IPTL to have been incurred by way of costs and expenses shows that they fell into two categories, namely:\n\n(1) A challenge to the assertion that costs or expenses had been incurred at all, and if incurred, whether for the purposes of the Tegeta Project; and\n\n(2) A challenge as to the reasonableness of the cost or expense, and thus the reasonableness and prudence of IPTL\u2019s conduct.\n\n**A. The EPC Contract:**\n------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThis was the subject of TANESCO\u2019s principal attack, and occupied a substantial proportion of the parties\u2019 submissions and evidence. A lot of money turns on this item, and we therefore think it right to deal with it in some detail. The main evidence presented was of two kinds, namely:\n\n(1) Evidence of the cost of other projects around the world which were said by one party or the other to be \"comparable\" or at least to afford some guidance (with adjustments where appropriate), backed up by the opinions of experts;\n\n(2) Evidence of the process whereby the EPC Contract came to be awarded to Stork-Wartsila at the agreed price.\n\nThere was also evidence presented through Mr Chambless based on published data of prices in the North American market, which we will mention hereafter, but which we regarded as not particularly helpful.\n\n80.\n\nIn relation to the costs of other projects, a degree of caution is clearly necessary, since every project is different, and quite apart from differences in specification, including the required fuel type and basic technology involved, allowance may have to be made for such matters as the country in which the project is located and the associated political risk, the accessibility of the site, the location in relation to the sourcing and price of labour, equipment and materials, inflation over time, and currency fluctuations. One must also bear in mind the relative market situation in terms of supply and demand, including individual companies\u2019 order books and backlogs. Further, even if, looked at objectively in comparison with other projects at other places and at other times, the price of a project might appear to be high, market forces may still dominate, and provided that the would-be purchaser adopts an appropriate bidding strategy and gives an opportunity of bidding to a sufficient number of likely interested suppliers, and thereafter negotiates in a proper maimer, he will prima facie have acted reasonably and prudently.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal does not think it helpful to attempt a detailed analysis of the considerable amount of material put before us on both sides relating to allegedly \"comparable\" projects - an exercise which has helpfully been reviewed by both parties in their Post-Hearing Memorials following detailed presentations in their earlier written submissions on which the witnesses elaborated at the hearing. We do think it worthwhile, however, to make the following points regarding this evidence.\n\n82.\n\nNowhere are the problems associated with an analysis of \"comparable\" projects more clearly illustrated than in the parties\u2019 evidence regarding the 74 MW Kipevu II project in Kenya. Understandably, both parties addressed Kipevu II as the project geographically nearest to the Tegeta Project and by virtue of this basic fact alone arguably comparable. Moreover, it appears also to be a Stork-Wartsila project using diesel engines identical to those installed at Tegeta.\n\n83.\n\nIn the first affidavit submitted on this subject by IPTL, Mr Fred W. Campbell, a project manager in the Energy Division of Bums & McDonnell Engineering Company of Kansas City, Missouri, USA, sought to justify Stork-Wartsila\u2019s EPC price by reference, inter alia, to the $85 million price tag which the parties accept as published \u2022 by the World Bank in respect of Kipevu II. Although it is clear from the World Bank documents that, as Mr Campbell stated, \"the cost of the Kipevu II *project* is $1135/KW\" ($85 million - 74 MW = $1,135/KW), it does not follow that this is, as Mr Campbell went on to say, \"virtually the same as the $l,140/KW of the Tegeta Project,\" since this latter figure represents only the *EPC cost* of Tegeta ($114,000,000 100 MW = $l,140/KW), and not the *overall project* cost. (Emphasis added). Such an obviously faulty analysis could not possibly justify the conclusion, made by Mr Campbell on the basis of Kipevu II (as well as other projects), that \"the EPC price of the Tegeta Project is within international norms\". On the other hand, it is evident that there are significant aspects of Kipevu II that suggest the possibility that it may entail less EPC work than Tegeta, whose per-KW cost then could naturally be higher. Thus, Kipevu II was to be located on land already cleared and adjacent to Kipevu I, an earlier (and similar) state-owned project, as well as to an even older state-owned steam power plant known simply as Kipevu and a new barge-mounted gas turbine independent power project fired on condensate (known as Westmont Power). TANESCO\u2019s expert Mr Alfred Lippert, a Chief Mechanical Engineer with Lahmeyer International GmbH of Bad Vilbel, Germany, when examined at the hearing, quite understandably could not express an opinion whether in the circumstances the Kipevu II EPC costs would have included, for example, construction of any access roads, interconnection to the Kenyan power grid, substation upgrades, housing, or two years\u2019 supply of spare parts, all of which were required in Stork-Wartsila\u2019s EPC contract for Tegeta. Mr Lippert agreed that \"it was reasonable\" for Hyundai to have bid about $8 million for such \"provisional items\" required in the Tegeta EPC Contract. In addition, he acknowledged that Stork-Wartsila was required to level and clear the Tegeta site, whereas the Kipevu II site had already been prepared. As Mr Lippert also acknowledged, the Kipevu II site is such that fuel delivery can be accomplished simply by constructing a 50-metre spur into the existing pipeline already serving nearby generating plants, thereby obviating the trucking and associated facilities required at Tegeta.\n\n84.\n\nEven had Kipevu II and Tegeta involved identical requirements in all respects, however, it was demonstrated to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction that because of currency fluctuations the period of time separating the two EPC price agreements could render them wholly incomparable. While the Stork-Wartsila EPC price of $114,188,560 for Tegeta was fixed on 22 January 1996, the PPA for Kipevu II was signed only in November 1998. Neither party could provide a date as of which an EPC price had been fixed with respect to Kipevu II, and the evidence was that at least as of 13 January 2000 no construction work had taken place there. As IPTL pointed out, at the time Stork-Wartsila had fixed the Tegeta *EPC price* of $ 114,188,560, that sum (rounded to $114 million) represented Dfl. (Dutch guilders) 190,254,601, but as of 29 June 2000 that same guilder sum equalled $81,415,166, or several million dollars *less than the entire project cost* of Kipevu II, which is three-quarters the size of Tegeta. (Emphasis added). While Stork-Wartsila doubtless procured much in dollars, or in other non-guilder currencies, the point remains: clearly comparisons unadjusted for such factors are of little value, if any.\n\n85.\n\nThe difficulties in analyzing \"comparable\" projects thus illustrated necessarily increase the further away one gets from a presumptively somewhat similar situation as. is presented by Kipevu II. Thus, the Tribunal finds it can draw but limited comfort from Mr Lippert\u2019s reliance on three other projects also using Stork-Wartsila engines identical to those installed at Tegeta, namely: Tapal, in Karachi, Pakistan; Zamboango, in the Philippines; and Lufussa, in Honduras. Still less can one be materially influenced by any of the seven additional projects on which TANESCO relies, all of which use Stork-Wartsila\u2019s \"next largest engine\", the 18 V46, and which are located variously in Bangladesh (Haripur); India (Tamil); Jamaica (Old Harbour); Pakistan (Karachi and Kohinoor); the Philippines (Luzon); and Vietnam (Ba Ria-Vung). It is noteworthy nonetheless that one of these, Old Harbour in Jamaica, is asserted to cost overall $1,353/KW (as compared to Tegeta\u2019s $l,500/KW). Moreover, as to a great number of the projects on which Mr Lippert gave evidence, the only information available apparently consisted exclusively of news reports from wire services and the like.\n\n86.\n\nIt is thus hardly surprising that in these proceedings IPTL vigorously questioned the usefulness of such evidence laid before us by TANESCO, and, apart from the early affidavit of Mr Campbell, itself abjured resort to such sources. The Tribunal is constrained to conclude, however, that IPTL\u2019s evidence in response, consisting of an expert estimate of the actual cost of building the project in issue, is equally flawed, both in concept and in execution.\n\n87.\n\nTANESCO rightly points out that the best evidence of actual costs would presumably be found in Stork-Wartsila\u2019s own EPC construction records. Although Stork-Wartsila \u2022 is not a party to this arbitration, the fact that, as IPTL has advised us, Stork-Wartsila is still owed in excess of $28 million in EPC Contract payments (including claimed interest), has previously collaborated with IPTL\u2019s parent company as a potential joint venturer on the project, and apparently had made some documents available to IPTL for use in this arbitration (including for the use of its cost estimation expert, Mr Chambless) at least raises a question as to why its construction cost documentation was not supplied to the Tribunal. The Tribunal does not go so far, however, on the record before it, as to draw any inferences in this regard, for which TANESCO in any event has not specifically asked. The fact remains, nonetheless, that the evidence presented by IPTL is essentially of an expert nature.\n\n88.\n\nThat evidence consists of three affidavits, supplemented by testimony at the hearing, from Mr Donald L Chambless of R.W. Beck International Ltd. (\"R.W. Beck\"). Essentially, Mr Chambless led a team, other members of which visited the site at Tegeta, that gathered various data on the basis of which it concluded that Stork-Wartsila\u2019s EPC price of about $114 million was a \"fair price\" and \"reasonable\". It is notable, however, that in pricing all construction items, apart from \"historical data\" and \"our experience in estimating projects of this type for over forty years\", the team relied on reference works such as R.S. Means Construction Cost Data and Richardson Engineering Service Inc.\u2019s Process Plant Construction Estimating Standards, which it was agreed are sourced only from United States experience and information. The relevance of those reference works to a project in Tanzania is debatable, and indeed has been vigorously contested. The fact that R.W. Beck has relied on these same authorities in evaluating 40 or so projects outside the United States for prospective lenders poses questions as to the identity and nationality of the lenders, the extent to which the projects evaluated were sourced in the United States and how linked the projects otherwise were to the United States. Regardless of the answers to those questions, such reference works alone cannot be authoritative as regards the Stork-Wartsila EPC contract for Tegeta. The force of this testimony was further reduced by a few admitted mistakes, and in particular, the admitted reliance on multiple hearsay for the price of the turbines, the largest single element of the EPC.\n\n89.\n\nAfter detailed cross-examination of the respective experts concerning the projects upon which they relied, on the one hand, and their estimates, on the other, it appeared that many apparent marked differences among projects could be explained by the sorts of factors outlined in paragraph 80 above. The broad conclusion of the Tribunal is to the effect that, generally speaking, medium speed diesel engine facilities tend to be less expensive than low speed diesel engine facilities, and that the EPC Contract price agreed between IPTL\u2019s agents and Stork-Wartsila, while not wholly out of line with other projects, when appropriate adjustments had been made, looked to be \"on the high side\".\n\n90.\n\nTurning to what we regard as the more relevant evidence as to the process whereby the EPC Contract came to be awarded to Stork-Wartsila at the price agreed, IPTL employed KTA Tenaga to prepare the project specifications, and to prepare and review tender and bid documents.\n\n91.\n\nKTA Tenaga submitted preliminary tender documents to a number of potential bidders in October 1994, as a result of which preliminary price quotations were received from Stork-Wartsila, Hyundai and MAN B & W. Stork-Wartsila quoted US$53,058,000 for the supply of 11 x SW 38 medium speed diesel engines only. MAN B & W quoted DM154,175,000 (approximately US$102 million) for a plant using 9 x 92 58/64 medium speed diesel engines. Hyundai quoted US$99,705,000 for a plant using 5 x Hyundai - MAN B & W low speed engines, or alternatively US$91,099,000 for 8 x medium speed engines (a difference of approximately US$8.6 million).\n\n92.\n\nFurther revised tender documents were submitted to a number of potential bidders in June 1995. It was not suggested that the list of addressees was insufficient or that there was any obvious omission from it. Stork-Wartsila, Hyundai and MAN B & W again submitted bids. According to the bid documents, the Stork-Wartsila bid was for a total price of US$124,078,200, including a provisional sum of US$17,000,000 for conversion to natural gas firing. Hyundai's bid was for a total price of US$141,472,350, which included US$29,071,800 for gas conversion. MAN B & W\u2019s bid, which was now for 6 x 48/60 series engines, was for a total price of US$114,306,671 including US$7,857,000 for gas conversion. Some of the figures quoted in KTA Tenaga's Tender Summary Sheet are slightly different, but the differences are not significant. It should be mentioned that Stork-Wartsila's bid provided for completion in 14 months, whereas Hyundai's bid was for completion in 22 months.\n\n93.\n\nIt was appreciated that the time factor and cost of gas conversion made the Hyundai bid uncompetitive, and in August 1995 Hyundai wrote putting forward an alternative proposal to use dual fuel engines. On 14 September 1995 Stork-Wartsila submitted a revised price schedule, in which it was said that the price for gas conversion had been reduced to US$11.5 million, and that it generally reflected a reduction in price of about 5%. This revised price schedule was presented at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, at which the possible joint venture or \"Construction Consortium\" division of work between Stork-Wartsila and Mechmar was discussed. The total price then proposed was Dfl.170, 221,875, being the equivalent of US$104,430,280, of which Stork-Wartsila's share of the works totalled Dfl. 148,123,793.\n\n94.\n\nIn December 1995 KTA Tenaga produced a detailed \"Tender Adjudication Report\", the version in the arbitration file being dated 29 December 1995, which summarised what were described as the final tender prices, in US dollars, as follows:\n\n**Stork-Wartsila** US$ 103,470,000 (without gas conversion)\n\nUS$114,990,000 (including gas conversion)\n\n**Hyundai** US$ 117,566,100 (without gas conversion)\n\nUS$126,788,900 (including gas conversion)\n\n**MAN B & W** US$106,449,671 (without gas conversion)\n\nUS$114,306,371 (including gas conversion)\n\nKTA Tenaga made a Preliminary Evaluation of the three tenders, in which points were allocated for technical compliance with the tender documents, commercial terms, completion time, experience and power track record, price, guarantees and O&M proposal. Of a possible 120 points, Hyundai \"scored\" 104, Stork-Wartsila 91 and MAN B & W only 55. In the Technical Evaluation, KTA Tenaga noted that Hyundai had offered slow speed diesel engines, which they observed should mean less maintenance demand, while the medium speed engines offered by Stork-Wartsila were said to have a higher fuel consumption. The time for completion quoted by Hyundai was said to be 19 months, with the first engine to be commissioned in 16 months from the date of the award of the contract, as against 15 months for Stork-Wartsila, with the first three units ready within 10 months from the award of contract, and the export of power commencing after 13 months. Under the heading of \"Experience\", KTA Tenaga commented that the W38 medium speed diesel engines offered by Stork-Wartsila were relatively new and that no W38 engine had been operated on natural gas. Despite taking account of the fact that Hyundai did not seem to have had adequate experience of working in Tanzania, under the general heading of \"Experience\" Hyundai was rated marginally higher.\n\n95.\n\nKTA Tenaga's \"Conclusions\" include the observation:\n\n...It is apparent that [Hyundai] has given the most attractive techno commercial offer....\n\nWith regard to the slow speed engines offered by Hyundai, KTA Tenaga observed that, because of their lower running speed, the wear and tear on the engines and parts should be lower, leading to a more lasting engine, and that the level of sophistication of the slow speed engine was much lower than that of the medium speed engine, thus leading to lower maintenance and a lower level of technical skills to maintain the engine - an important consideration in a developing country like Tanzania. Its final \"verdict\" was encapsulated in a passage on the penultimate page:\n\nThis is the case of purchasing a cheaper plant against a technically better plant that is likely to perform reliably in the long run.\n\n96.\n\nThus far, there would seem to be no basis for criticising the conduct of IPTL or its agents, although, against this background, it may be thought odd that on 29 December 1995, Mechmar wrote a \"STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL\" letter to Stork-Wartsila expressing Mechmar's interest to work with Stork-Wartsila for the Tegeta project. But it was made clear in the letter that there was no legally binding commitment.\n\n97.\n\nIt was the developments in the last stage of the evaluation of the bids and the award of the contract which were particularly criticised by TANESCO. KTA Tenaga met with Hyundai on 15 and 16 January 1996, following which Hyundai submitted a revised tender on 22 January, reducing its price, including gas conversion, by approximately US$10million to US$116,610,400. On 17 January 1996, KTA Tenaga also met with Stork-Wartsila, which on 22 January 1996 submitted a revised tender in the sum of US$114,188,500 (excluding gas conversion of US$11,543,000), and a total including gas conversion of US$125,731,500. Thus, on pricing, the relative position as between Stork-Wartsila and Hyundai had been suddenly and dramatically reversed. As a result of Hyundai's reduction in price of approximately US$10million and Stork-Wartsila's increase of approximately US$10.7million, the Hyundai bid was now approximately US$9million cheaper.\n\n98.\n\nKTA Tenaga produced a further \"Tender Adjudication Report\" in January 1996, which largely reproduced its December Report, but which omitted much of the detailed discussion in the \"Conclusions\" to which we have referred, and simply concluded \"From the technical evaluation both of the offers are equivalent\". Significantly it omitted all discussion of price. On the second page of the Introduction, it is stated:\n\nThis report concerns the technical aspects of the two submission [sic] and clarification but does not include the economic/financial aspects which Mechmar Corporation has instructed that they are conducted by Fieldstone Private Capital Group.\n\nAs such, this Report cannot make a complete recommendation for Contract Award which is the responsibility of Mechmar Corporation to combine the technical and financial reports before deciding on the Award.\n\nThere is no document in the file containing Fieldstone's economic/financial analysis, and in his oral evidence, in answer to questions from the Tribunal, Mr Willy Lim, the Managing Director of Fieldstone, confirmed that Fieldstone had not been asked to review the financial aspects of the January bids from Stork-Wartsila and Hyundai, and played no part in the financial negotiations. Further, there is no document in the file reflecting Mechmar's decision or recommendation to IPTL.\n\n99.\n\nIt is the view of the Tribunal that, against the background that in December 1995 IPTL's technical consultants, KTA Tenaga, had advised that the Hyundai proposal was \"a technically better plant that is likely to perform reliably in the long run\", the undocumented decision to award the EPC contract to Stork-Wartsila at a significantly higher price seems illogical, and raises very serious questions as to whether IPTL acted reasonably or prudently in taking the decision it did.\n\n100.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Datuk Majid, the Chairman of IPTL, put forward a number of reasons why IPTL decided to award the EPC contract to Stork-Wartsila rather than Hyundai. The Tribunal accepts that in accordance with the Stork-Wartsila bid, the engines would be \"on line\" a little earlier, but many of the other reasons put forward seem to us to be spurious. KTA Tenaga had carried out a detailed technical evaluation of the two bids, and even if one accepts the rather \"watered down\" statement in the January 1996 Report, and ignores the more detailed comparison in the December 1995 Report, it had concluded that the bids were technically \"equivalent\". The suggestion that the Hyundai revised bid was less credible because it had dropped its price by a substantial amount at the last minute is itself incredible to the Tribunal. It is readily understandable, that in the course of a competitive bidding process, especially if the competitors are aware of what others are bidding (which may or may not have been the case here), a would-be contractor will be willing to drop his price in order to secure the contract. On the other hand, one would have thought that a last minute *increase* of US$10 million in the bid price would have given more cause for concern, and would not only have raised serious questions about the reliability of Stork-Wartsila's pricing methods, but would or should have met with a considerable resistance. There is no other evidence to support the suggestion that Fieldstone had advised that the Hyundai engines would not be financeable on a limited recourse basis, and the suggestion that IPTL did not feel that it could reasonably proceed on the basis of Hyundai's dual-fuel engine proposal is simply contrary to the evidence. That was the proposal which had been evaluated by KTA Tenaga in December 1995. The \"relatively small difference in price\" to which Datuk Majid refers in paragraph 16 of his second witness statement was US$9 million, which even in percentage terms cannot sensibly be described as \"small\". It was suggested on behalf of IPTL that the, or at least a major, consideration was that the Hyundai revised proposal of January 1996 was expressed to be only valid up to 21 February 1996 \"unless otherwise mutually agreed\", whereas the contract could not have been concluded until financial close; Stork-Wartsila, on the other hand, maintained its price until the EPC Contract was eventually signed in February 1997. But Datuk Majid did not identify this in his statement as one of the reasons which had motivated IPTL at the time, and there is no evidence that IPTL or Mechmar ever went back to Hyundai to ask for its revised bid to remain open for longer. In IPTL's Post-Hearing Memorial, it is said, in paragraph 100:\n\nIPTL was unable to produce documentation which established that this $10 million increase was based on locking the price in. IPTL submits that this lack of documentation reflects bad record-keeping on this point and nothing else.\n\n101.\n\nThere is no contemporaneous document containing any explanation for the increase, nor any record of discussion either between IPTL and its advisers, or between IPTL or its advisers and Stork-Wartsila. The Tribunal does not accept that IPTL has demonstrated any sufficient reason for choosing the Stork-Wartsila bid. It is said that the lenders and lenders\u2019 engineers accepted the price as reasonable for the project and lent money on the basis of the US$114 million contract price. But there is no evidence that they were made aware of the fact that:\n\n(1) Stork-Wartsila's price had been revised upwards by US$ 10 million, apparently without explanation, at the last minute; or\n\n(2) That the Stork-Wartsila price was then US$9 million higher than the competitive bid from Hyundai, which IPTL's technical advisers had concluded only one month previously to be technically superior.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that on this point it was assisted by expert opinion as to whether or not the final Stork-Wartsila bid price was reasonable or unreasonable in an objective sense or, for example, as to whether or not the gas conversion process for the medium speed engines would have been more or less difficult than for the dual fuel slow speed engines offered by Hyundai. We are concerned essentially with determining whether IPTL acted reasonably and prudently in opting for Stork-Wartsila after the revised bids in January 1996. The Tribunal concludes that it did not. This constituted a breach of the term which we have held must be implied into the PPA and Addendum No. 1. It is not possible to reach any firm conclusion as to whether, if IPTL had acted reasonably and prudently, it would have accepted the Hyundai revised bid, or instead would have successfully resisted (at least substantially) Stork-Wartsila's last minute price increase. Either course would probably have passed the reasonableness and prudence test. The Tribunal must therefore adopt a \"broad brush\" approach, and concludes that, in order to compensate TANESCO for the breach, for the purposes of the adjustment of the Reference Tariff under Addendum No. 1, the EPC Contract price should be reduced by US$10 million.\n\n**B. Other issues concerning the adjustment of the Capacity Payment Element of the Reference Tariff**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Cost of Housing:**\n----------------------------\n\n103.\n\nIn relation to the EPC Contract with Wartsila, TANESCO raises the further specific point that IPTL was in breach of its duty to act reasonably and prudently by failing to take any steps to procure a reduction in price based on the reduced scope of housing built. In doing so, it relies on the following facts:\n\nThe housing specification required the EPC contractor to build at least a total of 37 units, including 6 single storey semi-detached houses, 30 units of single storey houses and one unit 1 1/2-storey clubhouse and facilities. This did not change. Item 26 of Wartsila's Final Tender Price of 22 January 1996 provided the basis for the EPC Contract and included the sum of US$7,566,000 for \"Provisional Items as specified in Section 3.7.16. Staff Housing for Residential Staff and Executive Staff'. However, the EPC Contract signed on 4 February 1997 provided that the housing scheme should consist of only 6 units of single-storey semi-detached houses, and 4 units of single-storey bungalows. According to the evidence of Mr Lippert, the value of the houses actually built was only approximately US$780,000;0 IPTL puts the value at approximately US$1.7 million.\n\n104.\n\nIn IPTL's Counter-Memorial it was said that IPTL determined that the cost associated with the housing project was too high and therefore decided to limit the size of the project. But if that were done before the specification was changed in the EPC Contract of 4 February 1997, as it seems it must have been, one asks rhetorically: Why was the price not changed? In his oral evidence, Datuk Majid emphasised that this was just a provisional sum, and that the housing was never completed because of TANESCO\u2019s Notice of Default. But this appears not to have been the case. The limited number of houses specified in the 4 February 1997 EPC Contract were built. But even if Datuk Majid's evidence was correct, then the provisional sum stated in the Tender and included in the contract price should be correspondingly reduced. The Tribunal concludes that, for the purpose of the adjustment under Addendum No. 1, the EPC Contract price should be reduced by a further sum of US$6 million.\n\n**(2) Development Costs:**\n--------------------------\n\n**(a) Staff and Management Costs:**\n-----------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIPTL claims to have incurred US$6,238,000 as \"Development Costs\", compared with the US$4,800,000 estimated in May 1995, and which included US$5,385,000, stated to be \"Staff and Management Costs\". In response to TANESCO\u2019s enquiry, these were said to be the costs charged by Mechmar to IPTL for four years of work performed by Mechmar's directors and employees. When asked for a breakdown by reference to the individuals concerned, the nature of their work and the amounts billed in respect of each individual, IPTL claimed to have been unable to provide any such breakdown.\n\n106.\n\nThe loan drawdown documents which were produced by IPTL show two payments made respectively to \"Omni Technical Management Establishment\" (\"OTME\") and \"Prime Consolidated Establishment\" (\"PCE\") which together totalled US$5,350,000. Mechmar's accountant had submitted a letter to the lenders in support of a drawdown payment in July 1997, stating that the payments were supported by a Sale and Purchase Agreement between IPTL and OTME for project development services, and a further agreement between IPTL and Aeromore Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd. (\"ACMSB\") and a further agreement between ACMSB and PCE, for the provision of financial services. TANESCO asked for copies of these agreements and was eventually informed by counsel for IPTL on 9 December 1999:\n\nThe payments to OMNI Technical Management and Prime Consolidated Management were not payments pursuant to contracts or invoices. Rather, they were inter-company transfers and funds between Mechmar and its subsidiaries. The transfers had no relevance to the IPTL project, and neither OME nor PCE were involved with the IPTL project.\n\nIn the course of the hearings in March 2000, Counsel for IPTL confirmed that, according to his instructions and despite the statement of Mechmar's accountants referred to above, there were no documents and no agreements. A statement from Mechmar's Chairman, Mr Tan Kean Wan, dated 27 March 2000, explained that amounts paid by Mechmar to its management and staff as well as to \"consultants and vendors\" were financed by borrowings from OMTE and PCE pursuant to the agreement referred to in the accountant\u2019s letter. His statement refers to staff and management costs totalling 13,676,845 Malaysian Ringgits (which appears to be a precisely calculated figure), but no documents have been provided in support.\n\n107.\n\nTANESCO suggests that the figures claimed were simply invented, and the alleged agreements fabricated. It further contends that the amount of staff and management costs claimed is so large as to \"bend credulity\". Based on the evidence of TANESCO\u2019s \"expert\" Dr Swales, it is suggested that a reasonable amount to allow, using the rates which Mechmar is said to have charged for its management and staff, being 250 Malaysian Ringgits (US$ 100) per man-hour for director level and 150 Ringgits Malaysian (US$60) per hour for associate and analyst level, would be US$1,280,000.\n\n108.\n\nIt is worth mentioning at this stage that Dr Swales of Acres was presented to the Tribunal as an expert witness. He is no doubt a great expert in his field, with considerable experience of international projects of this kind. But he was very much involved with this project at the material time as consultant to TANESCO and the Government of Tanzania. He was not favourably disposed to the IPTL project, considering it to be unnecessary and undesirable in the light of the rival SONGAS project, and he represented TANESCO in negotiations which took place in 1998. It could not be suggested that he was an independent or disinterested expert. Indeed, he was clearly a partisan witness who viewed matters through \"TANESCO-coloured spectacles\", and whilst the Tribunal pays due regard to his opinions, clearly in these circumstances they have to be weighed with some caution. As he frankly conceded in cross-examination, he was doing his best to support his client\u2019s case.\n\n109.\n\nIPTL submits that Mr Tan's explanation concerning the involvement of OTME and PCE should be accepted, especially since he was present during each day of the hearings but no request was made to cross-examine him on this point; that the development costs claimed are in line with industry norms; and that since the lenders accepted the claimed development costs as part of the project cost, TANESCO should do likewise.\n\n110.\n\nThis last submission of course misses the point that the payment by the lenders was itself based on the accountant\u2019s statement to which we have referred. The fact is that no documents have been produced to support the figure claimed. The burden must be on IPTL to establish that the development costs which it claims to have incurred and which were greater than those estimated at the time the PPA was concluded were in fact incurred. The burden of proof may then shift to TANESCO to establish on the basis of the documents and other evidence, including expert opinion, that they were not incurred reasonably or prudently. It was pointed out by Dr Swales in cross-examination that the \"Development Costs\" in relation to the neighbouring Kipevu II project, which TANESCO relied on in its extensive study of comparable projects for purposes of trying to establish the unreasonableness of the EPC Contract, were US$6.1 million, which is very much in line with the sum claimed in this case. But as Dr Swales also pointed out, \"Development Costs\" may vary considerably from one project to another, depending, amongst other things, on how much work is done \"in-house\".\n\n111.\n\nTaking all these considerations into account, the Tribunal concludes that a reasonable figure for staff and management costs is US$2.5 million.\n\n**(b) Interest Charges and Related Legal Fees:**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe sum of US$294,525.28 is said by IPTL to have been incurred as interest charges, being part of its Development Costs; and a further US$59,157.25, out of total legal fees of US$129,519.68, were claimed as legal fees in connection with various bank loans.\n\n113.\n\nTANESCO challenges these figures on the basis that there is no evidence to link the loans or the interest or legal charges to the IPTL project, other than from Kassim Chan, the accounting firm who confirmed the payments to OTME and PCE, which we have dealt with above. TANESCO further poses the question: If Mechmar borrowed US$5,385,000 from OTME and PCE (as was claimed), why did it need to borrow from banks?\n\n114.\n\nIn relation to the interest charges, IPTL conceded in its Post-Hearing Memorial that, since it was deriving a return from the equity, interest charges relating to the raising of that equity should be for its account, and agreed to omit this figure from the final financial model. Logically, the legal fees in connection with the loans must also be omitted, bringing the legal fees down to US$70,362.20. This reduced figure is, as we understand it, accepted by TANESCO as part of legitimate \"Development Costs\", as is the cost of technical and financial advisers, being US$135,741.74 and US$45,472.44 respectively, lenders' \"due diligence\" in the sum of US$122,382, and \"Miscellaneous\" of US$12,105.91.\n\n**(c) Travel Costs**\n--------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe last point on which TANESCO takes issue in relation to the claimed \"Development Costs\" is the sum of US$169,209 claimed as travel reimbursement. Again, no underlying invoices or vouchers have been made available to TANESCO, or indeed to the Tribunal. TANESCO contends that in these circumstances these costs should be wholly disallowed. IPTL points out that the project was an international one, being developed between Tanzania and Malaysia with the main contractor located in The Netherlands. A considerable amount of travel was clearly involved, and it is not suggested that the sum claimed (which was accepted by the auditors) was unreasonably incurred. In addition to the general point, TANESCO contends that a small portion of the travel cost claimed, amounting in total to US$12,913, related to travel to India, Burma, Thailand and Uganda, and would appear to have nothing whatever to do with the IPTL project. IPTL contends that these reflected part of the project development efforts. It is a small sum, and taking account of this, and in the absence of detailed evidence, the Tribunal allows US$150,000.\n\n**(d) Summary**\n---------------\n\n116.\n\nIn these circumstances, the total to be allowed in respect of Development Costs is as follows:\n\nUS$\n\nStaff and Management Costs 2,500,000.00\n\nInterest Nil\n\nLegal fees 70,362.20\n\nTechnical advisers 135,741.74\n\nFinancial Advisers 45,472.44\n\nLenders \"Due Diligence\" 122,382.00\n\nTravel Reimbursement 150,000.00\n\nMiscellaneous 12,105.91\n\nTotal US$3,036,064.29\n\nThus, in respect of this aspect of the cost, the 1998 figure of US$6,238,000 put forward by IPTL falls to be adjusted downwards by approximately US$3.2 million, and in consequence the May 1995 figure falls to be adjusted downwards by approximately US$1.8 million.\n\n**(3) The Cost of Raising Equity:**\n-----------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThis item comprises sums paid to consultants, banks and legal advisers by way of fees in relation to the raising of the necessary finance for its 30% equity contribution through a term loan and \"rights\" issue. As Dr Swales pointed out, under the PPA, IPTL was obliged to fund and maintain a 30% equity participation in the project, which suggests that the costs of and associated with the raising of that equity contribution should not be regarded as part of the project costs.\n\n118.\n\nIPTL's response is that the agreed internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 22.31 % was to be a \"net\" return, so that if IPTL had to raise funds to finance its equity contribution and to pay fees and expenses in relation to such financing, these should be taken into account.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that in respect of this item, IPTL's contention is wrong in principle. The PPA required IPTL to finance the project as to 30% with its own equity \"contribution\", the remaining 70% being by way of loans. The underlying assumption was that the 30% would be contributed by IPTL. Whether it did so by using its own capital or by way of a \"rights\" issue or bank loan is not in the view of the Tribunal properly to be regarded as part of the project cost to be taken into account for the purposes of arriving at the agreed IRR.\n\n120.\n\nTANESCO is, properly in our view, prepared to allow project advisors' fees, such as an invoice from Long & Co relating to legal advice and project documentation, as well as the fees paid to Fieldstone, which was agreed at 1% of the project debt. According to IPTL, the financial model for determining the Reference Tariff is geared to adjust the amount of Fieldstone's fee automatically, depending on the Tribunal's decision on the amount of reasonably-incurred total project cost.\n\n**(4) KTA Tenaga's Costs:**\n---------------------------\n\n121.\n\nIPTL has claimed that it paid KTA Tenaga the equivalent of a total of US$2,559,055 for \"consultancy services\" during the project-implementation stage from July 1997 to June 1998. It is not disputed that IPTL had a commitment to pay this sum (as to 25% on appointment and the balance over 12 instalments) nor that it was in fact paid. But TANESCO, again relying on the opinion evidence of Dr Swales, suggests that the sum is \"exorbitant\". Dr Swales would only be prepared to allow US$610,000 as a reasonable sum.\n\n122.\n\nTANESCO points to the fact that Stork-Wartsila was engaged as the EPC contractor, and that, as such, Wartsila's tasks would have included the design, engineering, procurement, construction, installation, testing and commissioning of the power station. Furthermore, KTA Tenaga was apparently paid the sum of US$124,016 in 1995, plus travel expenses of US$11,726, for its involvement in the initial feasibility study and the obtaining of approvals. Finally, it was pointed out that IPTL paid US$84,791 to Messrs Bums & McDonnell as engineering consultants to the lenders, for \"construction progress review\", and claims to have paid a further US$354,177 to KTA Tenaga for the services of engineers, resident site staff and related expenses.\n\n123.\n\nIPTL responded to these points quite briefly, contending that KTA Tenaga's fees of less than 3% of the contract price were \"within industry norms\", and criticising Dr Swales for providing no basis for his opinion that their fees should have been lower.\n\n124.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal is faced with the problem of a \"yawning\" gap between the parties' respective positions, with a lack of sufficient documentation to assist in resolving the conflict. In particular, two letters which are specifically referred to in KTA Tenaga's invoice cannot apparently be located.\n\n125.\n\nThis may be another example of where IPTL must take the consequences of its apparently inadequate system of collecting and retaining documents. It appreciated and indeed acknowledged that at the end of the day it would have to justify its costs and expenses as not only having been incurred, but as having been incurred reasonably and prudently. However, again the Tribunal considers that Dr Swales' notional figures for \"reasonable and prudent costs\" seem too low, and thinks it appropriate to reduce IPTL\u2019s claim to US$1.75 million.\n\n**(5) Land Costs:**\n-------------------\n\n126.\n\nIPTL has claimed the \"round\" figure of US$1 million in respect of its expenditure in the acquisition of land. It claims to have provided documentary evidence to TANESCO of expenditures totalling 389,284,647 Tanzanian Shillings (the equivalent, at the exchange rate of 600 Tsh = 1 US$, of US$648,807), and to have provided evidence to substantiate its claim that it has been required to reserve a further 2,978,571 Tanzanian Shillings (said to be the equivalent of US$276,666) in respect of disputes and court proceedings with landowners. A list of the payments made appears in the documents but it is said it was thought prudent to reserve a further 100 million Tanzanian Shillings (the equivalent of US$166,666) against potential further litigation. All this is said to total US$1,092,139.\n\n127.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal finds it difficult to follow IPTL\u2019s submissions and calculations in relation to the relevant document at page I 0785-6 (JA 323). The 389,284,647 Tanzanian Shillings expended seems clear. But the further sum of 2,978,571 Tanzanian Shillings does not appear to be described as a reserve at all, but rather the total of sums which have been paid to the Ministry of Land. Furthermore, at the exchange rate of 600 Tsh = 1 US$, this would amount to only about US$5,000. The sum for \"contingent liabilities\" is said to be 166,000,000 Tanzanian Shillings (which at the same exchange rate would amount to US$276,666) which does not appear in IPTL's calculations on page 91 of its Post-Hearing Memorial. The total figure stated in the relevant document said to reflect \"Payments made by IPTL in connection with Project Site Land Compensation, Right of Way etc\" is 655,284,649 Tanzanian Shillings, which reflects the US$l,092,140-odd claimed.\n\n128.\n\nDr Swales, in this case as in others, seeming to adopt the position of advocate rather than expert, states that the documents do not support a total expenditure of US$1,000,000. According to him, 266,000,000 Tanzanian Shillings of the money allocated to land acquisition was not spent, and accordingly he reduces the land acquisition cost to US$594,000. The difference between this and the sum of US$648,807 may be due in whole or in part to the fact that Dr Swales employs a different exchange rate.\n\n129.\n\nA total of this item is not dealt with specifically either in TANESCO's Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff or in its Post-Hearing Memorial, which suggests that it does not set much store by it. In any event, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is any basis on the evidence to reduce the figure of US$1 million.\n\n**(6) US$300,000 Transferred to Omni Management Services Esp:**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIPTL claimed an equity contribution in relation to this payment, made by transfer to a bank account in Liechtenstein. TANESCO points out that it is wholly unsupported by any invoice or any documentation linking it to the IPTL project. IPTL concedes the point and has agreed to make an appropriate deduction in the final financial model for determining the Reference Tariff.\n\n**(7) Insurance:**\n------------------\n\n131.\n\nAccording to TANESCO, there is a dispute concerning \"Lenders' Risk\" insurance, which IPTL's lenders required IPTL to maintain until the final 24 months before the loan was repaid. It was common ground that the PPA requires TANESCO to pay for risk insurance obligations imposed on IPTL by its lenders. According to Dr Swales, the IPTL financial model reflects a declining cost for this insurance over the 5 years of cover, being the maximum duration for which it would be quoted. Thereafter, it assumes that the premium remains fixed for the rest of the project. Dr Swales, supported in this aspect of his evidence by Mr Matthews, contends that the obligation. should end at the end of the sixth year when the obligations imposed by the lenders come to an end. Mr Willy Lim of Fieldstone contends that these \"sovereign risk\" insurance premiums properly apply to both the debt and equity financing of the project, since it is required not only by the lenders but also by the equity investors. He contends that insurance is reasonable and customary for the cost to be included as part of the project costs for the duration of the project for tariff calculation purposes.\n\n132.\n\nThis issue will not affect the tariff for the first few years, but in the view of the Tribunal Mr Lim is probably correct and the appropriate premiums should be taken into account. Dr Swales does make what seems to us to be a valid point that when the seventh year is reached, that part of the financing covered by the loans will have been repaid and need not be covered by insurance. Furthermore, the premiums might properly take account of the declining value of the plant. The Tribunal makes no deduction in respect of this item, but expects the parties to take these observations into account in due course.\n\n**(8) Exchange Rates:**\n-----------------------\n\n133.\n\nTANESCO asserts that for the purposes of calculating its equity in the project, IPTL has used a constant exchange rate of 2.54 Malaysian Ringgits to the US Dollar, whereas the actual exchange rate on the date for each of the nine drawdowns on the project loan was greater than 2.54. This is said to have resulted in an overstatement of IPTL's equity contribution by US$1,373,117.\n\n134.\n\nIPTL contends that TANESCO's assertion is misconceived, and denies having used the wrong exchange rates. The bulk of the equity contributions in dispute relate to the disbursement of development expenses and other project expenses prior to the financial closing of the project. From the first quarter of 1994 to the second quarter of 1997, Dollar/Ringgit exchange rates fluctuated very little (being in the range 2.4373 to 2.6885). The lenders and the auditors accepted a flat rate over the period of 2.54, being an approximate average of these rates.\n\n135.\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal concludes that IPTL is right in principle, and that TANESCO's complaint is not justified.\n\n**(9) Mobilisation:**\n---------------------\n\n136.\n\nDr Swales contended that, although the figure for mobilisation costs of US$ 1,394 million (or US$1.4 million in round terms) should be allowable, it should be fed into the financial model as having been incurred in the 5 months before the start of commercial operations as specified in the O&M Agreement.\n\n137.\n\nIPTL concedes this point, and has agreed to adjust the financial model accordingly.\n\n**(10) Fuel Oil Reserve:**\n--------------------------\n\n138.\n\nDr Swales contends that the amount taken for the fuel oil reserve, namely US$3,249,000 is excessive and unnecessary, being based on the assumption that all the fuel oil tanks at the site were or would be full. Dr Swales suggests that when the power station is operating, TANESCO will continue to generate its \"base-load\" energy requirements by means of its hydro power capacity, and that the Tegeta plant will be used in its early years, if at all, to meet short term \"peak\" demand. As a result, to assume that all three 5,000 metric tonne tanks will be filled to capacity, which would provide 30 days operation at 100% capacity, is unrealistic and unreasonable. Dr Swales considers that it would be sufficient to keep only one of the three tanks full, and to transport additional fuel as and when necessary from the additional 15,000 metric tonnes which IPTL is required to keep available at Dar-es-Salaam.\n\n139.\n\nDr Swales also disputes the amount of US$556,000 allowed in the model for industrial diesel oil - a type of fuel which, according to Dr Swales, TANESCO was never advised was needed at the plant.\n\n140.\n\nIPTL contends that, under the PPA, IPTL is obliged to maintain the capacity to utilise the plant fully if called upon by TANESCO to do so. Unless and until that requirement is amended, a reserve of 30 days fuel at full capacity is reasonable. Dr Swales' speculation as to the extent to which TANESCO will make use of the available power is irrelevant. The Tribunal tends to agree. With regard to the industrial diesel oil, IPTL contends that the reserve included is a manufacturers' recommendation. On this point, too, TANESCO fails.\n\n**(11) Maintenance Reserve:**\n-----------------------------\n\n141.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial, IPTL states that it agrees with Dr Swales\u2019 comments relating to this issue, and that the financial model has been adjusted to take account of that agreement. In these circumstances, it appears to be unnecessary for the Tribunal to deal with this matter further.\n\n**(12) Gas Conversion:**\n------------------------\n\n142.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff, TANESCO complained that ITL, in its 1998 financial model, had departed from the agreement made in May 1995 that the assumed cost of gas conversion (US$11,543,000) was to be financed as to 70% by debt and 30% by equity, and unilaterally established a Gas Equipment Reserve to be funded through the tariff from the outset.\n\n143.\n\nTANESCO contends that the cost of gas conversion should not be included in the tariff unless and until conversion takes place, and that, if and when such conversion occurs, IPTL is obliged to fund the conversion cost in the proportions set out above.\n\n144.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial, IPTL states that the parties have agreed on a mechanism with respect to the funding of gas conversion, which is reflected in the agreed-upon financial model. Again, it seems that no further action from the Tribunal is called for.\n\n**9. Was IPTL in breach of an implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to the procurement of the Fuel Supply Agreement (\"FSA\"), and if so, what are the consequences?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already explained in outline above, one of the elements in the purchase price and therefore the tariff in respect of power supplied pursuant to the PPA was the Energy Purchase Price, which included a Fuel Cost Component, which was subject to escalation under Appendix B, Clause 9.1(a) of the PPA on the basis of changes in fuel prices.\n\n146.\n\nIn the light of these provisions, and insofar as IPTL was responsible for making the necessary contractual arrangements to obtain fuel, the price of which would be reflected in any such escalation, TANESCO contended that IPTL was under an implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in performing that function. By parity of reasoning to that adopted in relation to the interpretation of Addendum No. 1, considered as part of its Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, the Tribunal accepts this submission.\n\n147.\n\nThe contest between the parties therefore involved a determination whether the arrangements made by IPTL satisfied these requirements.\n\n148.\n\nIn its Memorial and Submissions on Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law TANESCO submitted that by reason of the alleged breach of IPTL's obligations in this regard, the Tribunal should declare \"that IPTL is not entitled to base the Fuel Cost Component of the final Reference Tariff on the contract obtained by it for the supply of fuel\". The Tribunal was also invited to declare that IPTL may not \"pass-on\" any damages for its breach.\n\n149.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial TANESCO appeared to change its position somewhat by seeking instead damages. The measure of damages it has submitted should be the difference expressed in dollars per tonne between the reasonable price and the price specified in the fuel contract - \"TANESCO should receive a reduction in its monthly tariff'.\n\n150.\n\nIPTL, as buyer, entered into the FSA bearing the date 21 May 1997, with Galana Petroleum Limited (\"Galana\") and Total International Limited (\"Total\") as sellers. The FSA provided for an initial term of 5 years, with an option for a further 5 years on the same terms and conditions and, thereafter the parties were required to negotiate in good faith for any further period.\n\n151.\n\nThe complaints of TANESCO in relation to the provisions of the FSA were threefold. First, the process whereby the successful contractor was identified was flawed. Second, the cost of fuel was based on the Singapore rather than the Arab Gulf spot market. Third, the charges for freight, depot throughput, storage and trucking were excessive.\n\n152.\n\nTANESCO's case rested on the evidence of Mr William Matthews, an energy consultant. Mr Matthews of course was not involved in the negotiation of the FSA.\n\n153.\n\nThe criticism that TANESCO levelled against the commercial reasonableness of the FSA was blunted by two factors. First, Mr Matthews was unable to point to any independent power project in Africa which was obtaining fuel under a long term contract on better terms and conditions than those provided under the FSA. Second, not only was there no evidence that anyone else was willing and available to supply the fuel at a better price and on better conditions than Galana and Total, but, on the contrary, on the unchallenged factual evidence, TANESCO had sought tenders from all the recognised major fuel suppliers in the region, none of whom, with the exception of Galana and Total, was interested enough to tender for the FSA.\n\n154.\n\nIPTL, for its part, relied largely on the evidence of Mr Donald Wessel who also was not involved in the negotiation of the FSA. Mr Wessel gave a number of persuasive explanations for the lack of interest by potential suppliers, which can be summarised as follows:.\n\n(1) TANESCO was not required by the PPA to purchase any electricity at all. For this reason, the project would have been viewed as having a low probability of success and the contract as a \"high risk\" one.\n\n(2) The FSA gave a fuel supplier no assurance that it would be called upon to supply a single barrel of fuel oil to the project but it does obligate the supplier to provide fuel oil if and when called upon by IPTL under a set of terms and conditions including a rigid price formula over a 5 year period regardless of any future developments in the market place.\n\n(3) The PPA contemplated that the project might change to natural gas at any time at the option of TANESCO, at which point the FSA would have been have been of no value to the supplier.\n\n155.\n\nThere is no doubt that the price provided for the fuel, the cost of freight and other charges under the FSA are higher than those quoted on the spot market at the time, as demonstrated by Mr Matthews' evidence. The difficulty with his argument, however, is that reliance upon the spot market, by way of comparison to a long term supply contract, was simply commercially unrealistic. The Tribunal concludes that, although the apparent reasonableness or otherwise of the terms of the FSA may be highly relevant as evidence of the extent to which IPTL acted reasonably and prudently in procuring the FSA on the terms it did, the question at the end of the day remains whether, with greater efforts, it could have procured the supply of fuel on better terms. We conclude that IPTL was obliged to accept the terms of the one and only supplier willing to tender for a long term supply contract.\n\n156.\n\nTANESCO submitted that in the absence of full disclosure of all relevant documents it was impossible to form a conclusion that the FSA was the only or the best deal available. It was pointed out that none of the representatives of KTA Tenaga, Fieldstone or Long & Co., who were charged with the responsibility for negotiating with the suppliers, testified that Galana and Total were the only parties interested in bidding on the FSA. The Tribunal has carefully considered the argument that in the absence of further material no conclusion could be formed that the FSA was indeed a contract that a reasonable and prudent purchaser would have entered into. However in the absence of any evidence whatsoever of the availability of any other potential long term supplier the Tribunal rejects the claim by TANESCO that IPTL had breached its implied duty.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that under Article 2.4 of the FSA, the agreement was to lapse if notice for the first delivery thereunder were not given within 3 years from the date of the agreement, or such other date as may be agreed. We do not know what if any further agreement or discussions may have taken place between IPTL and Galana and Total, but it may be that TANESCO\u2019s complaints regarding the terms of the FSA may have become academic.\n\n**10. Waiver/estoppel.**\n------------------------\n\n158.\n\nIPTL contends that TANESCO waived or should be estopped from exercising any right to question the reasonableness or prudence of its conduct in relation to the costs of the project. As we understand it, the point is put in three ways. First, if there is an implied obligation on the part of IPTL to act reasonably and prudently in relation to the contract awarded and costs incurred (as the Tribunal has held), there must be a concomitant obligation on the part of TANESCO to exercise its right to object within such time as IPTL could reasonably have acted upon such objection. Second, TANESCO \"elected\" to accept the EPC Contract price by not objecting to the cost and through the confirmation by the Government of Tanzania of its support for the project provided the tariff would be around 10 US cents per kWh. Third, TANESCO should be estopped by acquiescence and/or convention because, with full knowledge of the EPC Contract price, it stood by without comment or protest as IPTL formally entered into the EPC contract with Wartsila and procured the building of the power station.\n\n159.\n\nIPTL was no doubt encouraged to raise these pleas by the fact that, in our Decision on Preliminary Issues of Construction Law, the Tribunal indicated that on the material then available it would have been inclined to the view that TANESCO would have been precluded, by estoppel by convention or acquiescence from raising objection to.. the change from low speed to medium speed diesel engines.\n\n160.\n\nBut in the view of the Tribunal, there are crucial differences between the issue addressed in that Decision and the issues now falling to be determined. It is \"hornbook\" law that it is a pre-requisite to the operation of doctrines of election, waiver or estoppel that the party said to have elected or waived or to be estopped had full relevant knowledge at the material time. If the complaint were that the EPC Contract price was unreasonable per se, then one could see some force in the argument. But the implied term as found by us and which is said to have been broken by IPTL was an obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to any agreement with a third party which would have had an effect on the extent of TANESCO's obligation to reimburse IPTL through the tariff payment. Although IPTL challenges TANESCO's assertion that it deliberately withheld relevant documentation, it cannot be suggested that TANESCO possessed full knowledge of all the details of the bidding process which the Tribunal has sought to analyse in its consideration of the reasonableness or otherwise of the decision to award the EPC Contract to Wartsila at the price agreed. Indeed, much of the detail emerged for the first time in the course of the arbitration.\n\n161.\n\nFurthermore, insofar as IPTL seeks to rely on the support given to the project by the Government of Tanzania, we do not consider for these purposes the Government and TANESCO should be identified the one with the other. In any event, the Government of Tanzania was in no better position than was TANESCO to form a judgment. Its relevant knowledge was no greater.\n\n162.\n\nFinally, as TANESCO points out, despite its lack of detailed knowledge, concern was expressed from time to time within Tanzania about the cost of the project, and IPTL acknowledged more than once that the appropriate time for discussing the propriety of its expenditure would be when the discussions over the adjustment of the Reference Tariff pursuant to Addendum No. 1 took place. TANESCO places particular reliance on a document published by IPTL and apparently written by Mr Rugemalira in August 1996, entitled \"The Truth about the IPTL Project\", in which it was stated:\n\nObviously IPTL will have to show and if necessary justify that the actual costs that will be used to adjust the reference tariff in order to arrive at the initial tariff were incurred in the most efficient and competitive manner.\n\n163.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there was no relevant election, waiver or estoppel.\n\n**11. What, if any, adjustments should be made to the Reference Tariff stated in the PPA?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIn the paragraphs above, the Tribunal has considered the numerous points raised by TANESCO in response to the figures put forward by IPTL as the appropriate figures to be fed into the \"financial model\" produced by Mr Lim (which we understand has now been adjusted so as to be in a form acceptable to both parties).\n\n165.\n\nIn relation to the Energy Payment, we have rejected TANESCO\u2019s complaint in relation to the terms of the FSA, so that no adjustment falls to be made by reason of IPTL\u2019s alleged unreasonableness or imprudence.\n\n166.\n\nIt was the understanding of the Tribunal that, by the time of their last exchanges, the parties were confident that, armed with the appropriate adjustments, they would be able to agree on the application of the financial model and the tariff which should be derived as a consequence. If this is not the case, or if either party wishes to have an Award which sets out the relevant calculated figure, further application must be made to the Tribunal.\n\n**12 What further orders should be made?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nAccording to the understanding of the Tribunal, both parties were agreed that, once the appropriate figures to be fed into the model had been ascertained so that the initial Reference Tariff could be calculated, steps should be taken to bring about the commencement of commercial operations.\n\n168.\n\nNeither party addressed the question of how much time would be required for this purpose, and in these circumstances, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to order that the parties should co-operate in taking whatever steps are necessary to achieve the commencement of commercial operation as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n**13. Costs:**\n--------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal received detailed submissions from the parties in relation to the apportionment of costs and the amount which should be allowed. We appreciate that, so far as the party and party costs are concerned, which reflect the very substantial amount of work done by the parties\u2019 legal representatives, as well as the substantial cost of expert and other evidence, the sums expended by the parties are considerable. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, are fortunately, somewhat more modest.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the apportionment of costs on the basis of the approach, which appeared to be common ground between the parties, that costs should follow the event. However, in this case, there was and is no one simple \"event\". The parties have each had a share of success and of failure - TANESCO being successful in resisting IPTL\u2019s application for provisional measures; IPTL being largely successful on the Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, and in particular the principal question of the validity of the Notice of Default and therefore the continuing existence of the PPA; and on the issue of bribery, which TANESCO chose to introduce at a very late stage; and TANESCO having enjoyed a substantial degree of success in relation to the tariff issues, and in particular the question of the reasonableness and/or prudence of IPTL\u2019s conduct in relation to the award of the EPC Contract.\n\n171.\n\nWe do not think that it is appropriate to make any apportionment on an \"issue-by-issue\" basis. This would require lengthy and detailed analysis which would itself be expensive, and indeed would not be possible on the material we have before us.\n\n172.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the Tribunal concludes that it would be fair to order that each party should bear its own legal and other costs, and that the costs of the arbitration should be borne as to 50% by each party.\n\n**14. Acknowledgement:**\n------------------------\n\n173.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal wishes to extend its appreciation to the legal representatives on each side for their considerable industry and assistance; and to The Centre in Washington D.C. for its efficient and very helpful administration of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on All Further Remaining Issues", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2001-05-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on All Further Remaining Issues\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn our Decision on Tariff and other Remaining. Issues dated 9 February 2001. which followed the submission of detailed written Memorials and oral submissions from both parties, the Tribunal considered and determined a number of issues, including, in particular:\n\nWhat, if any, adjustments should be made to the Reference Tariff stated in the PPA?\n\n2.\n\nWe considered this issue in Part 11 (paragraphs 164 to 166), in which we recorded our understanding that, by the time of the last exchanges between the parties, they were confident that, armed with the appropriate adjustments to take account of the specific matters referred to us, they would be able to agree on the application of the financial model and the tariff which should be derived as a consequence. However, although our Decision was intended and expressed to be final in relation to those issues with which we had dealt, we gave the parties the opportunity to make further application to the Tribunal if such agreement was not reached.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing the publication of our Decision, TANESCO raised a number of further matters going to the calculation of the Reference Tariff.\n\n4.\n\nFurther, in Part 12 of our Decision (paragraphs 167 to 168), the Tribunal recorded its understanding that both parties were agreed that, once the appropriate figures to be fed into the financial model had been ascertained so that the initial Reference Tariff could be calculated, steps should be taken to bring about the commencement of commercial operations. We noted that neither party had addressed the question of how much time would be required for this purpose, and therefore restricted ourselves at that stage to ordering the parties to co-operate in taking whatever steps would be necessary to achieve the commencement of commercial operations as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the publication of our Decision, IPTL invited the Tribunal to fix a date by which the commencement of commercial operations should be achieved.\n\n6.\n\nWritten Memorials and Reply Memorials were then submitted sequentially on behalf of the parties as follows:\n\nTANESECO\u2019s \"Memorial Regarding Remaining Tariff Issues\" dated 26 March 2001;\n\nIPTL's \"Memorial Regarding Remaining Tariff Issues\" dated 2 April 2001;\n\nTANESCO\u2019s \"Reply Memorial Regarding Remaining Tariff Issues\" dated 16 April 2001;\n\nIPTL\u2019s \"Reply Regarding Remaining Tariff Issues\" dated 20 April 2001.\n\nTANESCO submitted further evidence in the form of the Sixth and Seventh Witness Statements of Dr Martin C Swales and the Second Witness Statement of Mr Miles S Connell.\n\n7.\n\nThe following remaining issues were referred to the Tribunal for decision:\n\n(1) How the Construction Contingency Reserve should be dealt with.\n\n(2) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the figure for Sovereign Risk and other insurances?\n\n(3) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the Lenders\u2019 Participation Fee portion of \"Financing and Agency\" fees in consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions as to the deductions to be made from the claimed Project Costs.\n\n(4) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction in IPTL's deemed equity in the project?\n\n(5) What, if any, further orders should be made in relation to the Commencement of Commercial Operations?\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal was also asked to note and incorporate in its Decision and thereafter in its final Award a formal stipulation as to the agreement between the parties concluded since the last hearing concerning the Cost of Gas Conversion, to which the Tribunal had referred briefly in paragraph 144 of its Decision of 9 February 2001.\n\n9.\n\nAt the request of TANESCO, a further oral hearing before the Tribunal was held on Sunday 29 April 2001 at the offices of the World Bank in Washington DC, United States of America, at which TANESCO was represented by Mr Robert W Hawkins and Mr John Jay Range of Hunton & Williams and IPTL was represented by Mr Robert. Sentner of Nixon Peabody LLP. Dr Swales and Mr Connell were in attendance, but were not questioned in relation to their statements.\n\n10.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal was informed that the parties had reached agreement on remaining issues (2) and (3) as summarised in paragraph 7 above. The Tribunal invited the parties to reduce the terms of their agreement to writing and to submit the same to the Tribunal for incorporation into this Decision and, by reference, our final Award. The terms of the agreed stipulations relating to these issues were communicated to the Tribunal under cover of a letter from Hunton & Williams to ICSID dated 14 May 2001, confirmed by Nixon Peabody LLP on the same day.\n\n11.\n\nWe therefore set out first, as part of this Decision, the terms of the agreed stipulations made between the parties in relation to: (1) the Cost of Gas Conversion; *(2)* Financing and Agency Fees; and (3) Sovereign Risk and other insurances, as follows:\n\n(1) **Gas Conversion:**\n\n\"Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") dated 26 May 1995, between Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\") and Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\"), IPTL is required to convert the Tegeta facility to operate on Natural Gas upon the occurrence of certain conditions precedent.\n\nAccordingly, the Engineering Procurement and Construction Agreement (the \"EPC Contract\"), dated February 1997, between IPTL and Stork-Wartsila Diesel B.V. (\"Wartsila\") contains provisions pursuant to which Wartsila shall convert the facility to Natural Gas operation for a fixed price of US$11,583,000.\n\nTANESCO hereby agrees that upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent contained in Section 7.1 of the PPA, TANESCO will fully fund the costs of conversion at the fixed price and under the payment terms contained in the EPC Contract.\"\n\n(2) **Financing and Agency Fees:**\n\n\"1. In paragraph 9(E) of the Loan Facility Agreement, the Lender\u2019s Participation Fee portion of the Financing and Agency Fees for the Tegeta Power Plant was set at two percent (2%) of the Project loan amount of $105,000,000, which loan amount was fixed at 70% of Project Cost of $150,000,000.\n\n2. In its February 9, 2001 Decision, the Tribunal reduced the amount of certain claimed expenses that may be included in the total Project Cost for purposes of tariff calculation. The final Project Cost (and the corresponding final loan amount) that may be included in the calculation of the tariff cannot be determined until resolution of all remaining disputes concerning Project Cost.\n\n3. The parties stipulate and agree that the amount to be included as a Project Cost for the Lender's Participation Fee portion of financing and agency fees will be 2% of loan amount, calculated as [70% or 73.51%] of the reduced Project Cost resulting from the Award of this Tribunal, subject to adjustment upward or downward by the Award of a subsequent Tribunal, if any, that finally determines the amounts allowable for the Construction Contingency portion of the Project Cost.\"\n\n(3) **Sovereign Risk and other Insurances:**\n\n\"1. The insurance expenses claimed by IPTL as a Project Cost in the financial model, and referenced in a letter dated July 21, 1997 from Johnson & Higgins to Mechmar bearing document nos. 100014 through 100018, at Joint Appendix 302, are the following: $1,879,802 for Construction Cover, $2,052,000 for CEND Cover, $393,750 for War Risk Cover, and $450,000 for Currency Inconvertibility Cover. The premium on CEND Cover was calculated on an insured value of $150,000,000 (i.e., 100% of claimed Project Cost) at a rate of 1,368%. The premium on War Risk Cover was calculated on an insured value of $105,000,000 (i.e., the debt portion of claimed Project Cost) at a rate of.375%. The premium on Currency Inconvertibility Cover was calculated on an insured value of $30,000,000 at a rate of 1.5%.\n\n2. In its February 9, 2001 Decision, the Tribunal reduced the amount of certain claimed expenses that may be included in the total Project Cost for purposes of tariff calculation. The final Project Cost that will be included in the calculation of the tariff cannot be determined until resolution of all remaining disputes concerning Project Cost. The parties have reached an agreement that, when all remaining issues are ultimately resolved, the amount to be used as the insured value of Construction, CEND and War Risk Cover for purposes of calculating insurance premiums included as a Project Cost should be reduced based on the amount of total Project Cost allowed by the Tribunal.\n\n3. The parties therefore stipulate and agree that the amount to be used as the insured value of Construction, CEND and War Risk Cover for purposes of calculating premiums to be included as a Project Cost will be reduced in proportion to the reduction in claimed Project Cost resulting from the Award of this Tribunal, subject to adjustment upward or downward by the Award of a subsequent Tribunal, if any, that finally determines the amounts allowable for the Construction Contingency portion of the Project Cost. The insured value of Currency Inconvertibility Cover will remain at $30,000,000. and the resulting premium of $450,000 will not be proportionately reduced.\n\n4. For purposes of determining and modelling the insurance portion of fixed operations and maintenance cost, a 20-year straight line depreciation schedule will be adopted to reduce the insured value of CEND and War Risk Cover that may be included in the financial model ear year of the PPA. The initial value used in the depreciation schedule will be the value determined from the proportionate reduction in Project Cost resulting from the award or awards referenced above. Each year thereafter, the value for which the Project may be insured for purposes of the tariff calculation will be reduced by five percent (5%) per annum such that the value of the Project in the year 20 is only 5% of its value in year 1. The amount of CEND Cover that may be included each year to calculate the fixed operations and maintenance cost will be established according to the depreciation schedule referenced in this paragraph. The amount of War Risk Cover that may be included each year to calculate operations and maintenance cost will be fixed at [70% or 73.51%] of the depreciated value of the Project as determined from the depreciation schedule referenced in this paragraph. The parties have agreed, for purposes of modelling future operating expenses only, that $30,000,000 will continue to be used as the maximum insured value of Currency Inconvertibility Cover. If future operating experience indicates less than $30,000,000 needs to be converted from Tanzanian shillings to U.S. dollars, TANESCO may request IPTL to reduce the amount of Currency Inconvertibility Cover. Should the parties not reach mutual agreement, TANESCO reserves the right to challenge whether $30,000,000 is an excessive amount of Currency Inconvertibility Cover.\n\n5. The intial rates used in the financial model to calculate premiums for operating expenses will be the rates set out in the Premium Schedules provided by IPTL on April 24, 2001. The rate for CEND Cover wilt be 1,368%. The rate for War Risk Cover will be.2625%. The rate for Currency Inconvertibility Cover will be 1.25% until IPTL obtains a current quotation for such Cover, which quotation will then be used in the model.\n\n6. The sovereign risk insurance portions of fixed operations and maintenance cost for the entire 20 year term of the PPA will initially be calculated using the depreciation schedule referenced in paragraph 4 above and the rates referenced in paragraph 5 above. Each year thereafter, rates will be adjusted to the extent that CEND, War Risk or Currency Inconvertibility Cover is renewed at a different market rate.\n\n7. IPTL stipulates and agrees that with respect to insurance costs that will be passed through the tariff to TANESCO, it has an obligation to act in a commercially reasonably and prudent manner and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the PPA in procuring the insurance.\"\n\n12.\n\nWe now turn to the remaining issues upon which the parties were not agreed and which we deal with in the order as above.\n\n**The Construction Contingency Reserve:**\n\n13.\n\nAlthough it was submitted on behalf of IPTL that TANESCO should be precluded from re-opening this issue, which they contended had been the subject of an earlier agreement, the Tribunal concluded that no such binding agreement had been made.\n\n14.\n\nTANESCO\u2019s submission, in brief summary, was as follows:\n\n(1) No part of the Construction Contingency Reserve of US$5,709,000 had been utilised before IPTL had informed TANESCO in September 1998 that the plant was ready for the commencement of commercial operations, as certified by an Independent Engineer.\n\n(2) No part of the Construction Contingency Reserve had been utilised since.\n\n(3) The Reserve could only properly be utilised for payment of the cost of variation orders under the EPC Contract, and no such variation order had been issued or was likely to be issued.\n\n(4) The only suggestion made on behalf of IPTL as to the possibility of any variation order being issued before the commencement of commercial operations related to possible further work or changes due to the plant having remained idle for 2,5 years, in circumstances in which the Tribunal had held that IPTL was to be responsible for all such delay.\n\n(5) For these reasons, the Construction Contingency Reserve should now be set at zero for the purposes of the calculation of the initial Reference Tariff.\n\n15.\n\nIPTL, for its part, accepted the first three propositions, but challenged the fourth, as well as TANESCO\u2019s conclusion. There were, it was contended, two separate but associated questions, namely:\n\n(1) Whether any part of the Construction Contingency Reserve was or would be used?\n\n(2) To the extent to which it was not used, when should it be released?\n\n16.\n\nAs to the first of these questions, the Construction Contingency Reserve was, according to IPTL, to be available for any legitimate extra work or variation up to the time of commencement of commercial operations. While no part of it had been used thus far, it was impossible to say at this stage that no circumstances could arise under which it would be used. Apart from the fact that the plant had remained idle for 2,5 years, testing had not yet taken place. Furthermore, the Tribunal had not concluded that any and all consequences of delay were to be for IPTL\u2019s account, but merely that, since, IPTL was at least in part responsible for the long-standing impasse between the parties, it could not recover damages from TANESCO for the latter\u2019s alleged breach in failing to do its part to fulfil conditions precedent to commercial operation commencing.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the second question, IPTL submitted that, although the loan documentation provided for the release of any unused part of the Construction Contingency Reserve at the end of eight years, TANESCO, through Dr Swales, had challenged the reasonableness of this provision. In his proposed financial model put forward on behalf of TANESCO on 11 July 2000, Dr Swales had modelled the release of the funds during the first operating year, and being applied to fund the debt service and maintenance reserves. The Reserve was included as a proper cost for tariff calculation purposes over the first year after the commencement of commercial operations. IPTL stated in its Post-Hearing Memorial that it accepted that proposal.\n\n18.\n\nTANESCO pointed out that, in Mr Willy Lim\u2019s Witness Statement of 11 July 2000, he had conceded that, since it was not expected that any part of the Construction Contingency Reserve would be utilised, the total project cost would be reduced accordingly at the date of commercial operation: Dr Swales\u2019 \"proposal\" was therefore not open for acceptance.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in the above circumstances, it cannot and should not determine finally at this stage that the amount of the Construction Contingency Reserve to be fed into the financial model should be set at zero. If, before commercial operations commence, any extra work or variation is required, which IPTL claims should be funded out of the Construction Contingency Reserve, then, if TANESCO disagrees, there will be a further dispute which will have to be resolved. The Tribunal also concludes that there is no binding agreement between the parties as to when any unused portion of the Construction Contingency Reserve should be released. It would have been inclined to accede to Dr Swales\u2019 uncontroverted opinion on this point, but IPTL has offered to be more generous and to agree that any part of the fund which has not been utilised by the time commercial operations commence shall be released forthwith with the result that, in effect, there will have to be a further adjustment at that time to the Reference Tariff ab initio.\n\n20.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that for present purposes the financial model must be calculated on the basis that the Construction Contingency Reserve is included as part of the Project Cost, but shall be released at the date when commercial operations commence with a consequent adjustment to the Project Cost and the Reference Tariff, save to the extent to which any extra work or variation is required before the commencement of commercial operations which IPTL contends should be funded out of the Construction Contingency Reserve. The parties agreed at the hearing that any dispute as to whether and to what extent the Construction Contingency Reserve should be utilised for this purpose shall be referred to the present Tribunal for subsequent decision and Award as necessary. The parties have undertaken to provide such agreement in writing for incorporation by the Tribunal into its prospective Final Award.\n\n**The Alleged Reduction in IPTL\u2019s Deemed Equity Contribution:**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIt will be recalled that one of the assumptions contained within the 31 May 1995 letter was that the ratio between what was described as \"Senior Debt\" and \"Equity\" should be 70%/30%.\n\n22.\n\nTANESCO contends that, in consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision which disallowed a number of items of alleged expenditure, which were claimed to have constituted part of the overall Project Costs and which were said to have been funded by IPTL as part of its equity contribution (totalling US$5,027,410.35), IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was in fact reduced to 26.49%; that accordingly, IPTL\u2019s return on its actual equity, if unadjusted, would be higher than the agreed adjusted IRR of 22.31%; and that there should therefore be an appropriate further adjustment to the Reference Tariff pursuant to Addendum No. 1.\n\n23.\n\nOn behalf of IPTL, it was first of all submitted that this is a new point, which should have been raised (if at all) as part of the disputed tariff calculation issues which were the subject of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 9 February 2001. IPTL goes further and contends that, not only was the point not taken but, through Dr Swales, TANESCO conceded that the 70%/30% debt/equity ratio remained. The proposed financial model which Dr Swales put forward was calculated on that ratio, and in his Fifth Witness Statement submitted for the purposes of the tariff calculation phase of the proceedings, he listed, in paragraph 3, those of the assumptions which had not changed as including \"Senior Debt: 70%\" and \"Equity: 30%\" (although he added a footnote to the effect that he was unable to verify from the documents produced by IPTL that it did in fact contribute equity equal to 30% of the claimed project costs). One thing is clear - it was not suggested on behalf of TANESCO at that stage that the 70%/30% ratio would have to be adjusted to take account of any part of the claimed project costs which the Tribunal determined should be disallowed, depending on the source of the relevant funds.\n\n24.\n\nMr Hawkins for TANESCO fairly conceded that the point had not been raised, but suggested that TANESCO had not been in a position to raise it until after the Tribunal made its decision on the various items of claimed costs which were challenged. We do not accept that argument. The adjustment might not have been quantifiable at that stage, but the point could certainly have been raised, argued in principle and determined. It was not the intention of the Tribunal to give the parties a further opportunity to raise wholly new points after publication of its Decision.\n\n25.\n\nHowever, Mr Sentner for IPTL also invited us to dismiss the point on its merits, insofar as he contended that TANESCO had failed to make out its case on the facts. TANESCO relied in particular on the documents relating to the 9th and last drawdown which showed a total drawdown figure of US$119,296,000, comprising a contribution from the agent bank of US$84,000,000 (being 70%) and an equity portion of US$35,296,000 (being precisely 30%). TANESCO\u2019s claim for adjustment depended on the assumption that certain of the items which we had disallowed, and in particular: Development Cost of US$3,202,869; Cost of Raising Equity of US$715,486.35; KTA Tenaga Fees of US$809,055; and payment to Omni Management Services of US$300,000, were claimed as being part of IPTL\u2019s equity contribution. However, IPTL contended that one should not assume for these purposes that these items of claimed expenditure were to be identified as having been funded by or attributed to IPTL\u2019s equity contribution, and others as being the product of the bank loans. Both aspects of the money contributed went into one notional \"pot\" from which expenditure was made.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal respectfully agrees that, even if this claim for adjustment were not to be dismissed on the \"technical\" ground that it was raised too late, one result of it being, submitted without the opportunity of investigating precisely what contribution was in fact made by the banks on the one hand or by IPTL on the other in relation to each item of claimed cost which the Tribunal rejected or reduced was that the exercise could not now be carried out. Although the Tribunal was not persuaded by every aspect of Dr Swales\u2019 evidence, it shares his inability to verify from the evidence presented precisely what were the respective debt and equity proportions of the claimed Project Costs.\n\n27.\n\nFurthermore, as it seems to the Tribunal, if one were to reduce IPTL's equity contribution by reference to these specific costs which were disallowed, one should do a similar exercise in relation to the debt contribution. TANESCO\u2019s figures did not (for instance) appear to include in the equation the substantial deduction which the Tribunal concluded was to be made from the EPC Contract Price, and thus the Project Costs, for the purposes of calculating the Reference Tariff. In order to determine the \"true\" debt/equity contribution, the question arises whether this should be deducted from debt or equity, or remain deemed to have been contributed on the assumed 70%/30% ratio. Despite Mr Hawkins\u2019 admirable persistence, the Tribunal was not persuaded that in the calculation which it presented TANESCO had been comparing like with like.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is of the view that different considerations might in any event have applied, depending on the reason why the sums claimed were disallowed in whole or in part - whether the Tribunal was not satisfied that the money was spent at all; or whether the Tribunal was not satisfied that it was spent in connection with this project; or whether the Tribunal merely concluded that the expenditure was not reasonably or prudently incurred. Since only the latter had been in issue before us in the proceedings leading to our Decision, we saw no need to differentiate, and had not done so.\n\n29.\n\nAccordingly, and for these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that further adjustments should not be made to the financial model on this ground.\n\n**The Commencement of Commercial Operations:**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal has already referred above to paragraph 168 of its Decision of 9 February 2001.\n\n31.\n\nFor IPTL, Mr Sentner at one stage seems to be asking the Tribunal for an order that commercial operations should commence by 31 July 2001. However, he conceded that IPTL would need a period which he estimated as 90 days from the publication of our Final Award in order to complete all necessary preliminary steps, and in particular to arrange for the provision of the necessary finance from the lenders. Whilst the Tribunal undertook to use its best endeavours to produce its Final Award as soon as possible, it was acknowledged that, after the communication of this Decision to the parties, final adjustments would have to be made to the financial model, which the parties agreed should then be incorporated by reference into our Final Award.\n\n32.\n\nIn these circumstances, and also in view of the fact that no-one could be sure what, if any, problems would be revealed during commissioning and testing, and what, if any, further physical work needs to be done, the Tribunal considers that it would not be helpful to the parties for us to make an order which may not be achievable despite the good faith efforts of the parties.\n\n33.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal amends and refines the order which we indicated we were minded to make in paragraph 168 of our Decision of 9 February 2001, and hereby. orders that the parties shall comply with their respective obligations under the PPA, and shall use their best endeavours and co-operate together to achieve the commencement of commercial operations as soon as practicable and with a view to commercial operations commencing within 90 days of the publication of our Final Award."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2001-07-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\"), is a Tanzanian corporation, being a public utility wholly owned by the United Republic of Tanzania, and charged with responsibility for the generation, supply and transmission of electric power throughout the country.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent, Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\"), is similarly a corporation incorporated in Tanzania. It was formed as a \"joint venture\" company between VIP Engineering & Marketing Limited, a Tanzanian engineering company, and Mechmar Corporation (Malaysia) Berhard, a Malaysian corporation.\n\n3.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of a Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") dated \"as of\u2019 26 May 1995 between TANESCO and IPTL, whereby IPTL agreed to design, construct, own,, operate and maintain an electricity generating facility with a nominal net capacity of 100 megawatts, to be located in Tegeta, Tanzania (approximately 25 kilometres north of Dar es Salaam) (the \"Facility\"), and to operate the Facility and deliver electricity generated thereby to TANESCO for an initial period of 20 years, subject to extension for further periods as therein provided. We refer to the project as \"the Project\".\n\n4.\n\nUnder Article V of the PPA, the price to be paid after the Initial Operations Date of the first unit comprised three basic elements, namely:\n\n(1) A \"Capacity Payment\";\n\n(2) An \"Energy Payment\";\n\n(3) A \"Test Energy Payment\", to be applied before the applicable Commercial Operations Date.\n\n5.\n\nUnder Appendix B, a \"Reference Tariff\u2019 was to be established, comprising a \"Capacity Purchase Price\" (which in turn consisted of two elements, namely a \"Capital Component\" and a \"Debt Component\"), and an \"Energy Purchase Price\" (also consisting of two elements, namely a \"Fuel Cost Component\", and a \"Variable Operations and Maintenance Costs Component\"), which was subject to escalation/variation in accordance with the detailed provisions of Appendix B so as to arrive at the actual price or tariff to be payable.\n\n6.\n\nUnder Article IV it was a condition precedent to the obligation of TANESCO to purchase electrical energy and capacity from IPTL that IPTL should have fulfilled certain conditions, including in particular under Article 4.1(b) the submission, not less than 30 days prior to the Commencement Date of a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility, when constructed in accordance with the general layout drawings submitted therewith would (inter alia) conform with the Description of the Facility; and under Article 4.1(c) the provision, as soon as available but in any event prior to the Initial Operations Date of each unit, of a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility has been designed and constructed (inter alia) in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the general layout drawings.\n\n7.\n\nAddendum No. 1 to the PPA, dated 9 June 1995. provided (inter alia):\n\n\"Before commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff mentioned in Table I of Appendix B will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement\".\n\n8.\n\nOn 8 June 1995, an Implementation Agreement and a Guarantee Agreement were entered into between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and IPT.\n\n9.\n\nThe above contractual relationship was entered into against the background of a severe shortage of electric power within Tanzania, which was apparently due in part to developments in the economy which stimulated significant growth in the demand for electricity, coupled with problems experienced within Tanzania's existing hydrogenerated power system. A firm of international consultants, Acres International Limited (\"Acres\"), had been involved in advising the Government of Tanzania and TANESCO on a continuing basis since the late 1970's. By 1995, the need for further generating capacity was regarded as urgent.\n\n10.\n\nArticle XVIII of the PPA provided (inter alia) agreed machinery for the resolution of disputes. By Article 18.3, it was agreed that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the PPA should be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"), and that for the purposes of consenting to the jurisdiction of the Centre it was agreed that IPTL was a foreign-controlled entity, unless the amount of the voting stock in IPTL held by non-Tanzanian investors should decrease to less than fifty per cent of its voting stock. Such arbitration was to be conducted in London, England and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, before a tribunal of three arbitrators - one to be nominated by TANESCO, one to be nominated by IPTL, and the third to be nominated by the party - nominated arbitrators or failing their agreement by the High Court of England and Wales.\n\n11.\n\nDisputes did arise between the parties, as hereinafter more particularly defined, which were duly referred to arbitration pursuant to the aforesaid contractual provision - the Request for Arbitration being lodged with ICSID on 25 November 1998, and formally registered by the Secretary-General on 7 December 1998.\n\n12.\n\nTANESCO and IPTL nominated the Honorable Charles N Brower of Messrs White & Case LLP, 601 Thirteenth Street, NW, Suite 600 South, Washington, DC, United States of America, and the Honourable Andrew Rogers QC of 233 Macquarie Street, Level 7,, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia respectively as arbitrators, and the two arbitrators so nominated agreed to the appointment of Kenneth Rokison QC of 20 Essex Street, London WC2R 3 AL, United Kingdom to be third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was fully constituted on 24 March 1999.\n\n13.\n\nThe arbitral proceedings have been conducted throughout in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, under the auspices and administration of the Centre in Washington, DC. Jurisdiction in this case has at no time been contested by either party. TANESCO was designated by Tanzania as an agency of that state pursuant to Article 25(1) of the Convention on 24 September 1998, and TANESCO s consent to arbitrate disputes with IPTL in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules as provided by Article XVIII of the PPA was expressly approved by the Government of Tanzania by Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement. IPTL, although a Tanzanian corporation, has at all material times been owned and controlled to the extent of at least 70% by nationals of Malaysia. Both Tanzania and Malaysia are parties to the ICSID Convention.\n\n14.\n\nIn due course, on 4 February 1997, an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (the \"EPC Contract\") was concluded between IPTL and Stork-Wartsila Diesel B.V. (\"Stork-Wartsila\"), a company established in The Netherlands, for the purpose of constructing the generation plant required to perform the PPA. In addition, on 21 May 1997, IPTL entered into a Fuel Supply Agreement (the \"FSA\") with Galana Petroleum Limited (\"Galana\") and Total International Limited (\"Total\") for an initial term of 5 years to supply the fuel necessary to operation of the Facility.\n\n15.\n\nAs the Facility was being constructed and the prospect of commencing commercial operations came nearer, the disagreements between the parties which ultimately led to this arbitration developed. In particular, TANESCO took issue with the fact that the EPC Contract with Stork-Wartsila called for the provision of ten 10 MW medium speed diesel engines, instead of the five 20 MW slow speed diesels originally envisioned under the terms of the PPA. Further, it was becoming necessary for the parties to discuss adjustment of the Reference Tariff as foreseen in Addendum No. 1 to the PPA.\n\n16.\n\nThese events took place against the background of apparent controversy within Tanzania regarding a competing project, known as the SONGO-SONGO Gas-to-Electricity or \"SONGAS\" Project, in respect of which agreements had been initialed on 23 March 1997 between (inter alia) the Government of Tanzania, TANESCO, and two Canadian companies, Ocelot Energy Inc. (\"Ocelot\") and TransCanada Pipelines Limited. This rival project was to be built by Canadian interests and financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. There was evidence in the arbitration that, notwithstanding the urgency with which the PPA had been concluded in 1995, pressures were thereafter exerted both on and within the Government of Tanzania and TANESCO to defer it, if not eliminate it, in favour of the SONGAS Project.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 April 1998, on the eve of scheduled discussions between TANESCO and IPTL on the adjustment of the Reference Tariff TANESCO served on IPTL a Notice of Default asserting that IPTL was \"in default on its obligation to supply and install slow speed diesel generating sets in accordance with Section 1.1 of Appendix A to the PPA and calling upon IPTL to cure such default within 90 days as required under Article 16.3 of the PPA\n\n18.\n\nNegotiations proceeded somewhat sporadically during the course of the summer and early autumn of 1998 with the participation of the Tanzanian Government, TANESCO, and its legal and technical advisers, Hunton & Williams and Acres respectively, together with IPTL. However the parties remained at loggerheads regarding both adjustment of the Reference Tariff and the substitution of medium speed diesels for slow speed diesels.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 November 1998 the Request for Arbitration was lodged on behalf of TANESCO, asserting two claims:\n\n(1) That medium speed diesel engines had been substituted for the required slow speed diesels without obtaining the prior written consent of TANESCO, thus entitling TANESCO to terminate the PPA; alternatively\n\n(2) That, pursuant to Addendum No. 1 the Capacity Purchase Price was to be \"cost based\", but IPTL was refusing to share relevant information with TANESCO and the cost seemed excessive, so that in the event that the PPA could not be terminated the tariff should be adjusted.\n\n20.\n\nOn 14 December 1998, TANESCO gave to IPTL Notice of Intent to Terminate pursuant to Article 16.3(a) of the PPA, which was copied to IPTL\u2019s lenders, stating that, barring consensual resolution of the matter, TANESCO reserved its right to terminate the PPA pursuant to Article 16.3(c).\n\n21.\n\nMeanwhile on 30 November 1998, five days after lodging of the Request for Arbitration with the Centre, IPTL filed a petition in the High Court of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam, directed against TANESCO and three officials of the Government of Tanzania, seeking both a declaration that commercial operations of IPTL\u2019s facility should be deemed as having commenced 15 September 1998 and an order for payment to IPTL by TANESCO of a \"Capacity Payment\" in the amount of $3,623,000 monthly beginning on that date.\n\n22.\n\nOn 7 December 1998, being the same day the Request for Arbitration was registered by the Secretary-General, TANESCO petitioned the Tanzanian High Court to stay the proceedings recently commenced against it.\n\n23.\n\nOn the following day, 8 December 1998, IPTL submitted to the same Court a \"Notice of Objection on a Preliminary Point of Law\" asserting in effect that TANESCO had waived its right to pursue this arbitration.\n\n24.\n\nOn 5 March 1999 the High Court of Tanzania sustained the preliminary objections of IPTL and proceeded immediately to grant the relief requested by IPTL in its original petition. Leave was given to TANESCO to appeal and it sought a stay of execution pending such appeal.\n\n25.\n\nIn response, on 7 April 1999, IPTL applied for an order of execution in the amount of $23,670,266.67, that being the accumulated sum of the monthly \"Capacity Payments\" due pursuant to the High Court's Order up to 1 April 1999. Thereafter IPTL agreed that it would not execute for a limited period of time.\n\n26.\n\nWhen the Tribunal convened its initial session with the parties on 14 June 1999, TANESCO had already issued a request for an order of provisional measures from the Tribunal directed at a cessation of all the above proceedings in the Courts of Tanzania.\n\n27.\n\nIn the course of that session, it was clarified that IPTL was willing further to stay its hand in relation to the proceedings in Tanzania, but that it would itself seek provisional measures from this Tribunal substantially to the same effect as it had obtained from the High Court of Tanzania.\n\n28.\n\nThereafter, on 28 June 1999, IPTL filed with the Tribunal a request for the following provisional measures:\n\n(1) Permitting commercial operations of the Facility to commence;\n\n(2) Requiring TANESCO to make monthly Capacity Payments in the amount of $3,623,000, or, in the alternative, in the amount of $3,400,000 (an interim monthly payment which TANESCO previously had agreed with IPTL, subject however to approval of the Government of Tanzania, which had not been forthcoming); and\n\n(3) Requiring Tanzania to pay forthwith a lump sum of $32,607,000, being the accumulated monthly Capacity Payments due from 15 September 1998 to May 1999 in accordance with the order of the High Court of Tanzania.\n\n29.\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Tribunal convened to hear both parties\u2019 applications for provisional measures. In the meantime, on 8 July 1999, the order of the High Court of Tanzania had been stayed by a single Justice of the Court of Appeal of Tanzania, pending determination of the appeal thereof, and the parties then requested the Tribunal to defer consideration of TANESCO\u2019s request for provisional measures directed at the Tanzanian court proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nAt this hearing IPTL revised its request by (1) withdrawing its demand for a lump sum payment of the alleged \"arrears\" accumulated in respect of the order of the High Court of Tanzania, and (2) requesting that the requested order permitting commercial operations also enjoin TANESCO to co-operate with IPTL, including conducting operational tests and connecting the Facility to the Tanzanian power grid. The demand for a monthly Capacity Payment remained.\n\n31.\n\nOn 20 December 1999 the Tribunal issued its Decision On The Respondent\u2019s Request For Provisional Measures, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix A and which is incorporated herein by reference. The relief that had been requested by IPTL was denied by the Tribunal on the ground that it would change rather than maintain the status quo by ordering performance of the PPA, and thus was outside the scope of Arbitration Rule 39, and that there was insufficient demonstration of urgency in that IPTL, should it prevail on the merits, would in any event receive tariff payments over 20 years as foreseen by the. PPA and would lose only the interim use of funds, for which an award of damages would on the face of it be an adequate remedy.\n\n32.\n\nThe conclusions of the Tribunal in relation to the Request for Provisional Measures, in common with the conclusions of the Tribunal in relation to other matters which were submitted to the Tribunal for its decision in the course of the proceedings, were published in the form of \"Decisions\", to be incorporated into our Final Award by reference in due course. The Tribunal adopted this course because the ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no provisions which permit or even contemplate \"Partial\" or \"Interim\" awards, and, indeed, it seemed to the Tribunal that the Rules contemplated only one, Final Award. The course which the Tribunal adopted was not challenged or objected to by either party.\n\n33.\n\nBy the time of the hearing resulting in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision On The Respondent s Request For Provisional Measures, it had become clear that it would be appropriate to determine as a preliminary matter certain issues of construction of the PPA and law. It was ordered, therefore, that the parties should make written submissions with respect to the following preliminary issues:\n\n1. Was or is TANESCO entitled to terminate the PPA?\n\n2. If not, what are the effects (if any) on the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations under the PPA of:\n\n(1) the change from low speed to medium speed diesel engines; and/or\n\n(2) any other alleged differences between the Facility as built and that provided for in the PPA and/or any other agreements between the parties?\n\n3. How is the final Reference Tariff to be calculated, in the light of the said change and any other differences which may be established?\n\n4. What was the effect on the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995, and, in particular, did Addendum No. 1 on its true construction have the effect that the final Reference Tariff was to be calculated by reference to the reasonable and prudently incurred cost of the Facility as built; and what were \"the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\"?\n\n34.\n\nA hearing was held 13,14,15 and 16 March 2000 on these preliminary issues, and on 22 May 2000 the Tribunal issued its Decision On Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix B and which is incorporated herein by reference. As set forth in paragraph 19 of that Decision, the \"Conclusions\" of the Tribunal on the Preliminary Issues were as follows:\n\n(1) That the PPA was not subject to an unsatisfied condition precedent as alleged or at all, and was not void for uncertainty; and accordingly was a valid and effective contract between the parties;\n\n(2) That TANESCO was not entitled to serve Notice of Default and was and is not entitled to give notice of termination pursuant thereto;\n\n(3) That the Reference Tariff should be adjusted in accordance with Addendum No. 1 by reference to changes that had taken place, before commercial operations would have commenced but for TANESCO\u2019s purported Notice of Default, in any of the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, with the following qualifications, namely:-\n\n(1) that the figure of 23% for \"IRR\" should be amended to read \"22.31%\";\n\n(2) that it is open to TANESCO to prove that any costs incurred by IPTL relating to any of the listed assumptions were not reasonably and prudently so incurred.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to answer the Preliminary Issues listed in paragraph 33 above as follows:\n\n(1) Not on any grounds argued and dealt with in this decision.\n\n(2) None, save that there may be consequences on the cost of the Facility and therefore on the adjustment to the Reference Tariff to be carried out pursuant to Addendum No. 1 to the PPA.\n\n(3) & (4) The \"underlying assumptions stated in the PPA\" were those listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995, and the effect of Addendum No. 1 dated 9 June 1995 was as summarised in sub-paragraph (3) above.\"\n\n35.\n\nAt the time of the hearing on Preliminary Issues, and at the date of our Decision on those issues, a date had already been fixed for what was hoped would be the final hearing in this matter, to consider remaining issues in relation to the fixing of the tariff, to take place during the last week in July 2000.\n\n36.\n\nBetween the date of the hearing on Preliminary Issues and the date of our Decision, on 20 April 2000 TANESCO submitted a request to the Tribunal for an order for discovery concerning alleged payments and/or gifts made or given, offered or promised by agents of IPTL to officials of the Government of the Republic of Tanzania or TANESCO, including the provision of Answers to Interrogatories and a Request for Admissions in relation to such payments or gifts.\n\n37.\n\nReference to allegations of bribery or attempted bribery had been made earlier in the course of the proceedings, but TANESCO had never formally pleaded such allegations or sought to raise them by way of claim or defence.\n\n38.\n\nThe request was supported by the unsworn statements of Mr. Patrick Rutabanzibwa, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of the Republic of Tanzania and formerly the Commissioner for Energy and Petroleum Affairs in that Ministry; Mr. Prosper A.M. Victus, the Assistant Commissioner for Energy (Petroleum and Gas); and Mrs. Esther Masunzu, the Assistant Commissioner for Energy (Electricity).\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal declined to make any of the orders requested, on the ground that no allegation of bribery had been pleaded, and that it would in any event not be right to order the answering of questions on oath when the only basis for the allegations upon which the questions were based was unsworn statements.\n\n40.\n\nThe request was renewed on 26 May 2000, when TANESCO submitted its Reply on the Merits, in which it pleaded for the first time a claim to be entitled to rescind the PPA on the basis of its allegations of bribery, which it purported to raise as an \"Ancillary Claim\" pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (which by its paragraph (2) must be presented not later than in the Reply). The renewed application was supported by the Statutory Declaration of Mr Victus, and sworn statements of Mrs Masunzu and Mr Rutabanzibwa.\n\n41.\n\nOn 6 June 2000 IPTL raised objection to the assertion of the bribery claim and the renewed request for discovery, on the grounds (inter alia):\n\n(1) That it was not an \"ancillary\" claim, but was a claim which should have been asserted, if at all, in TANESCO\u2019s Memorial on the Merits in January 2000;\n\n(2) That, even assuming the truth of the facts alleged in the witness statements, TANESCO had failed to make out a prima facie case for rescission of the PPA;\n\nand\n\n(3) That if the plea were to be allowed, it would jeopardise the July hearing date.\n\nAlternatively, in the event that the Tribunal was minded to permit TANESCO to proceed with its plea of bribery, IPTL sought an order for immediate production by TANESCO of all documents relevant to the plea.\n\n42.\n\nOn 12 June 2000 the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision that it would permit TANESCO to raise the bribery issue pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and ordered both parties to produce any documents in their possession, custody or power relating to that issue. It declined to order the wide-ranging Interrogatories or the Request for Admissions proposed, which sought the answers to questions concerning possible bribery and attempts at bribery by employees and agents of IPTL generally, on the ground that no allegations of bribery or attempted bribery had been made against any representatives of IPTL except Mr. Rugemalira. The Tribunal made it clear that the addition of the bribery allegations would not be permitted to delay the July hearing, which had been scheduled for some time.\n\n43.\n\nOn 27 June 2000 the Tribunal ruled that TANESCO should produce relevant documents in the files of its counsel emanating from the Government of Tanzania, even though the original documents had never been in the possession, custody or power of TANESCO itself.\n\n44.\n\nThese documents were produced by TANESCO\u2019s Counsel, Hunton & Williams, under cover of a letter dated 5 July 2000, on the basis of an express agreement as to their confidentiality (which in the view of the Tribunal would have applied in any event). In the penultimate paragraph of its letter, Hunton & Williams stated:\n\nThe investigation in Tanzania is not complete. In the light of this fact, we have been instructed to advise that TANESCO will not proceed further at this time with respect to its bribery allegations but will make oral application at the hearing later this month for an extension of time to present its case with respect to the bribery claims.\n\nTANESCO further purported to \"reserve all rights regarding its bribery claim\" under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and under Tanzanian law.\n\n45.\n\nMeanwhile, on 29 June 2000 IPTL served its Reply Counter Memorial (or \"Rejoinder\") on the Merits and on 10 July 2000 served its Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff. On 11 July 2000 TANESCO served its Memorial on the Calculation of the Tariff.\n\n46.\n\nAn oral hearing took place before the Tribunal at the International Dispute Resolution Centre, 8 Breams Buildings, London on 21, 21, 24, 25 and 26 July 2000.\n\n47.\n\nAfter the close of the oral hearing, and pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal, IPTL filed a written submission dated 18 August 2000 on its claim for Damages for Breach of Contract, and each party filed a Post-Hearing Memorial dated 12 September 2000. Thereafter, on 2 October 2000, each party filed a written submission on the Award of Arbitration Costs.\n\n48.\n\nAt the start of the July hearing and upon the application of TANESCO, the Tribunal received \"information\" from Mr. Rutabanzibwa (although he was not formally called as a witness) as to the progress of the investigation in Tanzania of the allegations of bribery, which had apparently started in late 1997, had thereafter proceeded somewhat sporadically, but which was said to be continuing. On the basis of this information, Counsel for TANESCO asked for an extension of time of 3 months to make additional filings in relation to these issues.\n\n49.\n\nMr. Hawkins declined the invitation of the Tribunal to apply to withdraw the allegation, and. after considering the application, the Tribunal refused to grant the extension requested, and indicated that since the allegation remained on the record, it must be dealt with on its merits on the basis of the material put before it.\n\n50.\n\nThe issues which were canvassed before the Tribunal at the July hearing and which we were called upon to determine included the following:\n\n(1) The issue of alleged bribery;\n\n(2) Did IPTL and/or the parties fail to perform conditions precedent to Commercial Operations, including:\n\n(1) Failing to provide a certificate from the Independent Engineer stating that the Facility when constructed would conform with the Description of the Facility, or that the Facility had been designed and constructed in all material respects within the terms of the PPA and the general layout drawings?\n\n(2) Failing to agree the Reference Tariff?\n\n(3) Was TANESCO in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to the negotiations concerning the fixing of the tariff, and if so what are the consequences?\n\n(4) Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act in good faith in relation to the negotiations and in particular to the disclosure of relevant documents and information, and if so what are the consequences?\n\n(5) Did IPTL and Stork-Wartsila conspire together falsely to inflate the EPC price?\n\n(6) Was IPTL in breach of its obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to any costs and expenses which it would have input into the amount prima facie payable by TANESCO as the Capacity Payment element of the tariff, and in particular in relation to the procurement of the EPC Contract?\n\n(7) Was IPTL in breach of its implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to the procurement of the FSA, and if so what consequences flow.\n\n(8) Were any breaches on the part of either party waived, or is any complaint or remedy barred by estoppel?\n\n(9) What adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff stated in the PPA?\n\n(10) What if any further orders should be made?\n\n(11) What if any order should be made in respect of the costs of the arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal), and/or the legal and other costs of the parties?\n\n51.\n\nIn considering these issues and insofar as any issue depended on an application of principles of law, the Tribunal sought to apply the law of the Republic of Tanzania, as it has sought to do throughout this arbitration, that being the governing law of the contract expressly designated by the parties by Article 19.4 of the PPA.\n\n52.\n\nBy its Decision On Tariff And Other Remaining Issues dated 9 February 2001, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix C, and which is incorporated herein by reference, the Tribunal, for the reasons set out therein, concluded that:\n\n(1) The allegation of bribery failed and should be dismissed; in this connection, the Tribunal repeated its conclusion to the effect that the PPA was an effective contract between the parties.\n\n(2) IPTL did not fail to perform a condition precedent to commercial operations by failing to produce an Independent Engineer\u2019s Certificate in accordance with Article 4.1.(b) or (c) of the PPA.\n\n(3) Although commercial operations could not commence until the Reference Tariff had been adjusted to take account of changes in the underlying assumptions stated in the PPA, in the absence of agreement between the parties, it was for the Tribunal to decide what, if any, adjustments were appropriate and for commercial operations then to commence in accordance with that decision.\n\n(4) IPTL had not made out its allegation that TANESCO failed and refused to negotiate in good faith after April 1998, and that, at all events, any such failure or refusal was not the sole or effective cause of the failure of the parties to agree on the adjusted Reference Tariff so that commercial operations could commence, that IPTL\u2019s claim for damages for such alleged failure should be dismissed, and that TANESCO\u2019s parallel claim against IPTL was academic insofar as it claimed no damages for breach.\n\n(5) IPTL and Stork-Wartsila did not conspire together falsely to inflate the EPC Contract price.\n\n(6) IPTL was in breach of its implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to a number of items of costs and expenses which would have an input into the amount prima facie payable by TANESCO as the Capacity Purchase Price element of the Reference Tariff, including the procurement of the EPC Contract (as more particularly set out in our Decision), and that accordingly a number of adjustments would have to be made for the purposes of arriving at the initial Reference Tariff.\n\n(7) IPTL was not in breach of its implied obligation to act reasonably and prudently in relation to the procurement of the Fuel Supply Agreement.\n\n(8) There was no relevant waiver or estoppel.\n\n53.\n\nIn its Decision of 9 February 2001, the Tribunal recorded its understanding that the parties were confident that, armed with that Decision, they would be able to agree on the \"financial model\" originally produced by Mr. Willy Lim, and which had already been subjected to agreed adjustments, and the Reference Tariff which should be derived as a consequence; but communicated separately that, if this were not the case, further application must be made to the Tribunal. It was not the intention of the Tribunal to invite further submissions on matters which had already been dealt with in its Decision.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal further indicated that it considered it appropriate to order that the parties should co-operate in taking whatever steps would be necessary to achieve the commencement of commercial operations as soon as possible after our Decision.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal concluded that it would be fair to order that each party should bear its own legal and other costs and to share the costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, on a 50/50 basis.\n\n56.\n\nFollowing the publication of our Decision On Tariff And Other Remaining Issues, TANESCO raised a number of further matters going to the calculation of the Reference Tariff; and IPTL invited the Tribunal to fix a date by which the commencement of commercial operations should be achieved.\n\n57.\n\nAfter the exchange of written Memorials and Reply Memorials, and at the request of TANESCO, a further oral hearing took place before the Tribunal on 29 April 2001 at the offices of the World Bank in Washington DC, United States of America, when the following issues were referred to the Tribunal for decision:\n\n(1) How the Construction Contingency Reserve should be dealt with.\n\n(1) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the figure for Sovereign Risk and other insurances?\n\n(2) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the Lenders' Participation Fee portion of \"Financing and Agency\" fees in consequence of the Tribunal's conclusions as to the deductions to be made from the claimed Project Costs.\n\n(3) What, if any, adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction in IPTL\u2019s deemed equity in the project?\n\n(4) What, if any, further orders should be made in relation to the Commencement of Commercial Operations?\n\n58.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal was informed that the parties had reached agreement on issues (2) and (3); and subsequently, pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal, the parties submitted the agreed terms of their agreement to be incorporated into the Tribunal's Decision, and, by reference, this Final Award.\n\n59.\n\nThe parties further invited the Tribunal to note and incorporate in its Decision and its Final Award the terms of the agreement between the parties concerning the Cost of Gas Conversion.\n\n60.\n\nOn 24 May 2001 the Tribunal published its Decision On All Further Remaining Issues, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix D, and which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n61.\n\nIn addition to recording the agreements of the parties referred to in paragraphs 58 and 59 above, the Tribunal concluded that the financial model must be calculated on the basis, that the Construction Contingency Reserve should be included as part of the Project Cost, but that it should be released at the date when commercial operations commenced, with a consequent adjustment to the Project Cost and the Reference Tariff, save to the extent to which any variation order would be made under the EPC Contract before the commencement of commercial operations, which IPTL contended should be funded out of the Construction Contingency Reserve. The Tribunal recorded in its Decision the agreement between the parties that any dispute as to whether and to what extent the Construction Contingency Reserve should be utilized in such a case should be referred to an ICSID Tribunal comprised of Messrs Charles N. Brower, Andrew Rogers, and Kenneth Rokison, with Mr. Rokison serving as President, for subsequent decision and award as necessary. A copy of the parties-agreed Stipulation, submitted on 23 May 2001, is attached hereto as Appendix E.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected TANESCO\u2019s submission that there should be a further adjustment to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction in IPTL\u2019s equity contribution to the project.\n\n63.\n\nFinally, in relation to the timing of the commencement of commercial operations, the Tribunal amended and refined the order which it had indicated it was minded to make in paragraph 168 of its Decision of 9 February 2001, and ordered the parties to comply with their respective obligations under the PPA, and to use their best endeavours and to cooperate together to achieve the commencement of commercial operations as soon as practicable and with a view to commercial operations commencing within 90 days of the publication of our Final Award.\n\n64.\n\nFollowing publication of our Decision On All Further Remaining Issues, the parties agreed on the adjustments to be made to the financial model to take account of the Tribunal\u2019s various decisions, and submitted to the Tribunal an agreed financial model in both hard copy and electronic form to be used for the calculation of the initial Reference Tariff. That financial model which forms part of this award, is appended hereto as Appendix F (both hard copy and electronic form) and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n65.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal wishes to repeat its appreciation to the legal representatives on each side for their considerable industry and assistance, and to the ICSID Centre in Washington for its efficient and very helpful administration of the arbitration.\n\nTHEREFORE, THE TRIBUNAL AWARDS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1. The Tribunal decides as set forth above and in Appendices A, B, C, D, E and F hereto.\n\n2. In particular:\n\nA. The Power Purchase Agreement between the parties dated \"as of\" 26 May 1995 is and remains a valid and effective contract between them;\n\nB. The Reference Tariff under the Power Purchase Agreement between the parties dated \"as of\" 26 May 1995 is as set forth in Appendix F hereto;\n\nC. As agreed by the parties and submitted by them in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2):\n\n**Gas Conversion:**\n\n\"Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") dated 26 May 1995 between Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\"), IPTL is required to convert the Tegeta facility to operate on Natural Gas upon the occurrence of certain conditions precedent.\n\nAccordingly, the Engineering Procurement and Construction Agreement (the \"EPC Contract\"), dated February 1997, between IPTL and Stork-Wartsila Diesel B.V. (\"wartsila\") contains provisions pursuant to which Wartsila shall convert the facility to Natural Gas operation for a fixed price of US$11,583,000.\n\nTANESCO hereby agrees that upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent contained in Section 7.1 of the PPA, TANESCO will fully fund the costs of conversion at the fixed price and under the payment terms contained in the EPC Contract.\"\n\nD. The parties shall comply with their respective obligations under the Power Purchase Agreement between them dated \"as of\u2019 26 May 1995 and shall use their best endeavours and co-operate together to achieve the commencement of commercial operations of the Facility under said Agreement as soon as practicable and with a view to commercial operations commencing with ninety (90) days of the publication to them by the Centre of this Final Award.\n\nE. Each party shall bear its own legal and other costs, and the cost of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, shall be borne as to 50 per cent by each party."}]}
