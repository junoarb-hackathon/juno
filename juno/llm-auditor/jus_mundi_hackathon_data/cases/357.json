PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\")** pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"ICSID Convention\").** In its Request for Arbitration, Claimant referenced Article 13(3)(a) of the Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 7 February 1998 and entered into force 14 October 1998 **(\"Australia-Pakistan Treaty\"; Exhibit CE-4)** as Respondent\u2019s written consent to arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 18 May 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General of ICSID **(\"Secretary-General\")** that it appointed Mr. John Beechey as an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Mr. Beechey accepted his appointment on 1 June 2012 and made a declaration pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"Arbitration Rules\"****).**\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 June 2012, Respondent appointed as arbitrator Lord Hoffmann, who accepted his appointment on the following day. In separate letters dated 9 July 2012, the Parties jointly consented to the appointment of Dr. Klaus Sachs as the President of the Tribunal, who accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator on 12 July 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn 12 July 2012, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, Respondent filed a proposal to disqualify Mr. Beechey from the Arbitral Tribunal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention **(\"Disqualification Proposal\").** Subsequently, the ICSID Secretariat (the **\"Secretariat\")** informed the Tribunal that the proceedings were suspended pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same date but after the submission of Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the **\"Request\").** The Secretariat informed the Parties that, in light of the suspension of the proceedings, Claimant's submission would be sent to the Tribunal once the proceedings resumed.\n\n11.\n\nSubmissions were made on the Disqualification Proposal by Mr. Beechey and both Parties. In addition, the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal scheduled a hearing on the Disqualification Proposal, to be held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London on 8 September 2012.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 6 September 2012, Claimant informed the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal that the Parties had jointly requested Mr. Beechey to resign from the Tribunal and that he had complied with this request. Claimant also expressed its consent to Mr. Beechey\u2019s resignation. By letter of the same date, Respondent informed the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal that it accepted Mr. Beechey\u2019s resignation from the Tribunal. Respondent stated that its consent was without prejudice to objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which it might raise at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 7 September 2012, the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal informed the Secretary-General of their consent to Mr. Beechey\u2019s resignation. By letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed the Parties hereof and invited Claimant to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in order to fill the vacancy resulting from Mr. Beechey\u2019s resignation.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 6 September 2012, Respondent informed the Secretary-General that it would consent to Claimant\u2019s appointment of Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov as an arbitrator if he confirmed the disclosure which he had provided to Respondent in advance.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 7 September 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General that it appointed Mr. Alexandrov as an arbitrator.\n\n16.\n\nOn 10 September 2012, Mr. Alexandrov accepted his appointment and confirmed the disclosure which he had previously made to Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nBy email of the same date, the Secretariat informed the Tribunal that the proceedings would resume pursuant to Rule 12 of the Arbitration Rules from the point which they had reached at the time the vacancy on the Tribunal had occurred. The Secretariat provided the reconstituted Tribunal with Claimant\u2019s Request and Exhibits CE-37 to CE-149 as well as the Witness Statements of Messrs. Timothy Livesey and Robert Krcmarov.\n\n18.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 11 September 2012, Claimant submitted corrected versions of Exhibits CE-99 and CE-128.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 14 September 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, confirmed that the hearing on the Request (the **\"Hearing\")** would be held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London on 6 November 2012.\n\n20.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 1 October 2012, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures **(\"Response\")** with Exhibits RE-1 to RE-11 and Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-6, as well as the Witness Statement of Dr. Samar Mubarakmand and its annexes.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 October 2012, Claimant submitted its Reply on Provisional Measures **(\"Reply\")** together with the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Timothy Livesey. In the Reply, Claimant renewed its request that, given the imminent nature of the harm anticipated by Claimant, the Tribunal immediately grant the requested provisional measures as a temporary restraint pending disposition of the Request.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the Tribunal would not decide on the requested relief before having received Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder and having heard both Parties' arguments at the oral hearing.\n\n23.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 29 October 2012, Respondent submitted the Rejoinder (titled \"*Respondent\u2019s Answer to the Claimant\u2019s Reply\"',* **\"Rejoinder\"),** together with Exhibits RE-12 and RE-13 and Legal Authorities RLA-7 to RLA-10.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 31 October 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that Respondent inform the Tribunal and Counsel for Claimant whether Respondent intended to cross-examine Messrs. Livesey and Krcmarov during the Hearing. By letter of the same date, Respondent confirmed that it did not intend to do so.\n\n25.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 3 November 2012, Claimant submitted Exhibits CE-181 and CE-182.\n\n26.\n\nBy two separate emails of 5 November 2012, Respondent submitted Exhibit RE-15 and provided page 46 of its Exhibit RE-1.\n\n27.\n\nThe Hearing was held on 6 November 2012. Respondent\u2019s witness Dr. Samar Mubarakmand was cross-examined during the Hearing.\n\n28.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 13 November 2012, Claimant submitted the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Timothy Livesey.\n\n29.\n\nOn 19 November 2012, Respondent submitted its comments on the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Timothy Livesey.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 28 November 2012, Claimant, upon direction by the Tribunal, and in response to Respondent\u2019s letter of 22 November 2012, stated its position on a crossundertaking and security in the event that the Tribunal were inclined to grant the Request.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter dated 30 November 2012, Respondent replied to Claimant\u2019s letter dated 28 November 2012.\n\n**C. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThis section briefly sets out the background of the dispute as derived from the briefs and evidence submitted by the Parties at this preliminary stage of the arbitral proceedings. This factual summary should not, therefore, be taken as the Tribunal\u2019s prejudgment of any issues of fact or law to be resolved at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n33.\n\nOn 29 July 1993, BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. **(\"BHP\")** and the Balochistan Development Authority **(\"BDA\"),** a statutory corporation of the Province of Balochistan in Pakistan **(\"Balochistan\"),** entered into the Agreement for Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture **(\"CHEJVA\"; Exhibit CE-1),** which established the unincorporated contractual Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture (the **\"Joint Venture\")** with the purpose of exploring for deposits of gold, copper and other materials in the Chagai district of Balochistan. Pursuant to the terms of the CHEJVA, BDA held a 25% ownership interest in the Joint Venture, while BHP held a 75% interest in return for agreeing to fund the costs of exploration and any feasibility studies to be conducted under the CHEJVA.\n\n34.\n\nThe statutory legal regime which regulates the exploration and mining activities is contained in the 2002 Balochistan Mineral Rules **(\"BM Rules\"; Exhibit CE-5).** The BM Rules provide, *inter alia,* that the Technical Head of the Directorate General of Mines and Minerals (the **\"Licensing Authority\")** is the authority to which applications for mineral titles or mineral concessions should be submitted and which is empowered to grant mineral titles and mineral concessions pursuant to the BM Rules.\n\n35.\n\nOn 4 March 2000, the Government of Balochistan, BHP and BDA entered into the Addendum No. 1 to the CHEJVA **(\"Addendum No. 1\"; Exhibit CE-2)** pursuant to which the Government of Balochistan and BHP confirmed their intention that all references to BDA in the CHEJVA were deemed to refer to the Government of Balochistan. Based on two other contracts, an Option Agreement and an Alliance Agreement with BHP **(Exhibits CE-12** and **CE-15),** Claimant subsequently took over from BHP the exploration activities in the Chagai Hills exploration area.\n\n36.\n\nOn 30 November 2000, Claimant established Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Private) Limited **(\"TCCP\")** as its wholly owned Pakistani subsidiary (Claimant and TCCP are collectively referred to as **\"TCC\").**\n\n37.\n\nIn May 2002, the Licensing Authority granted *\"M/S. BDA/BHP Chagai Hills Joint Venture\",* i.e., the Joint Venture, the Exploration License EL-5 **(\"License EL-5\"; Exhibit CE-16),** which originally covered 973.75 square kilometers in the Reko Diq area. License EL-5 was initially granted for a period of three years from 21 February 2002 to 20 February 2005 and was subsequently renewed on two occasions through 19 February 2011. The area covered by License EL-5 was reduced first to 482.72 square kilometers and then to 435.02 square kilometers **(Exhibits CE-17** and **CE-20).**\n\n38.\n\nOn 1 April 2006, Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA pursuant to a Novation Agreement with the Government of Balochistan and BHP (the **\"Novation Agreement\", Exhibit CE-3),** and replaced BHP as a party to the CHEJVA with a 75% interest in both the Joint Venture and its principal asset, License EL-5. Claimant then transferred its mining rights, including the 75% interest in License EL-5 and certain other assets and liabilities, to TCCP **(Exhibit CE-21).** The remaining 25% continued to be held by the Government of Balochistan.\n\n39.\n\nFrom 2006, Claimant together with TCCP carried out an exploration program, as envisaged by Clause 7 of the CHEJVA, in the Exploration Area delineated in Schedule B of the CHEJVA, known as *\"Reko Diq\"1* Part of Reko Diq is the deposits Tanjeel (H4) and the Western Porphyries (H13, H14 and H15).\n\nRequest, para. 38 *et passim.*\n\n40.\n\nIn early January 2009, the Chinese state-owned company China Metallurgical Group Corporation **(\"MCC\"),** which operates a mine close to Reko Diq, was invited to submit a financial and technical proposal for Reko Diq to the joint Government of Balochistan/Govemment of Pakistan Reko Diq Steering Committee **(Exhibit CE-69).** Beginning in May 2009, while Claimant was carrying out its exploration program, Balochistan and the Federal Government also began to consider an alternative proposal for Reko Diq submitted by Dr. Samar Mubarakmand **(\"PC-1 Proposal\"),** which provided, *inter alia,* for the construction of a smelter in the Reko Diq area.\n\n41.\n\nOn 26 August 2010, after completing a scoping study in October 2007 (analyzing fourteen project development paths and recommending four options), a prefeasibility study in July 2009 (focusing on a base case configuration centered around the Western Porphyries but also including a significant amount of analysis regarding Tanjeel) and an expansion pre-feasibility study in July 2010 (envisaging an expansion to Tanjeel and Hl3 in the sixth year of the mining operation), TCC formally submitted the feasibility study envisaged in the CHEJVA (the **\"Feasibility Study\")** to the Government of Balochistan. The Feasibility Study examined the technical and economic feasibility of a base case mining project centered on the Western Porphyries and also contemplated its future expansion to Tanjeel and other adjacent ore bodies.\n\n42.\n\nOn 6 November 2010, a Pakistani attorney, M. Tariq Asad, filed a constitutional petition **(Exhibit CE-172)** before the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the Federal Government, the Provincial Government and other respondents, including Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, requesting the Court to, *inter alia',* (i) direct the Federal Government through its Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan, the Head of the Department of Mines and Mineral Development of Balochistan, the Steering Committee and the Board of Revenue of Balochistan to refrain from issuing a mining license in an arbitrary and unlawful manner and without the consultation of the Parliament of Balochistan; (ii) direct the Federal Government, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan and the Head of the Department of Mines and Mineral Development of Balochistan to explain why the mining process could not have been carried out by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and Mining Department, and why such efforts had not been made thus far; and (iii) further direct these three respondents to complete the whole process of gold mining, either independently or with the joint venture, within Pakistan territory and restrain them from taking the raw material out of Pakistan, so that the entire process could take place in Pakistan.\n\n43.\n\nOn 8 November 2010, a number of Pakistani politicians filed an additional petition with the Supreme Court of Pakistan **(Exhibit CE-173).**\n\n44.\n\nUnder Clause 11.3.1 of the CHEJVA, each party had 90 days after submission of the Feasibility Study to notify the Manager of the CHEJVA in writing *\"whether it intend\\Q&\\ to participate in development of the (...) Mineral deposit as a Mining Area.\"* On 8 November 2010, Claimant and TCCP provided notice to the Government of Balochistan of their election to participate in the development of Reko Diq **(Exhibit C-23).** The Government of Balochistan, for its part, did not make such an election within the mandated 90-day period. By letter to TCCP dated 28 March 2011 **(Exhibit CE-114),** the Government of Balochistan stated instead that it could not discuss participation in the mine development or consider a joint mining lease application due to third-party challenges to the CHEJVA pending before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\n\n45.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, Dr. Samar Mubarakmand gave an interview to the Pakistani television station Duniya TV. When the two interviewers suggested that Balochistan should be giving mining contracts relating to Reko Diq to local companies rather than to outsiders so that the flow of money could remain within Pakistan rather than going to foreign companies, Dr. Mubarakmand stated in response that this was the reason he had developed a technical project and presented it to the Chief Minister of Balochistan **(Exhibit CE-105).**\n\n46.\n\nThe PC-1 Proposal to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council was submitted by Balochistan on 10 December 2009 **(Exhibit CE-112),** and approval of the proposal was granted by decision of 9 December 2010 **(Exhibit CE-106),** following which 8,812 billion rupees were allocated to the project. This project is also referred to as the **\"Balochistan Copper/Gold Project\".**\n\n47.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, Dr. Samar Mubarakmand stated in a television interview that TCC had completed its exploration work and provided a feasibility report. Dr. Mubarakmand further noted that the decision on whether TCC would be granted a mining lease would be made by the Government of Balochistan *\"as these deposits belong to them.\"* **(Exhibit CE-108).**\n\n48.\n\nOn 15 February 2011, on Claimant\u2019s instructions, TCCP submitted to the Licensing Authority an Application for a Mining Lease **(\"Application\")** in respect of a portion of Reko Diq of just less than 100 square kilometers situated within the boundaries of License EL-5 **(Exhibit CE-6).** The Application was supported by the Feasibility Study and other documents required by the BM Rules.\n\n49.\n\nOn 3 March 2011, TCC notified the Government of Balochistan of Claimant\u2019s intention to purchase the Government\u2019s 25% interest in the Reko Diq project in order to pursue the project as the sole Participating Party pursuant to the CHEJVA.\n\n50.\n\nOn 15 September 2011, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that an unnamed Chinese company had approached the Government of Balochistan with a proposal for mine development at Reko Diq **(Exhibit CE-25).**\n\n51.\n\nOn 21 September 2011, the Licensing Authority issued a notice of its intent to reject Claimant\u2019s Application (the **\"Notice\"; Exhibit CE-7)** as *\"not satisfactory\"* and granted Claimant 30 days to submit a response.\n\n52.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, Claimant submitted its Response to the Notice **(Exhibit CE-8).** On the same date, Claimant also submitted a Notice of Dispute under the CHEJVA to the Government of Balochistan **(Exhibit CE-9),** which invited the Government to enter into consultations to reach an amicable resolution of the dispute. In a letter sent the following day, Claimant further informed Respondent that a denial of the Mining Lease would deprive Claimant of its investment in the Reko Diq project and constitute an expropriation within the meaning of Article 7 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.\n\n53.\n\nBy order of 15 November 2011, the Licensing Authority rejected Claimant\u2019s Application **(Exhibit CE-11).** On 28 November 2011, TCCP filed an administrative appeal against the order **(Exhibit CE-36).** On 23 February 2012, a day after the Balochistan Mines & Mineral Development Department of the Licensing Authority **(\"MMDD\")** submitted its reply to TCCP\u2019s administrative appeal **(Exhibit CE-129),** the Parties were informed that the appeal would be heard approximately two weeks later. The next day, however, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the Licensing Authority to decide on the appeal on 3 March 2012 **(Exhibit CE-131).** Following a hearing on 2 and 3 March 2012, TCCP learned that its administrative appeal had been denied by order of 3 March 2012 **(Exhibit CE-137).**\n\n**D. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThis section contains a short summary of the Parties\u2019 respective positions. As with the summary of the dispute set out in the preceding section, this summary should not be regarded as the Tribunal\u2019s prejudgment of any issues of fact or law that are to be resolved at a later stage of these proceedings.\n\n**I. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nClaimant contends that through exploration and feasibility activities which have consumed over ten years and hundreds of millions of dollars, Claimant and TCCP have done everything necessary to earn a legal entitlement to a mining lease for Reko Diq. Claimant claims that Balochistan has denied the mining lease and is now moving to either develop Reko Diq on its own, or to transfer some or all of it to third parties. Claimant asserts that Respondent and Balochistan have deprived Claimant of its right to a mining lease in breach of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty and that they threaten to make this deprivation permanent unless the Tribunal grants the provisional measures Claimant seeks.2\n\nRequest, paras. 112 *et seq.*\n\n**1. Authority of the Tribunal to Grant Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to recommend provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules. Claimant submits that the Tribunal merely needs to have *prima facie* jurisdiction on the merits in order to recommend provisional measures. According to Claimant, such *prima facie* jurisdiction is established pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 13 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty because (i) Claimant tried, but failed, to resolve the dispute with Respondent through negotiations pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (ii) Claimant is an Australian *\"investor\"* under Articles 1(1)(c) and (d) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (iii) Claimant holds a protected *\"investment\"* within the meaning of Articles 1(1)(a) and 2(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, and the dispute relates to and arises directly out of this *\"investment\"* within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (iv) the Parties consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.3\n\nRequest, paras. 119 et *seq.*\n\n57.\n\nClaimant states that it is a well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of ICSID tribunals that the provisional measures *\"recommended\"* by an ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory.4\n\nRequest, para. 118.\n\n**2. Right to Mine Reko Diq**\n-----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nClaimant submits that the right that it requests the Tribunal to preserve through provisional measures is Claimant\u2019s right to mine in Reko Diq and benefit from its alleged investments there.5 Claimant contends that it not only satisfied but in fact exceeded the requirements for being granted a mining lease as set forth under the CHEJVA and the BM Rules.6 Claimant submits that the Licensing Authority\u2019s discretion under the BM Rules is limited to determining whether the license applicant has satisfied what the CHEJVA describes as *\"routine Government requirements\"7*\n\nRequest, para. 129.\n\nRequest, paras. 129 *et seq.;* Reply, paras. 62 *et seq.*\n\nReply, para. 67.\n\n59.\n\nClaimant asserts that Balochistan denied its Application on unsupportable grounds. Claimant states that the Licensing Authority manifestly failed to exercise its discretion appropriately. Claimant alleges that Balochistan and Respondent planned to obtain the expert feasibility work from Claimant and then oust it from Reko Diq.8\n\nRequest, paras. 132 *et seq.;* Reply, paras. 68 *et seq.*\n\n60.\n\nClaimant rejects as a mischaracterization Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Licensing Authority\u2019s rejection of Claimant\u2019s application was *\"overseen\"* by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and argues that, instead, the Court suspended its own proceedings on the ground that this matter fell within the domain of the Government of Balochistan.9\n\nReply, paras. 72 *et seq.*\n\n61.\n\nClaimant submits that the BM Rules did not require TCC to undertake a full feasibility study of all the discovered deposits in the proposed Mining Area.10 Further, Claimant asserts that neither the CHEJVA nor the BM Rules require an applicant to limit the scope of the mining lease to a single deposit.11\n\nReply, para. 83.\n\nReply, para. 87.\n\n62.\n\nClaimant submits that, without the mining lease, it cannot further develop Reko Diq and therefore cannot earn any return on its considerable investments: its investments will be destroyed and its legitimate expectations denied.12 Claimant also submits that it has at this stage established at least a *prima facie* case that it has a right to mine Reko Diq and, accordingly, is entitled to specific performance enforcing that right.13\n\nRequest, para. 133.\n\nRequest, para. 135; Reply, para. 61.\n\n**3. Right to Specific Performance**\n------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimant seeks provisional measures to preserve the right to specific performance as a remedy for Respondent\u2019s alleged breaches of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.14\n\nReply, para. 61.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant submits that nothing in the Australia-Pakistan Treaty or the ICSID Convention prevents an investor from seeking restitution in the form of specific performance instead of through monetary compensation. To hold otherwise would render meaningless the specific conditions under which an expropriation is permitted under Article 7 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.15\n\nReply, para. 92.\n\n65.\n\nClaimant states that international law provides for *\"restitution\",* which includes specific performance, as a *\"preferred\"* remedy unless it is *\"materially impossible or wholly disproportionate\".* In support of this statement, Claimant relies on Article 35 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the award in *CMS v. Argentina16***(Exhibit CA-15)**\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,* Award of 12 May 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8; Request, para. 134; Reply, paras. 90 *et seq.*\n\n66.\n\nClaimant also looks to the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Enron***17 (Exhibit CA-16),** where the arbitral tribunal observed that *\"[a]n examination of the powers of international courts and tribunals to order measures concerning performance or injunction and of the ample practice that is available in this respect, leaves this Tribunal in no doubt about the fact that these powers are indeed available.\"*\n\nClaimant further cites *Micula***18 (Exhibit CA-17),** in which the tribunal observed that *\"[u]nder the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has the power to order pecuniary or non-pecuniary remedies, including restitution, i.e., re-establishing the situation which existed before a wrongful act was committed.\"19*\n\n*Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3.\n\n*Ioan Micula v. Romania,* Decision on Jurisdiction an Admissibility of 24 September 2008 (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20).\n\n*Micula,* para. 166.\n\n67.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent cannot rely on the Decision on Provisional Measures in *Occidental20* **(Exhibit RLA-1)** because, in the case at hand, Respondent and Balochistan have not yet taken any irreversible steps that might render specific performance impossible.21\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation & Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007 (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11).\n\nReply, para. 97.\n\n**4. Circumstances Warranting Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nClaimant submits that the circumstances require provisional measures pursuant to Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules as they show *\"urgency\"* and *\"a risk of harm\"22*\n\nRequest, para. 136.\n\n**a) Urgency**\n--------------\n\n69.\n\nClaimant submits that it is settled law that provisional measures are appropriate in urgent circumstances where *\"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before* [a] *final decision is taken\"23* According to Claimant, the current situation is urgent because Balochistan is ready to take immediate steps that will permanently deprive Claimant of its alleged right to mine Reko Diq. Claimant asserts that the requirement of urgency is met when *\"a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits. \"24*\n\nRequest, para. 138.\n\nRequest, para. 138.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant asserts that due to the following developments it is not possible to await the outcome of the Award on the Merits:\n\n\u2022 As stated in Dr. Mubarakmand\u2019s Witness Statement, a meeting of the Board of Governors of the Reko Diq Copper/Gold Project, with the Chief Minister of Balochistan as Chairman and Dr. Mubarakmand as Co-Chairman, took place on 12 September 2012 and the Government of Balochistan *\"resolved to grant permission for the project to begin operations at area H-4\"* (Witness Statement of Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, para. 20);\n\n\u2022 Respondent states in the Response that if the Tribunal were to grant provisional measures enjoining the Government from taking further steps to develop the Reko Diq Mining Area, *\"[t]he Government\u2019s efforts to develop H4 would be brought to a standstill including the preparation for the excavation of the ore due to commence in 6 months and the construction of a smelter\"* (Response, para. 117);\n\n\u2022 The work plan and timeline for the Balochistan Copper/Gold Project at deposit H4 attached as Annex 6 to Dr. Mubarakmand\u2019s Witness Statement **(\"H4 Work Plan\")** show that there will be an initial mobilization at the site within three months, and by mid-December 2012, test drilling will begin and a temporary camping site will be established at Reko Diq (Annex 6 to Witness Statement of Dr. Samar Mubarakmand).\n\nRespondent\u2019s plans to develop H4 are addressed in further detail below.\n\n71.\n\nWith respect to urgency in particular, Claimant also refers to the following developments:\n\n\u2022 Press announcements of the Chief Minister of Balochistan that Balochistan is taking measures to run Reko Diq by itself **(Exhibits CE-144** and **CE-146);**\n\n\u2022 Publication by the Government of Balochistan of several notices seeking senior technical and administrative personnel and tenders seeking advanced office equipment for the *\"Reko Diq Copper Gold Project\"* it would develop **(Exhibits CE-125, CE-127** and **CE-133);**\n\n\u2022 Reports by news outlets that a technical team would soon begin work at the Reko Diq site and that Balochistan had allocated budgetary resources to develop the site **(Exhibits CE-134** and **CE-146** to **CE-148);**\n\n\u2022 A news report that the Federal Government had granted *\"Export Processing Zone\"* status to Reko Diq, thereby conferring a favorable tax and duty regime upon Balochistan\u2019s government-run Reko Diq Copper/Gold Project **(Exhibit CE-142);**\n\n\u2022 Restrictions placed on Claimant\u2019s expatriate staff by Balochistan and Respondent preventing the staff from accessing the Reko Diq site, which make it impossible for Claimant to supervise the temporary closure of the site and secure its equipment and assets there;\n\n\u2022 Reports that employees of a competitor mining company, accompanied by Balochistan officials, accessed the Reko Diq site in early July 2012 and took samples from the deposits identified in Claimant\u2019s studies **(Exhibit CE-149)25**\n\nRequest, para. 139.\n\n**b) Risk of Harm**\n-------------------\n\n72.\n\nClaimant submits that there is a substantial risk of harm if no provisional measures are granted.26 Claimant asserts that the Government of Balochistan\u2019s imminent actions would create *faits accomplis* that would be difficult, if not impossible, to undo. If one or more mining leases were granted to a Balochistan entity and/or third parties, new rights and obligations would be created under provincial mining law, and the new leaseholder or leaseholders would, in turn, enter into numerous contracts and supply agreements with other parties. It would be difficult to extinguish these rights, and in the event the Tribunal decided to grant relief to Claimant, this would undoubtedly give rise to numerous and protracted legal disputes. Furthermore, Claimant states that there is a considerable risk that the construction or mining activities undertaken by Balochistan or a third party lacking Claimant\u2019s expertise would reduce the commercial prospects of the Reko Diq site. Claimant submits that enforcement of a final award in Claimant\u2019s favor would be impossible as a practical matter under such circumstances.27\n\nRequest, para. 140\n\nRequest, paras. 141 *et seq.*\n\n73.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tanjeel deposit (H4) forms an integral part of TCC\u2019s overall plans for Reko Diq and cannot simply be excised from the project. This is evidenced by the fact that TCC has consistently planned to extract ore from Tanjeel and has expended considerable time, effort and money in furtherance of this goal.\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Balochistan\u2019s planned construction, extraction and processing activities within the Reko Diq Mining Area would risk rendering specific performance of Claimant\u2019s right to mine Reko Diq impossible for the following reasons: (i) the project was purposefully designed so that, if warranted by prevailing economic conditions, it could eventually support expanded operations, in particular in Tanjeel; (ii) Balochistan would implement mine designs, choose processing methods and construct infrastructure that would almost certainly have a detrimental effect on the long-term efficiencies and returns of TCC\u2019s mining operation; (iii) Balochistan\u2019s copper mining operation will affect a much greater portion of the Reko Diq Mining Area than the five square kilometers specified in the Response; (iv) Balochistan\u2019s lack of experience in developing sustainable projects may have far-reaching and long-term effects, e.g., in the form of leakage from tailings areas, adverse effects from dust dispersion and a failure to plan for important remediation of environmental impacts following the closure of the mine; and (v) the name *\"Reko Diq Copper/Gold Project\"* suggests that the project will be extended to other parts of Reko Diq because there is no exploitable gold at the Tanjeel deposit.28\n\nReply, paras. 108 *et seq.*\n\n75.\n\nClaimant cites the Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures in *City Oriente29***(Exhibit CA-18),** where the arbitral tribunal concluded that:\n\n*\"[u]pon weighing the interests at stake, the Arbitral Tribunal must choose to protect the possibility of enforcing a hypothetical award favorable to Claimant, even at the cost of temporarily depriving Respondents\u2019* (sic) *of their contractual right to self-protection. Thus, given that Claimant has already commenced arbitration proceedings demanding performance of the Contract, Claimant has a right to request that Respondents refrain from performing any act that may lead to the early termination of the Contract.\"*\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and Other Procedural Matters of 13 May 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21.\n\n76.\n\nClaimant concludes that, without provisional measures, imminent actions by the Government of Balochistan threaten to destroy Claimant\u2019s investment and, as a practical matter, deprive the Tribunal of the opportunity to grant a performance remedy.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the practical effect of denying provisional measures would be to deny Claimant the right to seek specific performance and obtain the mining lease before the Tribunal has had the opportunity to reach a final determination on that issue. Claimant states that the loss of the right to mine Reko Diq would not be adequately reparable by an award of damages as the Reko Diq site is an *\"irreplaceable asset\".* Claimant submits that decades of exploration work, consuming tens of billions of dollars, have not uncovered a truly equivalent property. Claimant asserts that, since there is a possibility that it may be economically feasible to extract more of the mineral resources at Reko Diq in the future, any award of damages would likely undercompensate Claimant.30\n\nRequest, paras. 143 *et seq.*\n\n78.\n\nIn support of its argument, Claimant cites the Decision on Provisional Measures in *Perenco31* **(Exhibit CA-12),** in which the tribunal found provisional measures to be\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* Decision on Provisional Measures of 8 May 2009, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/06.\n\n**c) Balance of Harms**\n-----------------------\n\n79.\n\nClaimant submits that international tribunals typically assess whether the harm likely to result if the provisional measures are not ordered substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the interim relief is directed. If provisional measures are ordered, Claimant argues, all Respondent faces is a temporary hold on work at Reko Diq pending the outcome of this dispute. Even if Respondent were to prevail in this arbitration, the Government of Balochistan could still carry out its plans to dispose of the asset or run the project itself, thereby enjoying the substantial direct and indirect benefits of the mining operations over the long life of the mine. By contrast, if provisional measures are not granted, the imminent actions of Balochistan would be effectively irreversible.32\n\nRequest, paras. 150 *et seq.*\n\n80.\n\nClaimant states that any harm that Respondent alleges it will suffer is self-inflicted and could have been avoided had Respondent observed its obligations under the Australia-Pakistan Treaty and Balochistan observed its obligations under the CHEJVA and the BM Rules.33\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\n81.\n\nClaimant asserts that, as compared to the 1,500 jobs envisaged by the PC-1 Proposal, the mining project planned by TCC would create up to 11,500 jobs in the construction phase and more than 2,500 full-time jobs in the operating phase. Further, Claimant notes that even though it viewed a smelter built and operated by Balochistan or a third party as being unnecessary for the processing method applied, Claimant nevertheless did not object to supplying copper concentrate to this planned smelter. According to Claimant, the calculations on which the PC-1 Proposal is based do not take into consideration the significant capital and operating costs that are involved in mining, producing and processing copper. Claimant states that the mining project as contemplated by Claimant in the Feasibility Study, if properly managed, would be in operation for at least 56 years and provide substantial direct and indirect benefits to Balochistan, Respondent and any private stakeholders.34\n\nRequest, paras. 155 *et seq:,* Reply, paras. 118 *et seq.*\n\n**d) Risk of Aggravation of the Dispute**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nClaimant states that it is further well established that ICSID tribunals, like other international tribunals, may order provisional measures to prevent aggravation of the dispute. In particular, Claimant cites in this regard the Decision on Provisional Measures in *Perenco* **(Exhibit CA-12)** and Procedural Order No. 1 in *Burlington35***(Exhibit CA-14)**\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador (formerly Burlington Resources, Inc., and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)),* Procedural Order No. 1 on Provisional Measures of 29 June 2009, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5.\n\n83.\n\nClaimant accepts Respondent\u2019s view that non-aggravation of the dispute is not an independent ground on which to grant provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention but that the added requirements of necessity and urgency must also be met.36\n\nReply, para. 128.\n\n84.\n\nClaimant submits that its right to avoid aggravation of the dispute deserves to be protected through the recommendation of provisional measures (i) to allow the Tribunal sufficient time to decide the issues in dispute without a Party taking justice into its own hands and rendering the resolution of the dispute more difficult, costly and time-consuming; and (ii) to prevent the relationship between the Parties from worsening, in order not to complicate or preclude a future collaboration between the Parties in the event of a settlement or necessary future collaboration.37\n\nRequest, paras. 161 *et seq.;* Reply, paras. 129 *et seq.*\n\n**II. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. No Authority of the Tribunal to Grant Provisional Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nAs regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Respondent makes the following arguments: (i) the matters in dispute are before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which will state the law of Pakistan definitively with respect to the interpretation of the CHEJVA and the application of the relevant legislation; (ii) the terms of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty are under review by the Governments of Australia and Pakistan, in particular the issue of whether the BIT should apply to Claimant as a company owned and controlled by non-Australian companies; (iii) Claimant\u2019s voluntary participation in court proceedings in Pakistan prevents it from invoking the right to arbitration in Article 13 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (iv) public interest overwhelmingly favors the Government of Balochistan\u2019s proceeding with the H4 project without further delay and (v) Claimant has made an application for provisional measures in the parallel ICC arbitration that seeks the same relief against Balochistan.38\n\nResponse, paras. 23 *et seq.;* Rejoinder, paras. 8 *et seq.* and 41.\n\n86.\n\nRespondent refers to the decision on Provisional Measures in *Occidental* **(\"Exhibit RLA-1),** which states that *\"in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm,* (emphasis in the original)\"39 Respondent submits that the power to grant specific performance is not explicit in the ICSID Convention and that no ICSID tribunal has ordered a state to grant rights to an investor over its natural resources as a final or interim remedy.40\n\n*Occidental,* para. 61.\n\nResponse, paras. 1 *et seq.* and 28-29.\n\n**2. No Right to Mine Reko Diq**\n--------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent states that, even though Claimant sought a mining lease over the entire Reko Diq area which contains at least 14 known deposits, the Feasibility Study was limited to only two deposits, i.e., H14 and H15. Respondent submits that a project of this size has never previously been contemplated in Balochistan or Pakistan and that, therefore, the governmental mechanisms for putting it into effect cannot be considered \"routine\".41\n\nResponse, paras. 39 *et seq.*\n\n88.\n\nRespondent submits that the BM Rules make clear that when the Government enters into mineral agreements with companies or other entities, these agreements are subject to the BM Rules and the discretion of the Licensing Authority, which is in turn advised exclusively by the Mines Committee consisting of officials of the Directorate General of Mines and Minerals.42 Respondent states that the Licensing Authority is not a party to the CHEJVA and is not bound by any attempt to \"agree in advance or to preordain the result of the application of the mining rules and the exercise of the statutory discretion to grant or to refuse an application for a mining lease\".43\n\nResponse, paras. 45 *et seq.*\n\nResponse, para. 59.\n\n89.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant lacks any right or title to mine in the Reko Diq Mining Area because its Application was rejected by the Licensing Authority.44 Respondent submits that, under the BM Rules, the Licensing Authority has broad discretion to refuse a mining lease application if it believes that this would not be in the interest of the development of Balochistan\u2019s mineral resources. Respondent submits that the Licensing Authority properly exercised its discretion under the BM Rules to refuse Claimant\u2019s Application. According to Respondent, Claimant had no *locus standi* under the BM Rules to apply for the mining license because the Joint Venture, not Claimant, was the holder of License EL-5.45\n\nResponse, para. 50.\n\nResponse, paras. 90 *et seq.;* Rejoinder, paras. 5 *et seq.*\n\n90.\n\nRespondent asserts that, under the BM Rules, mining lease applications can be refused in the public interest and for failure to provide for additional value.46\n\nRejoinder, para. 53.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent submits that the issues of the validity and legality of the CHEJVA, Addendum No. 1 and the Novation Agreement are currently before the Supreme Court of Pakistan and have been pending since 2007. Respondent notes that the signatory to the CHEVJA on behalf of the BDA, then BDA Chairman Mr. Ata Muhammad Jafar, was later convicted of corruption. Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s reliance on the *ultra vires* joint venture contracts is misplaced because, whether or not they are declared by the Supreme Court of Pakistan as void *ab initio* under applicable law, they do not contain any promise to grant a mining lease to Claimant.47\n\nResponse, paras. 53 *et seq.*\n\n92.\n\nRespondent argues that, even if Claimant succeeds in establishing that the BM Rules entitle it to a mining lease, this would be in relation to a certain mine or mineral deposit, in accordance with the procedure set out in the CHEJVA. Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s Application related to at least 14 mineral deposits contained in Reko Diq, while the Feasibility Study related only to the two mineral deposits at H14 and H15. Respondent argues that Claimant failed to follow the procedures in the joint venture contracts in relation to the other mineral deposits in Reko Diq; it unilaterally submitted an application for the entire 99,483 square kilometers in breach of the joint venture contracts.48\n\nResponse, 77; Rejoinder, para. 58.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant applied for a mining lease as the holder of License EL-5 even though this license was granted to the Joint Venture and not to Claimant. Thus, pursuant to the CHEJVA, it was the property of the Joint Venture and not of Claimant.49\n\nResponse, 81.\n\n94.\n\nRespondent argues that the Licensing Authority gave Claimant sufficient notice of its intent to refuse the Application and thus provided Claimant with an opportunity for it to amend its Application - which Claimant did not do.50\n\nResponse, paras. 91 *et seq.*\n\n**3. No Legitimate Expectation**\n--------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant was well aware, or that it ought to have been plain to a prudent investor in Claimant\u2019s position, that the legislative framework applicable to mining titles as set out in the BM Rules provides the Licensing Authority with extremely wide discretion to refuse a mining lease application. Further, Claimant should have appreciated that an exploration license could not automatically be converted to a mining lease, and that the provisions of the Joint Venture contracts did not contain such a guarantee.51\n\nResponse, para. 97.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent states that Claimant could not expect that the lease of the entire area of 99,473 square kilometers for which it applied would be granted by the Licensing Authority, particularly because the Feasibility Study related only to 6 square kilometers (deposits H14 and H15).52 In the Rejoinder, Respondent contends that the *\"feasibilities or pre-feasibilities were made in relation to mineral deposits, namely H4, H14 and H15, and not areas in terms of square kilometres.\"53*\n\nResponse, para. 98; Rejoinder, para. 17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 44.\n\n97.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant\u2019s expectation that the CHEJVA gave rise to an entitlement to a mining lease is wrong for the following reasons: (i) the CHEJVA does not make such a representation or promise, but rather, Article 5.9 of the CHEJVA provides that the parties shall *\"seek an assurance from the Provincial Government, namely that the Joint Venture shall have the right to apply for a mining lease\"',* and (ii) pursuant to Rules 9(4) and 9(5) of the BM Rules, and as a matter of common law and common sense, such a guarantee by the Government of Balochistan in an agreement would be unenforceable and void.54 According to Respondent, Claimant was never given an assurance within the meaning of Article 5.9 of the CHEJVA by the Government of Balochistan.\n\nResponse, para. 99; Rejoinder, paras. 47 *et seq.*\n\n**4. No Right to Specific Performance**\n---------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nRespondent submits that it is established as a matter of customary international law that a State controls its own natural resources and no international tribunal can compel a State to transfer title to natural resources. Respondent states that the ICSID cases cited by Claimant in support of specific performance do not address the question of whether specific performance can be ordered where title to natural resources is at stake.55 According to Respondent, the reasoning in *Occidental* applies here, namely that *\"where a State has, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, put an end to a contract or a license, or any other foreign investor\u2019s entitlement, specific performance must be deemed legally impossible.\"56* Respondent submits that by denying Claimant\u2019s application for a mining lease, the Licensing Authority put an end to the CHEJVA.57\n\nRejoinder, paras. 57 *et seq.* referring to the cases of *Micula, Enron* and *Burlington.*\n\n*Occidental,* para. 79\n\nRejoinder, paras. 69 *et seq.*\n\n99.\n\nRespondent concludes that, should the Tribunal find liability to exist in this case, the only remedy available to Claimant is damages.58\n\nRejoinder, para. 71.\n\n**5. Circumstances Do Not Warrant Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) No Urgency and Necessity**\n-------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that there are circumstances of urgency and necessity that merit the grant of provisional measures. According to Respondent, Balochistan has no current intention of granting mining rights over Reko Diq to a third party or parties.59\n\nResponse, para. 104.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent submits that the Government of Balochistan\u2019s plans are limited to mining 5.08 square kilometres at deposit H4 of Reko Diq in order to meet Pakistan\u2019s domestic copper consumption needs. Further, Respondent states that the Government of Balochistan has no intention to extend its current development plans to the rest of Reko Diq.60\n\nResponse, para. 104.\n\n102.\n\nRespondent submits that Balochistan will only mine at deposit H4 at an initial rate of 15,000 tons per day. Considering that Claimant\u2019s plan is to mine 110,000 tons of ore per day at deposits H14 and Hl5 on the basis of an initial 30-year mining lease over an area of 99,473 square kilometres, it is inconceivable that Respondent\u2019s activities could cause any harm to Claimant, let alone harm of an irreparable nature. Respondent concludes that damages are an adequate remedy and, in fact, the only available remedy; none of Balochistan\u2019s actions with respect to Reko Diq during the pendency of these proceedings will compromise Claimant\u2019s ability to claim monetary compensation as part of the final award.61\n\nResponse, paras. 106 *et seq.*\n\n**b) Balance of Harms Not at Issue**\n------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nRespondent claims that arguments as to the *\"balance of convenience\"* come into play only where the requirements of necessity, urgency and \"an arguable case\" are met. Respondent submits that Claimant is unable to prove that these requirements are met here.62\n\nResponse, para. 116.\n\n104.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent states that Claimant\u2019s project, which requires that a pipeline of 682 kilometers be constructed through inhospitable territory with major security concerns, cannot be realized in practice. Respondent states that, in view of likely terrorist attacks on the pipeline, the security of the project cannot be guaranteed.63\n\nRejoinder, paras. 20 *et seq.*\n\n105.\n\nRespondent explains that the project is politically unacceptable for the Federal Government and the Government of Balochistan given the strength of public opinion against it in the absence of economic benefits to the people of Balochistan.64\n\nRejoinder, paras. 15 *et seq.*\n\n106.\n\nRespondent rejects as untenable Claimant\u2019s concerns that its mining project in relation to H4 would damage the deposit or the environment.65\n\nRejoinder, paras. 26 *et seq.*\n\n107.\n\nRespondent states that Claimant\u2019s conduct can be interpreted both as a deliberate attempt to conceal the extent of the mineral deposits in Reko Diq and mislead the Government of Balochistan, as well as an act of bad faith.66\n\nRejoinder, para. 37.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent asserts that there is a political and economic need for the Balochistan Copper/Gold Project.\n\n**c) No Aggravation of the Dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nCiting *Cemex v. Venezuela67* **(Exhibit CA 26),** Respondent submits that the *\"nonaggravation of the dispute\"* is not an independent ground on which to grant provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. The added requirements of urgency and necessity must be met.68\n\n*Cemex Caracas Investments B. V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B. V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures of 3 March 2010, para. 61.\n\nResponse, para. 112.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent submits that it is unclear how the Government of Balochistan\u2019s proposals with regard to deposit H4 will *\"aggravate the dispute\",* as the only remedy available to Claimant is damages.69\n\nResponse, para. 111.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent claims that the Government\u2019s proposed actions with respect to deposit H4 presently do not involve granting rights to any third parties during the pendency of these proceedings and beyond. Thus, Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures does not help or hinder the Tribunal\u2019s ability to resolve this dispute in any way.70\n\nResponse, para. 111; Rejoinder, paras. 22 *et seq.*\n\n**III. The Parties\u2019 Requests for Relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal to issue an Interim Award ordering that Respondent, during the pendency of this dispute:\n\n*a. refrain from, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan refrain from, taking further steps to develop the Reko Diq Mining Area, or any part thereof, by itself or with third parties;*\n\n*b. refrain from, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan refrain from, selling, leasing, transferring, authorizing or otherwise disposing of the Reko Diq Mining Area, or its interest in the Joint Venture, or any part thereof to any third party;*\n\n*c. refrain from, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan refrain from, breaching the confidentiality provisions of TCC\u2019s Feasibility Study by sharing or disclosing any portion of its contents with any unauthorized persons or entities;*\n\n*d. refrain from, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan refrain from, taking any steps that infringe TCC\u2019s exclusive surface rights under the Surface Rights Lease;*\n\n*e. issue, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan issue, any authorization required to allow TCC\u2019s expatriate staff to work in Pakistan and to travel to and access the Reko Diq site, including work visas, security clearances and No-Objection Certificates; and*\n\n*f. refrain from, and take all steps necessary to ensure that Balochistan refrain from, taking any steps that would unsettle the* status quo, *aggravate the dispute, or render ineffective any ultimate relief granted by the Tribunal.71*\n\nRequest, para. 166; Reply, para. 132.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the application with costs awarded in Respondent\u2019s favor.72\n\nResponse, para. 123; Rejoinder, para 72.\n\n**E. DECISION BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. Legal Framework for the Recommendation of Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"*\n\nThus, there is no question that the Tribunal has the authority to order provisional measures to preserve a party\u2019s rights.\n\n115.\n\nRule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules also states:\n\n*\"At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"*\n\n116.\n\nThus, before *\"recommending\u2019* any provisional measure under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, an arbitral tribunal must be satisfied that two prerequisites are met: (i) that a right exists and (ii) that the circumstances require that the provisional measures be ordered to preserve such right.\n\n117.\n\nThe question of whether the right to be preserved exists goes to the merits of the case which will not be decided at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. It therefore suffices that the party requesting the provisional measure establishes a *prima facie* case that it owns a legally protected interest.73\n\n*Burlington,* para. 53; *Occidental,* para. 64.\n\n118.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules further specify the circumstances under which provisional measures may be granted. This question has, however, been dealt with extensively in various decisions by ICSID tribunals. Pursuant to the well-established jurisprudence of ICSID tribunals, provisional measures may be granted where the situation is urgent and the requested measures are necessary to preserve a party\u2019s right from irreparable harm.74\n\n*Occidental,* para. 61; *Burlington,* para. 82; *Perenco,* para. 43. See also *Cemex,* paras. 44-56.\n\n119.\n\nThis test is in conformity with the practice of the International Court of Justice **(\"ICJ\")** under Article 41 of its Statute, on which Article 47 of the ICSID Convention is modeled.75 Article 41 of the ICJ Statute reads:\n\n*\"1. The Court shall have the power to indicate, if it considers that circumstances so require, any provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n*2. Pending the final decision, notice of the measures suggested shall forthwith be given to the parties and to the Security Council. \"*\n\nL.

Wittich (eds.), *International Investment Law for The 21st Century,* Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 158 *et seq.*\n\n120.\n\nAlthough Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules use the word *\"recommend\u2019,* it is generally recognized that arbitral tribunals are empowered under these provisions to order provisional measures with binding force and that the parties are obliged to comply with such orders.76 The Parties to the present arbitration have not contested the binding nature of provisional measures.\n\n*Occidental,* para. 58; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1 on Request for Provisional Measures, para. 4; *City Oriente,* paras. 51-53. See also *La Grand* (Federal Republic of Germany v. United States), Judgment, 2001 I.C.J. Rep. p. 466 **(Exhibit CA-4),** p. 502 *et seq.* *(\"The contention that provisional measures indicated under Article 41 might not be binding would be contrary to the object and purpose of that Article.\")*\n\n121.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, moreover, an arbitral tribunal may recommend provisional measures before it has decided on whether it has jurisdiction over the dispute. However, the Tribunal, in accordance with the well-established practice of ICSID tribunals,77 will only recommend provisional measures if it is satisfied that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case.\n\n*Burlington,* para. 49; *City Oriente,* para. 50; *Perenco,* para. 39; *Occidental,* para. 55.\n\n122.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal will proceed to determine whether it has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the dispute (II.) and whether provisional measures are required by the circumstances at hand to preserve Claimant\u2019s asserted right to mine Reko Diq (HI).\n\n**II.** ***Prima Facie*** **Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that, in the present circumstances, it has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 13 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.\n\n124.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n*\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally. \"*\n\n125.\n\nIn Article 13 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, it is stated, in relevant part:\n\n\"*1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other Party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.*\n\n*2. If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through consultations and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:*\n\n*(a) in accordance with the law of the Party which admitted the investment, initiate proceedings before that Party's competent judicial or administrative bodies;*\n\n*(b) if both Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Convention\"), refer the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre \") for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or 36 of the Convention;*\n\n*(...)*\n\n*3. Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to paragraph 2(b) of this Article:*\n\n*(a) where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days of receiving such a request from the investor;*\n\n*(...)\"*\n\n126.\n\nPursuant to Article 13(3)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, Respondent agreed to *\"consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days\"* after receiving the Request for Arbitration. On 28 November 2011, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration and consented *\"to submit to the Centre the dispute that is subject of this Request for Arbitration \"78*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 16.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent contests the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for the reasons set out in paragraph 85. As to the second reason - the review of the terms of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty by the two signatory governments with respect to its application to companies owned and controlled by non-Australian companies - the Parties confirmed at the First Session that Australia had advised the Pakistani Government that it has no intention of denying Claimant the benefits of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.79 The Tribunal understands that this issue has become moot.\n\nTranscript, p. 24.\n\n128.\n\nClaimant contends that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to decide on the merits.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it to be preliminarily established that (i) the Parties tried, but failed, to resolve their dispute through negotiations pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (ii) Claimant is an Australian *\"investor\"* under Articles l(1)(c) and (d) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (iii) Claimant holds a protected *\"investment\"* within the meaning of Articles l(1)(a) and 2(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, and the dispute relates to and arises directly out of this *\"investment\"* within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (iv) the Parties consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n130.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is satisfied that its *prima facie* jurisdiction is not affected by the separate proceedings before the Supreme Court of Pakistan to decide on matters relating to the interpretation of the CHEJVA under Pakistani law and the application of the relevant legislation. The reasons why such proceedings *prima facie* cannot affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the present dispute are twofold: Firstly, the subject matter of the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Pakistan is distinct from that of the present arbitration, which deals primarily with an allegation of a breach of Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Australia-Pakistan Treaty and general international law, and not with the interpretation of the CHEJVA under Pakistani law. Secondly, the parties to the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Pakistan differ from those in the present proceedings.\n\n131.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal finds *prima facie* that its jurisdiction is not affected by the ICC arbitration proceedings in which Claimant pursues its rights under the CHEJVA against Balochistan.\n\n132.\n\nFurthermore, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent has not established that Claimant is pursuing its rights under the Australia-Pakistan Treaty in court proceedings in Pakistan. The Tribunal therefore does not have to express its view on whether Article 13 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty contains a fork-in-the-road clause that would preclude submission of this dispute to an international tribunal.\n\n133.\n\nFinally, the question of whether public interest overwhelmingly favors the Government of Balochistan\u2019s proceeding with the H4 project without further delay is a question that goes to the merits and does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**III. Interim Measures for Preserving Claimant\u2019s Asserted Right to Mine Reko Diq**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Right to be Preserved**\n----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nClaimant requests provisional measures for the protection of the asserted right to *\"mine all ore in the Reko Diq Mining Area\"80* because it has satisfied the requirements for receiving a mining lease under both the CHEJVA, in particular Clause 11.8.2, and the BM Rules. Claimant also seeks protection of its asserted right to *\"restitution in the form of specific performance\"81* as a remedy for Respondent\u2019s failure to grant TCC the mining lease. In addition hereto, Claimant pursues its request in order to prevent the aggravation of the dispute.\n\nCf. Reply, para. 61.\n\nReply, para. 93.\n\n135.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, denies that Claimant has the right to a mining lease or any right capable of enforcement by specific performance.\n\n136.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 submissions regarding the existence of the asserted right to be preserved raise complex questions of law and fact. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, they are unsuitable for decision before a full hearing on the merits of the case.\n\n137.\n\nAt this early stage in the proceedings, the Tribunal cannot assume that Claimant does not have the rights or remedies to which it asserts it is entitled, including any right capable of enforcement by specific performance. To make this assumption would be tantamount to deciding the merits of the case in Respondent\u2019s favor based only on the evidence and argumentation that has been presented thus far. Accordingly, for the purpose of deciding on the Request, the Tribunal will assume that Claimant will succeed on these points, and turn its focus to the question of whether the circumstances in the present case require that provisional measures be ordered for the preservation of the asserted rights.\n\n**2. Circumstances Requiring Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nAs set out above, provisional measures may be ordered where the situation is urgent and the requested measures are necessary to preserve the asserted right from irreparable harm. Claimant bases the Request on two scenarios, which it set out during the Hearing. In the first scenario, Respondent limits its mining activities to deposit H4 (Tanjeel). In the second scenario, Respondent expands its activities to deposit H15.82 The Tribunal must therefore determine with regard to both scenarios whether the requirements of urgency and necessity are met.\n\nTranscript, p. 190 and 192.\n\n**a) Urgency**\n--------------\n\n139.\n\nAs regards the first scenario, the element of urgency is not disputed between the Parties. Indeed, Respondent itself stated during the Hearing that it intends to commence mining activities at deposit H4 within the next few months. At the Hearing, Respondent\u2019s Counsel stated that \"[y]es; *there will be mining in the H4 deposit within the space of the coming year*.\"83 Assuming that Claimant is correct that Respondent\u2019s mining activities would cause it irreparable harm by limiting or even closing off completely Claimant\u2019s ability to mine at Tanjeel, there is no question that the situation is urgent.\n\nTranscript, p. 226.\n\n140.\n\nIn contrast, it remains unclear whether the situation is urgent with respect to the second scenario, i.e., deposits other than H4, in particular H14 and H15.\n\n141.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent will most likely expand its activities to H15.84 In further support of this submission, Claimant adduced a Third Witness Statement by Mr. Timothy Livesey following the Hearing, in which Mr. Livesey attests that on 4 November 2012, a local employee of TCC encountered a convoy of vehicles traveling to the Reko Diq site led by an employee of Balochistan\u2019s Reko Diq Copper/Gold Project, Mr. Rehmat Ullah, and that some of the convoy\u2019s vehicles and drivers had been supplied by the nearby mining project operated by MCC. The Third Witness Statement contains three photographs which show off-road cars in a desert landscape. According to Mr. Livesey, the photographs on pages 2 and 3 of the Third Witness Statement show the convoy at the Tanjeel deposit and the photo on page 4 of the Third Witness Statement shows the convoy at deposit H15.\n\nTranscript, p. 192 *et seq.*\n\n142.\n\nIn his oral testimony given at the Hearing, Dr. Samar Mubarakmand stated that Balochistan had no present intention to develop the deposits H14 and H15.85 This statement was confirmed by Counsel for Respondent who submitted that *\"the Government has no present intention to do other than implement the plan that it has proposed for H-4; it has no present intention to develop H-14 or H-15, or any other deposit covered by the application for the mining links; and it has no present intention to give any rights whatsoever to any third parties (..*).\"86\n\nTranscript, p. 128 *et seq.*\n\nTranscript, p. 205 *et seq.*\n\n143.\n\nUpon questioning by the Tribunal as to whether Respondent would give an undertaking to the Tribunal as to any grant of rights to third parties, Counsel for Respondent declined to do so, stating that *\"the Government does not feel it appropriate, as a sovereign government, to give undertakings over what it considers to be its sovereign property and its sovereign rights'\",* which included the right *\"to develop H-14 and H-15 in due course if it chooses to do so.\"87*\n\nTranscript, p. 206.\n\n144.\n\nCounsel for Respondent did, however, state that *\"the Government has given (...) assurances such as have been set out in the pleading.\"88* Counsel for Respondent further stated that by *\"Government\"* he referred to both governments, i.e., of Respondent and Balochistan. Finally, Counsel for Respondent confirmed that *\"[i]f there is a change of position, a change of mind, the governments will give immediate notice\", \"first of all to the people of both the Province and the nation; secondly, it will be to the Supreme Court; and, thirdly, it will be to this Tribunal.\"89* By letter of 19 November 2012, Counsel for Respondent confirmed that this assurance *\"stands good, the Government has not changed its plans and that there is no urgent need for Provisional Measures.\"* By letter dated 30 November 2012, Counsel for Respondent again affirmed the assurance given.\n\nTranscript, p. 206.\n\nTranscript, p. 206 *et seq.*\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the assurances given by Counsel for Respondent, which Respondent renewed in in its letter dated 19 November 2012, that Respondent will immediately inform the Tribunal and Claimant if there is any change to Respondent\u2019s present intention to limit its activities to H4. In view of the position taken by Respondent, the Tribunal, for the time being, will presume that Respondent does not intend to expand its mining activities beyond deposit H4. The assurances given by Respondent are reflected in the decision on the Request.\n\n**b) Necessity**\n----------------\n\n146.\n\nThis leaves the question of whether Respondent\u2019s planned mining activities in the H4 area will, during the period before the final award, cause harm to Claimant which is *\"irreparable\",* i.e., which cannot be repaired by an award of damages or subsequent work of repair.\n\n147.\n\nThe burden is on Claimant to show that this is likely to happen in the absence of provisional measures.\n\n148.\n\nAs regards the harm to its mining project in the first scenario, Claimant has offered written testimony of Mr. Livesey, who in his First Witness Statement states that there is *\"substantial risk\"* of *\"irremediable harm\"90* to TCC\u2019s planned project if Balochistan or a third party were to begin construction or mining at the Reko Diq site because they might (i) render a portion of the viable mineral resource inaccessible due to improper placement of infrastructure or inadequate mining,91 (ii) enter into supply and service agreements with unsuitable subcontractors,92 and (iii) carry out substandard construction work with a view toward short-term profits to the detriment of long-term potential.93 Moreover, Mr. Livesey states in his First Witness Statement that *\"additional harmful possibilities that may result from inexpert operations are environmental damage, poor labor conditions, or diminished welfare in the local community.\"94*\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 95.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 96.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 98.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 99.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 101. See also Second Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, paras. 21-23.\n\n149.\n\nIn his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Livesey states that *\"Tanjeel forms an integral part of TCC\u2019s planned mining project and cannot simply be excised from the project without significantly impacting the economics of TCC\u2019s mining venture at Reko Diq,\"95* which would permanently impair *\"the \u2018optionality\u2019, or flexibility of TCC\u2019s mining project. \"96*\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 19.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey, para. 20.\n\n150.\n\nThe above statements are all based on possible mistakes which Balochistan might make when mining at deposit H4. There is no evidence that Balochistan or Respondent intends to do any of these things. Nor is there evidence that Respondent\u2019s planned mining activities in deposit H4 will have the significant impact on the economics of TCC\u2019s mining venture that Claimant alleges. The Tribunal also notes that Claimant did not propose to expand its activities to deposit H4 for six years after it started mining at deposits H14 and H15. Indeed, at the Hearing, Counsel for Claimant stated that *\"Tanjeel would get going six years later as part of the project.\"97*\n\n[]\n\n151.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, at present, there is insufficient evidence on record to show that provisional measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm. However, the Tribunal notes that the H4 Work Plan is fairly general and does not provide any details about the work specifically envisaged by Respondent with respect to deposit H4. The Tribunal therefore requests Respondent to inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular basis, about its specific plans and activities with respect to deposit H4.\n\n152.\n\nIn the remaining parts (c) to (f) of the Request, Claimant further requests the Tribunal to order Respondent or Balochistan to refrain from breaching the confidentiality provisions of TCC\u2019s Feasibility Study, infringing TCC\u2019s exclusive surface rights under the Surface Rights Lease, and unsettling the *status quo,* aggravating the dispute or rendering ineffective any ultimate relief granted by the Tribunal. Finally, Claimant requests the Tribunal to order that Respondent or Balochistan issue any authorizations necessary for TCC\u2019s expatriate staff to work in Pakistan and travel to and access the Reko Diq site.\n\n153.\n\nIn its pleadings, Claimant has based these requests on the same arguments of urgency and necessity without however developing them further during the Hearing. The Tribunal is of the view that in regard to these requests Claimant failed to meet its burden of showing urgency and necessity. This leads the Tribunal to dismiss these parts of the Request.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides as follows:\n\n**1. Respondent shall immediately inform the Tribunal and Claimant of any change of its present intention (i) to implement the H4 Work Plan, (ii) not to expand its mining activities to H14 and/or H15 or to any other deposit within License EL-5 and (iii) not to give any rights in this regard to any third party.**\n\n**2. Respondent shall further inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular basis, about its specific plans and activities with respect to deposit H4.**\n\n**3. The Tribunal remains seized of the matter and shall consider future applications by Claimant if the situation materially changes, in particular in case Respondent (i) materially deviates from the H4 Work Plan, (ii) expands its mining activities to deposits H14 and/or H15 or to any other deposit within License EL-5 or (iii) gives any rights in this regard to any third party.**\n\n**4. Otherwise, the Request is dismissed.**\n\n**5. The Tribunal will decide on the costs related to the Request at a later stage of the arbitral proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons)", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2017-11-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 22 June 2015, Allen & Overy LLP (Allen & Overy) informed the Tribunal that Pakistan had appointed Allen & Overy as counsel to act in the quantum phase of these proceedings and for all other matters going forwards. In its letter Allen & Overy further noted that cogent new evidence of corruption on the part of TCC had very recently been brought to their attention by Pakistan, requesting the Tribunal to cease in the meantime all efforts towards finalizing its award.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 23 June 2015, Claimant objected to Pakistan's attempt to introduce new evidence, particularly of alleged \"*corruption*\" \"*nearly four and a half years after submission of the Mining Lease Application, more than three and a half years after the commencement of this arbitration, and more than eight months after the liability hearing (which,* [they] *note, was followed by the submission of post-hearing briefs)*.\" Claimant further requested the Tribunal to reject Pakistan's improper request to halt its work on the decision.\n\n8.\n\nOn 25 June 2017, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Allen & Overy's communication of 22 June 2015, and of Claimant's letter of 23 June 2015, noting that the Tribunal saw no reason to discontinue its still ongoing deliberations on this case.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 July 2015, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of five witness statements signed by Mr Shehbaz Mandokhail, Sheikh Asmatullah, Mr. Abdul Aziz, Mr. Muhammad Tahir, and Mr. Masood Malik, that it submitted together with its request, and to adopt a new timetable for addressing the new evidence. A copy of Power of Attorney authorizing Allen & Overy to represent the Government of Pakistan in this matter was also attached.\n\n10.\n\nOn 11 August 2015, Claimant filed observations on Respondent's request of 21 July 2015, requesting the Tribunal to rule that the additional evidence should not be admitted.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, Respondent filed a response to Claimant's observations of 11 August 2015.\n\n12.\n\nOn 20 August 2015, the Tribunal fixed a procedural schedule for the Parties' subsequent submissions on Respondent's request for admissibility of new evidence of 21 July 2015, as follows:\n\n\"*Upon careful review of Respondent's letter dated 21 July 2015, Claimant's letter dated 11 August 2015 and Respondent's letter dated 17 August 2015, the Tribunal has decided to grant Respondent leave to file a full submission by 2 September 2015. Claimant will then have the opportunity to reply to Respondent's submission by 7 October 2015; therefore, the Tribunal asks Claimant to reserve its reply to Respondent's letter dated 17 August 2015, as requested by e-mail dated 19 August 2015, for the time being and include any comments that it wishes to make in its reply. The Tribunal reserves all further decisions on the admissibility of the new evidence as well as on any adjustment of the further proceedings until it has received the Parties' submissions.*\"\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 25 August 2015, addressed to Respondent and copying in the members of the Tribunal, Claimant requested that Respondent provide certain information as to the circumstances under which any of the witness statements that Respondent sought to submit to the Tribunal were obtained. In addition, Claimant requested an \"*unequivocal assurance that the confidentiality of communications, in the form of e-mails, phone calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise, between and among its personnel and lawyers, both within and without Pakistan, has been strictly respected, and that those communications have not been and will not be interfered with, monitored, taped, or otherwise compromised.*\"\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 28 August, 2015, addressed to Claimant and copying in the members of the Tribunal, Respondent stated that it would provide the relevant information together with its full submission on 2 September 2015. As to Claimant's second request, Respondent stated that in case Claimant should have an application to make in this **r** egard, it should do so; absent such an application, its statement had no place in international arbitration proceedings.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 August 2015, Claimant filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on confidentiality of communications. In its letter, Claimant requested the Tribunal to direct Pakistan \"*to provide unequivocal assurances that the confidentiality of communications, in the form of e-mails, phone calls, in person conversations, or otherwise, between and among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan, has been strictly respected, and that those communications have not been and will not be monitored, recorded, interfered with, or otherwise compromised*\"; and in the event that Pakistan continued to refuse to provide such assurances, Claimant further requested that the Tribunal direct Pakistan \"*to identify when, how, and which communications between and among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan, had been monitored, recorded, intercepted, or otherwise compromised*.\"\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 September 2015, Respondent filed an Application to Dismiss the Claims (\"**Respondent's Application**\"), together with the following accompanying documentation: (i) Judge Schwebel's Expert Opinion (\"**Schwebel Opinion**\") with Exhibits SS-01 to SS-23, (ii) Exhibits RE-170 to RE-204, and (iii) eight Witness Statements (from seven witnesses) of Abdul Aziz, Masood Malik, Shehbaz Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Tahir, Sheikh Asmatullah, Abid Mustikhan, Bari Dad (first and second).\n\n17.\n\nUpon invitation of the Tribunal, on 8 September 2015, Respondent filed observations on Claimant's request of 31 August 2015, and concluded by stating that \"*the NAB has requested that counsel for Pakistan convey to the Tribunal and to TCC that it has not and will continue not to monitor/intercept any form of privileged communication (oral or written) between TCC personnel and their legal counsel*\" (emphasis in original).\n\n18.\n\nOn 10 September 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Respondent's letter of 8 September 2015, noting Respondent's statement quoted in the previous paragraph, and invited Claimant to clarify by 15 September 2015, whether it wished to maintain its request as set out in its letter of 31 August 2015.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 September 2015, Claimant filed a response to the Respondent's further observations of 8 September 2015.\n\n20.\n\nOn 18 September 2015, Respondent noted that Claimant, in its letter of 15 September 2015, had raised arguments in relation to Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims that should have been contained in its reply to this Application due on 7 October 2015. Therefore, Respondent sought guidance from the Tribunal as to the point in time at which it should address Claimant's arguments.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 September 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties' respective communications of 15 September 2015 and 18 September 2015, and informed the Parties that the Tribunal would shortly issue a Procedural Order on Claimant's request, and that in the meantime it did not require further submissions from the Parties on that matter.\n\n22.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning confidentiality of communications. The Tribunal ordered Respondent to:\n\n\"*I. Ensure that neither the NAB nor any other agency of the Federal or Provincial Governments monitor/intercept or record any privileged or potentially privileged communication (oral or written), between and among TCC's personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan; and*\n\n*II. Identify whether and if so, when, how and which privileged or potentially privileged communications (oral or written) between and among TCC's personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan, have been monitored/intercepted or recorded by the NAB or any other agency of the Federal or Provincial Governments to date.*\"\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 October 2015, Respondent supplemented its Application to Dismiss the Claims of 2 September 2015, with two Witness Statements signed by Col. Sher Khan and Mr Muhammad Farooq and certain accompanying documents referred to in those statements.\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 October 2015, Claimant requested that the Tribunal grant an extension of the deadline to file its response until 16 October 2015, to permit Claimant to consider the two new Witness Statements filed by Respondent on 5 October 2015. By e-mail of the same date, the Tribunal granted Claimant's extension request.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 6 October 2015, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan informed the Tribunal that he had withdrawn as TCCA's counsel in this case, noting that his withdrawal was not prompted by any doubts about TCCA's integrity.\n\n26.\n\nOn 16 October 2015, Claimant filed its (first) Opposition to Respondent's Application for Dismiss Claims, together with updated indices of Claimant's Exhibits and Authorities, and a courtesy copy of Claimant's simultaneous filing in the ICC arbitration. Claimant primarily requested that Respondent's Application be rejected in its entirety. In the alternative, it requested that the Tribunal: (i) bar Respondent from raising any additional allegations; (ii) proceed to issue its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on the basis of the extensive evidence and arguments already presented by the Parties through and including the Post-Hearing Briefs filed in January 2015; (iii) defer further proceedings and a decision on Respondent's Application pending issuance of its Decision and the conclusion of Claimant's investigation into Respondent's allegations; and (iv) issue the orders sought be Claimant to protect the integrity of the arbitration and reduce the manifest unfairness Respondent's conduct has caused.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of 27 October 2015, the Tribunal conveyed the following directions to the Parties:\n\n\"*The Tribunal has duly considered Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2 September 2015 ('Respondent's Application') and Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss Claims dated 16 October 2015 ('Claimant's Opposition') and has come to the following decision for the time being:*\n\n*1. Respondent is invited to comment on Claimant's alternative claims, as set out under Sections III.B.2 through III.B.4. (paras. 130-151) of its Opposition, by **Tuesday, 10 November 2015**.*\n\n*2. The Parties are requested to agree on a time schedule in order to address the new issues raised in Respondent's Application, and to submit and agreed proposal by **Tuesday, 17 November 2015**.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal would like to inform the Parties that it has almost concluded its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with, a draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues raised in Respondent's Application. The Tribunal notes that, while this approach is not provided for by ICSID, it is common practice in the WTO and also provided for in Article 10.20(9) lit. a of the CAFTA. By analogy to the latter provision, the Parties may submit their comments on the draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within 60 days of its transmission by the Tribunal. Any such comments will be duly considered by the Tribunal in its ultimate Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\"*\n\n28.\n\nOn 10 November 2015, Respondent filed its first Reply to Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss Claims. Together with its submission Respondent provided a copy of Respondent's simultaneous filing in the ICC proceedings, for the Tribunal's information.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 12 November 2015, the Tribunal conveyed the following directions to the Parties:\n\n\"*Upon review of Respondent's Reply to Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss Claims ('Respondent's Reply'), the Tribunal gives the following directions:*\n\n*1. As the next procedural step, Claimant should submit a substantive response to Respondent's Application at the time agreed by the Parties, or fixed by the Tribunal as indicated below.*\n\n*2. For clarification purposes, all witness statements, including the two witness statements from the witnesses Col. Sher Khan and Mr. Muhammad Farooq submitted with Respondent's letter of 5 October 2015, as well as all other evidence submitted by Respondent in relation to its Application are admitted into the record, de bene esse, i.e., provisionally and without prejudice to Claimant's right to apply to have it struck out.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal notes Respondent's statement at para. 15 of its Reply that it \"has no present intention of submitting further witness evidence in respect of the corruption allegations.\" In case Respondent wishes to submit any further witness statements and/or any additional documents into record, it may do so only upon request for, and grant of, leave from the Tribunal.*\n\n*4. The Tribunal further notes Respondent's undertakings offered at para. 20 of its Reply and sees no need for additional orders relating to safe-conduct guarantees for the time being.*\n\n*5. Claimant's request for disclosure of documents as set out in the Annex to its Opposition is denied for the time being. The Tribunal will decide on the Parties' requests for disclosure of documents in accordance with the time schedule to be agreed by the Parties or fixed by the Tribunal.*\n\n*On this basis, the Tribunal asks the Parties to try reaching an agreement on the further time schedule to address the new issues addressed in Respondent's Application. The time limit for reaching such agreement is extended until Tuesday, 24 November 2015.*\n\n*In case the Parties are unable to agree on a time schedule, the Tribunal would be available for a procedural hearing to be held by telephone conference, unless both Parties prefer to have a hearing in person, and then fix the time schedule thereafter.*\"\n\n30.\n\nBy e-mail of 24 November 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on all but two issues concerning the time schedule and submitted the Parties' respective proposals. By e-mail of the same day, Claimant commented on Respondent's e-mail and submitted an alternative proposal regarding the time schedule. By e-mail of 25 November 2015, Respondent commented on Claimant's alternative proposal and submitted an alternative counter-proposal. Claimant responded on the same day, noting that any schedule depended on the Tribunal's actual availability, and requested that the Tribunal advise the Parties on its availabilities for a one-week/two-week hearing during the fall of 2016.\n\n31.\n\nBy e-mail of 27 November 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had no availability for a one\u2010week hearing in November or December 2016. The Tribunal proposed to hold the hearing either from 10 to 14 October 2016 (with 15 October held in reserve) or from 24 to 28 October 2016 (with 29 October held in reserve). The Parties were invited the Parties to agree on a mutually acceptable timetable leading up to either of those hearing dates and to inform the Tribunal about their agreement or to present their proposals to the Tribunal by Friday, 4 December 2015.\n\n32.\n\nBy e-mail of 3 December 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had conferred but had been unable to reach agreement, and submitted the Parties' respective positions regarding the procedural calendar for the remaining proceeding, including a hearing on the new evidence.\n\n33.\n\nOn 7 December 2015, Claimant replied to Respondent's e-mail of 3 December 2015, concerning the procedural calendar.\n\n34.\n\nBy e-mail of 11 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided on the procedural timetable as set out in the table included in its e-mail.\n\n35.\n\nOn 12 January 2016, Respondent filed, for the Tribunal's information, a copy of its submission before the ICC Tribunal of January 11, 2016 (Respondent's Supplementary Counter-Memorial), together with accompanying documents.\n\n36.\n\nOn 15 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties: (i) that 14-18 November 2016 was to be held in reserve \"*in case it turns out that one week will not be sufficient for the Hearing on the new evidence,*\" and (ii) that the Tribunal was in the process of finalizing the draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and would transmit it to the Parties, as announced, shortly.\n\n37.\n\nOn 3 February 2016 and having given advance notice to the Parties of its intention to do so on 27 October 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with its Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (the \"**Draft Decision**\") and invited them to provide comments on errors of fact, misprints, etc. within 60 days of the decision's transmission to the Parties. For the full procedural history of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 from Claimant's filing of the Request for Arbitration on 28 November 2011 to the Tribunal's issuing a procedural timetable to address the new issues in Respondent's Application on 11 December 2015, *see* paragraphs 5 to 212 of the Draft Decision.\n\n38.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, Claimant filed its second Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (\"**Claimant's Opposition**\"), together with: (i) Exhibits CE-428 to CE-491; (ii) Legal Authorities CA 201 to CA 260; (iii) updated indices reflecting the additional exhibits and authorities submitted since Claimant's Opposition of October 16, 2015; and (iv) Witness Statements of Timothy Hargreaves, Eduardo Flores, Hugh R. James, and Peter Jezek; the Third Witness Statement of Catherine \"Cassie\" Boggs; and the Sixth Witness Statement of Timothy Livesey.\n\n39.\n\nAlso on 11 March 2016, Claimant filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on confidentiality of evidence (\"**Claimant's Application for a Protective Order**\"), and a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of new evidence (\"**Claimant's Application for a Ruling** ***in Limine***\"), both dated 11 March 2016 **.**\n\n40.\n\nOn 12 March 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of (i) Claimant's Application for a Protective Order, including its request for an interim order pending the Tribunal's final resolution of Claimant's Application; and (ii) Claimant's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*, both dated 11 March 2016.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that Claimant had asked the ICSID Secretariat not to transmit Claimant's Response to Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims to Respondent, pending the earlier of (i) the Tribunal's ruling on Claimant's request for an interim order; or (ii) confirmation from Respondent that it will comply with the terms of the requested Protective Order on an interim basis pending the Tribunal's decision on Claimant's Application for a Protective Order. The Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant's request for an interim order or a confirmation from Respondent with the above-mentioned content, by 16 March 2016.\n\n41.\n\nOn 16 March 2016, Respondent filed observations on Claimant's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*, including a request to extend the time limit for exchanging the Parties' disclosure requests.\n\n42.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Tribunal granted the extension request; requested Claimant \"*to confirm that it no longer requests an interim order on its Application for a Protective Order because the Parties have agreed that, pending the Tribunal's decision on Claimant's Application for a Protective Order, Respondent will circulate Claimant's Response only to the Permitted Recipients as identified in Claimant's request for relief lit. a (ii), plus identified individuals/entities within the Government of Balochistan*\"; and invited the Parties to reach an agreement on the procedural timetable for the submissions on Claimant's Application for a Protective Order and its Application for a Ruling *in Limine.*\n\n43.\n\nOn 4 April 2016, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 6 with an Interim Order pending its final decision on Claimant's Application for a Protective Order.\n\n44.\n\nOn 4 April 2016, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the Tribunal's Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Such comments, pursuant to the Tribunal's direction by letter of 3 February 2016, were to be limited to \"*errors of fact, misprints, etc*.\"\n\n45.\n\nOn 6 April 2016, Respondent filed a response to Claimant's Application for a Protective Order and Claimant's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*.\n\n46.\n\nOn 12 April 2016, Claimant filed a Reply on Claimant's Application for a Protective Order, and a Reply on Claimant's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*.\n\n47.\n\nOn 14 April 2016, the Parties submitted a revised proposed schedule for disclosure/production of documents, which was approved on the same date by the Tribunal, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n48.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Application for a Protective Order and a Rejoinder on the Application for a Ruling *in Limine*, together with a consolidated index of authorities filed by Respondent in the arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 7 on Claimant's Applications for a Protective Order and a Ruling *in Limine*.\n\n50.\n\nOn 26 April 2016, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents. Claimant additionally requested the Tribunal to amend the Protective Order in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 7 to also include: \"*the documents disclosed by Claimant in response to Respondent's requests for production of documents*.\"\n\n51.\n\nBy e-mail of 29 April 2016, at the Tribunal's invitation, Respondent noted not having objections to Claimant's request of 26 April 2016 to amend the Protective Order in Procedural Order No. 7. As a result, on 2 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 concerning confidentiality of evidence, amending paragraph 1 of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 7.\n\n52.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9 concerning production of documents.\n\n53.\n\nOn 16 May 2016, Respondent requested the Tribunal to revise its Procedural Order No. 9, so as to reflect that Respondent was agreeable to any documents produced during this phase of document disclosure being used in the relevant ICC proceedings.\n\n54.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited Claimant to confirm its agreement with the requested revision of Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n55.\n\nOn 17 May 2016, Claimant confirmed its agreement to Respondent's requested revision of Procedural Order No. 9, and requested a four-day extension of the deadline for completion of voluntary disclosure of documents set in Procedural Order No. 9. On the same date, Respondent confirmed its agreement to the requested extension, which was granted by the Tribunal on 18 May 2016.\n\n56.\n\nOn 19 May 2016, Respondent requested clarifications of certain points on Respondent's completed Redfern Schedule of Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n57.\n\nOn 20 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 confirming the requested revision of Procedural Order No. 9, with regard to the use of documents in the ICC proceedings, and an amended Respondent's Redfern Schedule containing the requested clarifications of the Tribunal's decision on document production.\n\n58.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, Claimant requested the modification of the Tribunal's order regarding Request 12(b)(i) of Respondent's document requests, which the Tribunal \"*granted as requested*\" in Annex 1 to its Procedural Order No. 9, but which Claimant believed was unduly burdensome to the extent that it involved review of Claimant's petty cash records in order to identify documents relating to expenses that were reimbursed to Col. Khan. By letter of 6 June 2016, Respondent responded to Claimant's letter of 1 June 2016.\n\n59.\n\nOn 8 June 2016, Claimant filed a Request for Modification of Tribunal's *in Limine* Order (Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 7 of 21 April 2016).\n\n60.\n\nOn 10 June 2016, (i) the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 concerning production of documents; (ii) Respondent was invited to comment on Claimant's Request for Modification of Tribunal's *in Limine* Order dated 8 June 2016; and (iii) Respondent filed a request regarding one aspect of Claimant's production of documents, which according to Respondent was a breach of the Tribunal's decision regarding Request No. 15 of Respondent's Completed Redfern Schedule. Respondent requested the Tribunal to order Claimant to produce non-privileged documents and to explain the extent of the body of privileged documents relevant to its recent internal investigation.\n\n61.\n\nOn 13 June 2016, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on admissibility of new evidence, *i.e*., a witness statement from Mr. Zafar Iqbal in support of its Reply submission.\n\n62.\n\nOn 14 June 2016, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimant's Request for Modification of Tribunal's *in Limine* Order.\n\n63.\n\nOn June 15, 2016, the Tribunal decided on the Request for Modification of Tribunal's *in Limine* Order. The Tribunal maintained its original decision.\n\n64.\n\nAlso on 15 June 2016, the Tribunal gave certain directions to the Parties regarding the procedural calendar leading up to the Hearing.\n\n65.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, at the Tribunal's invitation, Claimant filed its comments on Respondent's request of June 10, 2016 regarding production of documents.\n\n66.\n\nOn 20 June 2016, Claimant filed observations on Respondent's request of 13 June 2016 on the admissibility of new evidence.\n\n67.\n\nOn 21 June 2016, the Tribunal proposed a modified procedural schedule.\n\n68.\n\nOn 23 June 2016, Respondent filed a reply to Claimant's letter of 20 June 2016 on the admissibility of new evidence.\n\n69.\n\nOn 24 June 2016, each Party confirmed its availability on the dates in the Tribunal's proposed modified procedural calendar.\n\n70.\n\nOn 25 June 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that the Pre\u2010Hearing Organizational Meeting would be held with the President of the Tribunal on 26 September 2016, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n71.\n\nOn 28 June 2016, Claimant filed a letter by which it maintained its objection and its request that the Tribunal deny Respondent's application for the admissibility of new evidence.\n\n72.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, Claimant filed a renewed request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents, including a request for production of original documents for inspection by the forensic examiner retained by Claimant.\n\n73.\n\nAlso on 1 July 2016, the Tribunal decided on Respondent's request for admissibility of new evidence, granting leave to Respondent to file a witness statement from Mr. Zafar Iqbal together with its Reply due on 15 July 2016.\n\n74.\n\nOn 4 July 2016, the Tribunal decided on production of documents and on Claimant's request for production or original documents (including Mr. Aziz's diaries) for inspection by the forensic examiner retained by Claimant.\n\n75.\n\nOn 6 July 2016, Respondent filed a letter in response to Claimant's request of 1 July 2016 and the Tribunal's decision of 4 July 2016. In its letter, Respondent requested that the Tribunal refrained from making any further orders regarding the documents to be produced for inspection until Respondent had had an opportunity to report back the following week on the outcome of meetings with the National Accountability Bureau (the **NAB**), in whose custody Mr. Aziz's diaries resided in connection with an on-going criminal inquiry.\n\n76.\n\nOn 6 July 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Respondent's letter of 6 July 2016, and informed the Parties that for the time being, the Tribunal maintained its decision of 4 July 2016. The Tribunal further noted the difficulties on the part of Respondent to meet the deadline of 11 July 2016, taking into account the Eid holiday which was being celebrated in Pakistan at the moment. The Tribunal therefore confirmed that it would not take a decision on whether to exclude any evidence already on the record related to the documents to be produced for inspection until Respondent had reverted to the Tribunal, at the latest by 15 July 2016.\n\n77.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, Respondent filed its second Reply to Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (\"**Respondent's Reply**\"), dated 15 July 2016, including: (i) Second Witness Statement of Muhammad Farooq; (ii) Second Witness Statement of Col. Sher Khan; (iii) Second Witness Statement of Muhammad Tahir; (iv) Witness Statement of Zafar Iqbal; and (v) Exhibits R-58(VI)(an) to R-502.\n\n78.\n\nAlso on 15 July 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. Aziz's diaries could not leave Pakistan, but would be available in Pakistan for forensic examination. In such circumstances, Respondent requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision of July 4, 2016, concerning the request for production of original documents for inspection, and instead direct the NAB to make the original documents responsive to Requests 20 and 21 available immediately for inspection in Islamabad. On 19 July 2016, Claimant filed observations in such regard.\n\n79.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, the Tribunal directed Respondent to provide to Claimant and the Tribunal, by 27 July 2016, a list of possible locations/institutions within Pakistan where a forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries could be carried out under laboratory conditions. As directed, Respondent provided such information to Claimant and to Respondent by letter of 27 July 2016. Attached to Respondent's letter were the curricula vitae of three possible forensic experts.\n\n80.\n\nOn 28 July 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Respondent's letter of 27 July 2016, and invited Claimant to comment thereon by 2 August 2016, in particular to state whether the method of examination proposed by Respondent; and/or the appointment of any of the experts identified by Respondent would be agreeable to Claimant. Claimant was further invited to comment on Respondent's preference for one expert to be appointed by the Tribunal instead of two Party-appointed experts.\n\n81.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, Claimant submitted a letter in response to Respondent's letter of 27 July 2016, concerning the request for production of original documents for inspection. In its letter, Claimant requested the Tribunal to reiterate its order of 4 July 2016 that Pakistan \"*immediately produce*\" Mr. Aziz's diaries to Claimant's forensic expert, Mr. Robert Radley. Claimant expressed its willingness to work with Pakistan to ensure that the documents are transported in a manner that did not compromise the chain of custody.\n\n82.\n\nBy e-mail of 4 August 2016, the President of the Tribunal requested Respondent to answer in particular the following questions, without prejudice to the Tribunal's decision:\n\n\"*1) Would Respondent/the NAB be willing to accept that the diaries are transported to Mr. Radley's laboratory under the custody safeguards and the conditions for inspecting Mr. Radley's laboratory, including the restrictions regarding the presence of a NAB official during his examination, as described by Claimant in its letter of 2 August 2016 at pages \u2010 2 3?*\n\n*2). Please provide the fullest information available about the three laboratories within Pakistan that Respondent proposed in its letter of 27 July 2016, as regards their equipment, their technical capacity and specifications, their national or international certifications, and their compliance with international standards. In particular, please specify whether any of the laboratories contains an ESDA machine as described in Claimant's letter of 2 August 2016 at page 3. Provided that this is the case, the Tribunal notes that the diary submitted as Exhibit A \u2010 A 1 is in fact a note pad. The Tribunal understands from Claimant's submission on pages \u2010 3 4 that ESDA machines are typically suitable only for the examination of single sheets of paper, which would require physical disassembly of the note pad. Would Respondent/the NAB allow that such disassembly take place in the course of an ESDA examination if this were technically necessary? Regarding the diary submitted as Exhibit A \u2010 A 2, it appears to the Tribunal that this consists of loose sheets paper so that no physical disassembly would be required. It appears to the Tribunal that no other diaries or documents responsive to Claimant's Requests 20 and 21 have been submitted so far.*\"\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that provided that the Tribunal considered the conditions for examination of the diaries in one of the laboratories identified by Respondent suitable for the present purposes and provided that there existed an ESDA machine in one of the laboratories in Pakistan, Claimant was requested to state whether Mr. Radley would be willing to travel to Pakistan within the next weeks and conduct an ESDA examination with the equipment available within the respective laboratory.\n\n83.\n\nOn 12 August 2016, each Party filed answers to the questions posed by the Tribunal on 4 August 2016. Attached to Claimant's letter was a letter from Robert Radley to Donald Francis Donovan dated 12 August 2016.\n\n84.\n\nOn 23 August 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was trying to identify a suitable expert to analyze the documents in question in Pakistan at the lab that had an ESDA equipment.\n\n85.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Claimant filed a request for (i) a ruling on the sequence of witness testimony and opening statements in the then upcoming evidentiary hearing, and (ii) an extension of the deadline for the filing of Claimant's Rejoinder.\n\n86.\n\nOn 1 September 2016, Claimant filed a letter regarding the expert examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries. It its letter, Claimant referred to its explanations of 12 August 2016, and in particular to those provided by its expert Robert Radley that he would not travel to Pakistan, because his ability to opine on the authenticity of the documents would be compromised if he could not examine them in his own laboratory. Claimant further ratified its request that the Tribunal reinstate its directions of 4 July 2016 that Pakistan deliver Mr. Aziz's diaries to Mr. Radley or be subject to an order that they be struck from the record; requested that certain requirements suggested by Mr. Radley be included in any terms of reference governing the expert's appointment, in the event that the Tribunal decided to appoint its own expert. Claimant also requested the Tribunal's advice on the expectations of a timetable regarding the eventual appointment process for a Tribunal-appointed expert.\n\n87.\n\nOn 2 September 2016, Respondent referred to Claimant's letter of 31 August 2016; (i) confirmed that it had agreed to its witnesses being examined during the October 2016 hearing in Paris, with Claimant's witnesses being examined during the December 2016 hearing in Hong Kong; (ii) expressed its disagreement over the timing of Claimant's opening statement; and (iii) objected to Claimant's requested extension of the deadline for the filing of its Rejoinder.\n\n88.\n\nBy letter of 2 September 2016, the Tribunal referred to two matters: (A) the examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries, including the appointment of an Independent Expert, and (B) Claimant's requests by letter of 31 August 2016. Regarding the examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to appoint an independent forensic document/ink expert to analyze Mr. Aziz's diaries in one of the laboratories in Pakistan identified by Respondent. The Tribunal proposed the names, of three experts as suitable candidates to the Parties, who would be able to travel to Pakistan, and provided their *curricula vitae* and additional information. The Tribunal explained the appointment method for the selection of the Independent Expert; provided the Parties with a ballot for them to rank the candidates on the list in order of preference; invited the Parties to liaise and submit an agreed proposal for the terms of reference, and provided the Tribunal's expectation of a timetable. As to Claimant's requests of 31 August 2016, the Tribunal decided that following the standard practice, the opening statements would be heard at the beginning of the first week. The Tribunal also granted an extension until 15 September 2016 of the deadline for Claimant to file its Rejoinder.\n\n89.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, Respondent filed a renewed request for production of documents, including a request for production of unredacted version of documents.\n\n90.\n\nOn 13 September 2016, Claimant provided comments on the list of experts proposed by the Tribunal in its letter of 2 September 2016. Claimant requested that the Tribunal order Pakistan to make the originals of Mr. Aziz's diaries available in the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory for the inspection by Mr. Radley during the week of 10 October 2016; on the Parties' consent, to appoint Dr. Agisnsky to conduct and ink-dating examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries, and to provide the Parties with an extension of the deadline to submit an agreed proposal of the Terms of Reference for the ink-dating expert.\n\n91.\n\nAlso on 14 September 2016, Claimant requested a one-day extension of the deadline for the filing of its Rejoinder. Respondent objected to Claimant's extension request. On the same date, the Tribunal granted the further extension of the deadline to file Claimant's Rejoinder until 1 p.m. of 16 September 2016 (N.Y. time).\n\n92.\n\nOn 15 September 2016, Respondent filed a request for admissibility of new evidence, disclosed by Claimant on 12 September 2016, *i.e*., 45 additional documents relating to (a) expenditure on the Chile trip and (b) the remuneration of Colonel Sher Khan, which the Tribunal had ordered Claimant to produce by 15 June 2016 pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9 (as amended by Procedural Order No.10). Respondent requested leave to file a supplemental submission addressing the new evidence in relation to the Chile trip by 30 September 2016.\n\n93.\n\nOn 15 September 2016, Claimant gave its consent to Respondent's requests of 15 September 2016, reserving the right to seek leave to file a short rejoinder if necessary.\n\n94.\n\nOn 16 September 2016, the Tribunal noting that Claimant had given its consent, granted Respondent's request to introduce the 45 documents as exhibits and to file a short supplemental submission limited to addressing the new evidence by 30 September 2016.\n\n95.\n\nOn September 16, 2016, Claimant filed its Rejoinder to Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (\"**Claimant's Rejoinder**\"), enclosing: (i) Claimant's new exhibits: CE-492 to CE-740; (ii) Claimant's new legal authorities: CA 261 to CA 351; (iii) updated indices; (iv) Witness Statements of Gibson Pierce, Robert Skrzeczynski, David Moore, Barry Flew, and Mark Wall; the Second Witness Statements of Cory Williams, Timothy Hargreaves, Eduardo Flores, Hugh R.

In its letter, Respondent requested the Tribunal to seek certain clarifications from Claimant.

Sher Khan describing allegedly privileged conversations.\n\n106.\n\nAlso on 28 September 2016, Claimant filed a further request for the confidentiality of evidence, *i.e*., requesting the Tribunal to amend the Protective Order set forth in Procedural Order No. 7, as amended by Procedural Order No. 8, and further requesting Respondent to provide certain information and documents regarding the individual to whom it had disclosed Protected Information.\n\n107.\n\nBy letter of 29 September 2016, the Parties were informed of the Tribunal's directions regarding certain pending matters, which had been jointly decided by the Tribunal following the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting held by the President of the Tribunal with the Parties on September 26, 2016, which addressed: (i) Issues on the Draft Agenda; (ii) the Expert Testimony of Former Ambassador Hussain Haqqani; (iii) Claimant's Corrected Rejoinder; (iv) Appointment of Forensic Expert(s); (v) Claimant's Requests Regarding Testimony of Respondent's Witnesses on Privileged Conversations; and (vi) Claimant's Request for an Amendment of the Protective Order.\n\n108.\n\nAlso on 29 September 2016, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Mr. Radley had advised that, while he was at that time unable to travel to Pakistan the week of 20 October 2016 due to prior casework obligations, he was attempting to rearrange his other work commitments to permit travel to Pakistan a reasonable time before the hearing. Claimant requested the opportunity to respond to Respondent's letter of 27 September 2016 by 4 October 2016, to permit Mr. Radley to complete those discussions. This request was granted by the Tribunal on 30 September 2016.\n\n109.\n\nOn 30 September 2016, Respondent filed its Supplemental Reply on its Application to Dismiss Claims (\"**Respondent's Supplemental Reply**\").\n\n110.\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Respondent filed observations on Claimant's further request for the confidentiality of evidence of 28 September 2016.\n\n111.\n\nAlso on 3 October 2016, Claimant filed a response to Respondent's observations of 28 September 2016 on Claimant's request to strike from the record certain testimony of two of Respondent's witnesses on privileged conversations.\n\n112.\n\nBy letter of 4 October 2016, Claimant commented on the Tribunal's proposal in its directions of 29 September 2016, that the expert report of former Ambassador Haqqani be exempted from the Protective Order and that Pakistan be permitted to \"*share and discuss the report with the NAB*\" so that it can \"*adequately address the statements made in Ambassador Haqqani's report*.\"\n\n113.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, Claimant filed its Supplemental Rejoinder on Respondent's Application to Dismiss Claims (\"**Claimant's Supplemental Rejoinder**\").\n\n114.\n\nBy letter of 5 October 2016, the Tribunal decided: (i) to deny Claimant's requests for exclusion of certain witness testimony of Mr. Bari Dad on his conversation with Claimant's former counsel Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan on 28 July 2015. Claimant's alternative requests indicated therein were also denied; (ii) to deny Claimant's request for excluding paragraphs 58-59 of Col. Khan's second witness statement; (iii) to admit Claimant's alternative request that it be permitted to submit a witness statement from another of the counsel who participated in the calls with Col.

Sher Kahn; (ii) the new exhibits cited in that witness statement; and (iii) an updated index of Claimant's Exhibits.\n\n121.\n\nA first week hearing on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims was held at the ICC, Paris from 10 October 2016 to 15 October 2016.

In the event that Claimant failed to do so, Respondent suggested that the Tribunal should appoint an expert, in which case Respondent proposed the appointment of Dr. Aginsky or one of the experts previously suggested by the Tribunal.\n\n124.\n\nBy letter of 19 October 2016, Claimant responded to Respondent's letter of 13 October 2016. Attached to Claimant's letter was a letter of Mr. Radley of the same date, explaining the reasons why he had concluded that he would not examine the documents in Pakistan. In its letter, Claimant requested that the Tribunal: (i) reinstate its order of 4 and 6 July 2016 and require Pakistan to immediately produce Mr. Aziz's diaries to Mr. Radley's laboratory for inspection and allow the presence of an NAB official during the examination subject to that official undertaking that he or she (*a*) would not interfere with Mr. Radley's examination in any way, (*b*) would present the diaries when requested, and (*c*) agreed not divulge any information learned by virtue of being present in the laboratory while other confidential work is being conducted; (*ii*) required Pakistan to make Mr. Aziz's diaries available for the Tribunal's inspection at the hearing in Hong Kong; and (iii) appointed Dr. Aginsky to conduct an ink dating examination, provided that any such examination was conducted only after Mr. Radley had completed his ESDA sequencing examination. In the alternative, should Pakistan refuse to deliver Mr. Aziz's diaries to Mr. Radley, Claimant requested the Tribunal to exclude all evidence related to these documents.\n\n125.\n\nBy letter of 20 October 2016, the Tribunal conveyed a message to the Parties on the matter of conducting a forensic examination of the so-called Aziz diaries, including a recommendation that Respondent produce Mr. Aziz's diaries to Mr. Radley's laboratory by 1 November 2016. Respondent was invited to respond by 26 October 2016.\n\n126.\n\nOn 26 October 2016, Respondent submitted a letter regarding the examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries. In its letter, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the NAB had reiterated its unwillingness for Mr. Aziz's diaries to be sent abroad under any circumstances, enclosing a letter sent by the NAB to the Attorney-General's Office in such regard. Respondent requested the Tribunal to withdraw its directions of 20 October 2016 and appoint a single Tribunal-appointed expert to assist the Tribunal to determine the authenticity of what Respondent's considered an important evidence. On 26 October 2016, Respondent submitted a further letter, this one requesting the Tribunal to revisit its order of 7 October 2016 regarding the disclosure of e-mails.\n\n127.\n\nAlso on 26 October 2016, Claimant requested that the Tribunal issue an order in relation to Respondent's alleged breaches of the Tribunal's Protective Order.\n\n128.\n\nOn 31 October 2016, Respondent submitted its comments in response to Claimant's letter of 26 October 2016 concerning Respondent's alleged breach of the Protective Order.\n\n129.\n\nOn 2 November 2016, Claimant submitted observations on Respondent's request of 26 October 2016 regarding the disclosure of e-mails, noting that Respondent's disclosure requests were untimely, improper and should in principle be rejected. However, in the event that the Tribunal was minded to afford Respondent any relief, then Claimant consented to disclose the requested e-mails, provided that Respondent gave its consent (or the Tribunal ordered) that either party might admit any of those documents into evidence on or before 18 November 2016.\n\n130.\n\nOn 2 November 2016, Claimant filed a response to Respondent's letter of 26 October 2016 regarding the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n131.\n\nBy letter of 4 November 2016, the Tribunal conveyed a message to the Parties with reference to Claimant's letter of 2 November 2016, Respondent's letter of 26 October 2016 and the Tribunal's directions of 20 October 2016, all concerning the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n132.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, Respondent submitted a brief reply to Claimant's letter of 2 November 2016 regarding the disclosure of e-mails. Claimant submitted its rejoinder on this matter on 9 November 2016.\n\n133.\n\nOn 9 November 2016, the Tribunal invited Respondent to confirm by 14 November 2016, whether it had appointed Dr. Aginsky (or any other person) as its own Party-appointed expert, and if so, whether Respondent intended to produce him as an expert witness during the Hong Kong hearing.\n\n134.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, the Tribunal decided on Claimant's request of 26 October 2016 regarding the alleged violation of the Protective Order. For the reasons set out therein, Claimant's request was dismissed.\n\n135.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, the Tribunal decided on Respondent's request of 7 October 2016 to revisit its order of the same date concerning the disclosure of certain e-mails.\n\n136.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would probably contract Mr. Gerald LaPorte as Respondent's forensic expert because Dr. Aginsky was not available. Respondent would confirm this the following week.\n\n137.\n\nOn 15 November 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had not received the 276 e-mails relating to Chris Arndt that Claimant had agreed to produce, requesting the Tribunal to order that Claimant produce them, and that Respondent be given five days from the date of production to review and submit any new exhibits. On the same date, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Respondent would receive the above-referenced e-mails later that day. By letter of 16 November 2016, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' communications of 15 November 2016 on the matter and gave the five days that had been requested by Respondent to proceed as suggested upon its receipt of the e-mails.\n\n138.\n\nOn 17 November 2016, Claimant requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to: (i) submit Mr. LaPorte's report no later than 26 November 2016; and (ii) direct Mr. LaPorte to take an additional set of ink-dating samples that replicate as closely as possible the samples Mr. LaPorte analyzes, and upon his return from Pakistan, promptly deliver the additional samples by overnight mail to a representative of Claimant's choosing. In addition, Claimant requested that the Tribunal amend the hearing schedule so that Mr. LaPorte would testify on 10 December 2016.\n\n139.\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the Tribunal requested Respondent to: (i) confirm by 21 November 2016 whether Mr. LaPorte had indeed travelled to Pakistan for a forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries and was in the process of preparing an expert report on this matter for Respondent; and (ii) comment by the same date on the requests raised in Claimant's letter of 17 November 2016. The Tribunal noted that, under the circumstances, it was inclined to grant Claimant's requests (to the extent an order from the Tribunal would be required), but would nevertheless like to hear Respondent first.\n\n140.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, Respondent submitted a letter in response to Claimant's letter of 17 November 2016 and the Tribunal's letter of 18 November 2016, regarding the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n141.\n\nOn 22 November 2016, Respondent filed a letter in response to the Tribunal's correspondence of November 11, 2016, and submitted ten documents from the 276 e-mails that had been disclosed by Claimant on 15 November 2016, as new exhibits RE-515 to RE-524. In addition, Respondent noted that Claimant's supplemental document production raised two questions which should be addressed by Claimant.\n\n142.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. LaPorte could not get the visa to Pakistan and would not be able to travel. On the same date, Claimant sent a brief response.\n\n143.\n\nAlso on 22 November 2016, Claimant filed a letter regarding the disclosure of e-mails, together with new exhibits numbered CE-840 to CE-867, and an updated index reflecting the additional exhibits.\n\n144.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, Respondent requested leave to submit nine documents as new exhibits.\n\n145.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, Claimant commented on Respondent's requests in connection with the disclosure of certain e-mails relating to Chris Arndt that were raised in Respondent's letter of 22 November 2016.\n\n146.\n\nOn 29 November 2016, the Tribunal referred to Claimant's letter on 29 November 2016, noting that \"*TCCA has no Arndt e-mails from the period August to December 1999, and it does not have more complete copies of the e-mail chains included in the production*\" as well as the explanation provided by Claimant in this regard. Consequently, the Tribunal considered that no further order was required on Respondent's requests of 22 November 2016.\n\n147.\n\nOn 30 November 2016, Claimant commented on Respondent's request for leave to submit nine documents as new exhibits.\n\n148.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the Tribunal granted Respondent's request to submit proposed exhibits RE-528 to RE-531, which it deemed responsive to Former Ambassador Haqqani's expert report, into the record. In accordance with Section 15.9 of Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant was granted leave to submit evidence in rebuttal to these four exhibits until 4 December 2016. Respondent's request to submit the remaining proposed exhibits was denied as belated.\n\n149.\n\nA second week hearing on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims was held at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), Hong Kong from 3 December 2016 to 10 December 2016.

Respondent's filed its observations on 12 January 2017.\n\n158.\n\nOn 15 January 2017, the Tribunal decided not to exclude Mr. LaPorte's Expert Report but invited Claimant to raise any questions it might have regarding the specific source material mentioned in its letter of 9 January 2017 that it would have requested in advance of Mr. LaPorte's examination if it had known about the techniques that Mr. LaPorte would apply and to put such questions directly to Mr. LaPorte, and fixed a procedural calendar for the Parties' subsequent submissions on the examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n159.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, Claimant posed questions to Respondent's Expert Mr. LaPorte pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal of 15 January 2017.\n\n160.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to re-issue its decision dated 15 January 2017 to refuse Claimant's request to exclude Mr. LaPorte's Expert Report and Respondent's Accompanying Submission without any further qualification.\n\n161.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, Respondent requested that the Tribunal confirm that Claimant's questions of 18 January 2017 should be narrowed down in the manner suggested by Respondent in its letter to Claimant of 20 January 2017, which had been provided to the Tribunal.\n\n162.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, Respondent filed a letter objecting to the procedural schedule for the eventual quantum phase, that was fixed during the last day of the Hong Kong Hearing. On the same date, Claimant was invited to comment by 27 January 2017.\n\n163.\n\nOn 24 January 2017, Claimant filed a letter in response to (i) Respondent's letter of 20 January 2017, requesting that the Tribunal withdraw certain portions of its 15 January 2017 decision, and (ii) Pakistan's letter of 23 January 2017, requesting that the Tribunal narrow the list of questions that Claimant posed to Mr. LaPorte on 18 January 2017.\n\n164.\n\nOn 25 January 2017, the Tribunal decided on Respondent's requests of 20 January 2017 and of 23 January 2017.\n\n165.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, Respondent filed a copy of its letter to Claimant with copy to the Tribunal concerning the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries, attaching Mr. LaPorte's answers to Claimant's questions with one attachment.\n\n166.\n\nOn 27 January 2017, Claimant filed a letter commenting on Respondent's request of 23 January 2017.\n\n167.\n\nBy letter of 31 January 2017, the Tribunal denied Respondent's request of 23 January 2017, noting that it expected the Parties to prepare their submissions on quantum, if any, in accordance with the schedule agreed on with the Parties on the last hearing day in Hong Kong.\n\n168.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, Respondent filed a letter in response to the Tribunal's decision of 31 January 2017.\n\n169.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, Respondent filed a copy of its letter to Claimant, regarding the issue of documents relating to Claimant's investigation into allegations that it had tried to bribe Chief Minister Raisani in 2009-2010. On the same date, Claimant submitted a copy of its response to Respondent.\n\n170.\n\nOn 9 February 2017, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to amend the Protective Order.\n\n171.\n\nAlso on 9 February 2017, Claimant filed a 10-page submission (\"**Claimant's LaPorte Response**\") together with Mr. Robert Radley's Expert Report (\"**Radley Report**\"), accompanied by Exhibits CE-876 to CE-882 and an updated index of its exhibits.\n\n172.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, the Tribunal decided that the hearing on the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries tentatively scheduled for 21 February 2017, should take place with the President of the Tribunal at the ICC in Paris, with the co-arbitrators participating by video-link.\n\n173.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, Claimant filed observations on Respondent's request of 9 February 2017 seeking an amendment of the Protective Order. On the same date, Respondent filed a response to Claimant's observations of 14 February 2017.\n\n174.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, the Tribunal decided to grant Respondent's request for an amended order, subject, however to the addition that Claimant had subsidiarily requested, *i.e*., that the signed undertaking be provided to, and kept on file with, the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n175.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, Claimant submitted Exhibits CE-883 to CE-888 into the record.\n\n176.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Tribunal held a hearing on the forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries, at the ICC in Paris, with the President of the Tribunal participating in person and the co-arbitrators by video-link.

Attached to Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief were new legal authorities, *i.e*., RLA-335 to RLA-339, together with an updated consolidated index of authorities.\n\n179.\n\nBy letter of 8 March 2017, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties' Post-Hearing Briefs, and informed the Parties that the Tribunal would be rendering its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims if not by 15 March 2017, at the latest on 20 March 2017.\n\n180.\n\nUpon receipt of the Parties' Post-Hearing Briefs and as announced in the Tribunal's letter of 8 March 2017, the Tribunal intensively deliberated on Respondent's Application and carefully considered each of the arguments put forward by the Parties, including the evidence adduced to support them.\n\n181.\n\nAfter thorough and open-minded deliberations, the Tribunal has unanimously reached the decision to reject Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims and, on 20 March 2017, communicated its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons to follow) to the Parties. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to the Tribunal's approach to first communicate its decision to the Parties and then provide the reasons for its decision in a second step, *see* paragraphs 8 to 16 of the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons to follow) dated 20 March 2017. As announced in the Tribunal's letter of 31 May 2017, the Tribunal further issues its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, as amended pursuant to the Parties' comments of 4 April 2016 (the \"**Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability**\"), together with this fully reasoned Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims.\n\n182.\n\nOn 20 April 2017, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs for the present phase of the proceedings concerning Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n183.\n\nFor a detailed summary of the factual background to the dispute between the Parties, the Tribunal makes reference to Section IV of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that in the present phase of the proceeding, it has been presented with certain additional facts, supplementing the chronology of events as set out in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which are either undisputed between the Parties or are otherwise established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. These will be addressed as part of the Tribunal's reasoning on Respondent's individual allegations.\n\n**V. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Respondent's Contentions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Factual Allegations**\n--------------------------\n\n185.\n\nRespondent submits that it has presented compelling documentary and witness evidence of corruption by BHP and TCC in relation to the Reko Diq project. In particular, Respondent asserts that by paying numerous bribes as detailed in Respondent's submissions, Claimant achieved results regarding both the procurement of the foundational agreements (*i.e*., the *Agreement for Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture* (the \"**CHEJVA**\"),1 the *Addendum No. 1 to Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement* (the \"**Addendum**\"),2 the letter by which BHP's 75% in the Joint Venture was certified (the \"**Certification**\"),3 the Deed of Waiver and Consent (the \"**Deed**\"),4 and the *Novation Agreement \u2013 Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement* (the \"**Novation Agreement**\")5) and the expansion of its investment (relating to the grant of land lease rights to construct an airstrip (the \"**Airstrip Land Lease**\"),6 the second renewal of Exploration License EL-5,7 the grant of surface rights (the \"**Surface Rights Lease**\"),8 as well as the Mining Lease and Mineral Agreement which were never obtained).9\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-193**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-194**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-3**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-213**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-16**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-43** and **CE-66**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 32-41.\n\n186.\n\nRespondent perceives that Claimant's attack on the NAB and its investigative process and the resultant conspiracy theory that multiple Pakistani State branches worked together to procure false confessions has fallen flat for three main reasons.10\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 255-281.\n\n187.\n\nFirstly, Respondent submits that there is no evidence that Pakistan's witnesses were coerced into making false confessions; cross-examination failed to garner support for this theory.11 Respondent maintains that the NAB inquiry was conducted in accordance with law and procedure and that attempts to disprove this are uncorroborated. In fact, Respondent takes the position that Claimant's evidence (particularly the Flew Transcript and the Debevoise Notes) serves to undermine this theory.12 Secondly, according to Respondent, the factual circumstances in which evidence was obtained, including the fact that investigations began in 2011 and that half of the witness statements were obtained before the NAB's involvement, demonstrate the implausibility of Claimant's theory.13 Lastly, Respondent argues that Mr. Haqqani's \"*independent expert report*\" is simply a \"*vitriolic attack on the country he abandoned amidst allegations of serious impropriety.*\"14\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 256-271.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 256-271\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 272-277.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 278-281 *referring to* Haqqani Report, dated 15 September 2016.\n\n188.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that it is a falsity that Claimant maintained a robust compliance culture and that the corruption allegations therefore must be a conspiracy. In reality, Respondent submits that Claimant and its shareholders, Barrick Gold and Antofagasta, have committed serious and repeated violations of their own internal compliance policies, Pakistani law and the FCPA, particularly evidenced by the trips for Government delegations to Chile (December 2006) and Canada (March 2007), as will be addressed in more detail in Section VII.D.2.a below.15\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 282.\n\n189.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant knew of the national corruption risk and Mr. Farooq's reputation for corruption.16 Nonetheless, Respondent maintains that incoming CEOs were unprepared and Col. Khan lacked qualification to deliver anti-corruption training to employees (which in fact was not delivered).17 Moreover, Respondent alleges that 'red flags' of corruption were not dealt with (including Col. Khan's meteoric salary rise, the bribe offer to Chief Minister (**CM**) Raisani and the expatriate work visa bribes) even though the aforementioned knowledge of corrupt Government officials and the high risk nature of the jurisdiction necessitated a heightened degree of diligence.18 Respondent also highlights the failure of Dr. Jezek to act diligently in the employment of Mr. Mustikhan, who was employed in relation to the Umbrella Strategy, which Respondent describes as \"*aggressively targeting*\" key-decision makers and influencers and as involving substantial wrongdoing on the part of Claimant's consultants and employees, all in an attempt to secure the Mineral Agreement.19\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 283-300 *referring to* Transcript (Day 11), p. 3055 lines 21-22 and p. 3034 lines 8-12; Transcript (Day 9), p. 2430 lines 6-10 and 19 and p. 2441 lines 2-4; Transcript (Day 10), p. 2490 lines 1-3 and p. 2579 lines 8-14 and p. 2829 lines 4-9; Boggs IV, \u00b6 5; Boggs III, \u00b6 13 *and* Transcript (Day 1), p. 170 lines 13-15.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 284-300 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2579 lines 15-22 and p. 2580 lines 7-9; Transcript (Day 9), p. 2467 line 22 to p. 2468 line 5 and p. 2435 line 7 to p. 2436 line 20; Transcript (Day 11), p. 2833 lines 18-20, Transcript (Day 3), p. 820 line 17 to p. 821 line 5; Transcript (Day 4), p. 1113 line 22.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 82-103; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 310-321 *citing to* *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 [**RLA-334**], \u00b6 519.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 313; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 355-369.\n\n**2. Legal Consequences**\n-------------------------\n\n190.\n\nAs for the legal consequences arising out of the acts of corruption it alleges, Respondent refers to the Expert Opinion of Judge Stephen Schwebel who concluded that faced with an investment tainted with such corruption, a tribunal may find that: (i) it lacks jurisdiction; (ii) the claim is inadmissible; or (iii) on the merits, the substantive protections contained within the investment treaty are not available.20\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 384, *referring to* Schwebel Opinion, \u00b6 90.\n\n191.\n\nRespondent advances two main arguments to support the proposition that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.21\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 416-471.\n\n192.\n\nFirstly, Respondent argues that Claimant's alleged investment fails to meet the legality requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty (requiring investments to be made within framework of Pakistani laws).22 Respondent maintains that: (i) the Addendum and related agreements are void due to corruption and thus do not constitute assets within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty; and (ii) valid and effective acceptance of Claimant's investment never existed due to breaches of fundamental Pakistani law principles.23 By reference to a number of investment treaty decisions, Judge Schwebel noted in his Opinion that jurisdictional arguments based on the illegality of an investment will have temporal limitations, namely that such arguments will only bar jurisdiction where the \"*establishment*,\" rather than the \"*performance*,\" of the investment is tainted by illegality.24\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 419-464 *referring to* Schwebel Opinion \u00b6 90; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 160-168; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 419-464.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 412-419.\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 73.\n\n193.\n\nSecondly, Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal finds that Claimant's corruption did not infect the inception of its investment but went to its operation and/or performance, the Tribunal nonetheless lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims.25 Respondent maintains that pursuant to a proper construction of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 13(3)(a) of the Treaty, Pakistan has not consented to arbitrate claims arising from investments tainted by fraud and corruption (a conclusion which does not depend on the construction of Article 1(1)(a)).26 Respondent again refers to Judge Schwebel's Opinion in which he states that in the case of corruption in the performance of the investment, the Tribunal must look beyond this legality requirement, considering the impact of public policy on the host State's consent to arbitrate and the investor's entitlement to rely on that consent.27 Respondent submits that given Claimant's corruption during the performance of the investment, Claimant should be estopped from relying on the host State's consent to arbitrate or should be found not to meet the implied conditions attaching to the host State's offer to arbitrate.28\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 420 *referring to* Schwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 76-83.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 420-424; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 181-183; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 465-466.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 420 *referring to* Schwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 76-83.\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 76.\n\n194.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal finds that it does have jurisdiction, Respondent maintains that the corruption in relation to the inception or performance of Claimant's investment nonetheless renders the claims inadmissible based on transnational public policy or the application of the \"*unclean hands*\" doctrine.29\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 425-426; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 129-145; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 473-478.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction and that Claimant's claims are admissible, Respondent's position is that: (i) its corruption and lack of diligence render the substantive protections in the Treaty unavailable to Claimant; and (ii) even if such protections are available, each of them is vitiated by Claimant's illegal conduct.30\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 427-439; Respondent's Reply \u00b6\u00b6 479-491; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 210-215.\n\n**B. Summary of Claimant's Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, Claimant has maintained that the preliminary objections in Respondent's Application have been waived and are time-barred \u2013 this will be considered in Section VII.A below.31 Contrary to Respondent's assertion that any corruption, whether in relation to the foundational agreements or the collateral events is relevant, Claimant further asserts that allegations of corruption that do not concern the foundational rights do not fall properly within the remit of this investment treaty Tribunal.32\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 79-89.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 188.\n\n**1. Factual Allegations**\n--------------------------\n\n197.\n\nIn response to Respondent's factual allegations, Claimant submits that a voluminous documentary record and a dozen witnesses have refuted Respondent's claims and demonstrated the foundational agreements to be the product of a normal bureaucratic process.33 In contrast, the fact that none of the highest-ranking government officials implicated in Respondent's allegations have testified, allegedly speaks volumes as to the falsity of its claims.34\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 8.\n\n198.\n\nClaimant submits that this evidence and the objective facts demonstrate that the real scandal here is not Claimant's alleged corruption, but Respondent's cynical abuse of the international community's commitment to eliminate corruption to escape liability for already determined Treaty breaches.35\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 2.\n\n199.\n\nClaimant highlights that for years no-one was able to uncover the alleged widespread corruption, but suddenly, when Respondent needed to avoid its liability to Claimant, it convened a Local Expert Group, which \"*unearthed*\" in weeks evidence that had eluded the Governments for years and deputized the NAB, all to assist with this arbitration.36 The documentary record allegedly establishes that this investigation was not driven by a commitment to \"*intensify* [Respondent's] *investigation efforts*,\" but solely to rescue the Governments' hopeless arbitration position.37\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 7 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-433**, p. 57.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 69-78 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 71 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 39.\n\n200.\n\nClaimant contends that in pursuit of these aims, through intimidation, self-interest and confabulation, Respondent's witnesses were prompted by NAB interrogators to make false confessions.38 However, this allegedly became clear at the Hearing when, according to Claimant, testimonies crumbled and Respondent's (albeit unconvincing) documentary evidence of the bribery, *i.e*., Mr. Aziz's diaries, was undermined.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 298-320.\n\n201.\n\nClaimant contends that it has maintained a robust compliance culture, further corroborating the conclusion that Respondent's allegations are a conspiracy. Dismissing Respondent's allegations that TCC ignored 'red flags' based on documentary and witness evidence, Claimant maintains that: (i) Col. Khan's salary increases were due to legitimate business considerations and company-wide policies; and (ii) Claimant's self-reporting of deficiencies in the application procedure for expatriate work visas provides no basis on which to dismiss Claimant's Treaty claims, but instead confirms its commitment to ethical business practice.39 Moreover, Claimant submits that Respondent's claims of illegitimacy in relation to the Umbrella Strategy are contrary to the record and rely on a selective misinterpretation of the documents.40\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 218; Claimant's Rejoinder \u00b6 260.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 223-231.\n\n**2. Legal Consequences, If Any**\n---------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAs for legal consequences flowing from proven allegations of corruption, if any, Claimant emphasizes that the Tribunal's Draft Decision concluded that the three jurisdictional requirements were met and that Claimant's claims were admissible; in Claimant's view, Respondent has offered no reason for which these issues merit re-litigation.41\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 395 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 628\u2013640, 678\u2013685.\n\n203.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims for four reasons. Firstly, Claimant emphasizes that the admission requirement contained in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is not a legality requirement and cannot now be retroactively revisited since compliance is measured at the time of the investment's admission, not at any time thereafter.42 Secondly, Claimant disputes the contention that a legality requirement can be read into the Treaty because it is implicit in international law.43 Thirdly, Claimant asserts that pre- or post-admission allegations (of corruption that allegedly occurred before or after the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement) are irrelevant to the legality requirement and thus at the jurisdictional stage.44 Lastly, Claimant maintains that there is no implicit corruption-related condition on Pakistan's offer to arbitrate.45\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 117-134.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 135-137.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 138-150.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 151-154.\n\n204.\n\nClaimant further submits that despite Respondent's attempts to rely on the *World Duty Free* and the *Churchill Mining* cases, there is no general principle of \"*unclean hands*\" in international law that would render Claimant's claims inadmissible and the Tribunal cannot decline to exercise its mandate on the ground of transnational public policy.46\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 155-170; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 395-402.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, Claimant maintains that Respondent has not met the burden of proving its allegations and cannot save its Application by asking the Tribunal to connect the dots and infer the corruption which Respondent has failed to prove. In Claimant's view, there is no legal or factual basis for the relief that Respondent seeks; it thus asks the Tribunal to dismiss the Application in its entirety, grant a full remedy for the harm caused by Respondent's reliance on fraudulent evidence and move onto the next stage of proceedings.47\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 13, 20 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 383.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief dated 7 March 2017, Respondent seeks relief in the following terms:48\n\n(i) A declaration that Respondent's witness statements and accompanying evidence are admitted to the record;\n\n(ii) A declaration that, as a result of Respondent's evidence of fraud and corruption, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine all of TCC's claims or all of Claimant's claims are inadmissible and are dismissed, with prejudice, or all of Claimant's claims are unsuccessful on the merits and are dismissed, with prejudice;\n\n(iii) An order that Claimant should pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including their own costs, the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by Respondent, including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as the expenses of Respondent's own officials and employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate; and\n\n(iv) Such further or other relief as the Tribunal, in its discretion, considers appropriate.\n\nRespondent' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 444.\n\n207.\n\nRespondent further continues to reserve all of its rights in respect of the Draft Decision, which it submits must be substantially revised to take account of the Tribunal's findings on Respondent's Application to Dismiss and to reflect the relief sought above.49\n\nRespondent' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 445.\n\n**B. Claimant's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief dated 7 March 2017, Claimant requests that the Tribunal:50\n\n(i) Dismiss the Application in its entirety and with prejudice;\n\n(ii) Order Respondent to pay, on a full indemnity basis and with interest, all legal and other costs incurred since the beginning of these proceedings through the end of this phase; and\n\n(iii) Order such other and further relief as may be just and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 409.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n---------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nAt the outset of its reasoning, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in the course of the present phase of the proceedings concerning Respondent's allegations of corruption as well as, to the extent relevant in the present context, the arguments and evidence adduced in the previous phase on jurisdiction and liability. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning is structured as follows: As a first step, the Tribunal will assess Claimant's objections to the admissibility of Respondent's Application and of the new evidence that Respondent has submitted in support of its Application. In case the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Respondent's Application and the new evidence is admissible, it will, as a second step, examine the standard and burden of proof applicable to Respondent's allegations of corruption. As a third step, the Tribunal will analyze each of Respondent's factual allegations and determine whether these have been established in accordance with the applicable standard and burden of proof. Finally, in case the Tribunal finds that one or more of Respondent's factual allegations have been established, it will assess the legal consequences, if any, flowing from any such proven allegations.\n\n**A. Claimant's Objections to the Admissibility of Respondent's Application and of the New Evidence Respondent Has Submitted in Support of Its Application**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nClaimant contends that there was not a \"*long running investigation into corruption*\" prior to Respondent's decision to assert accusations here in a belated attempt to frustrate this arbitration.51 Claimant argues that Respondent's enduring inaction despite its \"*awareness of allegations of corruption*\" since the inception of the Reko Diq project renders the Application inadmissible in three respects.52\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51-78 *referring to* Respondent's 17 August 2015 Letter to the Tribunal, at 2.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51-116 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 35.\n\n212.\n\nFirstly, Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to raise the allegations of corruption, which it has now raised in its Application, as preliminary objections during the generous time set by the Tribunal and thus that Respondent has waived any objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over, or admissibility of, Claimant's claims.53 Secondly, Claimant argues that Respondent's failure to pursue these allegations in a timely fashion also bars the Application, as a procedural matter by the doctrine of laches, and thirdly, as a substantive matter by the doctrine of acquiescence; both requiring denial of Respondent's request to admit new evidence and thus dismissal of the Application.54\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 78.\n\n**a. Respondent's Application is Time-Barred**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nClaimant submits that ICSID Arbitration Rules 41 and 26 govern the Tribunal's determination of whether Respondent can assert preliminary objections at this stage of proceedings.55 Claimant rejects: (i) Respondent's \"*flawed proposition*\" that these rules do not apply to corruption; and (ii) the alleged impossibility of presenting this evidence earlier.56 To the contrary, Claimant maintains that Mr. Farooq's corrupt reputation, the fact that corruption was \"*common knowledge*\" and the fact that there were no barriers to Respondent questioning its officials, gave ample basis for inquiry.57\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 79 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 20 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 371-373.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 79-80 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 371.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 81 *referring to* Malik, \u00b6 6.\n\n214.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's suggestion that Rule 41(1)'s mandatory language (objections \"*shall*\" be submitted \"*no later than*\" the counter-memorial deadline) should be disregarded given: (i) the Tribunal's obligation to investigate corruption; and (ii) the language in Rule 41(2) permitting the Tribunal to consider jurisdiction at any stage, should be dismissed. Relying on commentators and various tribunals, Claimant submits that that key issue is the parties' equal right to due process which includes a respect for the Tribunal's time limits.58\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\n215.\n\nRespondent's further suggestion that corruption allegations constitute \"*special circumstances*\" under Rule 26(3) is also rejected by Claimant.59 Claimant criticizes Respondent's incorrect characterization of the *World Duty Free* and *Metal-Tech* decisions and instead cites *Siag* to support the fact that Respondent's failure to exercise diligence expected of a party with corruption concerns is sufficient to dismiss its challenges to jurisdiction and admissibility as time-barred.60\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89.\n\n**b. Laches Bars Respondent's Application**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nClaimant submits that laches is based on notions of equity and fairness and constitutes \"*the exclusion of all pretensions to right*\" on the basis of \"*the length of time during which that right has been neglected.*\"61 Claimant perceives that Respondent's assertion that this doctrine does not apply since this is a challenge to jurisdiction in an existing claim, not an overdue claim, misses the point by focusing on the label rather than the substance of submissions.62 Claimant maintains that these allegations have created a new phase in proceedings, comparible to a new case, not simply a procedural request for consolidation as in the *Canfor & Tembec* cases cited.63\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 92 *citing to Spader* Case, United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IX, 223\u2013224 (1903/1905) [**CA 266**] at 224 (*quoting Vattel*).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 92.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 93 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 375-376.\n\n217.\n\nMoreover, referring to the *Gentini* and *Cadiz* cases, Claimant argues that the delay has had a significant effect on the nature and the quality of available evidence.64 Claimant alleges that its prejudice has been compounded by Respondent continuing to make new allegations (including the belated introduction of Mr. Iqbal's testimony) as evidenced by its ever-shifting testimony and the ease with which witnesses have been willing to deny such allegations.65\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 94-99 *citing to Gentini* Case, United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards Vol. X, 551\u2013561[**CA 268**] *and Case of Ann Eulogia Garcia Cadiz (Loretta G. Barberie) v. Venezuela*, opinion of the Commissioner, Mr. Findlay, Claims Commission established under the Convention concluded between the United States of America and Venezuela on 5 December 1885, United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards Vol. XXIX, 293\u2013298 [**CA 270**], p. 298.\n\n**c. Acquiescence Bars Respondent's Application**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nClaimant refers to a number of international tribunals holding that respondent states cannot ignore corruption and then try to use such alleged illegality as a shield against investment claims.66 Thus, by reason of its two-decade long failure to investigate and prosecute, Claimant perceives that Respondent should be deemed to have acquiesced to the lapse of the claim.67\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 269-270.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 101-116 *referring to* International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 12 December 2001, [**CA 1**], Art. 45(b).\n\n219.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's suggestion that any corruption, no matter how minor or how late the allegations are raised, should result in the Tribunal dismissing the investor's claims no matter their merit nor whether the state has attempted to punish its own official's conduct, would create perverse incentives in favour of corruption.68 Claimant explains that despite countless opportunities to investigate the alleged corruption, Respondent was miraculously able to unearth its allegations after only a few days of interviews; Claimant draws similarities to a recent decision in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to contend that NAB is abusing its powers for purposes extraneous to anti-corruption goals in order for Respondent to avoid liability in this international arbitration.69\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 107 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 273-292, 241-253 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 379.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 113-115 *citing to* C.A. No. 82-K of 2015, Supreme Court of Pakistan, Order (Amir Hani Muslim, J.) [**CA 278**].\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nRespondent submits that it has not waived any of its objections and there are no procedural restrictions that bar its Application.\n\n221.\n\nFirstly, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), Respondent argues that it has raised objections \"*as early as possible.*\"70 While Claimant's corrupt practices may have been suspected, Respondent emphasizes a distinction between rumors and tangible evidence which could be placed before a tribunal. Additionally, Respondent claims that Claimant's suggestion that Respondent waited for \"*two decades of deliquence*\" is unsubstantiated given the investigations which were indeed initiated.71 Respondent argues that it was unable to raise its objections earlier due to Claimant's failure to comply with disclosure obligations, concealing payments and witnesses.72\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 371 *citing to* *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award dated 8 October 2009 [**CA-136**], \u00b6 221.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 406(a)(i) *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 183 lines 4-19.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 371 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 64-68.\n\n222.\n\nNonetheless, if the Tribunal determines that Respondent's new evidence was filed outside the time limits, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should make use of its power to examine its jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) as well as its *ex officio* obligation to investigate and rule upon the existence and consequences of corruption.73\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 372 *citing to* Hwang & Lim, *Corruption in Arbitration - Law and Reality*, Asian International Arbitration Journal Volume No. 1, May 2012 [**RLA-33**], \u00b6 15, 24.\n\n223.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), \"*special circumstances*\" exist that entitle the Tribunal to disregard any applicable time limits \u2013 there is allegedly no doubt that the new evidence is significant enough to warrant the exercise of the Tribunal's power given that it goes directly to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims.74 Respondent contends that the *Siag* case is not instructive given that it did not concern corruption allegations.75\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 373.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 406(a)(ii) *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 46 line 12 to p. 47 line 2, *citing to*, *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award of 1 June 2009 [**CA-195**], \u00b6\u00b6 296-300.\n\n224.\n\nRespondent further contends that the doctrine of laches does not apply here since: (i) this is not an application concerning an overdue claim, but Respondent is challenging jurisdiction in an existing claim; and (ii) the application of this equitable principle is not supported by Arbitration Rules or ICSID case law.76 Respondent also considers that the doctrine of acquiescence does not apply since corruption has not been \"*ignored*\" as alleged by Claimant. In this regard, Respondent refers to prior investigations and its updates to the Tribunal on the NAB inquiry.77\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 361-370.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 406(b) and (c) *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101, Transcript (Day 1), p. 190 lines 7-15 and p. 32 line 12 to p. 43 line 17, Respondent's Opening Slides pp. 11-20 *and* Respondent's Reply \u00b6 10, 34-48.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant's first argument, *i.e*., that Respondent has waived any further preliminary objections under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, relates exclusively to Respondent's claim that, based on the alleged acts of corruption, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and/or Claimant's claims are inadmissible. This first argument does not relate to Respondent's further claim that Claimant's claims should also fail on the merits or to the admission of the new evidence that Respondent has submitted in support of its Application. Therefore, the Tribunal will address the alleged waiver of preliminary objections first.\n\n226.\n\nIn the context of its further arguments, Claimant takes the position that Respondent's Application as a whole is time-barred, based on the doctrine of laches or extinctive prescription and on the doctrine of acquiescence, and also opposes the admission of the new evidence. These arguments will be addressed second.\n\n**a. Allegation that Respondent Has Waived Any Further Objections to the Tribunal's Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Claimant's Claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nClaimant firstly argues that, taking into account the advanced stage of the proceedings, Respondent has waived any further objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or the admissibility of Claimant's claims and makes reference to ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and 26(3).78 ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, which deals with \"*Preliminary Objections,*\" provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage, of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence*.\"\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n228.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 26, which is concerned with \"*Time Limits,*\" provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*(3) Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise*.\"\n\n229.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that Respondent raised the specific allegations of corruption that have been the subject of the present phase of the proceedings for the first time after the oral hearing on jurisdiction and liability and after the filing of the Parties' post-hearing briefs, at a time when the Tribunal was deliberating on its decision on jurisdiction and liability. It is therefore undisputed that Respondent did not raise its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility on the grounds of alleged corruption within the time limits set for its Counter-Memorial or its Rejoinder filed in the jurisdiction and liability phase of the proceedings.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent takes the position that it has raised its objections \"*as early as possible*\" given that the facts on which they are based were unknown to it and it did not have tangible evidence to support them, until it established the Group of Experts to re-examine the allegations of corruption relating to the Reko Diq project.79 Respondent thus invokes the exception provided in Rule 41(1): \"\u2026 *unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at the time*.\" In addition, Respondent notes that pursuant to Rule 41(2), the Tribunal may at any stage of the proceedings consider at its own initiative whether it has jurisdiction to hear the claims before it and claims that the Tribunal has an *ex officio* obligation \"*to investigate and rule upon the existence and consequences of corruption*.\"80 Finally, Respondent invokes the existence of \"*special circumstances*\" within the meaning of Rule 26(3), arguing that it has presented the Tribunal with new evidence \"*in a timely manner and there can be no doubt that the new evidence is significant enough to warrant the exercise of the Tribunal's power*.\"81\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 371.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 372.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 373.\n\n231.\n\nAs to Respondent's argument that the facts underlying its allegations of corruption were not known to it at the time it filed its written submissions on jurisdiction and liability, Claimant correctly points out that Respondent's own witnesses have testified that the alleged corruption was \"*widely known*\" and \"*common knowledge*\" within the BDA at the time the alleged acts of corruption took place.82 While Respondent acknowledges that \"*TCC's corrupt practices had long been suspected*\" but distinguishes between rumors and \"*tangible evidence that can be placed before a tribunal*,\"83 the Tribunal notes that Respondent did not provide an entirely satisfactory explanation as to why a Group of Experts was only established in 2015 and, most importantly, why the individuals that have now appeared as Respondent's witnesses had never been interviewed about the suspicions of corruption as part of the investigations that Respondent claims to have been ongoing since 2011.84 In fact, Respondent itself submits that the Group of Experts was established in the course of settlement negotiations between the Parties following the oral hearing on jurisdiction and liability, in order to \"*get to the bottom of the matter*,\" *i.e*., of the purported irregularities identified by the investigation in 2011 and by the Supreme Court in 2014, and that it for the first time identified \"*specific instances of corrupt practices*\" in connection with the Reko Diq project.85\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 22; Claimant's October 2015 Opposition, \u00b6 81. Farooq I, \u00b6 26; Aziz, \u00b6 20; Tahir I, \u00b6 11; Malik, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 371.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 69-77. In its Briefing Note of 4 June 2015, the Group of Experts noted that \"[a]*ll people we met stated how no one had ever questioned them before about the Project and that a day would come when the real facts about Reko Diq would come to light*.\" **Exhibit RE-443**, \u00b6 4.1.1.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\n232.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is therefore not entirely convinced by the justification provided by Respondent regarding the timing of its investigations into the suspicions of corruption, the Tribunal is willing to accept that if the alleged instances of corruption on which Respondent relies actually happened, Respondent may not have been aware of them. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that it would go too far to assume that Respondent has waived its right to raise objections to jurisdiction and admissibility on these grounds. Any possible delay in obtaining knowledge of the relevant facts can, and will, be taken into account in the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence. In particular, any potential consequences that such delay may have had on Claimant's ability to adduce counter-evidence should not be held against it.\n\n233.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that in view of the seriousness of at least some of the allegations raised by Respondent and the fact that Respondent has advanced ten witnesses that testify to having paid or accepted bribes in connection with the Reko Diq project, there are indeed \"*special circumstances*\" that justify to hear Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility despite the fact that they have been raised only at a very late stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal is aware of Claimant's objection to the qualification of Respondent's allegation as \"*special circumstances*\" and its argument that there is no need to consider these as objections to jurisdiction or admissibility given that the Tribunal \"*may appropriately consider the effect of the allegations as an affirmative defense on the merits to TCCA's claims*.\"86 However, the Tribunal does not agree with this argument in its general form, taking into account the different legal issues to be addressed within an assessment of jurisdictional and admissibility objections on the one hand and the assessment of liability on the merits on the other, as demonstrated by the Legal Opinion of Judge Schwebel that Respondent submitted in this proceedings.87 Similarly, a finding that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear certain claims cannot be equated with a finding that such claims fail on the merits.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 64 *et seq*.\n\n234.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that the allegations raised by Respondent in its Application give rise to \"*special circumstances*\" that justify hearing its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n**b. Allegation that Respondent's Application and the New Evidence It has Submitted are Barred Based on the Doctrine of Laches and the Doctrine of Acquiescence**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nAs a separate argument, Claimant claims that Respondent's \"*long delay in submitting allegations and evidence of this kind*\" is sufficient to bar Respondent's Application, invoking the principle of laches or \"*extinctive prescription*\" and the doctrine of acquiescence. On that basis, Claimant also objects to the admission of the new evidence submitted by Respondent in support of its allegations of corruption.88\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 93-96; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92, 100.\n\n236.\n\nClaimant claims that under the principle of laches, \"*a party's undue delay in asserting a claim is considered, and can justify denial of the claim*\" and argues that the rationale underlying this principle, which is based on \"*fundamental notions of equity and fairness*,\" applies \"*with special force here*.\" In Claimant's view, the admission of the new evidence would be unduly prejudicial to Claimant, arguing that such evidence is \"*fundamentally unreliable*,\" disproven by the documentary record and, in some instances, concerns very distant events as a result of which evidence and witnesses may no longer be available to effectively mount a defense, and has been obtained by Respondent \"*by misusing its sovereign police power as a discovery tool*.\"89\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 94-98; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 94.\n\n237.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, none of the above-mentioned considerations justify barring Respondent's Application or denying Respondent's request to admit the new evidence into the record. As mentioned above, any prejudice caused to Claimant and its ability to adduce counter-evidence can, and will, be taken into account in the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence. In particular, the Tribunal will ensure that the fact that, as noted by Claimant, relevant parties and possible witnesses such as Chris Arndt and the former Chief Minister Muhammad Yousaf have passed away in the meantime,90 will not go to Claimant's detriment. In addition, the Tribunal will take into account both Parties' submissions as to the circumstances in which the testimony of Respondent's witnesses was obtained and make its own assessment on Claimant's allegations in this regard, to the extent that it considers such allegations established on the facts of this case.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 95 (with note 150).\n\n238.\n\nClaimant further relies on the doctrine of acquiescence, arguing that \"*there is strong support among arbitration tribunals and commentators \u2026 for the rule that a respondent state should not be allowed to invoke corruption as a defense against investor claims if it has failed to genuinely investigate or prosecute the alleged corruption.*\"91 According to Claimant, the right to assert a claim is lost through acquiescence when a State \"*fail*[s] *to assert a claim when a State would be expected to do so*,\" in particular when the ignorance invoked by the State was caused by a negligent failure to investigate.92 In this regard, Claimant refers to \"*two decades of delinquence*\" in which no serious investigation was conducted given that Respondent \"*did not so much as interview a single witness on allegations of corruption or review any documents or government records save the Supreme Court record.*\"93\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 103.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 105 *quoting from* Aloysius P. Llamzon, *Corruption in International Investment Arbitration* (2014) [**CA 275**], p. 274.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 67.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted above that Respondent has not provided an entirely satisfactory explanation as to why it only established the Group of Experts in order to \"*get to the bottom of the matter*\" in 2015.94 In addition and while Respondent emphasizes that \"[t]*he public officials implicated in corruption in this case are subject to the NAB's on-going criminal inquiry \u2013 Pakistan is not letting them go free*,\"95 it has not denied Claimant's submission that the NAB inquiry that was commenced after the Group of Experts had been disbanded in June 2015, has not yet been converted into a formal investigation and that so far, no individual prosecution has been initiated against any of Respondent's witnesses \u2013 despite the fact that they provided sworn testimony to the NAB in which they confessed to having paid or accepted bribes.96\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Application, \u00b6 71.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 406.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\n240.\n\nNevertheless, and taking into account that there has not been complete inaction of Respondent in respect of investigating the allegations of corruption, the Tribunal does not consider it justified to bar Respondent's Application from being heard or the new evidence from being admitted into the record. In the Tribunal's view, the current status of the NAB inquiry as well as the above noted considerations regarding the overall timing of the investigations, in particular the forming of the Group of Experts, should rather form part of the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence and, specifically, the assessment of the credibility of the account that Respondent's witnesses have given on the alleged acts of corruption.\n\n**c. Conclusion on Claimant's Objections and the Admission of the New Evidence**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant's objections to the admissibility of Respondent's Application are dismissed and the concerns raised by Claimant regarding the timing and further circumstances surrounding the investigations conducted by Respondent will be taken into account on the merits \u2013 as part of the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence presented by both Parties.\n\n242.\n\nAs to the new evidence submitted by Respondent, which has up to date been admitted only *de bene esse*, the Tribunal decides to admit such evidence, as well as the counter-evidence submitted by Claimant, into the record.\n\n**B. Approach to Respondent's Application**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nAt the outset of its assessment of the merits of Respondent's Application, the Tribunal takes note of the concern expressed by Respondent that the Tribunal may be inclined to attribute more credibility to Claimant's witnesses, whom Respondent describes as \"*articulate, polished English-speaking professionals,*\" than to the witnesses presented by Respondent, to whom Respondent refers as \"*parochial government employees operating in a process-driven but ultimately corrupt environment*.\"97\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\n244.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it is well aware of the unfamiliar situation in which witnesses testifying to a tribunal find themselves, which may have been particularly the case for Respondent's witnesses, as well as of the interpretation issues that arose during the oral testimony given by the witnesses who testified in Urdu. The Tribunal has taken Respondent's concern seriously and has taken particular care to make its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses' accounts independent of the cultural differences which Respondent has highlighted and independent of a particular witness's ability to articulate their account of the events in a well-formulated manner.\n\n245.\n\nAs a second preliminary matter, Respondent has expressed the concern that the Tribunal may be vulnerable to a \"*confirmation bias*\" given that it has already provided the Parties with its Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which contains findings that, but for the corruption allegations raised by Respondent in its Application, Claimant succeeds in its claims. Specifically, Respondent argues that the Tribunal may be inclined to \"*ignore inconvenient evidence which undermines the Draft Decision*\" and emphasizes the importance of \"*not glossing over factual allegations*.\"98\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to note that it has taken the allegations raised by Respondent in its Application very seriously, as demonstrated, *inter alia*, by the fact that it has heard the Parties in a separate phase of proceedings dealing exclusively with these allegations, which consisted of two rounds of written submissions, a total of 13 days of oral hearings in which all 24 fact and expert witnesses were heard, and written post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal further recalls that, while Claimant requested in its October 2015 Opposition, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal proceed to issue its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on the basis of the evidence in the record, the Tribunal informed the Parties on 27 October 2015 that \"*it has almost concluded its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with, a draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues raised in Respondent's Application.*\"\n\n247.\n\nAt that point and throughout this phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal has always been aware that Respondent's allegations, if and to extent they would be proven in the course of this separate phase, could warrant a substantial revision of the conclusions the Tribunal had reached in its deliberations on the basis of the evidence in the record by the time Respondent submitted its Application. The members of the Tribunal have therefore been careful to review and evaluate the new submissions and new evidence presented by the Parties with an open mind and with the constant aim of avoiding what Respondent has described as \"*confirmation bias*.\"\n\n248.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal also takes note of the concerns expressed by Respondent in its letter of 30 June 2017 regarding the Tribunal's approach to issue a Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claimants (with Reasons to Follow) and the fact that the Tribunal took more time than expected by Respondent to draft and finalize this fully reasoned Decision. For the reasons set out in its message of 4 July 2017, the Tribunal re-confirms that it has given itself sufficient time to fully and properly review the Parties' Post-Hearing Briefs and to deliberate on each of the allegations raised in Respondent's Application, with an open mind, before rendering its Decision with Reasons to Follow on 20 March 2017. In particular, the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusion on each individual allegation, which are now set out in the present Decision in detail, were fully discussed and agreed between the members of the Tribunal before that date.\n\n249.\n\nMore specifically, the Tribunal has carefully considered and thoroughly discussed the written and oral testimony provided by all 24 witnesses in this phase of the proceedings as well as the documentary evidence, in particular, Mr. Aziz's diaries and the evidence produced in relation to their authenticity, as well as all other contemporaneous documents presented by the Parties. On that basis, the Tribunal has assessed each of Respondent's allegations by taking into account both the direct evidence and the surrounding circumstances invoked by Respondent and, in addition, it has evaluated the Parties' more general submissions, including on the timing and circumstances in which the evidence was produced, as noted above.\n\n250.\n\nIn the following analysis, the Tribunal will first address the standard and burden of proof in respect of Respondent's allegations of corruption, including the question as to the requirements that would have to be proven. As a second step, the Tribunal will assess the factual circumstances, *i.e.,* whether and to what extent Respondent's allegations of corruption have been proven on the facts of the case as established on the basis of the evidence in the record. Finally, if and to the extent such allegations have been proven, the Tribunal will assess the legal consequences arising from its findings on the facts.\n\n**C. Standard and Burden of Proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Standard of Proof**\n------------------------\n\n251.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal has discretion as to the applicable standard of proof. According to Respondent, the Tribunal should apply the ordinary civil 'balance of probabilities' standard and reject Claimant's claims under the Treaty if it is more likely than not that Claimant engaged in corruption with the intention of obtaining, maintaining or expanding its investment.99 Respondent argues that Claimant attempts to impose a more onerous standard which goes beyond that required by international law.100\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 386-389; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 146-157; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 377-404.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 378.\n\n252.\n\nRespondent submits that there is a lack of uniform approach to the standard in corruption cases. Various tribunals (*Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan, Desert Line v. Yemen and Rompetrol v. Romania*) have confirmed that a flexibility to adopt the appropriate standard should be adopted by tribunals, evaluating the evidence before them.101 Respondent maintains that this approach was confirmed by Judge Higgins and codified by the ICSID Convention in Articles 43-45 and in ICSID Arbitration Rule 34.102\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 146-150 *citing to*, *Metal-Tech Ltd v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214 / Exhibit SS-7**], \u00b6 239, *Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008 [**CA 115**], \u00b6 129 (quoting from the *Oil Platforms Case*) *and* *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 [**RLA-268**], \u00b6 182.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 148-149 *referring to* Rosalyn Higgins, Speech to the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, 2 November 2007 [**RLA-255**], p. 4.\n\n253.\n\nRespondent therefore firstly rejects the necessity for \"*but-for*\" causation; while the causal link between the investment and corruption may be one of the factors that impacts the Tribunal's analysis, Respondent contends that any corruption made in connection with the investment is pertinent to the outcome.103 Respondent criticizes Claimant's reliance on cases which not only fail to support the application of such a strict requirement, but in a number of instances directly contradict it.104 In fact, Respondent refers to *Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic* where the tribunal observed that \"*regular payments over a period of time effectively* 'buy' *the long-term goodwill of the recipient*\" and \"*make it difficult to establish a causal link between the bribe and the advantage that it procures.*\"105 Respondent thus argues that in most cases its evidence does establish a link, but where this is not so, the Tribunal should \"*connect the dots,*\" inferring a link between payments and Claimant's investment.106\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 380.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 386; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 382-389 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 40-70.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 383 *citing to* *Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009 [**CA-157**], \u00b6 44.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 383.\n\n254.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's reliance on *Niko* is inapposite since Claimant fails to mention that the tribunal's purported dismissal of the corruption defence for lack of causation, was a mere jurisdictional decision.107 Respondent maintains that *Tanesco* was a commercial case dealing with contractual rights, not investment treaty rights, therefore the causal link required to be established in that case is not comparable to that which is required to exist here.108 In *World Duty Free,* Respondent submits that the type of causal link required to enable Kenya to lawfully avoid the contract was of secondary importance; the investor's claims were ultimately dismissed as corruption constituted a breach of transnational public policy.109\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 385 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 44, 50 *and citing to Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production* *Company Limited, & Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 & ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013 [**CA-205 / Exhibit SS-11**].\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 386 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 44, 51-52 and *citing to Tanzania Electric Supply Co. Ltd. (Tanesco) v. Independent Power Tanzania Ltd.* ICSID Case No. ARB 98/8, Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues, 9 February 2001 [**CA-209**].\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 388 referring to Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 47 *citing to* *World Duty Free Co. Ltd. v. The Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006 [**RLA-36 / Exhibit SS-2**], \u00b6 167, 175.\n\n255.\n\nRespondent refers to the late Professor W\u00e4lde in the *Methanex v. United States* case and the tribunal in *Metal-Tech* to support the argument that the Tribunal should \"*connect the dots*\" created by circumstantial evidence, notwithstanding the absence of any direct evidence of investor wrongdoing.110 Respondent maintains that Mr. Farooq's corrupt conduct, the widespread Pakistani corruption and the fact that \"*one in five cases of transnational bribery occur in the extractive sector*\" constitute relevant circumstantial evidence, making it unrealistic to assume corruption is unlikely in this context.111 Respondent also refers to the World Bank's Sanctions Board's discretion in determining the relevance and sufficiency of evidence, as well as inferring intent and knowledge in corruption cases and thus argues that an ICSID tribunal should not apply an inconsistent standard of proof.112\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 384 *citing to Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005 [**CA-191 / RLA-107**], Part III, Chapter B, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; *and* *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA-214** / **Exhibit SS-7**].\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 407 *referring to* Boggs III, \u00b6 13; Hargreaves, \u00b6 63; Flores, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34; **Exhibit RE-181**, p. 5; *and* **Exhibit RE-458,** p. 10.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 408.\n\n256.\n\nRespondent secondly rejects Claimant's assertion that Pakistan must prove any wrongfully obtained rights to be \"*foundational to TCCA's investment.*\"113 While Respondent acknowledges the distinction between illegality at the inception of the investment and illegality during its performance, it does not accept that the latter would be \"*outside of the Tribunal's mandate.*\"114 Respondent dismisses Claimant's authorities provided in support of its argument and additionally highlights that none of these (bar *Metal-Tech)* actually involved corruption.115 Respondent argues that *Yukos* was based on domestic tax law and cannot be compared to the special status of corruption in an international context.116 Respondent maintains that, to the contrary, to its knowledge, no investment treaty tribunal has yet had to consider the legal effect of corruption during the performance of an investment.117 Respondent also deems Claimant's reliance on *NIOC* to be inapposite since it does not introduce a general principle that \"*nebulous concepts, like* 'tainting'*, simply cannot be employed in order to trump the fundamental requirement of causation*\" as Claimant's counsel argued in its opening statement at the hearing.118\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 390.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 390-393 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 167.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 391.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 391-393 *citing to* *Yukos Universal Ltd. (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, PCA Case No. 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA-178 / Exhibit SS-18**].\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 393.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 387 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 190; *National Iranian Oil Company v.

Romania* award which Claimant cites in support of this heightened standard.121 Respondent maintains that it creates an impossible tension by recognizing that corruption is notoriously difficult to prove but nevertheless raising the evidential hurdle to make it harder to prove than other allegations. Respondent further maintains that the tribunal in *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, also rejected arguments for a heightened standard of proof and determined that the starting point should always be the 'balance of probabilities'.122\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 406 *referring to*, Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, no. 1 (2010) 51 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6 43; Hwang and Lim, *Corruption in Arbitration \u2013 Law and Reality*, Asian International Arbitration Journal, Volume 8 No. 1, pp. 1-119 [**RLA-33**], \u00b6 38.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 151-153 *citing to*, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.

Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n259.\n\nWhile Respondent accepts that it bears the overall burden of proof, it argues that Claimant has failed to refute any of the international law authorities which support the concept that where it establishes *prima facie* proof, and Claimant possesses evidence to rebut it, the burden may shift.123 Respondent refers to Constantine Partasides' statement that \"*plausible evidence of corruption, offered by the party alleging illegality, should require an adequate evidentiary showing by the party denying the allegation*\" and maintains that this has been expressly acknowledged in *Fraport II*.124 Pakistan asserts that these observations also accord with the decisions of various other tribunals including but not limited to *Rockwell v. Iran*, *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, *Middle East Cement v. Egypt*, *Feldman v. Mexico, International Thunderbird Gaming v. Mexico*, and *Siag v. Egypt*.125\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 155-157; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 412-415; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 390.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 413 *referring to* Constantine *Partasides*, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World,* ICSID Review - Foreign Investment Law Journal 25, no. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6 66; *and citing to* *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

Czech Republic*, Respondent further maintains that should the Tribunal have any doubts, it has the duty under international law independently to inquire into and fully investigate that corruption.126\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 412 *referring to* B. Cremades and D. Cairns, *Transnational Public Policy in International Arbitral Decisionmaking: The Cases of Bribery, Money laundering and Fraud* in K. Karsten and A. Berkeley (eds.)

The Legal Standards Relevant to Mr. Aziz's Diaries**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nAs will be discussed in Section D.2.e below in relation to the Surface Rights Lease, Respondent relies on Mr. Aziz's diaries, which form part of a broader series of diaries kept by Mr. Aziz as Personal Assistant to Mr. Farooq (BDA Chairman), to substantiate its claim that Claimant made improper surface rights payments and other bribes. It claims that the diaries are authentic documentary evidence, debunking TCC's \"*grand conspiracy*\" theory.127\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 233-253.\n\n262.\n\nRespondent refers to *Churchill Mining v Republic of Indonesia* to advance the argument that it has the initial burden of establishing the *prima facie* authenticity of the diaries, while Claimant has the burden of establishing fabrication.128 Respondent maintains that the Parties agree on this, but do not agree on what Respondent must do to satisfy this hurdle and whether or not it has been met.129\n\nLaPorte Submission, \u00b6 10 *citing to* *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 [**RLA-334**].\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 391, *referring to* its argument to this effect in Respondent's LaPorte Submission, \u00b6 10, which it claims has not been challenged in Claimant's LaPorte Response.\n\n263.\n\nRespondent criticizes Claimant's suggestion that the burden is \"*not a simple burden*\" based on *Golshani*.130 Respondent maintains that Claimant's reliance on this award is misplaced; the nature of the tribunal's inquiry clearly distinguishes it from the present case. Nonetheless, Respondent highlights the guiding statement from that award and maintains that Mr. Aziz's diaries do \"*inspire a minimally sufficient degree of confidence*\" in their authenticity, if indeed not a greatly higher level of confidence and as such, Pakistan's burden has been met for the following reasons.131\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 393 *citing to Abrahim Rahman Golshani v The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,* IUSCT Case No. 812 (546-812-3), Final Award, 2 March 1993 [**RLA-330**].\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 394 *citing to Abrahim Rahman Golshani v The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,* IUSCT Case No. 812 (546-812-3), Final Award, 2 March 1993 [**RLA-330**], \u00b6 49.\n\n264.\n\nFirstly, Respondent maintains that its witness evidence is itself enough to satisfy this burden.132 Pakistan maintains that the questions posed to Mr. Aziz during cross-examination, in an attempt to disprove his testimony were adequately answered and Mr. Farooq and Mr. Dad further corroborated his account.133\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 235-239, 392.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 235-239 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 24 lines 18-20 *and* Claimant's LaPorte Response, \u00b6 15 *and* Transcript (Day 2), p. 586 lines 3-9 and p. 587 lines 7-8.\n\n265.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that it has given Claimant every opportunity to inspect the diaries.134 Even if the Tribunal accepts Claimant's argument that they should have been made available at a particular location, Respondent maintains that due to ongoing criminal investigations, there are legitimate reasons for their only being available in Pakistan.135 Respondent thus maintains that to the extent Claimant takes the position that Mr. Aziz's diaries cannot be authenticated without having been produced in original form, such an argument must fail.136\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 396-398.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 399-400.\n\nLaPorte Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n266.\n\nThirdly, Respondent maintains that the case-law on which Claimant relies to suggest that the diaries should be excluded can be distinguished.137 Respondent argues that the claimant in *EDF* did not provide a similarly legitimate reason for the non-production of an audio recording and the claimant's own expert witness was unable to examine the original recording. Here, however, leading forensic examiner Mr. LaPorte has produced a report following forensic examination which concludes that there was \"*not a single feature in these questioned documents to suggest that they were fraudulently prepared*\" as alleged.138 Respondent thus contends that there is no basis for comparing Mr. Aziz's diaries with the unexamined and clearly altered audio recordings in *EDF*.139 Respondent further distinguishes *Europe Cement* on the factors the tribunal considered relevant to an assessment of (in)authenticity of documents. Respondent maintains that here there is corroborating witness evidence of authenticity which did not exist in *Europe Cement*. Respondent has produced originals for inspection and Mr. Aziz's diaries have withstood forensic scrutiny.140\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 401-404.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 240, 402(b) *referring to* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 402.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 403-404 *citing to* *Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2 Award, 13 August 2009 [**RLA-228**].\n\n267.\n\nRespondent thus contends that having discharged its burden of *prima facie* proving the authenticity of the diaries, the burden of proving fabrication is upon Claimant. This will be considered in light of the forensic examination results and circumstances surrounding the relevant diary entries in Section D.2.e below.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. Standard of Proof**\n------------------------\n\n268.\n\nClaimant argues that it is insufficient for Respondent to establish that at some point during the project, Claimant ran afoul of the law. Arbitrators should not be surrogates for the host state's government, policing all investor misconduct without regard to the limited civil nature of the dispute before it.141\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n269.\n\nFirstly, Claimant contends that, provided Respondent could prove that the alleged corruption actually occurred, it would then need to prove that such corruption caused Claimant to obtain a right or benefit to which it was otherwise not entitled (the 'but-for' element).142 Claimant argues that Respondent has not even so much as alleged such a causal link with respect to many of its allegations and although corruption is hard to prove, tribunals do not have a licence to engage in gap-filling.143 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Niko* which maintained that when dealing with corruption allegations, a tribunal should \"*only decide on substantiated facts, and cannot base itself on inferences*\" drawn from circumstantial evidence.144\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177-187; Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 44-53; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2523 lines 4\u201317, p. 2524 line 18 to p. 2525 line 2 and p. 2551 lines 12\u201314.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22 *citing to* *Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited, & Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11, ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013 [**CA 205**], \u00b6 424.\n\n270.\n\nClaimant submits that the authorities advanced as support for its connect-the-dots theory of causation do not allow Respondent to escape the 'but-for' obligation.145 Claimant criticizes Respondent's ignorance to the fact that in *Sistem v Kyrgyz Republic,* although acknowledging that a causal link might be \"*difficult to establish,*\" the tribunal did not conclude that this difficulty meant that the requirement should be dispensed with.146 Claimant further argues that although the *Methanex* award did use the phrase \"*connecting the dots,*\" it took pains to caution against misuse of that approach in precisely the way Respondent attempts to do here.147 Claimant further deems Respondent's reliance on the *Metal-Tech* award to be misplaced. Contrary to the impression Respondent seeks to give, Claimant maintains that the tribunal did not jump from fact to fact, speculatively filling in gaps, nor did it conduct an inquisition by suspicion but instead maintained a straightforward application of a tribunal's powers under the ICSID Rules and the IBA Rules.148\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177-187.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 180-182.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 186 *citing to Methanex Corporation v.

In fact, as the *Fraport II* tribunal explained, the illegality must get to the \"*essence of the investment.*\"156 Claimant urges the Tribunal not to manufacture a rule \"*out of thin air*\" to allow Respondent to escape liability for its alleged violations of international law.157\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 190 *citing to National Iranian Oil Company v.

Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n275.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent attempts to establish two fall-back options in an attempt to dispute that as the moving party, it bears the burden of substantiating its allegations.163\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 172-176.\n\n276.\n\nFirstly, Respondent asks that should the Tribunal have any doubts, it should \"*independently inquire into and fully investigate*\" the allegations.164 Claimant argues that filling the alleged gaps in Respondent's case is not the Tribunal's duty.165 Secondly, Respondent has provided no explanation as to why the burden should shift to Claimant. Instead it mistreats authority in order to justify this shift.166 Claimant submits that, not only does Respondent misinterpret a passage from *Siag v Egypt,* it misleadingly truncates passages from *Fraport II* and Constantine Partasides' article which, read properly, stand for the proposition that when facing allegations of corruption, it would be unwise to \"*sit back and not contribute to the evidentiary exchange,*\" instead of supporting the burden-shifting gambit.167\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 173 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 412.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 173 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 412.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 174-176 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 413 *and* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 175-176 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 63 and Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 413.\n\n**c. The Legal Standards Relevant to Mr. Aziz's Diaries**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nWhile Claimant has not addressed the burden of proof in relation to Mr. Aziz's diaries by distinguishing between the *prima facie* authenticity and the purported fabrication, it generally takes the position that Respondent \"*always bears the burden of proving its allegations*\" and explicitly rejects Respondent's argument that it need only make a *prima facie* showing.168\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30.\n\n278.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Mr. Aziz's diaries, Claimant considers that the conclusion that they were indeed fabricated \"*is compelled*\" by the results of the forensic examination, Mr. Aziz's testimony during the hearing and Respondent's refusal to deliver the originals of Mr. Aziz's diaries to Claimant or the Tribunal.169 In addition, Claimant argues that an adverse inference of fabrication must be drawn from Respondent's refusal to produce the originals and its \"*intentional obstruction of any meaningful forensic examination*.\" Referring to Article 9(5) of the IBA Rules of Evidence and quoting from *Europe Cement*, Claimant therefore asks the Tribunal to draw the \"*strong inference that the documents were not produced*\" or subjected to effective examination \"*because they would not withstand forensic scrutiny.*\"170 It also\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 321-326.\n\nClaimant's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 326, 390 *citing to* IBA Rules, Art. 9(5) *and* *Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009 [**RLA-228**], \u00b6 152.\n\n279.\n\nClaimant refers to its efforts to have Mr. Aziz's diaries subjected to an effective forensic examination and what it describes as a \"*campaign to prevent such examination*\" by Respondent. According to Claimant, it was indisputable by the end of the hearing on the forensic examination that Respondent \"*deliberately obstructed the effective performance of at least three forensic examinations that could have dispositively proven that the Aziz Diaries, or at least the relevant passages, had been fabricated, giving rise to an unassailable inference that Pakistan refused to allow the documents to be examined because it realized that the examination would prove fabrication*.\"171\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 324-325.\n\n280.\n\nClaimant argues that it needs to prove only two points for the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference of fabrication: (i) that any one of the ESDA indentation, ESDA sequencing, or ink dating examinations might have provided proof of fabrication; and (ii) that by refusing to produce the originals for its expert Mr. Radley to conduct ESDA examinations at his laboratory and by refusing to allow Respondent's expert Mr. LaPorte to take samples from which to conduct ink dating examinations, Respondent has prevented those examinations from taking place.172\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 389-390.\n\n281.\n\nClaimant maintains that Respondent steadfastly refused to produce the originals and instead waged a campaign of obstruction preventing forensic scrutiny. At the February 2017 Hearing, Claimant referred to *EDF* to substantiate its argument that as a matter of law, a party cannot prove a *prima facie* case of authenticity without producing the originals.173 Nonetheless, Claimant alleges that Respondent has tried to justify its recalcitrance with the pretext that production of the originals poses an unspecified risk to their admission in a \"*hypothetical criminal proceedings that still has not commenced.*\"174\n\nTranscript (21 February 2017), p. 29 lines 8-11.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 360-364.\n\n282.\n\nIn relation to what Respondent must do to satisfy the burden of establishing even *prima facie* authenticity of the diaries, at the February 2017 Hearing, Claimant argued that contrary to Pakistan's suggestions, *Golshani* showed that the burden of proving *prima facie* authenticity was not simple and \"*actually requires a very searching examination.*\"175\n\nTranscript (21 February 2017), p. 29 lines 16-22.\n\n283.\n\nBoth Parties' specific arguments concerning whether the burden of proof regarding Mr. Aziz's diaries has been successfully discharged will be summarized below in Section D.2.e below in relation to the results of the forensic examination and the specific circumstances surrounding the relevant entries in the diaries.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIn the following analysis, the Tribunal will first assess the standard of proof to be applied in order to assess Respondent's allegations of corruption in general. Second, the Tribunal will address the burden of proof and, in particular, Respondent's arguments regarding a shifting of such burden. Third, the Tribunal will determine the requirements that would have to be established in order to (possibly) give rise to legal consequences for Claimant's claims under the Treaty. Finally, the Tribunal will address, more specifically, the standard and burden of proof applicable to assess the authenticity of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n**a. In General: The Standard of Proof Applicable to the Allegations of Corruption Raised by Respondent**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by Respondent, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide for guidance as to the standard or burden of proof to be applied but rather provide the Tribunal with considerable discretion to determine matters of evidence. As also noted by Respondent, there is further no uniform approach in international investment treaty arbitration to determining the standard of proof in connection with allegations of corruption.176\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 147-149.\n\n286.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the Tribunal should apply the oridinary civil law standard of balance of probabilities, *i.e*., it should assess \"*whether it is* 'more likely than not' *that corruption has occurred*.\" Respondent claims that this standard is supported by \"[a] *clear consensus* [that] *is developing among commentators, practitioners and tribunals,*\" citing, in particular, to the investment treaty cases of *Rompetrol v. Romania* and *Tokel\u0117s v. Ukraine*.177\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 405 (with note 1389 *referring to* *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 [**RLA-268**], \u00b6 183 *and* *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007 [**RLA-178**], \u00b6 124). *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 389 (with note 1545).\n\n287.\n\nClaimant on the other hand makes reference to the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania*, which held that \"[t]*here is general consensus among international tribunals and commentators regarding the need for a high standard of proof of corruption*,\" and to the finding made by the tribunal in *Fraport v. Philippines II* that evidence to establish corruption must be \"*clear and convincing so as to reasonably make-believe that the facts, as alleged, have occurred*.\"178 On that basis, Claimant advances the application of a heightened standard of \"*clear and convincing*\" evidence to allegations of corruption.179\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 58 *quoting from* *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 [**CA 136**], \u00b6 221 *and* *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014 [**CA 200**], \u00b6 479.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 193.\n\n288.\n\nIn light of the differing positions adopted by the Parties, with each claiming that their position is supported by a consensus among tribunals and commentators, the Tribunal will analyze in particular the investment treaty case law which the Parties have cited in their submissions.\n\n289.\n\nFirst, the *Rompetrol* tribunal, drawing guidance from tribunals in investor-State arbitration as well as in State-to-State dispute settlement, which dealt with bad faith, fraud, corruption or \u2013 as in the case before the *Rompetrol* tribunal \u2013 \"*improper, irregular, or potentially sanctionable conduct on the part of State officials*,\" made the following findings:\n\n\"*The guidance which the Tribunal draws from the cases is that there may well be situations in which, given the nature of an allegation of wrongful (in the widest sense) conduct, and in the light of the position of the person concerned, an adjudicator would be reluctant to find the allegation proved in the absence of a sufficient weight of positive evidence - as opposed to pure probabilities or circumstantial inferences. But the particular circumstances would be determinative, and in the Tribunal's view defy codification. The matter is best summed up in general and nonprescriptive terms by Judge Higgins,* 'the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on.' *Or as the matter was put in greater detail (citing Judge Higgins) by the tribunal in* Libananco v. Turkey:\n\nIn relation to the Claimant's contention that there should be a heightened standard of proof for allegations of '*fraud or other serious wrongdoing,*' the Tribunal accepts that fraud is a serious allegation, but it does not consider that this (without more) requires it to apply a heightened standard of proof. While agreeing with the general proposition that \u2014the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on..., this does not necessarily entail a higher standard of proof. It may simply require more persuasive evidence, in the case of a fact that is inherently improbable, in order for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof has been discharged.\"180\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 [**RLA-268**], \u00b6 182.\n\n290.\n\nOn that basis, the *Rompetrol* tribunal concluded:\n\n\"*Therefore the Tribunal, while applying the normal rule of the* 'balance of probabilities' *as the standard appropriate to the generality of the factual issues before it, will where necessary adopt a more nuanced approach and will decide in each discrete instance whether an allegation of seriously wrongful conduct by a Romanian state official at either the administrative or policymaking level has been proved on the basis of the entire body of direct and indirect evidence before it.*\"181\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 [**RLA-268**], \u00b6 183.\n\n291.\n\nSecond, the *Tokio Tokel\u0117s* tribunal, noting that there are diverging views regarding the applicable standard of proof in connection with allegations such as, in that case, \"*a deliberate campaign to punish* [the claimant's Ukrainian subsidiary] *for its impertinence in printing materials opposed to the regime, or to expose* [it] *as an example to others who might be tempted to do the same*,\" reasoned as follows:\n\n\"[W]*e shall not propose a solution for the current uncertainty about the standard of proof to be applied in a case such as the present. We emphasise the standard of proof, not the burden of proof, for there can be no doubt that the latter rests on the Claimant. As regards the standard, three possibilities have attracted support. First, the usual standard, which requires the party making an assertion to persuade the decision-maker that it is more likely than not to be true. Second, that where the dispute concerns an allegation against a person or body in high authority the burden may be lower, simply because direct proof is likely to be hard to find. Third, that in such a situation, the standard is higher than the balance of probabilities*.\"182\n\n*Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007 [**RLA-178**], \u00b6 124.\n\n292.\n\nDismissing the second and third standards based on the consideration that they would cause \"*serious logical problems*,\" the *Tokio Tokel\u0117s* tribunal reiterated that it made \"*no assumptions of this kind, one way or the other, in the present case, and shall approach the issues on the basis that in order to prove its case on the existence and causal relevance of a nayizd the Claimant must show that its assertion is more likely than not to be true*.\"183\n\n*Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007 [**RLA-178**], \u00b6 124.\n\n293.\n\nBy contrast, the *EDF* tribunal held in the context of an alleged bribe solicitation:\n\n\"*In any case, however, corruption must be proven and is notoriously difficult to prove since, typically, there is little or no physical evidence. The seriousness of the accusation of corruption in the present case, considering that it involves officials at the highest level of the Romanian Government at the time, demands clear and convincing evidence. There is general consensus among international tribunals and commentators regarding the need for a high standard of proof of corruption. The evidence before the Tribunal in the instant case concerning the alleged solicitation of a bribe is far from being clear and convincing.*\"184\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 [**CA 136**], \u00b6 221.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent cites to two commentaries, which: (i) criticized the *EDF* tribunal for creating a message that is \"*difficult \u2026 to accept*\" because it recognized on the one hand that it is \"*notoriously*\" difficult to prove allegations of corruption but on the other hand imposed an enhanced standard of proof; and (ii) advanced the view that the ordinary standard of balance of probabilities should apply to allegations of corruption.185\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 406 *citing to* Constantine Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, No. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6 43 *and* Michael Hwang S.C. and Kevin Lim, Corruption in Arbitration, Law and Reality, 2012 [**RLA-33**], \u00b6 36.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the consideration as it was expressed by the commentary cited by Respondent \u2013 and which was also recognized by the *EDF* tribunal \u2013 that \"*in determining an appropriate standard of proof, arbitration tribunals should take account not only of the seriousness or likelihood of the allegation, but also the intrinsic difficulty of proving it.*\" However, as noted by the same commentary, a heightened standard of \"*clear and compelling*\" evidence has been applied by a number of tribunals that were faced with an assessment of corruption allegations.186\n\nConstantine Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, No. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6\u00b6 53, 48-49 *also referring to* two ICC cases: (i) We *stinghouse Int'l Projects Co., Westinghouse Elec. S.A. and Barns & Roe Enterprises, Inc. v. Nat'l Power Corp. and The Republic of the Philippines*, ICC Case No. 6401, Preliminary Award (19 December 1991), \u00b6\u00b6 33-35, which required \"*clear and convincing evidence*\" of corruption amounting to \"*more than a mere preponderance*\"; and (ii) *Hilmarton Ltd. v. Omnium de Traitment et de Valorisation S.A.*, ICC Case No. 5622 (1988), \u00b6 23, which demanded proof \"*beyond doubt*\" of corruption.\n\n296.\n\nThe *Fraport II* tribunal also explicitly recognized these conflicting considerations with regard to allegations of corruption and found:\n\n\"*The Tribunal holds that considering the difficulty to prove corruption by direct evidence, the same may be circumstantial. However, in view of the consequences of corruption on the investor's ability to claim the BIT protection, evidence must be clear and convincing so as to reasonably make-believe that the facts, as alleged, have occurred.*\"187\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014 [**CA 200**], \u00b6 479.\n\n297.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Niko Resources v. Bangladesh*, on which Claimant also relies and from which Judge Schwebel quotes in his legal opinion,188 found:\n\n\"*The Tribunal is aware that acts of corruption are often difficult to prove, and arbitral tribunals have only very limited means to reach their conclusions. While they must bear in mind these difficulties they must also be aware that findings of corruption are a serious matter which should not be reached lightly. As the tribunal put it in* Hamester v. Ghana, *a tribunal would* 'only decide on substantiated facts, and cannot base itself on inferences'.\"189\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 44.\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited, & Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11, ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013 [**CA 205**], \u00b6 424.\n\n298.\n\nClaimant further relies on the tribunal in *Siag v. Egypt*, the majority of which held in the context of allegations of fraud:\n\n\"\u2026 *The standard suggested by the Claimants was the American standard of* 'clear and convincing evidence,' *that being somewhere between the traditional civil standard of* 'preponderance of the evidence' *(otherwise known as the* 'balance of probabilities' *), and the criminal standard of* 'beyond reasonable doubt.'\n\n*The Tribunal accepts the Claimants' submission. It is common in most legal systems for serious allegations such as fraud to be held to a high standard of proof.

Llamzon, *Corruption in International Investment Arbitration* (2014) [**CA 275**], \u00b6\u00b6 9.18-9.19 *quoting from Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecci v.

Uzbekistan* on which Claimant also relies. In that case, the tribunal did not clearly distinguish between the standard of proof and the burden of proof. Having noted that the warranted application of international law included the general maxim that each party bears the burden of proof for the facts on which relies, it stated:\n\n\"*Here, the question is whether for allegations of corruption, the burden should be shifted to the Claimant to establish that there was no corruption. Rules establishing presumptions or shifting the burden of proof under certain circumstances, or drawing inferences from a lack of proof are generally deemed to be part of the* lex causae*. In the present case, the* lex causae *is essentially the BIT, which provides no rules for shifting the burden of proof or establishing presumptions. Therefore, the Tribunal has relative freedom in determining the standard necessary to sustain a determination of corruption. Both Parties subscribe to this view: both have relied on case law to convince the Tribunal that their respective positions \u2013 a high standard advocated by the Claimant* ['clear and convincing evidence or more'] *and a low standard advocated by the Respondent* ['more likely than not to be true'] *\u2013 should be adopted.*\"193\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6 238.\n\n302.\n\nThe *Metal-Tech* tribunal did not have to decide on the rules applicable to the standard and burden of proof to resolve the dispute before it because the relevant payment had been admitted by the claimant's principal witness and the tribunal itself had sought further evidence on the nature and purpose of such payments. On that basis, as has also been noted by Judge Schwebel in his legal opinion,194 the *Metal-Tech* tribunal concluded:\n\n\"[T]*he Tribunal will determine on the basis of the evidence before it whether corruption has been established with reasonable certainty. In this context, it notes that corruption is by essence difficult to establish and that it is thus generally admitted that it can be shown through circumstantial evidence*.\"195\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 32.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6 243.\n\n303.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal agrees with the above referenced tribunals and commentators that, particularly in the context of allegations of corruption and fraud, there are two conflicting evidentiary considerations. As it has been put by the *Niko Resources* tribunal, \"*acts of corruption are often difficult to prove, and arbitral tribunals have only very limited means to reach their conclusions. While they must bear in mind these difficulties they must also be aware that findings of corruption are a serious matter which should not be reached lightly.*\"196\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v.

At the same time, a finding of corruption may give rise to serious consequences and thus should indeed not be presumed lightly. Taking into account these considerations, the Tribunal stated at the end of the oral hearing that it was looking for \"*solid evidence regarding the alleged acts of corruption that are attributable to the Claimant*.\"197 For the same reasons, the Tribunal generally agrees with the *Hamester* and *Niko Resources* tribunals that a finding of corruption must be based on \"*substantiated facts*\"198 or, as put by the *Metal-Tech* tribunal, that it must be established with \"*reasonable certainty.*\"199\n\nTranscript (Day 12), 3206:9-11.\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 [**RLA-268**], \u00b6 183.\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v.

Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011 [**RLA-129**].\n\n306.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the dispute should not be about whether the applicable standard of proof should be labelled \"*clear and convincing*\" evidence or whether any other term should be used instead. The essential question is whether the standard of proof allows for the consideration of indirect or circumstantial evidence in addition to, or even in the absence of, direct evidence that would establish specific acts of corruption, and thus allows for inferring corrupt practices from the circumstances surrounding a particular event.\n\n307.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *Rompetrol* tribunal that a tribunal may \"*be reluctant to find the allegation proved in the absence of a sufficient weight of positive evidence - as opposed to pure probabilities or circumstantial inferences*\" but also that \"*the particular circumstances would be determinative, and \u2026 defy codification.*\" In any event, the standard of proof should enable a tribunal to assess the allegation \"*on the basis of the entire body of direct and indirect evidence before it.*\"202 Similarly, the *Metal-Tech* tribunal, recognizing the difficulty of establishing corruption by direct evidence, considered that \"*it is thus generally admitted that it can be shown through circumstantial evidence*.\"203 And even the *Fraport II* tribunal, which applied a standard of \"clear and convincing\" evidence, stated that \"*considering the difficulty to prove corruption by direct evidence, the same may be circumstantial.*\"204 This view is confirmed by Judge Schwebel, who concluded in his legal opinion that \"*in view of the difficulty in establishing the facts surrounding allegations of corruption circumstantial evidence may be employed*.\"205 Claimant does not directly challenge this view but argues in favor of a but-for causation requirement,206 which will be addressed in further detail below.\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v.

Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 183, 177.\n\n308.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not wish to decide in the abstract on the relevance, if any, of the indirect or circumstantial evidence presented by Respondent in support of its allegations. The Tribunal will rather perform a detailed review and evaluation of both direct and indirect evidence adduced by Respondent in the context of each individual allegation and decide whether such evidence is sufficiently \"*solid*\" and \"*persuasive*\" to reach the conclusion that the allegation has been proven.\n\n**b. In General: The Burden of Proof Applicable to the Allegations of Corruption Raised by Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nAs to the burden of proof, Respondent \"*accepts that it has the primary burden of proving its allegations of TCC's corruption.*\" However, it further argues that \"*burden shifting is permissible in respect of allegations which are made out* prima facie *and where the responding party should possess evidence to rebut them,*\" which it considers to be supported by commentators and investment treaty tribunals.207 On that basis, it argues that in light of the \"*evidence of many individual irregularities in connection with the obtaining of key contracts and approvals for its investment, TCC should be expected to rebut such evidence with proper explanations*.\"208\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 412-414. *See also* Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 155, 157; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 390.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 415.\n\n310.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's suggestion that where Respondent has presented *prima facie* evidence of corruption, it would be for Claimant to disprove Respondent's allegations and submits that, to the contrary, \"*investment treaty tribunals have routinely held that a party alleging corruption in an arbitration proceeding always carries the burden of proving its claims*.\"209 In addition and while noting that this is not a case in which Claimant has \"s[a]*t back and not contribute*[d] *to the evidentiary exchange*,\" Claimant denies that in a case of alleged corruption involving government officials within the control of the respondent State, the claimant would have the \"*control of the relevant evidence*\" and emphasizes that \"*it is often difficult to prove a negative*.\"210\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 174.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 63; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 176.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in support of its position, Respondent relies on a commentary, which notes that \"[i]*n applying the standard of a balance of probabilities, English courts look to the balance of evidence offered by both sides*\" and further adds:\n\n\"*In practice this means that once a certain* prima facie *threshold of evidence is reached by the party alleging illegality, which may not in and of itself be enough to discharge the standard of proof, it should not be adequate\u2014given the nature of the allegation\u2014for the defendant to sit back and not contribute to the evidentiary exchange on that issue*.\"211\n\nConstantine Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, No. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n312.\n\nOn that basis, the commentary offers the proposition that \"*plausible evidence of corruption, offered by the party alleging illegality, should require an adequate evidentiary showing by the party denying the allegation*.\"212\n\nConstantine Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, No. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6 66.\n\n313.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, this proposition was applied by the *Fraport II* tribunal, which held in the context of proving jurisdictional objections in general:\n\n\"*Regarding burden of proof, in accordance with the well-established rule of* onus probandi incumbit actori*, the burden of proof rests upon the party that is asserting affirmatively a claim or defense. Thus, with respect to its objections, Respondent bears the burden of proving the validity of such objections. The Tribunal accepts that if Respondent adduces evidence sufficient to present a* prima facie *case, Claimant must produce rebuttal evidence, although Respondent retains the ultimate burden to prove its jurisdictional objections*.\"213\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12 Award, 10 December 2014 [**RLA-231**], \u00b6 299.\n\n314.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not convinced that \"*look*[ing] *to the balance of the evidence*\" actually entails a shifting of the burden of proof in the sense that, if the opposing party *does* adduce certain counter-evidence, which would, however, not be in itself sufficient to disprove an allegation, *prima facie* evidence would be sufficient to consider the allegation established. As pointed out by the same commentary, \"*a simple shifting of the burden of proof, all in one go, is rightly difficult for any lawyer to accept*\" and reaching the *prima facie* threshold of evidence \"*may not in and of itself be enough to discharge the burden of proof.*\"214\n\nConstantine Partasides, *Proving Corruption in International Arbitration: A Balanced Standard for the Real World*, ICSID Review 25, No. 1 (2010) 47 [**RLA-221**], \u00b6\u00b6 28, 63.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Respondent also cites several investment treaty cases, which recognized the possibility of shifting the burden of proof once a *prima facie* has been made.215 However, as pointed out by Claimant, most of these cases did not concern allegations of corruption and those that did, specifically the *Fraport II* and *Siag* decisions, in fact did not involve a shifting of the burden of proof. Apart from the *Fraport II* decision, which has already been quoted above, the *Siag* tribunal, in the context of allegations of fraud raised by Egypt in connection with the claimant's nationality, held as follows:\n\n\"*As noted earlier, on 27 February 2008 Claimants stated that Mr Siag had provided extensive prima facie evidence of his Lebanese nationality, and that accordingly* 'the burden of proof is now on Egypt.' *The Tribunal agrees with this contention. On 29 February 2008 Claimants stated:* 'As an initial matter, of course, Egypt bears the burden of proof with respect to each of its jurisdictional objections. It is not Claimants' burden to disprove jurisdictional objections made by Egypt.' *For its part, Egypt asserted that it had proved Mr Siag's non-Lebanese nationality and that accordingly* 'the burden has shifted.' *The Tribunal does not accept this latter submission. Because negative evidence is very often more difficult to assert than positive evidence, the reversal of the burden of proof may make it almost impossible for the allegedly fraudulent party to defend itself, thus violating due process standards. It is for this reason that Tribunals have rarely shifted the burden of proof*.\"216\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 414 (with notes 1415 through 1418).\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award of 1 June 2009 [**CA 195**], \u00b6 317.\n\n316.\n\nThe *Metal-Tech* tribunal, in a passage already quoted above, first recognized that \"*as reflected in the maxim* actori incumbat probatio, *each party has the burden of proving the facts on which it relies*\" and then added:\n\n\"*Here, the question is whether for allegations of corruption, the burden should be shifted to the Claimant to establish that there was no corruption. Rules establishing presumptions or shifting the burden of proof under certain circumstances, or drawing inferences from a lack of proof are generally deemed to be part of the* lex causae*. In the present case, the* lex causae *is essentially the BIT, which provides no rules for shifting the burden of proof or establishing presumptions. Therefore, the Tribunal has relative freedom in determining the standard necessary to sustain a determination of corruption*.\"217\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6\u00b6 237-238.\n\n317.\n\nWhile it thus appears that the Metal-Tech tribunal did not exclude the possibility of shifting the burden of proof, it concluded that \"*the present factual matrix does not require the Tribunal to resort to presumptions or rules of burden of proof where the evidence of the payments came from the Claimant and the Tribunal itself sought further evidence of the nature and purpose of such payments*.\"218\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6 243.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this aspect of the dispute arises out of a confusion about the meaning of the term \"*burden of proof*.\" To say that a party bears the burden of proof means that if, after considering all the evidence, a tribunal is left in doubt as to whether the party has proved its case to the necessary standard, that party loses. In that sense, the burden of proof never shifts. The references to \"*shifting*\" are to the process of reasoning by which the tribunal decided whether the case has been proved or not. A tribunal may take into account that a party has not adduced rebutting evidence in circumstances in which that party would have been expected to be able to do so. In this sense the tribunal may be said to have imposed upon the party a \"*burden*\" to adduce evidence. But the burden of proof as such has not shifted. It is only that the opposing party's failure to adduce evidence is part of the material which has enabled the tribunal to conclude that the first party has proved its case.\n\n319.\n\nIn response to Respondent's allegations and the evidence it has submitted, Claimant has presented 14 witnesses and various contemporaneous documents in rebuttal. Thus, it cannot be said that Claimant has generally refused to contribute to the evidentiary exchange. The Tribunal is aware that Respondent complains about the fact that Claimant has withheld several internal documents regarding its own investigation into allegations of corruption, invoking legal privilege. However, in the Tribunal's view, this does not justify a \"*shift*\" of the burden of proof \u2013 also taking into account the Tribunal's understanding of this term explained in the previous paragraph. If and to the extent it becomes relevant, a lack of rebuttal evidence concerning individual allegations will be taken into account in the evaluation of the evidence submitted by both Parties. Nevertheless, if the Tribunal is not satisfied that Respondent's allegations have not been established in accordance with the standard set out above, Respondent's case will not have been made out.\n\n**c. The Requirements of What Needs to Be Proven**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nIn addition to the standard and burden of proof, the Parties are in dispute as to what Respondent has to prove, *i.e*., the requirements to be met in order for Respondent to succeed with its objection to jurisdiction and admissibility and/or its affirmative defense. Specifically, Claimant argues that Respondent \"*must prove not only* (i) *that* 'TCC engaged in corruption,' *but also* (ii) *that TCC thereby procured certain rights or benefits, and* (iii) *that such rights or benefits were foundational to TCCA's investment.*\"219\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 40.\n\n321.\n\nRespondent opposes the second and third requirements as going \"*far beyond the standard required by international law and*[] *allow*[ing] *a corrupt party to avoid any consequences for its actions before an investment treaty tribunal*.\"220 The Tribunal will thus focus on these two requirements in the following analysis.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 378.\n\n**i. The Alleged But-for Causation Requirement**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nAs to the second requirement, Claimant takes the position that Respondent must prove a \"*causal* 'link between the [alleged] advantage bestowed and the [alleged] improper advantage obtained'\" or, in other words, \"*proof that* but for *the alleged corruption, TCC would not have its investment*.\"221 In this regard, Claimant refers to Article 50 of the Vienna Convention, which allows a State to vitiate its consent to a treaty if its \"*consent to be bound \u2026 has been* procured through *the corruption of its representative,*\" and claims that the underlying concern that the corruption defense could be used \"*as a pretext*\" for reneging on treaty commitments also applies to obligations assumed under the Treaty.222 In addition, Claimant relies on the cases of *World Duty Free v. Kenya*, *Niko Resources v. Bangladesh* and *TANESCO v. IPTL*.223\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 44 *quoting from* Sist *em Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v.

(IPTL)*, ICSID Case No. ARB 98/8, Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues, 9 February 2001 [**CA 209**].\n\n323.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, claims that \"*any corruption (and any attempt to corrupt) made in connection with TCC's alleged investment is relevant to the outcome of the case*.\" It adds that \"[w]*hile the type of causal link between an investor's corruption and its investment may be one of the factors that impacts the tribunal's precise analysis \u2026 the investor's corruption will always be relevant and indeed decisive for the outcome of the arbitration.*\"224 Respondent is of the view that in most cases, it has sufficiently established the causal link but requests that where this is not the case, \"*the Tribunal should* 'connect' the dots' *and infer the link between those payments or promises and TCC's alleged investment*.\" In support of its position, Respondent relies on the cases of *Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic* and *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*.225\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 379-380.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 382-384 *referring to* *Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v.

United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Award, Separate Opinion of Prof. W\u00e4lde dated December 2005, 26 January 2006 [**RLA-241**].\n\n324.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal will again draw guidance from the case law cited by the Parties. First, the *World Duty Free* tribunal found that bribery is contrary to transnational public policy and, on that basis, concluded that \"*claims based on contracts of corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal*.\" In the passage quoted by Claimant, the tribunal further rejected the claimant's argument that the admitted bribe was \"*severable*\" from the relevant contract and, in that context, stated that \"*there can here be no severance when the bribe, as known and intended by Mr. Ali, formed an intrinsic part of the overall transaction without which no contract would have been agreed by the parties*.\"226\n\n*World Duty Free v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006 [**RLA-36**], \u00b6\u00b6 157, 174-175.\n\n325.\n\nSecond, the *Niko Resources* tribunal, making reference in its decision on jurisdiction to the statement made by the *World Duty Free* tribunal regarding \"*contracts of corruption*\" and \"*contracts obtained by corruption*,\" distinguished between the two categories and referred to Article 50 of the Vienna Convention, which it considered as \"*a general principle of law and as such applicable to contracts concluded by States*.\"227 Emphasizing that a contract obtained by corruption should be voidable at the discretion of the bribery victim, the *Niko Resources* tribunal noted that Bangladesh did not rely on the avoidance of the agreements (which contained the relevant arbitration agreements) and then addressed the question of causation as follows:\n\n\"*The case of bribery which has been established in the present case did not procure the contracts on which the claims in this arbitration are based. \u2026 Thus, there is no link of causation between the established acts of corruption and the conclusion of the agreements, and it is not alleged that there is such a link*.\"228\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited, & Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation*, ICSID Case Nos.

In that regard, it held:\n\n\"*Although Mrs Masunzu is said to have admitted that, by her taking the 100,000 Tanzanian shillings,* 'Mr Rugemalira succeeded in getting her assistance in direct support of the IPTL project'*, there is no evidence to suggest either (i) that, but for the alleged bribe, she would have cast any vote or used any influence against the IPTL project, or (ii) that her support was crucial or indeed made any difference.*\"231\n\n*Tanzania Electric Supply Co.

Indeed, one might have thought that, as men of honour, as they purport to be, the attempted bribes would have had the very opposite effect*.\"232\n\n*Tanzania Electric Supply Co. Ltd. (Tanesco) v.

Ltd. (Tanesco) v. Independent Power Tanzania Ltd. (IPTL)*, ICSID Case No. ARB 98/8, Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues, 9 February 2001 [**CA 209**], \u00b6 57.\n\n330.\n\nFourth, the *Sistem* tribunal on which both Parties relied in their submissions had to decide on an allegation that the refurbishment of the Kyrgyz President's guest residency by the claimant amounted to an attempt to bribe the President. The tribunal stated that it \"*would not have hesitated to attach the appropriate legal consequences to any proven instance of bribery or corruption*.\"234 However, it considered that there was no such proof because it did not consider the refurbishment to be an act of bribery. It nevertheless held with respect to causation:\n\n\"*If an agreement is to be nullified, or benefits under a BIT are to be denied, because the transaction is tainted by corruption, the case needs to be clearly made out. In this context, one important element of the concept of bribery or corruption is the link between the advantage bestowed and the improper advantage obtained. In the present case Sistem had made its investment in 1993. The refurbishment occurred in mid-1995. Sistem lost control of the hotel in December 1995. Only in 1999 did it recover control. No plausible explanation was suggested as to how the refurbishment could be linked to any improper advantage. The only suggestion was that* 'there is no explanation of the [1999] main agreement if there was no bribe involved.'\n\n*In some circumstances it may happen that regular payments over a period of time effectively* 'buy' *the long-term goodwill of the recipient, so as to make it difficult to establish a causal link between the bribe and the advantage that it procures. But that is not the case here. This was a one-off transaction, from which no individual derived a personal advantage (the refurbishment being of the President's official accommodation); and it is not suggested that the transaction was made surreptitiously*.\"235\n\n*Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009 [**CA 157**], \u00b6 40-41.\n\n*Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009 [**CA 157**], \u00b6 43-44.\n\n331.\n\nFifth, as regards the *Metal-Tech* case, the Tribunal notes that the Parties focused on the question whether or not the tribunal made its finding of corruption \"*solely by* 'connecting the dots' *created by circumstantial evidence*\" as alleged by Respondent.236 In the Tribunal's view, this question pertains to the standard of proof, which has been addressed above, but not to the specific question of causation, which is at issue here. In respect of the causal link between the act of corruption and the investment, the *Metal-Tech* tribunal first noted that the legality requirement in the applicable treaty applied only to the establishment of the investment, not to its operation, but that the relevant payments all post-dated the establishment of Claimant's investment.237\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 384. *See also* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 183-185.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6 267.\n\n332.\n\nWhile noting the claimant's argument that because of this timing, \"*none of its payments can be viewed as compensation for obtaining the approval of its investment*,\" the tribunal nevertheless considered the payments relevant because the services under the alleged consultancy agreements, which served as the cover for the bribery payments, would have had to be rendered prior to the establishment of the investment and it was admitted that the consultants \"*were a substantial part in putting the deal together*.\"238 On that basis, the *Metal-Tech* tribunal concluded:\n\n\"\u2026 *Metal-Tech had promised as early as 1998 to pay the Consultants if and when the Claimant's investment was established. In consequence, the actual date of the payments does not prevent the Tribunal's consideration of those payments as relating to the implementation of the Claimant's investment when assessing the evidence in respect of the corruption allegations*.\"239\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6\u00b6 267-271.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 [**CA 214**], \u00b6 273.\n\n333.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent's legal expert Judge Schwebel, while not explicitly addressing the alleged requirement of but-for causation because his legal opinion was submitted already with Respondent's Application, stated in his conclusions drawn from arbitral precedents and treaties addressing corruption:\n\n\"*- There is an accepted international public policy that condemns corruption of public officials and debars judicial and arbitral upholding of agreements tainted by corruption.*\n\n*- This international public policy applies to investments obtained by corruption and to investments furthered, renewed or implemented by corruption*.\"240\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 90.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, first, it can be considered common ground between the Parties that an established act of corruption must (at least) be \"*connected with*\" Claimant's investment, in the sense that the investment must be \"*tainted*\" by the act of corruption. This threshold is confirmed by the conclusions of Judge Schwebel in his legal opinion and was also applied by the *Sistem* tribunal. Similarly, the *Metal-Tech* considered it decisive that the bribery \"*related to*\" the implementation of the claimant's investment. While Claimant rejects the term \"*tainted*\" (albeit in the context of the third requirement) to the extent that it would include \"*allegations* [that] *are far removed in time and have no connection to the grant of those rights*,\"241 the Tribunal considers that this does not adequately capture the meaning of \"*tainted*\" as it has been used by Judge Schwebel or by the *Sistem* tribunal \u2013 on whose findings Claimant itself relies.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 190.\n\n335.\n\nMoreover, having reviewed the case law cited above, the Tribunal is not convinced that it should impose a requirement of *but-for* causation, *i.e*., proof that the act of corruption \"*caused TCCA to obtain a right to which it was otherwise not entitled*.\"242 In particular, the recognized evidentiary difficulties in connection with allegations of corruption may often relate not only to the act of corruption itself but also to the link between the act of corruption and the investment. In fact, it may in some instances be close to impossible to prove that, *but for* a payment made to obtain a certain right or benefit, such an advantage could not have been obtained if the payment had not been made.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 177.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that of the above referenced cases, only the *TANESCO* tribunal used the term \"*but for*\" in its decision. However, as pointed out by Respondent, the tribunal in that case was concerned with the question whether the relevant contract was void and not with the quality of the necessary link between an act of corruption and an investment under a treaty. As to the term \"*contract obtained by corruption*\" established by the *World Duty Free* tribunal as well as the term \"*procured by corruption*\" used by the *Niko Resources* tribunal, the Tribunal does not understand these to impose a strict *but-for* requirement. It rather appears that they required a causal link in the sense that the act of corruption must have contributed to obtaining a right or benefit related to the investment \u2013 while such contribution may not be remote, it need not be the only cause and the right or benefit need not be one to which the investor would not be entitled or that it would not have been able to obtain by legitimate means. In that sense, one can say that the investment must be \"*tainted*\" or, as put by Judge Schwebel, it must be \"*obtained \u2026 furthered, renewed or implemented*\" by corruption.\n\n**ii. The Alleged \"*****Foundational Rights*****\" Requirement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nAs to the third requirement, Claimant makes reference to the distinction between the *making* of an investment on the one hand and the *performance* of an investment on the other and claims that only the former can bar an investor's claims. According to Claimant, this is a distinction between \"essential *and* peripheral *illegality*.\" More specifically, Claimant takes the position that \"*to defeat an investor's treaty claim, the state must prove that the alleged corruption caused the claimant to obtain the rights it seeks to enfore in arbitration.*\"243 Claimant further argues that \"[a]*llegations of corruption that do not concern these foundational rights are collateral, and not properly within the remit of this investment treaty Tribunal.*\"244 In support of its position, Claimant relies in particular on the cases of *Yukos v. Russia* and *Fraport II*.245\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 54-56 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 188.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57 *referring to* *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178**] *and* *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014 [**CA 200**].\n\n338.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, takes the view that \"*the Tribunal should consider and duly investigate any corruption (and any attempt to corrupt) in relation to any aspect of TCC's alleged investment*.\" While recognizing that some tribunals have distinguished between the inception and the performance of an investment in their jurisdictional analysis, Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that illegality in the performance of the investment would be \"*ouside the Tribunal's mandate*\" or would not have any impact on its investment treaty claim.246 Respondent acknowledges that no investment treaty tribunal has yet had to consider the legal consequences of corruption in the performance of an investment but makes reference to the legal opinion of Judge Schwebel, who concludes that corruption at that stage can become relevant at the jurisdictional, admissibility or merits level.247\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 390-391.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 393 *referring to* Schwebel Opinion, \u00b6 90.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties appear to agree on the elements which constitute what Claimant refers to as the \"*foundational rights*\" pertaining to its investment, *i.e*., the 1993 CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum, the 2000 certification of BHP's 75% interest, the 2000 Deed of Waiver and Consent and the 2006 Novation Agreements.248 There is further common ground that the dispute regarding the alleged \"*foundational rights*\" requirement concerns the question of whether an act of corruption, in order to (possibly) give rise to legal consequences to Claimant's claims under the Treaty, must necessarily relate to the *making* of the investment. In other words, there is a dispute whether and, if so to what extent, the alleged acts of corruption relating to the *performance* of the investment in the present proceeding bear any relevance to Claimant's claims.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14 and \u00b6\u00b6 39 *et seq*.; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 388 and \u00b6\u00b6 29 *et seq*.\n\n340.\n\nBefore turning to the legal opinion of Judge Schwebel on this matter, the Tribunal will review the case law relied on by Claimant in support of its argument.\n\n341.\n\nThe *Yukos* tribunal held, *inter alia*, that even in the absence of an express legality requirement in the applicable treaty, an investment obtained in bad faith or in violation of the host State's law should not be protected under the treaty (even though it left open whether such implied legality requirement oprated as a bar to jurisdiction or whether it deprived the investor of the substantive protections of the treaty). In that context, it further found:\n\n\"*However, the Tribunal does need to address Respondent's contention that the right to invoke the ECT must be denied to an investor not only in the case of illegality in the making of the investment but also in its performance. The Tribunal finds Respondent's contention unpersuasive.*\n\n*There is no compelling reason to deny altogether the right to invoke the ECT to any investor who has breached the law of the host State in the course of its investment. If the investor acts illegally, the host state can request it to correct its behavior and impose upon it sanctions available under domestic law, as the Russian Federation indeed purports to have done by reassessing taxes and imposing fines. However, if the investor believes these sanctions to be unjustified (as Claimants do in the present case), it must have the possibility of challenging their validity in accordance with the applicable investment treaty. It would undermine the purpose and object of the ECT to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits.*\"249\n\n*Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178**], \u00b6\u00b6 1354-1355.\n\n342.\n\nThe *Yukos* tribunal noted that the respondent had not been able to cite any authority that would support its submission and discussed in particular the tribunal's statement in *Fraport v. Phillipines I*, which had stated that illegal acts in the course of the investment \"*might be a defense to claimed substantive violations.*\" In the view of the *Yukos* tribunal, however, this statement did \"*not imply the unavailability of the substantive protections of the treaty, but rather concludes that the respondent State has not incurred any liability under the treaty.*\"250\n\n*Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178**], \u00b6 1356.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the above quoted statement made by the *Fraport I* tribunal was made in the context of its analysis of whether an express requirement in the applicable treaty that an investment be made \"*in accordance*\" with relevant domestic law applied only \"*at the time of commencement of the investment*\" or whether, in order to give rise to the tribunal's jurisdiction, the investment had to \"*continuously remain in compliance with domestic law \u2026 in the course of the operation.*\" The *Fraport I* tribunal dismissed this argument by stating:\n\n\"*If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed substantive violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction*.\"251\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007 [**CA 130**], \u00b6\u00b6 344-345.\n\n344.\n\nFollowing annulment of this decision, a newly constituted tribunal in *Fraport II* addressed the same provision of the treaty, albeit in the context of a different argument, *i.e*., that it allegedly did not contain any legality requirement. The *Fraport II* tribunal dismissed that argument and held that the provision \"*limits the scope of* 'investment' *under the BIT to investments that were lawful under (*i.e. 'in accordance' *) with the host State's laws and regulation* at the time the investments were made.\"252 It then added:\n\n\"*The Tribunal is also of the view that, even absent the sort of explicit legality requirement that exists here, it would be still be appropriate to consider the legality of the investment. As other tribunals have recognized, there is an increasingly well-established international principle which makes international legal remedies unavailable with respect to illegal investments, at least when such illegality goes to the essence of the investment.*\n\n*In light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that Article 1(1) of the BIT requires that an investment comply with the laws of the host State at the time it is made in order to be accorded protection under the BIT. The Tribunal's assessment of Respondent's jurisdictional objections will therefore focus on the time of entry of Claimant's investment*.\"253\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014 [**CA 200**], \u00b6 331 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014 [**CA 200**], \u00b6\u00b6 332-333.\n\n345.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the findings made by the *Fraport II* tribunal (and also those made by *Fraport I* tribunal) relate only to the legality requirement it found to exist in the applicable treaty and thus to the question as to whether it had jurisdiction to hear the claimant's claims. While it indeed appears that, in the view of the *Fraport II* tribunal, this requirement applied only to the time of making the investment (as opposed to the subsequent performance), it did not have to, and did not, make any findings as to any possible (other) legal effects that an alleged illegality during the performance of the investment could have.\n\n346.\n\nAs for the *Yukos* tribunal, Respondent correctly pointed out that while the tribunal did not deny the claimant's right to invoke the applicable treaty \"*altogether*,\" it did consider the illegal conduct that it found to have occurred on the part of the claimants in its further analysis on: (i) the State's liability (albeit concluding that the State's measures nevertheless had an expropriatory effect); and (ii) the amount of compensation to be paid (as a result of which it concluded that \"*the Claimants have contributed to the extent of 25 percent to the prejudice which they suffered as a result of Respondent's destruction of Yukos*\").254 Consequently, the Tribunal considers that this decision also does not support Claimant's argument that acts of corruption relating to the performance of the investment would not be relevant to its claims or, in other words, that they would \"*not* [be] *properly within the remit of this investment treaty Tribunal.*\"255\n\n*Cf*. *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178**], \u00b6\u00b6 1577-1580 *and* \u00b6 1637.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 188.\n\n347.\n\nRespondent's legal expert Judge Schwebel, who rendered an opinion on the international legal consequences flowing from a finding of corruption, also makes a distinction between the \"*establishment*\" of an investment on the one hand and the \"*management or operation*\" of that investment on the other. Specifically, Judge Schwebel explains that \"[w]*here the investor has bribed officials as part of the establishment of its investment, it will have breached the implied or express legality requirement in the BIT and/or in the ICSID Convention*\" and makes reference to several investment treaty cases in which claims were dismissed on the basis of an express or implied legality requirement.256 Judge Schwebel further points out:\n\n\"*A number of investment treaty decisions have confirmed that jurisdictional arguments based on the illegality of an investment have temporal limitations, namely that such arguments will only bar jurisdiction whether the establishment, rather than the performance, of the investment is tainted by illegality*. \u2026\n\n*Accordingly, it is open to this Tribunal to hold that it lacks jurisdiction to determine the Claimant's claims if it finds that the Claimant bribed public officials of the Respondent and that those bribes were made during the inception or novation of the Claimant's investment*.\"257\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 65-72 *referring to* *Metal-Tech Ltd. v.

Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178 / Exhibit SS-18**]. Judge Schwebel notes, however, that the *Yukos* tribunal was not faced with allegations of bribery.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it can thus be considered established and supported by both the legal opinion of Judge Schwebel and the case law cited above that an act of corruption in the performance of the investment would not be relevant in the context of the Tribunal's jurisdictional analysis of whether Claimant has made an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, *i.e*., whether it has an asset \"*admitted by* [Respondent] *subject ot its law and investment policies applicable from time to time*,\" or whether the dispute arises directly out of an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n349.\n\nAs to acts of corruption found to have occurred in the performance of the investment, Judge Schwebel opines:\n\n\"*An investor that has partaken in acts of corruption during the life of an investment should be estopped from relying on the host State's consent to arbitrate or should not found not to meet the implied conditions attaching to the host State's offer to arbitrate. Consequently, a Tribunal will lack jurisdiction*.\"258\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 76.\n\n350.\n\nAccording to Judge Schwebel, both Respondent's consent to arbitration given in Article 13 of the Treaty and the requirement of consent to ICSID arbitration provided in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention \"*must \u2026 be interpreted in view of international public policy against corruption and bribery*.\"259\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n\n351.\n\n\"*Further and alternatively*,\" Judge Schwebel takes the following view:\n\n\"[W]*here a claim is based on the protections contained in a BIT (as opposed to the contractual rights contained in a contract), an investor that engages in bribery in relation to its investment should not be entitled to rely on the legal rights contained within the BIT. The Tribunal in such a case should declare the claim inadmissible or the substantive rights as not being subject to protection*.\"260\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89 *referring to* *World Duty Free v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006 [**RLA-36 / Exhibit SS-2**], *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

It suffices to note the obvious, *i.e*., that the question as to the whether an act of corruption that could potentially be found to have occurred in the performance of the investment could give rise to legal consequences for Claimant's claims under the Treaty is in dispute between the Parties. In the Tribunal's view, this question should not be answered in the abstract. In particular, the Tribunal does not wish to categorically exclude the possibility that an established act of corruption in the performance of the investment \u2013 which Claimant has labelled as \"*collateral allegations*\"261 \u2013 could become relevant to the Tribunal's legal analysis at either of the levels indicated by Judge Schwebel. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced of the alleged general requirement that an act of corruption must relate exclusively to the establishment of Claimant's investment or, in other words, to Claimant's \"*foundational rights*.\"\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 133.\n\n353.\n\nWhile the Tribunal will follow the distinction applied by both Parties between \"*foundational*\" events that preceded and constituted Claimant's investment decision embodied in the conclusion of the Novation Agreement and further events that post-dated this investment decision, it will in any event assess all allegations of corruption, including those relating to events in the performance of the investment. If and to the extent it will find that any such allegation has been established, it will decide on the legal consequences of such finding at the appropriate stage below.\n\n**d. Specifically: The Standard and Burden of Proof Applicable to the Dispute Regarding the Authenticity of Mr. Aziz's Diaries**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is undisputed that it \"*has the initial burden of establishing, prima facie, that the Aziz Diaries are authentic; but that the burden of proving fabrication is TCC's to satify.*\"262 However, the Parties are in dispute as to the hurdle of showing *prima facie* authenticity and whether such burden has been met by Respondent. Respondent takes the view that \"*its burden is relatively low and has been met in circumstances where: (i) numerous witnesses including the author have been presented for examination on the Aziz Diaries and the allegations underlying the questioned payments in the Aziz Diaries; (ii) the Aziz Diaries were made available for inspection; and (iii) a leading forensic document examiner, Mr LaPorte, who after carrying out a range of tests on the original documents in Pakistan, produced a report concluding that there was no indication that the Aziz Diaries were, in whole or in part, fabricated.*\"263\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 391 *referring to* LaPorte Submission, \u00b6 10. In that submission, Respondent relies in particular on *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 [**RLA-334**] and *Dadras International, Per-Am Construction Corporation v The Islamic Republic of Iran Tehran Redevelopment Company,* IUSCT Case Nos. 213 and 215 (567-213/215-3), Award, 7 November 1995 [**RLA-331**].\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 392.\n\n355.\n\nClaimant does not explicitly address the distinction drawn by Respondent between a *prima facie* showing that Mr. Aziz's diaries are authentic and the burden of proving that they are fabricated. However, it argues that the evidence in fact \"*compel*[s]\" the conclusion that Mr. Aziz's diaries *have* been fabricated and further requests that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference of fabrication based on Respondent's refusal to produce the original Diaries for a proper forensic examination.264 In that context, it argues that it \"*need only prove two points, and it has proven both. First, it has proven that any one of the ESDA indentation, ESDA sequencing, or ink dating examinations might have provided material proof of fabrication. Second, it has proven that Pakistan, by refusing to produce the originals to Mr. Radley to conduct ESDA examinations at his laboratory and by refusing to allow Mr. LaPorte to take samples with which he and Dr. Aginsky could conduct ink dating examinations, has prevented those examinations from taking place.*\"265\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 326.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 388-390.\n\n356.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal to assess is thus which conclusions are to be drawn from the following circumstances: (i) the original Aziz diaries were made available for inspection, but only under the restricted conditions permitted by the NAB, *i.e*., in particular, the examination had to be conducted in a forensic laboratory within Pakistan and Respondent's expert was \"*not granted permission to perform any form of destructive analysis, which is necessary to conduct a chemical analysis of the inks*\";266 (ii) on the basis of the examinations Respondent's expert *was* permitted to carry out either himself or through a forensic scientist,267 he did find certain peculiarities, in particular that a page is missing between two of the relevant entries and that different inks had been used, but concluded that \"*there is no evidence to indicate that the Aziz Journal of Q2B, including the three questioned entries, were created at any other time than on or around their purported dates*\";268 and (iii) Claimant's expert considered that \"*it is **equally** accurate that there is no evidence that the entres **were** created on or around their purported dates*\" and \"*either of these contrasting statements is equally likely*,\" which, in his view, renders the examination \"*inconclusive,*\" but that further examinations could have, but were not, performed that \"*may have shed further light on the way in which these documents have been created*.\"269\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 1.\n\n*Cf*. LaPorte Response to Claimant's Queries Regarding the forensic Examination oft he Aziz Diaries, 26 January 2017.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 24.\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 (emphasis in original).\n\n357.\n\nContrary to what Respondent suggests, Claimant does not accept that it has a burden of proving that the relevant entries in the Diaries were not written on the dates on which they purport to have been written or are otherwise forgeries. It generally rejects Respondent's position that the burden of proof will shift it it makes a *prima facie* showing and maintains that Respondent \"*always bears the burden of proving its allegations*.\"270 Also taking into account its general findings on the burden of proof above, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that this general rule also applies in the present context because the Aziz diaries are simply part of the evidence by which the Respondent proposes to discharge its burden of proving acts of corruption. Even if there is no forensic evidence to prove when the relevant entries were made, the absence of such evidence cannot prove that they must have been made on any particular date, still less that they are truthful records of the transactions in question. The Tribunal must decide upon the whole of the evidence, giving the evidence of the Aziz diaries such weight as it thinks appropriate, whether Respondent has proved its case.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30.\n\n358.\n\nIn addition to its argument that the fabrication is in fact proven by the results of the forensic examination of the Diaries and further evidence on the record, Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences based on Respondent's refusal \"*to produce the originals and its intentional obstruction of any meaningful forensic examination*.\"271 Respondent denies that Mr. Aziz's diaries would have to be produced in original form to the Tribunal or Claimant, in particular where there are legitimate and \"*compelling reasons*\" why it was unable to do so, and maintains that it \"*has given a reasonable opportunity to a Tribunal-appointed or a TCC-appointed expert to review the original Aziz Diaries.*\"272\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 326.\n\nLaPorte Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 396-399.\n\n359.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that in its Procedural Order No. 9 dated 12 May 2016, it granted Claimant's request that \"[t]*he complete and original notebook(s), journal(s), diary or diaries, or other larger document or collection reportedly belonging to Abdul Aziz, from which pages were excerpted and exhibited in support of his 24 June 2015 witness statement*\" be produced to Claimant. This order was confirmed in the Tribunal's communications of 4 July 2017 and 6 July 2017. In the following months, extensive correspondence was exchanged between the Parties on the matter of a forensic examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries in which Respondent, *inter alia*, produced a letter from the NAB that it would not permit the Diaries to be sent \"*abroad outside NAB jurisdiction*\" because they were \"*original evidence of an ongoing inquiry/investigation.*\"273 Despite several attempts by the Tribunal and the Parties, no mutually agreeable solution could be found regarding an examination of Mr. Aziz's diaries within Pakistan.\n\nNAB letter dated 14 July 2017.\n\n360.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal pointed out in its letter of 20 October 2016 that it \"*agree*[d] *with Claimant that procedural fairness requires that the Aziz diaries be made available to the expert chosen by Claimant for inspection at his own laboratory in order for him to carry out an adequate examination regarding their authenticity*.\" It further provided, *inter alia*, the following directions:\n\n\"*Therefore, the Tribunal strongly recommends that Respondent comply with Claimant's request and promptly produce the Aziz diaries to Mr. Radley's laboratory in Reading, England for inspection under the conditions set out in Claimant's letter of 19 October 2016.*\n\n*The same applies to Claimant's second request, i.e., that the Aziz diaries be made available for the Tribunal's inspection at the hearing in Hong Kong. While the Tribunal refrains from ordering Respondent to do so, it again strongly recommends that Respondent comply with this request in order to allow the Tribunal to make its own assessment of the diaries' authenticity.*\n\n*The Tribunal notes that, in case Respondent should not follow the Tribunal's recommendations regarding Claimant's first and/or second request for whatever reason, the Tribunal will not entirely exclude the Aziz diaries or the relevant portions of all witness statements from the record. However, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that it would definitely take into account any refusal to produce the original diaries to an expert and/or the Tribunal when assessing the evidentiary value of the diaries \u2013 a value that would naturally be significantly reduced in the absence of any evidence on the diaries' authenticity.*\"\n\n361.\n\nFollowing Respondent's statement that \"*the NAB has reiterated that it is unwilling for the Aziz Diaries to be sent abroad under any circumstances*,\"274 the Tribunal confirmed in its letter of 4 November 2016 its \"*strong recommendation*\" that:\n\n\"*(i) Respondent promptly produce the Aziz diaries to Mr. Radley's laboratory in Reading, England for inspection under the conditions set out in Claimant's letter of 19 October 2016; and (ii) the Aziz diaries be made available for the Tribunal's inspection at the hearing in Hong Kong. The Tribunal has duly considered the Parties' submissions on this matter and sees no reason to deviate from these two recommendations.*\n\n*The Tribunal further re-affirms the notice given to Respondent in its letter of 20 October 2016 and again in the message to the Parties on 27 October 2016 that the diaries' non-availability to Claimant for examination by its own expert and by the Tribunal in Hong Kong might affect their probative value*.\"\n\nRespondent's letter dated 26 October 2016, p. 2.\n\n362.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that this decision did not prevent Respondent from appointing its own expert, \"*bearing in mind, however, the Tribunal's notice reiterated above regarding the evidentiary value of evidence to which neither an expert of the opposing Party nor the members of the Tribunal have been given access*.\"\n\n363.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Tribunal recalls that throughout the correspondence exchanged over the course of 2016 on this matter, Respondent argued on various occasions that an ink-dating analysis would be useful and proposed that the Tribunal appoint an ink-dating expert.275 It also noted that it had \"*obtain*[ed] *the NAB's consent to conduct forensic examination of the Aziz Diaries by multiple experts*.\"276 After the Tribunal had decided that it would not appoint an expert, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had appointed Mr. LaPorte as its own expert to conduct an ink-dating analysis in Pakistan and that, as requested by Claimant, he would take an additional set of ink-dating samples for examination by an expert appointed by Claimant.277 Nevertheless, when Mr. LaPorte arrived in Pakistan, he was \"*not granted permission to perform any form of destructive analysis, which is necessary to conduct a chemical analysis of the inks.*\"278 It also follows from correspondence exchanged between the Parties' counsel that Claimant was informed of this development only after the examination by Mr. LaPorte had been concluded.279\n\n*See, e.g*., Respondent's letter dated 19 September 2016, p. 3. Claimant concurred with this proposal in its letter of 21 September 2016, p. 3. *See also* Respondent's letter dated 13 October 2016, p. 2; Respondent's letter dated 26 October 2016, p. 6.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 26 October 2016, p. 5.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 14 November 2016; Respondent's letter dated 21 November 2016. See also Respondent's letter dated 22 November 2016, p. 2.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 1.\n\nExhibit A to Claimant's letter dated 9 January 2017.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that in its e-mail of 4 January 2017, Respondent argued for the first time that Mr. LaPorte had taken the view that an ink-dating analysis \"*would be unlikely to advance matters in the present case.*\"280 In his expert report, Mr. LaPorte explained that he informed the NAB after his first day of examination that:\n\n\"[G]*iven that (i) in any event the other two questioned entries were made more than 17 months ago; (ii) there is a reasonable chance that they were created using a fast ageing ink* [based on information of a published study] *; and (iii) the document containing those entries was not kept in any protected conditions but was exposed to normal climatic conditions in Pakistan, it was highly unlikely that chemical analysis of those entries would in any way assist any findings relating to the timing of the creation of the questioned entries in this report. On that understanding and given the pending criminal case where these documents are used as evidence, the NAB did not grant me permission to conduct this type of analysis.*\"281\n\nExhibit A to Claimant's letter dated 9 January 2017.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 6.\n\n365.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, however, Mr. LaPorte stated in the examination protocol that he had provided to Respondent prior to his examination that \"[t]*he GC/MS analysis can be used to analyze the solvent levels in the inks to determine if any of the written entries were created in the past 2 years (ink aging analysis).*\"282\n\n**Exhibit C-889**, \u00b6 12.\n\n366.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that during the hearing, Mr. LaPorte sympathized with the NAB's refusal to permit ink-dating on the grounds that it was a destructive analysis, which might impair the evidentiary value of Mr. Aziz's diaries, by stating that \"*even in the United States, it would be consistent spoliation of evidence in a criminal proceeding, and that evidence would completely thrown out.*\" However, this statement stands in contrast to the explanation he provided in his examination protocol:\n\n\"*The removal of ink is minimally invasive and does not diminish the integrity of the document or any entries. Moreover, capturing images of the document via scanning and photography preserves the integrity of the document. \u2026 I have performed chemical analysis of documents in hundreds of criminal and civil cases, and I have never been involved in a criminal or civil matter where the court has prohibited me from performing ink aging analysis or testifying to my findings.*\"283\n\n**Exhibit C-889**, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.\n\n367.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the use of Mr. Aziz's diaries as evidence in a pending criminal case provides sufficient justification to refuse permission to conduct an ink-dating analysis; further, it is not convinced that it would have been \"*highly unlikely*\" that an ink-dating analysis could have assisted the Tribunal in assessing the authenticity of Mr. Aziz's diaries.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it does not make a finding as to the appropriateness of drawing inferences and a positive finding of fabrication at this point, *i.e*., without having examined the results of the forensic examination and the specific circumstances surrounding the relevant entries in Mr. Aziz's diaries and the events to which they purportedly pertain, which will be discussed in detail below. However, taking into account the circumstances set out above, in particular the fact that the original Aziz diaries were not made available for examination by Claimant's expert at his laboratory and that the NAB further refused (without giving advance notice to Claimant) that Respondent's expert perform an ink-dating analysis as it had been contemplated, any remaining uncertainty regarding the authenticity of Mr. Aziz's diaries cannot go to the detriment of Claimant.\n\n369.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that even if it turns out that there is no forensic evidence that the relevant entries in the diaries were forged, this will not be to sufficient to draw an inference that they must positively be assumed to be authentic.\n\n**D. Factual Allegations**\n--------------------------\n\n370.\n\nHaving set out the applicable standard and burden of proof as well as the requirements of what needs to be proven, the Tribunal will now turn to the individual factual allegations of corruption raised by Respondent. As noted above, the Tribunal will in this analysis follow the distinction drawn by the Parties between allegations relating to: (i) the making of Claimant's investment, *i.e*., the events preceding or constituting Claimant's main investment decision embodied in the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement by which Claimant became party to the CHEJVA;284 and (ii) the performance of Claimant's investment, *i.e*., the events following the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement.\n\n*Cf*. Tribunal's Draft Decision, \u00b6 897.\n\n371.\n\nAt this point, this distinction is drawn without any prejudice to the legal consequences arising from a finding of corruption in connection with either the making or the performance of the investment. The Tribunal further notes that its use of the term \"*investment*\" at this stage is also without prejudice to a possible finding on Respondent's objection to the classification of Claimant's interest as an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention \u2013 should the Tribunal make a finding of corruption in the establishment of the investment and thus have to decide on this objection further below.\n\n372.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is aware of Respondent's position that the conclusion of the Novation Agreement was not Claimant's \"*main investment decision*\" as the Tribunal found in its Draft Decision, bur rather \"*one of a series of necessary investment decisions*.\"285 The Tribunal is also aware that Judge Schwebel stated in his legal opinion that \"*where the investor's investment decision can be viewed as part of a series, a narrow view as to the moment of the inception of the investment should not be taken*.\"286 Claimant, on the other hand, argues that the Novation Agreement \"*is the only agreement where any conduct attributable to TCCA could possibly affect its Treaty rights. To succeed on its Application, Pakistan must show that the execution of the Novation Agreement was procured by corruption*.\"287 At the same time, however, Claimant acknowledges that the \"*foundational agreements underpinning TCCA's investment* [are] *the CHEJVA, the Addendum* [and] *the Novation Agreements.*\"288 Consequently, on the assumption that the Tribunal were to find that an established act of corruption that it found to have occurred in the context of the CHEJVA or the 2000 instruments, if any, could be attributed to Claimant, there appears to be common ground that such an act of corruption could indeed be relevant to Claimant's investment and thus its claims under the Treaty.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 105(f).\n\nSchwebel Opinion, \u00b6 75.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 118.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14.\n\n373.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal will now address the individual factual allegations raised by Respondent and assess them in a chronological order.\n\n**1. Allegations Relating to the Making of Claimant's Investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nIn the context of the making of Claimant's investment, Respondent's allegations relate to the following events: (i) the conclusion of the CHEJVA on 29 July 1993 and the grant of certain relaxations to the then-applicable 1970 BMC Rules in January 1994; (ii) the conclusion of an addendum to the CHEJVA on 4 March 2000; (iii) the certification of BHP's 75% interest in the Joint Venture by letter of 14 April 2000; (iv) the conclusion of a deed of waiver and consent on 23 June 2000; and (v) the execution of two novation agreements regarding the CHEJVA and Exploration License EL-5 on 1 April 2006. The Tribunal will address these allegations in turn.\n\n**a. Allegations Relating to the 1993 CHEJVA and the 1994 Relaxations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent did not raise specific allegations of corruption relating to the CHEJVA. However, in its Reply it asked the Tribunal to \"*make a finding that it is more probable than not that the CHEJVA was secured by corruption based on\u2026circumstantial evidence.*\"289\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 108.\n\n376.\n\nThe first piece of such evidence is that the documentary record purportedly demonstrates anomalies in the approval process. Respondent submits that the record demonstrates that not all relevant stakeholders supported the CHEJVA, there were extensive delays in negotiation during the period when Mr. Khan was Chairman of the BDA, which frustrated BHP, significant failings in the approval process and eventual sign-off was given soon after Mr. Jaffar became Chairman (the same Mr. Jaffar who was later convicted of corrupt activities in 2001).290 Respondent maintains that Mr. Jaffar's later conviction, combined with the fact that he was responsible for pushing through the anomalies in the process and the bribes paid to BHP officials shortly after the CHEJVA was signed, justify an inference that the CHEJVA was procured by corruption.291\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 111.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 21 lit. a.\n\n377.\n\nRespondent refers to file notes which allegedly reveal that despite serious reservations raised by the Additional Chief Secretary (**ACS**) and the Chief Secretary (**CS**) over the CHEJVA, Mr. Jaffar moved at speed, exerting pressure to obtain vettings and moving forward without Planning & Development Department or the Industries Department approval.292 Consequently, Respondent asks the Tribunal to: (i) re-visit its decision that it lacked sufficient evidence to establish any act of corruption in respect of Mr. Jaffar; and (ii) \"*join the dots*\" in the light of not only broader evidence of corruption by BHP throughout the project, but the \"*red flag*\" of Mr. Jaffar's attempts to expedite the process and his ultimate conviction for corruption.293\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 115-118.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 111-122 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 682.\n\n378.\n\nRespondent submits that other anomalies in the approval process include a breakdown in communication between the BDA and its independent counsel, Chima & Ibrahim (demonstrated by the fact that many of its concerns were ultimately ignored by the BDA), as well as the Mr. Ali Juma's vetting of the draft on behalf of the Law Department \u2013 the same Mr. Juma who allegedly later received a bribe to expedite vetting of the Addendum.294\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 119-122.\n\n379.\n\nRespondent submits that another piece of circumstantial evidence is a purported payment of PAK Rs 30,000 to Mr. Tahir by Mr. Farooqi (General Manager, Co-ordination BDA) to ensure his silence about a waiver of the annual fee over a reserved gold area in November 1994 (contrary to the parties agreement).295 Respondent highlights that the Supreme Court noted in its January 2013 decision that this waiver of the annual fee was indeed highly irregular and that with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear why such irregularity took place.296 Respondent also alleges that Mr. Farooqi himself was paid a bribe, although the amount of this is unknown.297\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 108(b).\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 35-36 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 129.\n\n380.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's suggestion that Mr. Tahir was a low level bureaucrat and not in a position to voice any objection to the waiver; it maintains that documentary evidence shows that he was the key individual at the BDA responsible for obtaining the relaxation.298 Secondly, Respondent dismisses Claimant's argument that if Mr. Tahir had been paid to keep quiet, this would have failed since the relaxation and fee waiver were not secret. In this regard, Respondent submits that whether or not it was actually kept a secret is irrelevant because few individuals understood the proper allocation of costs under the CHEJVA.299\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 126 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 169 *and* Tahir I, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 125-129 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\n381.\n\nRespondent thus asks for the aforementioned discrepancies in the approval process of the CHEJVA to be reviewed in light of this subsequent corrupt payment in securing the waiver for the gold area (firstly demonstrating a willingness to use corruption and secondly increasing the likelihood of corruption during CHEJVA negotiation and execution).300\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 123-129.\n\n382.\n\nRespondent further alleges that the comprehensive relaxations of the BMCR granted to BHP in January 1994 (before the waiver of the annual fee) \"*to facilitate Stage One exploration activities*\", when combined with inconsistencies in the record and the involvement of corrupt individuals such as Mr. Jaffar and Mr. Farooqi, evidence corruption in respect of the CHEJVA.301 In particular, Respondent alleges that BHP did not fulfill the criteria for relaxations under the 1970 BMC Rules with Mr. Jaffar playing a key role in pressuring and misinforming the Government of Balochistan (\"**GOB**\") in order to obtain such relaxations which notably had no time limit and extended to Mincor (despite only being granted to BHP).302\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 130-132 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-187**, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 130-132.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nOn a preliminary note, and as will be addressed in more detail in Section VII.D.1.b below in relation to the Addendum, Claimant maintains it should not be compelled to forfeit its valid Treaty claims because of alleged wrongdoing by BHP in the years before TCC existed or became a partner in the Reko Diq project.303\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 39-52.\n\n384.\n\nHowever, should the merits of these BHP-era claims be considered, Claimant argues that despite the lack of evidence of corruption that could have had any bearing on the negotiation and execution of the CHEJVA, Respondent seeks to resurrect arguments which have already been rejected by this Tribunal and the ICC Tribunal, about the CHEJVA's validity, and ultimately asks the Tribunal to find corruption here on the basis of circumstantial evidence and gap-filling.304\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 39-52 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 638*,* ICC Preliminary Issues Ruling, \u00b6 411 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 108.\n\n385.\n\nFirstly, Claimant argues that Respondent has not explained how irregularities post-dating the CHEJVA by more than a year (even if proven), could constitute evidence of corruption and \"*wildly overstates*\" the role of Mr. Jaffar, fails to explain the relevance of his conviction some eight years later and in fact has conceded that this was entirely \"*unrelated*\" to the CHEJVA itself.305 Claimant maintains that Respondent must do more than simply \"*suggest corruption*\" on the basis of two allegedly \"*corrupt individuals, namely Mr. Jaffar and Mr. Farooqi*\" and their purported roles in the relaxation process; Respondent must prove it.306\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 345-346; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 50 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 178(c).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 357 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 130.\n\n386.\n\nSecondly, Claimant argues that there is no evidence to suggest there was anything improper about the waiver and the relaxations.307 Claimant highlights that Respondent's only specific corruption allegation relates to an alleged bribery payment to Mr. Tahir for him to keep quiet about the waiver of the prospecting license fee due in November 1994\u2014 sixteen months after the CHEJVA's conclusion in July 1993. There is allegedly no explanation as to how this waiver is relevant to determining whether the CHEJVA was corruptly procured in the first place. Claimant maintains that not only is this claim unsubstantiated but is undermined by the fact that Mr. Tahir was not in a position at the BDA to voice any meaningful objection, and the record showing that multiple Provincial Government authorities were involved in the process; the notification was kept far from quiet.308\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 354-360.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 52 *referring to* Exhibits **RE-48**, p.2, **RE-50**, **CE-191** *and* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 169.\n\n387.\n\nClaimant specifically rejects Respondent's allegations that the BDA failed to act on Chima & Ibrahim's advice; not only were Pakistan's comments assessed in the wrong context, but the firm recognized its own lack of expertise, therefore it should not be surprising that the Government did not entirely follow the advice of corporate lawyers with no mining expertise.309\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 352.\n\n388.\n\nThirdly, Claimant maintains that the CHEJVA was the product of extensive negotiation and review.310 It rejects Respondent's allegations, including that: (i) the CHEJVA was procured in a \"*non-transparent manner*\"; (ii) Mr. Jaffar acted with undue haste; and (iii) external counsel's advice was ignored by the BDA. According to Claimant, these allegations are speculative, short of the evidentiary standard and unsupported by documentary evidence. Claimant submits that evidence demonstrates that over a three-year period, BHP negotiated the terms in multiple meetings with high-ranking government officials, at least five different drafts were proposed and considered by all relevant departments on different occasions and independent expert advice was widely obtained.311 Claimant further disputes Respondent's suggestion that various departments did not vet the agreement; Claimant maintains this is directly contradicted by the BDA's Board of Directors' (which included the Secretaries of Planning and Development, Industries and Finance) approval of the agreement on 3 July 1993, and the fact that the Planning and Development Department specifically authorized Mr. Jaffar to sign the agreement.312\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 105-119 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 105, 109; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 348.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 348 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 115-116, **Exhibit RE-39**, p. 9, **Exhibit CE-308**, p. 2 *and* **Exhibit RE-43**, p. 1.\n\n389.\n\nFourthly, Claimant argues that Balochistan's welcoming of an investment by a company of BHP's experience was not suspicious since it was still required to prove its credentials to earn its interest in the CHEJVA.313 Equally, Claimant submits that the 1970 BMC rules were two decades old and thus did not contemplate the large-scale activities envisaged by the CHEJVA. Therefore, in order to guarantee security of tenure, BHP formally requested relaxation of certain provisions to make the project practicable.314 Claimant thus contends that there was no occasion to speculate why Balochistan entered into the agreement which offered legitimate benefits to Balochistan and Pakistan including \"*unprecedented*\" value for Baloch society in terms of mineral and economic development.315\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 116 *referring to* Boggs II, \u00b6 4 *and* Draft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 926-930.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112, 118 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-212**, p. 9.\n\n390.\n\nIn response to Respondent's attempts to highlight that it was the purportedly corrupt Mr. Juma who vetted the CHEJVA on behalf of the Law Department, Claimant argues that any alleged payment made to Mr. Juma in relation to the Addendum cannot be of relevance to whether the CHEJVA was properly vetted six years earlier.316\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 353 *citing to Cf.* *Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009 [**CA 157**], \u00b6 43.\n\n391.\n\nUltimately Claimant deems it \"*both incredible and fundamentally unfair*\" for Respondent to attempt to impugn the CHEJVA as a product of corruption twenty-three years later and after losing on jurisdiction and liability.317 Instead of using the interim decades to present evidence to support this allegation, Respondent actually actively defended the CHEJVA's legitimacy in Pakistan's own courts. Having previously acknowledged in the two international arbitrations that it possesses no evidence of procurement by corruption in respect of the CHEJVA, Claimant questions how Respondent can now contend otherwise.318\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 118.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-19**, p. 12, Draft Decision, \u00b6 637 *and* Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n392.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis on the allegations of corruption that Respondent has raised in connection with the CHEJVA and the 1994 Relaxations, the Tribunal notes that Respondent did not include these allegations in its Post-Hearing Brief as part of the list of illegal acts that it sets out as being established on the basis of the evidence presented to the Tribunal. It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether Respondent maintains the allegations it has previously raised in its Reply. It will nevertheless address these allegations in the following analysis.\n\n393.\n\nRespondent's allegations do not involve any specific payment or other form of bribe made in connection with the negotiation and execution of the CHEJVA. Respondent rather asks the Tribunal to find \"*that it is more probable than not that the CHEJVA was secured by corruption*\" based exclusively on circumstantial evidence. Specifically, Respondent invokes: (i) alleged \"*anomalies in the approval process of the CHEJVA*\" and the \"*key role*\" of Mr. Ata Muhammad Jaffar, who had become Chairman of the BDA in April 1993 and signed the CHEJVA on behalf of the BDA in July 1993; (ii) an alleged payment of PAK Rs. 30,000 paid by Mr. Mohammad Amin Farooqi, then General Manager Co-ordination BDA, \u2013 allegedly on behalf of BHP \u2013 to Mr. Muhammad Tahir, then Additional General Manager of the Mines Division at the BDA in relation to the waiver of an annual fee over a reserved gold area in November 1994; and (iii) \"*anomalies in the process of the relaxations of the* [1970 BMC Rules],\" which were granted by the GOB in January 1994.319\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 108.\n\n394.\n\nAs to the first argument, Respondent relies primarily on the involvement of Mr. Jaffar in the final phase of the negotiations and in the execution of the CHEJVA and highlights that after more than two years of negotiations, it took only three months from Mr. Jaffar's taking office as Chairman of the BDA until the signing of the CHEJVA. In addition, Respondent notes that Mr. Jaffar was convicted in 2001 of having acquired properties totalling USD 6.5 million through corrupt practices.320 However, as the Tribunal noted in its Draft Decision, this conviction was not related to the CHEJVA or to the Reko Diq project in general.321 In addition, the Tribunal noted that while the Supreme Court held in its judgment of 2013 that the dual office held by Mr. Jaffar at the time the CHEJVA was signed, *i.e*., Chairman of the BDA and Additional Chief Secretary within the GOB, presented a \"*clear conflict of interest*,\" it did not make any finding that Mr. Jaffar's conduct in connection with the CHEJVA constituted an act of corruption and it did not mention any corresponding conduct of BHP in this regard.322\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 683, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 686.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 683 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 50, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 686.\n\n395.\n\nRespondent argues that this view of the Tribunal \"*should be re-visited in light of the new evidence of corruption more broadly*\" and that the Tribunal should \"*join the dots*\" based on the allegation that: (i) \"*BHP furthered its interests in the investment by way of corruption from start to finish, including as early as 1994 (and later through Mr Iqbal)*\"; (ii) Mr. Jaffar was later convicted of corruption \"*on a significant scale*\"; and (iii) Mr. Jaffar \"*used considerable personal efforts*\" to ensure the signing of the CHEJVA \"*in an expedited time frame by an irregular process and in the face of serious and repeated objections.*\"323 In addition, Respondent notes that the vetting by the Law Department was signed by Mr. Ali Juma, *i.e*., the same person that, according to Respondent, received a bribe from Mr. Farooq in December 1999 to vet the 2000 Addendum.324\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 114.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 122\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by any of these arguments. In particular, it appears to the Tribunal that apart from the events that were already subject to the Tribunal's consideration in the previous phase of the proceedings, Respondent attempts to prove its allegation in connection with the CHEJVA by arguing that the Tribunal should consider the other allegations of corruption it has raised in connection with other events as established. However, even if the Tribunal were to consider some of these allegations established, this would not be sufficient to draw an inference that there was also corruption in connection with the CHEJVA, which preceded all of these other events \u2013 in the case of the alleged illegitimate payment in December 1999, by several years. In addition, and while Respondent has now set out the negotiation history of the CHEJVA, including the communications exchanged with different departments within the GOB, in even more detail, it has not provided any additional evidence that would support a finding of corruption in this regard.\n\n397.\n\nAs to the second argument, *i.e*., an alleged payment of PAK Rs. 30,000 to Mr. Tahir made in connection with the waiver of an annual fee in November 1994, the Tribunal notes that this allegation is supported by the witness testimony of Mr. Tahir, who testified that he received this payment \"*for keeping quiet about the fact that the annual fees of this reserved area* [for gold exploration pursuant to a prospecting license] *had been waived*.\"325 He added that, while the fact of the waiver was known to various GOB departments, this did not apply to the alleged inaccuracy of the statement made by Mr. Farooqi in the request for such waiver, *i.e*., that the fee would otherwise have to be paid by BDA under the CHEJVA. According to Mr. Tahir, he \"*intentionally kept quiet about the deliberate misinterpretation because* [he] *had been paid by Mr. Farooqi to do so.*\"326\n\nTahir I, \u00b6 4.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 9.\n\n398.\n\nClaimant correctly points out that this alleged payment post-dates the signing of the CHEJVA by more than 15 months.327 Even if the Tribunal were to consider this payment as established, it remains unclear to the Tribunal how it would support any finding of corruption in the context of the conclusion of the CHEJVA. In addition, the payment was allegedly made by Mr. Farooqi, *i.e*., a BDA official. Respondent has not established that the alleged payment was made with the knowledge of BHP at the time. While Respondent claims that the payment was made \"*on behalf of BHP*\" and argues that \"[c]*learly, Mr Farooqi himself also received a bribe, although the amount of this is unknown*,\"328 this is an unsubstantiated allegation that does not satisfy the standard of proof established by the Tribunal above.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 51.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 129.\n\n399.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal is not convinced that the alleged payment, even if it was made, can be attributed to BHP and even less so, to Claimant, which was not involved in the project in any manner at the time. Therefore, it does not have to decide whether such act would be sufficient to \"*taint*\" the investment in the sense established above, *i.e*., whether it contributed to BHP obtaining a right or benefit related to the investment, and what the legal consequences of such a finding would be.\n\n400.\n\nAs to the third argument, *i.e*., alleged \"*anomalies*\" in the process of obtaining the 1994 Relaxations, the Tribunal recalls that it considered it unnecessary in its Draft Decision to express an opinion on the validity of the 1994 Relaxations under Pakistani law.329 In any event, the GOB (at least) created the impression that the Relaxations had been validly granted and even confirmed in a letter dated 11 November 2000 that they \"*still h* [e] *ld good*.\"330 The Tribunal further considered that Respondent could not rely on a failure on the part of the GOB to comply with its own rules and thus, that, regardless of their validity under Pakistani law, the 1994 Relaxations could in any event form part of Claimant's legitimate expectations.331\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 906, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 909.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 906 *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-195**, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 909.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 907, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 910.\n\n401.\n\nRespondent now argues that \"*inconsistencies in the record, and the recorded influence of two known corrupt individuals, namely Mr Jaffar and Mr Farooqi, suggest that corruption in this process is likely*.\"332 The Tribunal is again not convinced by this argument because, similarly to the CHEJVA above, Respondent again attempts to prove its allegation in connection with the 1994 Relaxations by making reference to its other allegations of corruption that the Tribunal should consider established for the present purposes. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that there was any payment attributable to BHP in respect of the waiver of the annual fee, and Mr. Jaffar's conviction for corruption that is entirely unrelated to Claimant's investment does not constitute circumstantial evidence for a finding of corruption that \"*tainted*\" such investment. In addition, as to the alleged \"*inconsistencies*\" regarding the 1994 Relaxations, the Tribunal notes that the process in which they were granted was already subject to the Tribunal's consideration in the Draft Decision and, in the absence of any new evidence that would demonstrate any wrongdoing on the part of BHP in that regard, the Tribunal does not see any reason to deviate from the conclusion it reached in that Decision.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 130.\n\n402.\n\nIn conclusion, based on a detailed review and evaluation of the indirect evidence adduced by Respondent in the context of the CHEJVA and the 1994 Relaxations, the Tribunal does not consider that there is any \"*solid*\" and \"*persuasive*\" evidence that would justify the conclusion that Respondent's allegation of corruption in that context has been proven with \"*reasonable certainty*.\" Consequently, this allegation is dismissed.\n\n**b. Allegations Relating to the March 2000 Addendum**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will address Respondent's allegation that the March 2000 Addendum has been procured by the making of illicit payments.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nRespondent alleges that BHP paid the following bribes totaling more than PAK Rs. 2 million to secure the 2000 Addendum (a condition precedent to its farm out arrangement with Mincor/TCC):\n\ni. PAK Rs. 40,000 from Mr. Farooq to Mr. Tahir in November 1999 to prevent Mr Tahir from being a hurdle in the Addendum process;\n\nii. PAK Rs. 20,000 from Mr. Farooq to Mr. Juma in December 1999 to ensure quick vetting of the Addendum;\n\niii. PAK Rs. 2 million from Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Burq in February/March 2000 to sign the Addendum without requiring further approvals;\n\niv. PAK Rs. 500,000 of the amount paid to Mr. Burq was paid to Mr. Farooq in February/March 2000 which, together with the periodic payments to Mr. Farooq, ensured that Mr. Farooq did TCC's bidding, including taking steps to ensure the execution of the Addendum; and\n\nv. An unknown amount by Mr. Lakhani/Mr. Arndt to Gov. Mengal to sign a letter authorizing the Chairman of the BDA to sign te Addendum on behalf of the GoB.333\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 133.\n\n405.\n\nConsequently, Respondent alleges that BHP succeeded in two respects: (i) it was able to rewrite the key terms of the CHEJVA in its favour through the Addendum; and (ii) the 2000 Addendum was executed despite failing to follow due process.334\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48.\n\n**(a) Re-write of Commercial Terms**\n------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nRespondent rejects the claim that the 2000 Addendum was in all parties' interests and that its purpose was to \"*clarify what had been [the] original intent [of the parties] all along.*\"335 BHP allegedly wanted to exit the project on the most favourable terms, so to secure an Addendum drastically rewriting the CHEJVA's key commercial terms (to BHP's benefit and to Balochistan's detriment), officials were bribed during the approval process.336 Respondent maintains that these amendments allowed BHP to earn its 75% interest without honoring its original promises under the CHEJVA.337 As a result, Respondent claims that Mincor, the \"*mining minnow and novice\"* was comfortably able to become involved in the project.338\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 136 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 122.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 135-136; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 42, 49 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 55 line 18 to p. 56 line 2.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 138.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 136, 233.\n\n407.\n\nAs highlighted in its opening statement and corroborated by Claimant's witness Mr. Pierce, Respondent perceives that the amendments in GOB's favor cannot be considered of anything more than \"*marginal importance and did not affect the project economics*.\"339 However, some of the key amendments set out in detail in Annex 1 of the Reply, Respondent's perception of the motive behind them as well as how they allegedly \"*shifted the contractual balance*\" between the Parties are summarized below.340\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 62 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 64 line 21 to p. 65 line 2 *and* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2000 lines 11-18.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 138.\n\n**(i) The Relaxation of the Requirements for BHP to Obtain a 75% Interest in the Joint Venture**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nRespondent argues that the amendment of Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA was not a mere linguistic improvement.341 The provision sets out the commercial bargain \u2013 BHP is not obliged to pay a lump sum to acquire a project stake, but can earn a 75% interest by financing and completing exploration work (including a Feasibility Study if required) within six years of the Commencement Date (*i.e*., by 20 January 2000).342\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 58-61 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 56 lines 9-15 and Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 139.\n\n409.\n\nRespondent submits that Article 5 of the Addendum removed the Feasibility Study requirement and stipulated that BHP must obtain ten Prospecting Licences to earn its interest (notably, which it had already done).343 Not only did this relax the conditions, requiring only the completion of Stage One and Two activities, but also operated retroactively, implemented two months after the 20 January 2000 deadline.344\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 142 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Recital C.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 143.\n\n410.\n\nRespondent further maintains that Claimant's comparison of the original and amended wording (presented in its opening statement), omitted certain wording and thus Respondent asks the Tribunal to disregard Slide 119 (which is incorrect and misleading) and instead refer to its demonstrative RD-7.345\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60 *referring to* TCC's Opening Slides at p. 119 *and* **Demonstrative RD-7**.\n\n**(ii) Increased Scope of Activities to Which the GOB Was Obliged to Contribute**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nRespondent explained that Clause 9.3 of the CHEJVA reflected the understanding that the BDA would not need to contribute to any exploration costs anywhere in the Exploration Area.346 However, through Article 8 of the Addendum, the GOB became obliged to contribute to all exploration costs in any area which was the subject of a \"*Mining Venture.*\"347 Where previously, this burden lay with BHP, Respondent maintains this commitment was reduced leaving the GOB with significant cost obligations and altering an integral part of the original bargain.348\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 146-149.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 144-149.\n\n**(iii) BHP's Narrowed Financing Commitment to the GOB**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThrough Clause 12.4 of the CHEJVA, Pakistan submits, BHP was obliged to finance development in full; the GOB incurred no costs until the project generated revenue which could then be used to repay debt.349 Yet, pursuant to Article 9 of the Addendum, Pakistan maintains, the GOB's right not to contribute was confined to:\n\ni. the GOB's capital assets not covered by external project financing;\n\nii. the capital costs of a Mining Venture (as opposed to the operating costs which would have been proportionally paid); and\n\niii. the costs of the first Mine Development only (as opposed to the costs of any Mining Venture).350\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 148.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 152.\n\n413.\n\nSpecifically regarding the first Mine Development, Respondent submits that the GOB became liable for a share of the third-party financing as arranged by BHP on a \"*best endeavours*\" obligation, becoming solely responsible for any subsequent Mining Development.351 Moreover, Respondent maintains that initially the repayment of BHP's loan to the BDA depended on the venture's performance and BDA was obliged to allocate only 50% of the gross revenue for these purposes. However, Respondent alleges that through Article 9 of the Addendum, BHP's obligation to pay funds to the GoB was conditional upon agreement on the percentage of the \"*Available Cashflows*\" to be used for repayment purposes.352 Respondent notes that Mr. Pierce confirmed that the removal of this cap could have resulted in the GOB receiving \"*no cash flow at all for eight years.*\"353\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 154.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 156-159.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 56 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 1976 lines 7-9.\n\n**(iv) Other Favorable Changes for BHP**\n----------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's allegations that retrospective \"*clarifications*\" to the role of the BDA as the GOB's agent (Articles 2.1, 2.2 of the Addendum), the GOB's blanket confirmation of the BDA's past actions in relation to the CHEJVA (Clause 2.2 of the Addendum), or its acceptance of the work performed by BHP as of the date of execution of the Addendum as valid performance under the CHEJVA (Clause 2.4 of the Addendum), were in the GOB's interests.354 Respondent maintains that the real implications were that the GOB assumed liability for the BDA's past actions, waiving any potential claims against BHP. Given BHP's performance issues to date, Respondent considers these amendments to be startling.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 164.\n\n**(b) Failure to Follow Due Process**\n-------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nAccording to Respondent, witness and documentary evidence purportedly demonstrates anomalies in the approval process, contrary to claims of \"*extensive negotiation*\" and a \"*robust internal review*\".355 Respondent dismisses claims of constant communication relating to negotiations since no amendments were made to BHP's July 1998 draft until signing in 2000.356 These anomalies were purportedly accompanied by bribes paid on behalf of BHP to ensure harmony by key decision-makers and a fast passage through Balochistan bureaucracy, the ultimate aim being swift entry of Mincor into the project.357\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 169 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 127; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 66 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6 74.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 166-169; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 63-71.\n\n416.\n\nWhile Respondent acknowledges the Tribunal's decision that Mincor's insistence on the Addendum's conclusion as a condition to taking over from BHP does not constitute illegality in relation to the CHEJVA, it argues that the impact of this condition on BHP is relevant background to considering the steps BHP was willing to take to push through the Addendum by any means.358\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 167 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 683.\n\n417.\n\nRespondent maintains that the first anomaly concerned the Summary for the Chief Minister, submitted by the BDA on 20 May 1999. While it contained BDA's concerns about Clause 12.5 of the CHEJVA, it omitted various departments' objections (including the Law Department, the Industries Department and the Director of the Directorate of Mineral Development (\"**DMD**\")) which were raised verbally to Mr. Farooq.359 Mr. Farooq then admitted that he and the Additional Chief Secretary (Development) purposely excluded the Secretary of Finance from negotiations in June 1999 due to his strong opposition to the contents of the Addendum.360\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 170 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(a).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 170-171.\n\n418.\n\nRespondent alleges that acting on Mr. Arndt's initiative and contrary to the GOB Rules of Business 1976, in August 1999, the Additional Chief Secretary (Development) submitted a request for the Governor to sign an authorization allowing the BDA Chairman to sign the Addendum (subject to Law Department vetting).361 Respondent maintains that the Governor nonetheless refused to grant the authorization, instead requesting that Finance Department approval be sought.362\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 172 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(c), Iqbal, \u00b6 20 *and* **Exhibit RE-20**, rule 8(1), 14, 7(3).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 172 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(c).\n\n419.\n\nRespondent submits that the second anomaly concerned the Law Department opinion of 21 August 1999, in which the Secretary refused to provide vetting for various reasons including Article 2.4 of the Addendum, which was \"*totally against the state/Province interest.*\"363 Respondent claims that, in its opening statement, Claimant cherry-picked these objections, dismissed them as \"*silly*\" and misrepresented that vetting was eventually obtained.364 Respondent emphasizes the abrupt approval and the lack of explanation why the Law Department's objections were abandoned (which, according to Mr. Tahir, was not the usual vetting process).365 Respondent alleges that not only does this demonstrate irregularity, but it supports the contention that a corrupt payment was made to assist this (with Mr. Farooq confirming that he paid Mr. Juma, the Law Department's Section Officer to vet the Addendum quickly).366\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 173 *referring to* **Ex RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 33-34.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 70 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 250 line 9.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 70 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 179; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1** item 2, *further referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(h) and Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 133(d), 182, **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 39-40, 36 and 55.\n\n420.\n\nRespondent maintains that the Finance Department also raised objections in relation to the new Clause 12.5 on 12 October 1999.367 Claimant allegedly misrepresents: (i) that the Finance Department eventually provided due vetting; and (ii) that its objections ended with the signing of the Addendum. Respondent submits that, realizing its error, Claimant now argues that these objections were addressed in its letters to the BDA Chairman of 12 October 1999 and 11 November 1999 and claims that \"*compromise was reached in negotiations about that.*\"368 In fact, Respondent argues that two months after signing, the Finance Department voiced its concerns to the BDA, thus purportedly demonstrating that its observations were ignored despite their importance for Balochistan.369\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 176-178.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 68 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 28-30, TCC's Opening Slides at p. 105 *and* Transcript (Day 1), p. 249 lines 11-17.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 185; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 68.\n\n421.\n\nRespondent dismisses Claimant's fall-back argument, that in any event, the Finance Department approval was not required under the Balochistan Rules of Business. Respondent acknowledges that if the concerned departments disagree, the case can be submitted to the CM and as martial law applied, the Governor was the responsible individual, not the CM.370 It maintains, however, that Claimant ignores the requirement that the \"*final views of the other departments concerned shall be obtained before the case is submitted.*\"371 Respondent notes that documentary and witness evidence demonstrates that neither the Governor nor the BDA sought the final views of the Finance Department.372\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 251 line 7 to p. 252 line 21, relying on **Ex RE-20**, Government of Balochistan Rules of Business 1976 at rule 8(2).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-20**, rule 8(2).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69.\n\n422.\n\nMoreover, Respondent alleges that in a meeting in early November 1999 between Mr. Arndt and Mr. Farooq, it was once again agreed that Mr. Arndt would press for the new Governor (Gov. Mengal) to sign a letter authorizing the BDA Chairman to sign the Addendum on the Governor's behalf, despite not actually approving the Addendum (witnesses describe this as an attempt to generate pressure on the Law and Finance Departments to vet the agreement), whilst Mr. Farooq would ensure that such vetting was obtained.373 Mr. Arndt allegedly promised Mr. Farooq that he would be \"*rewarded with a lot of money*\" for this, while Mr. Farooq paid Mr. Tahir PAK Rs. 40,000 out of his own pocket to prevent him informing the GOB's Planning and Development Department that these two vettings had not been obtained (thus being a hurdle in the approval process).374\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 172, 180 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(c) *and* Iqbal, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 43; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 179 *referring to* Tahir I, \u00b6 7, Tahir II, \u00b6 16 *and* Farooq I, \u00b6 8, 28.\n\n423.\n\nRespondent submits that in early December 1999 following a meeting at Gov. Mengal's house, Mr. Lakhani admitted to Mr. Farooq that \"*he had paid out so much money on this project so far, about US$ 5 million, and that he had had to pay more money to the Governor.*\"375 Respondent maintains that this helps to explain why the authorization letter was signed on 24 December 1999. Respondent recognizes that the Tribunal has already acknowledged the oddities in the form of the aforementioned letter in its Draft Decision, but suggests that the circumstances surrounding its execution are fundamental here.376\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 180 referring to Farooq II, \u00b6 21(g).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 180 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 740.\n\n424.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent alleges that at the beginning of 2000 when Mr. Burq took over as BDA Chairman, feeling that the relevant Addendum approvals were incomplete, Mr. Arndt and Mr. Iqbal made another illicit payment to secure the execution.377 Respondent maintains that the suggestion that Mr. Burq had no choice but to sign the Addendum given that the Governor had already determined it should be signed, is entirely unproven.378 Mr. Farooq clarified in his testimony that Mr. Burq \"*had no objection on the signing of the Addendum; he had objection on the approval of the Addendum. That it had not gotten approval.*\"379 Respondent also highlights that Mr. Farooq also testified that he was given a cut of this bribe for his assistance in ensuring the pushing through of the Addendum contrary to due process.380\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 45.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 253 lines 6-16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47 *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 8, Farooq II, \u00b6 21(i), Transcript (Day 3), p. 697 lines 3-16 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 133(b), 183.\n\n**(c) The Role of Mr. Arndt**\n-----------------------------\n\n425.\n\nRespondent questions Claimant's suggestion that evidence regarding Mr. Arndt's employment status \"*conclusively establishes that none of this could have happened\"* (since he was not working for BHP nor TCC at the time of the alleged payments) for two main reasons.381 As a preliminary issue however, Respondent emphasizes that the question of his involvement is collateral and can in no way detract from the evidence of bribery \u2013 the broader evidence suggests his involvement in the project at the time of the relevant bribes (including not only the payment for Mr. Burq to sign the Addendum, but also the payment in relation to the certification of BHP's interest \u2013 addressed below).382\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 323 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 298.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 322-344.\n\n426.\n\nRespondent's first argument is that Claimant's story of the emergence of Respondent's witnesses regarding Mr. Arndt, *i.e*., that Mr. Farooq was forced to falsely testify to the NAB and implicated Mr. Iqbal in paying cash bribes, leading Mr. Iqbal to invent Mr. Arndt's bribery scheme and Mr. Farooq to then change his testimony after spontaneously remembering Mr. Arndt's role, is unsubstantiated and illogical.383 Respondent submits that various elements of the story do not add up, including why the NAB would need evidence of Mr. Farooq's participation in the broader kickback scheme to use as leverage to implicate Mr. Iqbal when it already had evidence of his corruption and why Mr. Farooq would accuse Mr. Iqbal rather than Mr. Arndt directly, leading to Mr. Farooq's so-called \"*spontaneous,*\" fabricated memory as to Mr. Arndt's role in the corruption.384\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 324 *referring to* TCC's letter to the Tribunal dated 2 November 2016, pages 2 and 5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 324-325.\n\n427.\n\nSecondly, Respondent refers to an abundance of evidence which it argues strongly suggests that Mr. Arndt was involved at the time of the relevant bribes including the following:\n\n428.\n\nRespondent maintains that Mr. Arndt had both the motive and the means to be involved. After his formal retrenchment from BHP in August 1999, he was allegedly promised a lead role in the project following farm-out to Mincor (with Mr. Skrzeczynski confirming that no Addendum/certification - no farm out - no job) and, as confirmed by Mr. Williams, he was in possession of \"*well over two years' pay*\" and thus a \"*substantial amount of money*\" with which to fund the bribes.385\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 327-328 *referring to* Ex. RE-518, E-mail from Saad Husain to Chris Arndt, subject: Update at p. 2, Transcript (Day 8), p. 2123 lines 17-18, Transcript (Day 9), p. 2210 lines 6-9 and p. 2219 line 2.\n\n429.\n\nRespondent further alleges that e-mails, progress reports on the project received and distributed by Mr. Arndt and the evidence of Mr. Hargreaves indicates that he remained the 'go to' source of information about the project for his former colleagues notwithstanding his official retrenchment.386 Respondent submits that Mr. Arndt seemingly remained closer to events on the ground than Mr. Hargreaves who professed to be \"*overseeing BHP Minerals as Country Manager for BHP in Pakistan*\" from 1997.387\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 329-330.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 329 *referring to* Hargreaves I, \u00b6 13.\n\n430.\n\nRespondent submits that the suggestion that he was replaced with Mr. Skrzeczynski and Mr. Schloderer is contradicted by witnesses confirming that after his retrenchment in August 1999, Mr. Arndt continued his work as no one else had the requisite \"*experience of contract negotiation and dealing with government officials*\" as he did to get the Addendum over the line.388 Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Skrzeczynski admitted that he was not actually involved in Addendum negotiations and that between August 1999 and the signing of the Addendum and related documents, Mr. Schloderer was not actually located in Pakistan, but in Peru.389\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 331-333 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 333 lines 3-8 *and* p. 407 lines 14-18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 332 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2129 lines 8-9, p. 2126 lines 4-5 and 19-22, p. 2133 lines 20-21, p. 2138 lines 8-13 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2313 line 22 to p. 2314 line 2.\n\n431.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimant's evidence of Mr. Arndt's non-involvement including his CV and the absence of his name in certain project minutes and correspondence, is unreliable.390 Additionally, in relation to the e-mail exchange between Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Arndt from mid-May 2000 which seems to demonstrate Mr. Arndt's absence from the project, Respondent submits that it actually shows the complete opposite; he was being updated on the project from other sources and was seeking a permanent job back in Pakistan.391 Maintaining that TCC possessed Mr. Arndt's personal e-mails as these were linked to TCC's Outlook due to his continuing involvement, Respondent also claims that TCC's witnesses are not credible given their limited knowledge of Mr. Arndt's whereabouts and limited role in negotiations.392 Moreover, Respondent is unconvinced by Claimant's explanation of why it does not have more complete copies of some e-mail chains (particularly those of relevance to Mr. Arndt's role) since it perceives responding to personal e-mails in a new e-mail chain and deleting original e-mail messages in a reply e-mail not to be common practice.393\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 334-341.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 338-340 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-737**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 339-341 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2108 line 21 to p. 2109 line 1, Hargreaves II, \u00b6 15, Moore, \u00b6 55 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2236 lines 6-9.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 340 *referring to* Pakistan's letter to the Tribunal dated 22 November 2016, p. 2 *and* TCC's letter to the Tribunal dated 28 November 2016, p. 1.\n\n**(d) TCC is Responsible for BHP's Past Conduct**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nRespondent dismisses the argument that \"*under no circumstances could TCC be faulted for any wrongdoing by BHP,*\" suggesting that TCC would avoid liability in respect of the \"*pre-2006 wrongdoing.*\"394 Respondent considers it uncontested that the bribes paid in relation to the Addendum (and the 75% certification and Deed, as discussed below) are attributable to BHP and notes that Claimant did not contest that this conduct was attributable to TCC until its Rejoinder.395\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 345-346 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 143 *and* Transcript (Day 1), p. 204 lines 1-3 and lines 17-19 and p. 203 lines 21-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 346.\n\n433.\n\nFirstly, Respondent maintains that BHP's conduct is attributable to TCC given the continuity of personnel responsible for the corruption, many of whom transferred from BHP to TCC, and the corruption itself, which often involved the same agents (including Mr. Iqbal, Mr. Arndt, Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Lakhani).396 Respondent maintains that Mr. Farooq remained the central figurehead of corruption on the GOB/BDA side for 14-15 years in relation to the 2006 Novation Agreements.397 Respondent further submits that prior to the novation in 2006, Col. Khan and Mr. Dad (who would go on to be implicated in TCC's corruption case) came to be employed by TCC and there was also crossover between Mincor and TCC (Mr. Moore for example transferred in his position as Managing Director in 2000).398\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 353.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 245.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 243-244.\n\n434.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that TCC had direct knowledge of the fraudulent certification of the 75% interest (discussed below), since Mincor/TCC assumed responsibility for exploration work which BHP would already have had to be performed by January 2000 for the interest to be earnt under CHEJVA.399\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 347(a).\n\n435.\n\nThirdly, Respondent notes that the commercial relationship between BHP and TCC pursuant to the Option and Alliance Agreements was such that they operated as a joint venture; the farm-out did not mean that BHP exited the project completely, but remained party to the CHEJVA for the next six years responsible for BHP as its partner in the project.400 Respondent maintains that both parties expected to profit from the project; TCC by eventually becoming party to the CHEJVA and BHP by exercising its clawback right vis-\u00e0-vis TCC if a significant discovery was made.401\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 347(b), 355.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 355 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2199 lines 10-15 *and* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2175 lines 13-15.\n\n436.\n\nRespondent dismisses Claimant's reliance on *Yukos* and *Saluka* given that they did not involve the claimant's legal predecessor's corrupt conduct or the claimant's knowledge of such corruption.402 Respondent also argues that Claimant entirely misses the point by distinguishing the *World Duty Free* case, ignoring the finding that an individual's continued involvement, knowledge and conduct in relation to two organizations created a common link justifying attribution of his knowledge of corruption and his corrupt conduct to both of them. Thus, given the continuity of personnel addressed above, and applying this reasoning, Respondent argues that the aforementioned individuals' knowledge and conduct must be treated as knowledge and conduct of both BHP and TCC.403\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 352 *citing to* *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. the Russian Federation*, PCA Case Nos. 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178 / Exhibit SS-** 18] *and* *Saluka Investments B.V. v. the Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 [**CA 44 / RLA-106**].\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 350-354; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 452.\n\n**(e) Lack of Diligence Is Legally Significant**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nEven if the Tribunal did not impute the conduct of BHP to TCC, Respondent asserts that TCC's failure to conduct due diligence in a high-risk environment is enough to make it responsible for that misconduct and prevent it from raising Treaty claims.404\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 347(c), 371-383.\n\n438.\n\nRespondent submits that there is no evidence that TCC carried out proper due diligence in accordance with Pakistani and anti-corruption law and alleges that it entered into the Alliance and Novation Agreements without requiring BHP to make any representations regarding the absence of corruption in the project. Respondent submits that the significance of corruption in Pakistan, the mining industry generally, as well as the involvement of corrupt individuals like Mr. Farooq, strongly suggests TCC's knowledge and acquiescence in corruption.405\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 457.\n\n439.\n\nRespondent cites *Anderson v Costa Rica* (\"*an important element of such due diligence is for investors to assure themselves that their investments comply with the law\"*) and *MTD v. Chile* where the host state was not held responsible for the consequences of unwise business decisions or lack of diligence of an investor.406\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 454 *citing to* *Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010 [**RLA-132**], \u00b6 58 *and* *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award dated 25 May 2004 [**RLA-131**], \u00b6 167.\n\n440.\n\nRespondent argues that the *Churchill Mining* case (where the tribunal denied treaty protection to claimants because various mining licences were fraudulent) is particularly relevant for two main reasons.407 Firstly, the tribunal's reasoning centered on: (i) the seriousness of the fraud; and (ii) \"*the claimants' lack of diligence overseeing the licencing process and investigating allegations of forgery.*\"408 Respondent draws similarities in that just as \"*the claimants were aware of the risks involved in investing in coal mining industry in Indonesia,*\" Claimant here was aware of the same in Pakistan.409 Secondly, just as claimants failed to exercise due diligence when \"*indications of forgery first came to light,*\" Pakistan alleges that TCC \"*deliberately closed its eyes to evidence of serious misconduct,*\" something which its witnesses accepted at the Hearing.410 Respondent considers these 'red flags' also relevant in relation to: (i) whether BHP had earnt its 75% interest; (ii) the Law Department's review of the Novation Agreements; (iii) Mr. Farooq's role in securing the airstrip lease despite his known corrupt reputation; (iv) Mr. James' hands-off approach with the Surface Rights Lease; and (v) the lack of investigation of suspect aspects of the lavish 'educational' trips.411\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 377.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 379 *citing to* *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 [**RLA-334**], \u00b6 509.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 379 *citing to* *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 [**RLA-334**], \u00b6 517.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 377, 379, 381 *citing to* *David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v.

As a result, the consequence should be the dismissal of its claims as a matter of jurisdiction, admissibility or on the merits.412\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 383.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's allegations fail to meet the burden of proof.413 The aspects of Respondent's narrative which are subject to objective verification are alleged to be false but even if they were creditable, Claimant maintains that they are ill-conceived given the robust Government process that attended the Addendum negotiations; corruption could thus not have been the 'but-for' cause of its consummation.414 Additionally, Claimant notes that neither of the two individuals fundamental to such allegations, Mr. Burq and Governor Mengal who allegedly received bribes, were produced as witnesses to this arbitration.415\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 122.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 122-131.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 73.\n\n443.\n\nClaimant also argues that these allegations make no sense as the Addendum was executed in the interests of all parties at the time.416 More specifically, Claimant identifies two apparently \"*fatal flaws*\" in Respondent's argument: (i) the Government officials whom Pakistan allegedly corruptly influenced did not have decision-making power to influence the process; and (ii) documentary evidence clearly shows that the Addendum was correctly vetted.417\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 361.\n\n**(a) The Lack of Decision-making Power Possessed by Those Allegedly Bribed**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nClaimant suggests that even if BHP had bribed BDA officers, that could not have procured the Addendum since through Article 173 of Pakistan's Constitution and the Balochistan Development Authority Act, the BDA was the GOB's agent.418 Claimant explains that the GOB retained decision-making authority with respect to the CHEJVA and foundational agreements; therefore, the alleged bribes would not be sufficient to demonstrate that they procured the foundational documents themselves.419\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 103.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 104.\n\n445.\n\nClaimant refers to the chronology of the GOB's review process, as evidenced by the documentary record, in order to demonstrate that while Mr. Burq was indeed the individual who affixed his signature to the Addendum, he did so on the Governor's specific directions.420\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 361; Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 135 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-58(VI)(an)** *and* **CE-2**, p. 9.\n\n446.\n\nClaimant also rejects the allegations advanced in Respondent's Reply.421 Firstly, Claimant submits that Mr. Farooq's suggestion that he engineered the Law Department's vetting of the Addendum by personally convincing the Secretary of Law to approve the draft Addendum by paying \"*a small amount*\" to Mr. Juma, the Section Officer of the Law Department who subsequently processed the matter, is inherently suspect.422 Given the specificity with which Mr. Farooq had testified about numerous payments over the years, Claimant alleges that it is inconceivable that he would have forgotten such a fundamental payment until the Reply stage of proceedings.423 Secondly, Claimant rejects the argument that BHP's corruption extended to a level of seniority higher than Mr. Burq through Mr. Arndt of BHP and Mr. Lakhani of Mincor both paying a bribe to Governor Mengal in December 1999, in exchange for authorizing BDA to sign the Agreement, noting that both individuals were not employed by BHP at the time.424\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 362.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 362-363 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(h).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 362-363.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 362, 364 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(g).\n\n**(b) Role of Mr. Arndt**\n-------------------------\n\n447.\n\nClaimant asserts that Mr. Arndt's employment at BHP ceased in August 1999 and he did not join TCC until late 2003. It argues that Mr. Arndt has been used by Respondent as a convenient scapegoat to fill key evidentiary gaps in its case \u2013 Claimant maintains that the \"*tale of Mr. Arndt*\" has been entirely \"*tailor-made for Pakistan's immediate purpose.*\"425 Claimant maintains that it is therefore impossible that he made promises to Mr. Farooq in November 1999, arranged a bribe for Governor Mengal in December 1999 or approved the bribe to Mr. Burq in February 2000 as alleged.426\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 54-65; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 364.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant maintains that, on recognizing that the nonexistent bribes would not appear on BHP nor TCC's books, Mr. Iqbal conveniently invented the tale of \"*Secret Agent Arndt,*\" responsible for the key foundational bribes \u2013 knowing that he could not deny the accusations as he was no longer alive.427\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 299; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 408 lines 1-3.\n\n449.\n\nClaimant argues that, not only is there indisputable documentary and witness evidence to demonstrate that this did not happen, but this fiction became glaringly false during the Hearing at which Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq struggled to explain the nature of Mr. Arndt's continued working relationship with the company that had just laid him off.428\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 27, 298; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 56 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2),p. 388 lines 2-5 and Transcript (Day 3), p. 772 lines 2-4.\n\n450.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant submits that the records of official meetings and correspondence both serve to substantiate the fact that Mr. Schloderer replaced Mr. Arndt as the project's Chief Executive in August 1999 \u2013 he was the individual running negotiations, not Mr. Arndt.429 Claimant argues that documentary and witness evidence (including Mr. Arndt's CV) both serve to demonstrate that after he left BHP in August 1999, he went on to work for a series of companies on different projects, casting doubt on Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq's \"*incredible*\" testimonies.430\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 56 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 444 line 18 to p. 445 line 1 *and* p. 382 lines 9-19.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 57 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-510**, p. 1, Skrzeczynski, \u00b6 19, Moore, \u00b6 55, Hargreaves II, \u00b6 15 *and* Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated 26 October 2016, \u00b6 13.\n\n451.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant maintains that nothing in the aforementioned e-mail exchange gives any indication that Mr. Arndt was secretly travelling around the country delivering bribes for his former employer, but instead depict a geologist in Western Australia, e-mailing friends to search for work.431 According to Claimant, these private e-mails came into TCC's possession as Mr. Arndt \"*uploaded those e-mails to the TCCA system sometime after he joined TCCA in November 2003.*\"432\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 58-61.\n\nTCC's letter to the Tribunal dated 2 November 2016, p. 6.\n\n452.\n\nClaimant submits that the fiction can be discredited by looking at the objective circumstances; why would a cash-squeezed BHP going to pay bribes to exit a project it was willing to walk away from?433 Claimant disputes that Mr. Arndt had the motive and the means to make the payments; in its view, this argument does not solve any of the problems with the incredibility of Respondent's claims, but also ignores the fact that even if he did use his own money to further his own interests, this would not be attributable to BHP or TCC.434 Moreover, Claimant relies on witness testimony from Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Skrzeczynski to demonstrate that the alleged promised job for Mr. Arndt simply did not exist and was in fact contrary to Mr. Arndt's own employment expectations and prospects.435\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 62.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 63 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-858**, p. 1, Transcript (Day 8), p. 2120 line 18 to p. 2121 line 1 and p. 2122 line 14 to p. 2123 line 10.\n\n453.\n\nUltimately, Claimant submits that the Tribunal can have no doubt that Mr. Arndt was not involved in the project at the relevant time and much less acting as some kind of secret agent delivering bribes for BHP to obtain the 2000 instruments.436\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 54-65.\n\n**(c) Role of Mr. Lakhani**\n---------------------------\n\n454.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Mr. Moore and Mr. Hargreaves both testified that Mr. Lakhani did not become involved with TCC until late 2000 and even then only as a seed investor.437 Mr. Moore went so far as to say that it was \"*utterly incredible\"* that Mr. Lakhani had any prior association with the project, since when the pair met in April/May 2001, Mr. Lakhani mentioned no such prior involvement.438\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 70 *referring to* Moore, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53 *and* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 14, 19.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 72.\n\n455.\n\nClaimant maintains that this employment discrepancy, coupled with the fact that no one at BHP nor Mincor had access to funds as much as the alleged USD 5 million which Mr. Lakhani purportedly told Mr. Farooq he had paid out in bribes on the project (allegedly a sudden and convenient recollection made in Mr. Farooq's second witness statement), makes it implausible that either individual would have paid out this much money by December 1999.439\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 69-74, 93 *referring to Respondent's* Reply, \u00b6 133(e), 180 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(g); Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 364 *referring to* Skrzeczynski, \u00b6 21 *and* Hargreaves, \u00b6 19.\n\n**(d) Documentary Record**\n--------------------------\n\n456.\n\nClaimant maintains that there is documentary evidence to corroborate the two year-long negotiation of the Addendum, during which time five drafts were considered, various meetings were convened involving at least twenty high ranking government officials, multiple correspondences were exchanged by the GOB and independent corporate counsel's legal advice sought, all in connection with the approval process.440\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 124-126.\n\n457.\n\nClaimant described the negotiation process as: (i) \"*thorough*\", evidenced by the GOB obtaining legal advice from independent legal counsel; and (ii) \"*transparent and appropriate,*\" referring to the Chief Minister's praise of the GOB's development of a special committee to ensure finalization of the document.441 Claimant explains that Respondent's own witness, Mr. Tahir even acknowledged that the approval process was subject to normal bureaucratic deliberation.442\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 8 *and* **RE-58(VI)(aj),** pp. 160-164.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 76 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 135 *and* Transcript (Day 2), p. 340 lines 17-22.\n\n458.\n\nClaimant particularly draws the Tribunal's attention to the alleged payment from Mr. Arndt and Mr. Iqbal of PAK Rs. 2,000,000 to Mr. Burq in February or March 2000. In doing so, Claimant firstly refers to the Tribunal's Draft Decision where it rejected the argument that there were *\"several oddities relating to the authorization of the Governor of Balochistan permitting the Chairman of the BDA to sign on his behalf.*\"443 Ultimately however, Claimant relies on the documentary record (which demonstrates that two BDA Chairmen preceding Mr. Burq openly supported the Addendum) to show that that execution consummated a long-standing institutional imperative and to reject Respondent's allegation that there was any need for this alleged corrupt payment in order to prevent him being an obstacle in the approval process.444\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 127 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 37 *and* Draft Decision, \u00b6 682.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 127 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 10, 14, 54.\n\n459.\n\nClaimant also refutes the alleged bypassing of both the Law Department and the Finance Department on the basis of the following documentary (and/or witness) evidence.\n\n**(i) Law Department**\n----------------------\n\n460.\n\nClaimant submits that the documentary record shows that: (i) on 28 December 1999, the BDA Chairman specifically requested that the Addendum be vetted by the Law Department which was returned \"*duly vetted*\" three days later; and (ii) this Department was actively engaged in the approval process during the course of the two-year negotiation.445\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 129 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 55 *and* **RE-56**, p. 2.\n\n461.\n\nClaimant submits that there are inconsistencies in Respondent's witness statements in relation to the alleged payment made by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Tahir to prevent him pointing out that Law Department approval had not been obtained.446 In Mr. Farooq's first witness statement and indeed in Mr. Tahir's statement, it was stated that this payment was made from the money Mr. Farooq received in January 2000 from BHP, however this made little sense since Law Department approval was in fact obtained on 31 December 1999.447 Claimant maintains that unsurprisingly, Mr. Farooq had to change his testimony to suit these dates and subsequently testified that he actually paid Mr. Tahir in November 1999 out of his own pocket before he received payment from BHP.448\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 81.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 81 *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 8, Farooq II, \u00b6 21(i) *and* Tahir I, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 81 *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 8 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 21(i).\n\n**(ii) Finance Department**\n---------------------------\n\n462.\n\nClaimant dismisses Mr. Tahir's insinuation that \"[a] *number of further concerns*\" raised by the Finance Department were ignored, relying on further documentary evidence to show that by at least February 1998, the Finance Department was actively engaged in the process and remained so throughout.449 Claimant specifically maintains that various letters were exchanged between the Finance Department, the BDA and BHP between September and December 1999 addressing particular concerns the Finance Department had, including clarification that these concerns had indeed \"*already been discussed in detail at various meetings with the high officials of GOB/BDA.*\"450\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 131.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 131 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 5, \u00b6 3, 22 (letter dated 23 September 1999), 26, 28-30, 41-42 (reflecting September 1999 meeting involving the Finance Department), 50.\n\n463.\n\nClaimant questions why Mr. Iqbal would have recommended that the Government retain an independent financial consultant to review the Finance Department's objections if he was attempting to circumvent due process through a bribery scheme.451 Similarly, Claimant draws the Tribunal's attention to Mr. Iqbal citation of the Balochistan Rules of Business in an attempt to claim that the Governor's approval was not valid without sign-off from all relevant departments.452 However, when confronted with the exact text on cross-examination, he then admitted his neglect to mention a number of rules which stipulate situations in which approval is not required, therefore demonstrating the purported \"*lengths that* [he] *would go to concoct testimony*\".453\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 79 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 357 lines 18-22.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 80 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 80 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 359 line 8 to p. 363 line 12 and p. 363 line 13 to p. 364 line 10 *and* **Exhibit RE-20**, rule 8(2), at 10 and Rule 46, at 23.\n\n464.\n\nMoreover, Claimant submits that the fact that these departments raised concerns about the Addendum does not suggest that it was somehow improper due to deficiencies in the approval process. Claimant talks of the irony of Mr. Iqbal's testimony stating that these concerns indicate a deficiency in the process since he himself actually perceived such concerns to be meritless at the time.454\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 78 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 351 lines 9-13.\n\n**(e) The Alleged 'Re-write' of the Commercial Terms**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nClaimant maintains that even if the Addendum were one-sided (something which is disputed), this would not be enough to establish that corruption took place.455 To constitute circumstantial evidence of corruption, Claimant maintains that the contract would have to be patently without any benefit to Balochistan.456 Claimant submits that in any event, the underlying premise that the contract was one-sided was blatantly false if one considers the long negotiating history and plainly reads the Addendum. In Claimant's view, it is clear that the entire commercial deal of the CHEJVA was not transformed as a result of the 2000 Addendum.457\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 83.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 84.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 368; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 85.\n\n466.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant submits that Respondent fails to mention how several of the provisions introduced through the Addendum actually amended the CHEJVA in Balochistan's favor.458\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 379; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 86.\n\n467.\n\nFirstly, Claimant argues that through its Article 5, the Addendum clearly preserves the Operating Committee's ability to resolve and commission a Feasibility Study.459 Claimant disputes that the parties originally intended this to be a condition in the manner suggested by Respondent, which was then was replaced with the requirement to obtain ten Prospecting Licences. Claimant argues that Respondent has ignored the negotiating history as explained by Mr. Pierce \u2013 this change was made because at the time, BHP was planning to trade in some of its current prospecting licences in exchange for new ones to the west.460 He further explained that the amendment, which simply takes a concept from the CHEJVA and makes it a separate sentence, was intended merely to permit BHP to determine in the areas of which ten Prospecting Licences it would be required to complete Stage One and Stage Two activities.461\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 369-370 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 5.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 369-371 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 370 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6 89, 106.\n\n468.\n\nSecondly, Claimant maintains that the Addendum does not affect BHP's obligation to bear the costs of all exploration activities. Claimant submits that on a plain reading, it simply reinforces the original bargain, clarifying the extent to which Balochistan was in fact not obliged to pay for such activities over \"*any part of the\u2026Exploration Area which is not the subject of a Mining Venture.*\"462\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 372-373 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 8.1 *and* Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n469.\n\nThirdly, Claimant dismisses Respondent's allegation that the Addendum set the stage for Balochistan to get \"*squeeze*[d] *out*\" of profitable expansion projects by requiring it to fund its own portion of the capital cost of Mine Development after the first mine.463 Claimant submits that this ignores a fundamental limit on BHP's financing commitment contained in the CHEJVA, namely that the commitment only extended until Minerals were produced \u2013 there was no perpetual agreement to fund Balochistan's interest contrary to Respondent's suggestions.464\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 88 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 150-163.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 88 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1**, Clause 12.4 *and* **CE-2**, new Clause 12.4.2.\n\n470.\n\nFourthly, Claimant relies on Mr. Pierce's testimony to explain that, far from increasing Balochistan's indebtedness as alleged, the introduction of external project financing was simply intended to increase the available finance sources for the parties.465 The only difference was that Balochistan would not be liable to BHP, but instead to a third party.466 Claimant maintains that this does not change the fact that Balochistan was always obliged to repay its share of the costs.467 Respondent's emphasis on BHP's \"*best endeavours*\" obligation is also alleged to be misguided since Claimant maintains that this had the potential to actually reduce Balochistan's indebtedness should the best terms be more favorable than those attached to the equity portion for which it was obliged to contribute.468\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 374 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6 69.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1**, Clauses 12.4-12.5 *and* **CE-2**, new Clause 12.4.2.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 374 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 12.4.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 374 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 9.\n\n471.\n\nLastly, in respect of the allegation that the Addendum threatened GOB's \"*guaranteed cashflow of 50% gross revenues*,\" Claimant relies on Mr. Pierce's evidence to argue that this ignores the fact that Balochistan rejected a proposed 100% allocation outright and therefore this amendment actually reflected a compromise struck by the parties for the benefit of both sides.469 Firstly, Claimant submits that it deferred the agreement of a specific percentage until after the decision to proceed with mine development meaning that Balochistan would have more concrete expectations of the future mine's profitability and prevailing copper prices, and secondly, the eight year repayment period aligned the arrangement with the standard among international financing guidelines for private sector projects.470\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 375 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 376 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 66-69 *and* **Exhibit CE-507**, p. 1.\n\n**(f) TCC Is Not Responsible for BHP's Past Conduct**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nClaimant argues that there is no legal basis on which any acts of corruption committed by BHP employees can be attributed to Claimant given that BHP and TCC are distinct entities.471 Both *Yukos* and *Saluka* are cited in support of Claimant's contention that an investor cannot be faulted for the wrongdoing of its predecessors, where the tribunals rejected arguments that the claimants should be faulted for illegalities of what were described as distinct entities/separate persons.472\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 142-147; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 39 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 203 line 19 to p. 205 line 3.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 143; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 40 *citing to* *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014 [**CA 178**] *and* *Saluka Investments B.V. v. the Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 [**CA 44 / RLA-106**].\n\n473.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's arguments to the contrary are based on a misreading of the authorities \u2013 none of which establishes a rule which would make TCC responsible for the actions of its predecessor.473 Claimant distinguishes the *World Duty Free* case given that the facts were entirely different and TCC is clearly not the alter ego of BHP here, whereas in that award Mr. Ali was held to be the \"*alter ego of both companies.*\"474\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 144 *citing to* *World Duty Free v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006 [**RLA-36**] \u00b6 168.\n\n474.\n\nSecondly, Claimant alleges that Respondent advances no explanation or authority to support its contention that a failure to conduct appropriate due diligence can result in attributing BHP's liability to Claimant.475 Claimant submits that Respondent has not established that there is any legal obligation, under the Treaty or international law, to conduct due diligence.476 In addition, Claimant distinguishes *MTD* based on the fact that lack of diligence was considered when assessing quantum and therefore was a straightforward application of contributory fault, not a new theory of attribution.477 Claimant also distinguishes the *Anderson* and the *Churchill Mining* cases since what mattered there was not mere prior misconduct by third parties, but rather that the very source of Claimants' rights was illegal and fraudulent.478 Moreover, Claimant argues that *Churchill Mining* cannot be compared since TCC not only had a strong anti-corruption culture, but Respondent has not proven any corruption, let alone foundational corruption which affected the \"*entire project*\" as was the case in *Churchill Mining*.479 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant also draws the Tribunal's attention to *Minnotte v Poland* in which the tribunal explained that it was not an investigative body and only had limited responsibility and powers to adjudicate the claims of an investor protected by the treaty.480\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 145.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 145.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41(b).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45 *citing to* Minnotte Award [**RLA-299**] \u00b6 155.\n\n475.\n\nClaimant therefore argues that there is no support for Respondent's claim that TCC must forfeit its valid Treaty claims because of BHP's alleged past wrongdoing.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n476.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of Respondent's allegations of corruption in the context of the 2000 Addendum, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties that, as of 1998, BHP intended to farm out at least part of its interest in the Reko Diq project to a third party.481 Mr. Pierce explained that \"[a]*s a result of the concept study* [whose results did not meet BHP's financial criteria] *Reko Diq dropped from a high to a low priority in the budget cycle for 1999 (from mid-1998 to mid-1999). BHP had made the decision to spend only the minimum necessary to meet obligations within the joint venture agreement while looking for a partner* \u2026\"482\n\n*Cf*. Williams II, \u00b6 9.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 23.\n\n477.\n\nWhile BHP initially negotiated with a large Australian mining company, Iscor Australia Pty. Ltd. (\"**Iscor**\"), in 1998, these negotiations did not lead to a successful close because, as explained by Mr. Moore, who led the negotiations on behalf of Iscor at the time, BHP could not fulfill the conditions precedent agreed on in an initial memorandum of understanding \"*in a reasonable time frame*\" and, thus, eventually \"*withdrew from the deal*.\"483 After Mr. Moore had created Mincor Resources NL (\"**Mincor**\") as a junior exploration company in 1999, with Iscor remaining the largest shareholder holding 40%, he again contacted BHP in order to revive the negotiations relating to the Reko Diq project. He added: \"*It was clear to me that BHP, despite looking for a partner for at least two years, had been unable to find another partner interested in the project*.\"484 This was confirmed by Mr. Skrzeczynski, who explained that \"[t]*his was a speculative and risky exploration project, and Mincor faced no serious competition at the time to win it*.\"485\n\nMoore, \u00b6 12.\n\nMoore, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13.\n\nSkrzeczynski, \u00b6 20.\n\n478.\n\nIt is further common ground that the Option Agreement entered into by BHP and Mincor in April 2000 contained the following conditions precedent:\n\n\"*5.1.1 BHP and the BDA have executed a binding and unconditional Addendum to the CHJV, which provides for:*\n\n*a) clarification of BHP's joint venture partner as the GOB acting through its agent the BDA;*\n\n*b) clarification of BHP's financing commitment to the BDA for construction capital and establishment of a repayment schedule, which is satisfactory to each of Mincor and BHP and which commitment will be accepted by Mincor;*\n\n*c] confirmation that BHP earned its 75% interest in the joint venture on completion of Stage 2 and selection of 10 PLs.*\n\n*5.1.2 The GOB and BDA have signed a written acceptance of the Parties' proposals as outlined in this Option Agreement.*\n\n*5.1.3 The GOB and BDA have executed a Deed of Waiver in terms of which they waive any pre-emptive rights which may affect the transfer of interests between BHP and Mincor as required by the Alliance Agreement.*\n\n*5.1.4 BHP has received all regulatory, governmental or other approvals, notices or consents required or desirable to allow BHP to grant the rights to Mincor granted under the Alliance Agreement and for the Parties to fulfil their obligations contemplated under that Agreement.*\"486\n\n**Exhibit CE-12**, Article 5.1.\n\n479.\n\nIn its Draft Decision, the Tribunal found that Mincor's insistence on the conclusion of an addendum to the CHEJVA as a condition for becoming involved in the Reko Diq project does not constitute evidence that Claimant was aware of any illegal conduct in the context of concluding the CHEJVA but considered it as a reaction to the uncertainties that had surfaced in 1999 as to whether the GOB had validly become a party to the CHEJVA pursuant to the applicable internal laws of the GOB in 1993.487 The Tribunal also found that while the 2000 Addendum was again signed by the Chairman of the BDA (as was the CHEJVA), this time the Governor of Balochistan had explicitly \"*authorize*[d] *Chairman, Balochistan Development Authority to sign Addendum No. 1 to the* [CHEJVA] \u2026 *on behalf of the Government of Balochistan*.\"488\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 683, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 686.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 741 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(an)**, p. 53, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 744.\n\n480.\n\nIt is now undisputed that an addendum to the CHEJVA was under negotiation between BHP and the GOB since 1998 and that, while several communications were exchanged with various departments of the GOB until early 2000, in fact, no further changes were made to the draft presented by BHP in July 1998 until it was signed by BHP and the Chairman of the BDA in March 2000.489\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CE-504** *to* **Exhibit CE-02**. *See also* Pierce, \u00b6 46 *and* Skrzeczynski, \u00b6 14.\n\n481.\n\nRespondent claims that the following bribes were paid \"*to secure the Addendum*\":490\n\ni. PAK Rs. 40,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Tahir in November 1999 \"*to prevent Mr Tahir from being a hurdle in the Addendum process*,\" specifically to prevent him from informing the Planning & Development Department of outstanding vettings by the Law and Finance Departments;\n\nii. PAK Rs. 20,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Ali Juma, Section Officer at the Law Department, in December 1999 \"*to ensure quick vetting of the Addendum*\" by the Law Department despite the objections that it had previously raised in August 1999 and maintained in October 1999;\n\niii. PAK Rs. 2,000,000 by Mr. Iqbal \u2013 out of funds provided by Mr. Arndt \u2013 to the new Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Burq in February/March 2000 \"*to sign the Addendum without requiring further approvals\"* from the Law and Finance Departments, which, according to Respondent, were still outstanding at the time;\n\niv. PAK Rs. 500,000 by Mr. Burq to Mr. Farooq \u2013 out of the amount paid to Mr. Burq \u2013 in February/March 2000 \"*to reward Mr Farooq for ensuring execution of the Addendum*\" and pushing it through without following the proper procedures;\n\nv. \"*periodic payments to Mr Farooq*\" to ensure, together with the payment of PAK Rs. 500,000, that Mr. Farooq \"*did TCC's bidding, including by taking steps to ensure the execution of Addendum*\";\n\nvi. An unknown amount by Mr. Lakhani / Mr. Arndt to Governor Mengal in December 1999 \"*to sign the letter authorizing the Chairman of the BDA to sign the Addendum on behalf of the GOB*.\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 133.\n\n482.\n\nEven though the final two allegations, which Respondent has raised in its Reply, are not included in its Post-Hearing Brief, it is not entirely clear whether Respondent has abandoned these. Therefore, the Tribunal will also address these allegations in the following reasoning.\n\n483.\n\nIn support of its allegations, Respondent has presented witness testimony from Mr. Farooq, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Tahir, which will be addressed in further detail below.\n\n484.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the alleged bribes achieved the following results: (i) \"*fundamentally rewriting key terms of the CHEJVA in BHP's favour through the Addendum*\"; and (ii) \"*obtaining execution of the Addendum despite failing to follow due process.*\"491 As for the first alleged result, Respondent primarily invokes a \"*radical*\" change of the financing arragenments that had been agreed under the CHEJVA. In addition, it argues that the amendment to clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA resulted in a \"*substantive change in favour of BHP*\" regarding the requirements for earning its 75% interest in the CHEJVA.\" By contrast, Respondent describes the amendments introduced by the Addendum to the GOB's benefit as \"*insignificant*.\"492\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 49-62. *See also* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 136-166.\n\n485.\n\nAs for the second alleged result, Respondent claims that the following \"*anomalies in the documentary record*\" corroborate the witness evidence of the alleged bribes: (i) \"*a number of bribes were paid by or on behalf of BHP to ensure both buy-in by key decision-makers and swift passage through the Balochistan bureaucracy*\"; (ii) the objections raised by the Law Department in 1999 were not acted upon and its vetting obtained within three days in December 1999 was \"*irregular and fuelled by corruption*\"; and (iii) the objections raised by the Finance Department in 1999 and again in 2000 were ignored and it was effectively \"*side-lined*\" because its final comments were never sought.493\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 64; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-187.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the allegations of illegitimate payments set out above have been categorically rejected by Claimant and those of its witnesses that were involved in project at the time when the 2000 Addendum was negotiated and/or executed, specifically by Mr. Pierce, Mr. Skrzeczynski, Mr. Williams, Mr. Moore and Mr. Hargreaves (albeit the latter admitted during the hearing that he was not directly involved at the time). In order to evaluate the direct evidence of corruption presented by Respondent, *i.e*., the witness testimony from Mr. Farooq, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Tahir, the Tribunal will assess all circumstances of the case based on the contemporaneous documents in the record and also take into account the oral testimony of the witnesses from both sides, who were confronted with the opposing allegations and testimony of the other side during the hearing.\n\n487.\n\nIn that regard, the Tribunal will also analyze what Respondent has described as the \"*results*\" of the alleged bribes, *i.e*., whether the 2000 Addendum indeed introduced significant changes into the CHEJVA that were largely to the benefit of BHP and/or to the detriment of the GOB and whether the manner in which the objections raised by the Law and Finance Departments were dealt with amounts to a failure to follow due process. Claimant denies both aspects of Respondent's arguments.\n\n**(a) The Changes to the CHEJVA Introduced by the 2000 Addendum**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has reviewed the terms of the CHEJVA and those of the 2000 Addendum, in particular in the context of the financing arrangements for exploration and mining activities. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that in particular Article 9 of the Addendum by which Clauses 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6 of the CHEJVA were replaced, included significant changes to the financing terms agreed under the CHEJVA. First, the new Clause 12.4.1 (second sentence) by which the GOB's initial option under the CHEJVA \"*not to contribute to the costs of such development* [activities and operations within a Mining Area] \u2026 *until such time as Minerals are produced from the Mining Area*\" was limited under the Addendum to \"*the Equity Portion of the capital costs of the first Mine Development in the Exploration Area*.\"494\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 12.4 (second sentence) *to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 9 (new Clause 12.4.1 (second sentence)).\n\n489.\n\nSecond, the new Clause 12.4.2 introduced the concept of project financing into the CHEJVA, providing that BHP was to \"*use its best endeavours to arrange*\" such project financing for the first Mine Development and, more importantly, that \"[e]*ach Participating Party shall be liable for the interest on, and repayment of, such financing from its portion of gross revenues, in proportion to its Participating Interest*.\" In addition, each Participating Party was to \"*provide on a several basis in proportion to their respective Participating Interests any completion guarantees required by lenders with respect to such project financing*.\"495 As the option for the GOB not to contribute to the development costs until the mine became operational related only to the equity portion, it could not opt out of carrying upfront the costs for the debt portion (including for the provision of completion guarantees) on terms that were to be arranged by BHP \"*in consultation with the GOB.*\"\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 9 (new Clause 12.4.2).\n\n490.\n\nA third significant change concerned the terms on which the GOB was to repay its debt to BHP in case it elected not to contribute to development costs upfront (to the extent this was still permitted under the new Clause 12.4.1). Initially, Clause 12.5 of the CHEJVA provided that repayment was to be made \"*by means of fully allocating fifty percent (50%) of the BDA's entitlement to gross revenues derived from the Mining Venture*.\"496 By contrast, the new Clause 12.5.2(b) provided that the percentage of gross revenues to be allocated to repayment was to be determined \"*within 15 days after the date when the GOB elects not to contribute to the Equity Portion of the capital cost of the first Mine Development*\" either by mutual agreement between BHP and the GOB or, failing such agreement, pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism provided in the CHEJVA, and at \"*a percentage which ensures that the Equity Debt is repaid within 8 years after commencement of commercial production from the Joint Venture Area*.\"497 While Claimant argues that this provision reflected a compromise because the GOB did not accept BHP's initial request that 100% of the gross revenues be allocated to repayment and adds that the percentage could also be fixed at below 50%,498 the Tribunal is not convinced by these arguments. Claimant itself has emphasized the need for a change of the initial provision by noting that on the model used by BHP in 1998, even the allocation of 100% of gross revenues to repayment would result in a repayment period of over 24 years.499 Therefore, an allocation of less than 100% - and certainly of less than the initially foreseen 50% - would have been possible only if the estimated grade of ore which BHP had identified and on which it had based its model would significantly improve.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 12.5.\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 9 (new Clause 12.5.2(b)).\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 375-376.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 375 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-636**. *See also* Pierce, \u00b6 70.\n\n491.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Claimant also makes reference to certain obligations of the GOB under the CHJEVA to provide services at its own expense, which were eliminated under the Addendum. However, Mr. Pierce confirmed during the hearing these \"*were certainly minor when you compare them in context with the financing arrangements.*\"500\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2000 lines 17-18 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 5.7.2, 7.2(c) *and* 7.2(f). *See also* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 379.\n\n492.\n\nApart from the financing terms, Respondent also makes reference to Article 2.4 of the Addendum by which the parties to the Addendum agreed, most importantly, to \"*accept the work performed by GOB, BDA or BHPM up until the date of this agreement as valid performance under the Agreement.*\"501 The Tribunal agrees that while on its face this provision applied equally to both joint venture partners, BHP as the party performing the majority of the work under the CHEJVA was naturally the main benefitting party in that context.\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 2.4.\n\n493.\n\nRespondent further claims that Article 5 of the Addendum, by which Clause 3.2 providing for the requirements for BHP to earn its 75% interest under the CHEJVA was amended, eliminated the requirement to complete a feasibility study \u2013 if resolved by the Operating Committee that one be completed.502 Respondent also emphasizes that this change was introduced two months after the six-year deadline for completing the requirements of Clause 3.2 had already expired, and argues that there was \"*absolute no reason*\" for the GOB to allow BHP to benefit from this restrospective change to the CHEJVA rather than to enter into a new deal with Mincor.503\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 3.2 *to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 5.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 143.\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Claimant disputes that it was ever intended under the CHEJVA that BHP was to complete a feasibility study before earning its 75% interest.504 In the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to reach a definite conclusion on this issue. In any event, as confirmed by Mr. Pierce during the hearing, the new wording, which created a separate sentence for the feasibility study, made it clear that it was not (or no longer) a requirement for earning BHP's 75% interest.505 Consequently, any ambiguity that may have existed before was now eliminated, which was to the benefit of BHP.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 370; Pierce, \u00b6 105.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 2011 lines 2-22.\n\n495.\n\nFinally, Respondent also invokes a change made to Clause 9.3 of the CHEJVA and claims that the scope of activities to which the GOB was obliged to contribute was thereby increased.506 Clause 9.3 originally provided that the BDA was not obliged to contribute \"*to any Joint Venture Expenditure required in association with the Exploration Programme*\" but, upon completion of this Programme, would have to contribute \"*to all further Joint Venture Expenditure*\" in proportion to its 25% interest.507 Article 8.1 of the Addendum replaced this provision and provided that the GOB was not be obliged to contribute \"*to any costs of exploration, pre-feasibility studies or feasibility studies over any part of the area comprised in the Exploration Area which is not the subject of a Mining Venture established in accordance with Clause 11.7*,\" but, upon establishment of such Mining Venture, would have to contribute \"*to all further Joint Venture Expenditure in respect of any Mining Area*\" in proportion to its 25% interest.508\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 144-147.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 9.3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 8.1.\n\n496.\n\nWhile Respondent claims that through this change, the GOB became obliged to contribute to all exploration costs in any area which was subject of a \"*Mining Venture*,\" including the costs for the most detailed exploration works such as a Feasibility Study, Claimant argues that, to the contrary, the new provision \"*reinforce*[d] *the original bargain\"* by clarifying that the GOB was not obliged to contribute to any exploration costs where BHP had conducted such activities but decided not to establish a Mining Venture.509 This understanding was also confirmed by Mr. Pierce.510\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 372-373.\n\nPierce, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\n497.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the major difference between the two provisions relates to the event as of which the BDA or GOB would be required to contribute \"*to all further Joint Venture Expenditure*.\" Under the CHEJVA, the triggering event was the completion of the Exploration Programme, *i.e*., the completion of Stage One through Stage Four activities as set out in Schedule A. Under the 2000 Addendum, the relevant event was the establishment of a Mining Venture but the obligation to contribute was then limited to the Mining Area covered by that specific Mining Venture. The Tribunal notes that pursuant to the procedure set out in Article 11 of the CHEJVA, a Mining Venture was to be established only after a Feasibility Study, *i.e*., the final Stage Four activities of the Exploration Programme, had been completed and delivered to the Joint Venture partners and both sides had elected to participate in the development of the mineral deposit as a Mining Area.511\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 11.3.1, 11.3.2 and 11.7.\n\n498.\n\nWhile Respondent argues that Clause 11.4.1 of the CHEJVA, which allowed BHP to proceed on its own if the GOB decided not to participate, put BHP in control whether a mining development would proceed, it does not claim that this right was introduced through the 2000 Addendum but rather describes the reference made to that right in Article 7 as a \"*clarification*\" and a \"*reminder to the GoB*.\"512 In addition, the Tribunal understands that if BHP decided to pursue mining development without the participation of the GOB, there would not have been a Mining Venture in respect of that specific deposit(s) and thus no obligation to contribute would have arisen on the part of the GOB under the new Article 8.1 of the 2000 Addendum. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that under Article 8.1, the GOB could have been obliged to contribute to the substantial costs of a Feasibility Study, given that a Mining Venture was to be established only upon completion of that Study for the specific Mining Area and the obligation to contribute was limited to further expenditures within that Mining Area.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 147.\n\n499.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the Addendum introduced several changes into the CHEJVA that were favorable to BHP and some of them, in particular those relating to the financing terms, were unfavorable to the GOB. The Tribunal also recognizes that the change or clarification to Clause 3.2 was made retroactively, *i.e*., after the six-year period had expired. However, this does not yet mean that the Addendum was necessarily procured by corruption. To the contrary, it appears to the Tribunal that there may have been entirely legitimate considerations on the basis of which the GOB agreed to the amended terms, bearing in mind that these were one of the conditions precedent agreed between BHP and Mincor.\n\n500.\n\nRespondent argues that it was not in the interest of the GOB that Mincor, which it described as \"*a mining minnow and novice compared to BHP*,\" would be introduced into the project with the ultimate view to replace BHP as a party to the CHEJVA.513 However, the Tribunal recalls that BHP had decided already in 1998 that the project did not meet its internal financial criteria and therefore no longer allocated significant funds to the project. It is undisputed that BHP was under no contractual obligation to develop the project but could have abandoned the project if it was not possible to farm out its interest to a third party.514 Mincor, on the other hand, was eager to develop the project and Respondent also does not dispute that it was the only seriously interested party at the time. In the words of Mr. Skrzeczynski:\n\n\"*We made clear to the GOB that BHP was not going to continue doing more work at Reko Diq, and if work was to continue another party would have to do it. Those deposits did not meet BHP's hurdle rates at the time. We were not aware of any other companies who were interested in doing the work necessary to take the project further at the time. Mincor was the only option for the project to continue, which is what the GOB wanted at the time. So it made sense that the GOB would, for entirely legitimate reasons, want to support the Mincor farmout by signing conventional documents that any investor would expect to get before investing*.\"515\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 233.\n\n*Cf*. Skrzeczynski, \u00b6 18; Williams, \u00b6 10.\n\nSkrzeczynski, \u00b6 22.\n\n501.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Moore, the founder of Mincor, explained the reasons why he considered Mincor to be \"*a better partner for the GOB than BHP was at that time*\" as follows:\n\n\"*Mincor also had excellent credentials. As the CEO of Mincor, I had a background in geology and nearly 20 years of experience with mining projects around the world at Shell/Billiton and Iscor. I also had direct hands-on experience in porphyry copper systems, and the importance of this to the people who managed BHP's Reko Diq project, who were primarily geologists, should not be under-stated. Mincor offered a small startup's flexibility and willingness to take risks, strong technical credentials, known and trusted individuals who already had a good knowledge of the Reko Diq Project, and the added heft of a major mining company as controlling shareholder. For all of these reasons, Mincor was also a better partner for the GOB than BHP was at that time*.\"516\n\nMoore, \u00b6 61.\n\n502.\n\nConsequently, it may well be that in the interest of taking the project forward, the GOB was ready to accept the changes introduced by the Addendum without being incentivized by illegitimate payments. In addition, the Tribunal notes that what it has determined above is that the financing terms under the Addendum included significant changes compared to those under the CHEJVA. However, this does not entail a finding that those changes were not reasonable and aimed at reflecting industry practice and thus making the project bankable \u2013 in particular, taking into account that the only interested party was a junior mining company that would be not be able to raise sufficient equity to finance the entire project on its own.\n\n503.\n\nFor example, Mr. Pierce explained that the eight-year repayment period for the GOB's debt to its joint venture partner remains, to his knowledge, international financing standard.517 He further testified that when first studying the CHEJVA, he was \"*struck by the generous terms of the CHEJVA in favor of the GOB*,\" specifically by the \"*25% free carried interest through the initial exploration program*\" which he considered \"*significantly higher than the industrial norm*.\"518 Consequently, BHP stated as early as in a letter dated 30 September 1996 to the BDA that one of the items to be addressed in an addendum to the CHEJVA would be to \"[b]*ring the financing clause up to date by putting a more realistic interest rate to reflect what it would cost BHP to provide a loan to BDA, and to have it repaid out of BDA's share of revenues*.\"519\n\nPierce, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 41.\n\n**Exhibit CE-495**, p. 2.\n\n504.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the GOB's acceptance of the terms of the Addendum can be explained only by inferring the making of an illegitimate payment.\n\n**(b) The Process Leading Up to the Execution of the 2000 Addendum**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal has reviewed the process leading up to the execution of the 2000 Addendum, which, according to Respondent, failed to follow due process. In this regard, Respondent refers in particular to: (i) the objections to the Addendum raised by the Law Department, which it \"*abruptly and without explanation abandoned*\" at the end of December 1999 even though its concerns had not been addressed;520 and (ii) the objections raised by the Finance Department, which it maintained even after the Addendum had already been signed but which were \"*ignored despite their importance for the Province of Balochistan*.\"521\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 182.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 185.\n\n**(i) The Events Surrounding the Vetting by the Law Department**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nAs to the objections raised by the Law Department, Respondent contends that these were at first raised verbally but \"*purposefully omitted*\" in a Summary for the Chief Minister dated 20 May 1999 that was prepared by the BDA. At the bottom of the Summary, the Chief Secretary requested that a committee be set up to reach final agreement with BHP, which would include, *inter alia*, the Secretary of Law.522 As Respondent itself submits, the Secretary of Law participated in a meeting held on 18 June 1999 with various officials of the BDA to discuss the Addendum \"*in detail*.\"523\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 170, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 5-8.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 171, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 10.\n\n507.\n\nIt is undisputed that in its letter of 21 August 1999, the Law Department raised various objections to the draft addendum, which it maintained in a letter of 18 October 1999.524 These objections were subject to discussions between BHP, the BDA and the GOB. In its letter dated 5 July 1999 (which was apparently rather written in September 1999), BHP addressed the objections raised by the Law Department and also attached an opinion which it had obtained specifically with regard to these objections from its external legal counsel, Kabraji & Talibuddin.525 In return and after the Law Department stated that it still \"*adhere*[d] *to its earlier advice*,\"526 the BDA sought an opinion on the objections and the opinion of BHP's counsel from its own external counsel, Shakil Law Firm, which was provided in November 1999.527 Following a meeting that was apparently held, *inter alia*, between the Chief Executive of BHP and the Governor of Balochistan on 8 December 1999,528 whose further participants and contents are in dispute between the Parties, on 24 December 1999, the Governor signed the letter by which the Chairman of the BDA was authorized to sign the Addendum.529 In his letter of 28 December 1999 by which the Chairman re-submitted the Addendum for vetting to the Secretary of Law, he noted that the Governor had signed the authorization letter upon request from the Planning and Development Department and also referred to a meeting held between the Chief Executive of BHP and the Secretary of Law on 3 December 1999.530 While Respondent considers the latter \"*clearly an unusual step*,\"531 it does not raise any allegation of corruption with regard to this meeting. Three days later, on 31 December 1999, the Law Department returned the Addendum \"*duly vetted*\" to the BDA.532\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 33-34, 36.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 11-12, 15-17.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 36.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 46-48.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 51.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 52-53.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 54.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 182.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 55.\n\n508.\n\nRespondent claims that: (i) a payment in an unknown amount was made by either Mr. Lakhani or Mr. Arndt to the Governor during the meeting held in December 1999 so that he would sign the authorization letter; and (ii) a payment of PAK Rs. 20,000 was made by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Juma to sign the letter of 31 December 1999 despite the previously raised objections.\n\n**The Alleged Payment to the Governor of Balochistan**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nIn support of the first allegation, Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Farooq, who stated in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*Part way through the meeting, the Chairman and I were asked to leave. The meeting continued for another 15 or 20 minutes. After the meeting ended, on the way back to the BDA's offices, Mr Arndt told me that* 'this man knows how to do business' *and that the work will get done. Mr Lakhani followed me back to my office. When I was alone with Mr Lakhani, he told me in frustration that he had paid out so much money on this project so far, about US$ 5 million, and that he had had to pay more money to the Governor*.\"533\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 21 lit. g.\n\n510.\n\nDuring the hearing, it became clear that Mr. Farooq's testimony was not that Mr. Lakhani had said that he *had already* paid any amount to the Governor but rather that he *would* have to pay \"*more money to the Governor*\" after having paid USD 5 million to a person or persons the identity of whom was not known to Mr. Farooq. He also clarified that he did not have any personal knowledge of any bribes being paid or offered to the Governor but only testified about a statement allegedly made by Mr. Lakhani and the impression he had from Mr. Arndt's alleged statement that \"*this man knows how to do business*.\"534 When specifically asked whether he personally accused the Governor of accepting a bribe to sign the Addendum, Mr. Farooq stated:\n\n\"*I am not saying that, that he has taken bribe. Mr. Lakhani \u2026 said that he had to give the money. And that's what I have said in my statement. \u2026 I'm not saying that. It is just Chris Arndt said to me after coming out of the meeting, saying that Governor is this and that. He knows how to do business. He can do this.*\n\n*And he gave us the impression, Chris Arndt, that the Governor takes the money as well. This is where we got the impression from, and we became aware that the Governor was also asking for the money.*\"535\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 714 line 9 to p. 722 line 17.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 721 line 20 to p. 722 line 17.\n\n511.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers it doubtful that this testimony, even if taken at face value, could be sufficient to establish an illegitimate payment made by BHP to the Governor of Balochistan, Claimant also denies that Mr. Lakhani and Mr. Arndt were even present during the relevant meeting with the Governor. As for Mr. Lakhani, Claimant submits that \"*Mr. Lakhani was never associated with BHP and did not become associated with TCC until late 2000*.\"536 In this regard, Claimant relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Moore and Mr. Hargreaves, who both replied to Mr. Farooq's written testimony. Mr. Moore stated:\n\n\"*Muslim* [Lakhani] *first became interested in the Project only in late 2000, after Tim Hargreaves introduced him as a possible seed investor. It was only in May 2001 that I invited him to join the company in an operational role and appointed him TCC's Representative in Pakistan. So it is simply impossible that Muslim paid $5 million \u2013 or any amount \u2013 in bribes in or before 1999, prior to his involvement in the Project*.\"537\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 300; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 70.\n\nMoore, \u00b6 52.\n\n512.\n\nMr. Hargreaves testified in this regard:\n\n\"*I know for a fact that Mr. Lakhani had no involvement until later. In November 2000, while I was working in Egypt, Geoff Allen, the ex-Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan who was assisting David Moore of Mincor first contacted me about the opportunity to invest in TCC and asked me about other potential investors who might be interested. In turn, I introduced the investment proposal to Mr. Lakhani and another investor both of whom were also working in Egypt at the time. To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Lakhani did not even know of Reko Diq before that contact and certainly had no role or financial interest in it. The investment commitments were made in December 2000 and shares issued in January 2001 when Mr. Lakhani became a TCC investor after which I introduced him to David Moore some time during the first half of 2001*.\"538\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 19.\n\n513.\n\nWhen asked during the hearing when he had first come across Mr. Lakhani, Mr. Moore confirmed that \"*it must have been September, October, November, of 2000*.\" He further confirmed Mr. Hargreaves' testimony by stating that \"*I think it was Tim Hargreaves who put forward his name because I was looking for seed finance*.\"539 In response to the question whether it was possible that Mr. Lakhani already had an interest and association with the project beforehand of which Mr. Moore was not aware, he answered:\n\n\"*It seems utterly incredible to me because I met Muslim in May 2001, April or May. We sat and talked it through. We talked through the Project, what we were going to do, what our plans were. I asked him about his background, what his personal life was. At no stage during any of that time did he mention that he had ever had any involvement in the Reko Diq Project*.\"540\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2289 lines 11-15.\n\nTranscript (day 9), p. 2295 lines 4-11.\n\n514.\n\nMr. Hargreaves was not questioned during the hearing about his testimony regarding Mr. Lakhani. On that basis, the Tribunal considers that Respondent has failed to establish that Mr. Lakhani was involved in the Reko Diq project in December 1999 and, specifically, that he participated in the meeting with the Governor held on 8 December 1999 and that he made a statement to Mr. Farooq that he had paid bribes for the project and that he would have to pay more money to the Governor to sign the authorization letter for the Addendum.\n\n515.\n\nAs for Mr. Arndt, who is also implicated in Mr. Farooq's statement, the Tribunal is is satisfied that he was not involved in the project and not participating in meetings on behalf of BHP in December 1999. His alleged role will be addressed in further detail below. In any event, the Tribunal does not consider it established that any illegitimate payment was made to the Governor to authorize the signing of the Addendum.\n\n**The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 20,000 to Mr. Juma**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nIn support of its second allegation, *i.e*., a payment of PAK Rs. 20,000 made by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Juma at the Law Department, Respondent again relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, who stated in second witness statement:\n\n\"*A few days after the Governor signed the authorisation letter, I met (on 28 December 1999) with the Secretary of Law to provide him with a note from the Chairman of the BDA that again requested Law Department vetting of the 2000 Addendum. I asked him to vet the agreement and, after some discussion of the Law Department's objections, he wrote the comment on the bottom of the note for his staff to* 'kindly do the needful'*. Over the next day or so I pursued the matter with the Section Officer, Ali Juma, who was reluctant to provide vetting in light of the observations previously raised, but who was in a difficult position given the comment of the Secretary of Law. I paid Mr Juma a small amount, around Rs. 20,000, in his office, which he was demanding to process the matter quickly. Mr Juma confirmed the Law Department's vetting of the 2000 Addendum on 31 December 1999.*\"541\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 21 lit. h.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while Respondent alleges that \"*the Secretary of Law stood by his existing objections*\" when Mr. Farooq came to see him on 28 December 1999 and that \"*he was convinced by whatever Mr. Farooq said to him, and presumably by what was said to him during his meeting with BHP's CEO a few weeks earlier, to instruct his staff to* 'kindly do the needful',\" neither Respondent nor Mr. Farooq raise any specific allegation that a bribe was paid to the Secretary of Law himself. The allegation rather relates to Mr. Juma, who was instructed by his superior to vet the Addendum and, on Mr. Farooq's testimony, demanded payment in order \"*to proceed the matter quickly.*\" Even if established, this payment did thus not contribute to obtaining a right or benefit related to the investment, given that the Secretary of Law had already made the decision that the Addendum was to obtain the vetting by the Law Department.\n\n518.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal further notes that neither Respondent nor Mr. Farooq state that the alleged payment was made on instruction or with knowledge of BHP. While Mr. Iqbal testifies that when he spoke with Mr. Farooq about the vetting, Mr. Farooq told him that \"*the Law Department* 'just vetted it' *due to its efforts*,\"542 this would not establish that the payment itself occurred with knowledge of BHP \u2013 regardless of whether knowledge of Mr. Iqbal could be attributed to BHP.\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 21.\n\n519.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by Respondent's allegation that the vetting obtained from the Law Department was \"*irregular and fuelled by corruption.*\"543\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 64.\n\n**(ii) The Events Surrounding the (Lack of) Vetting by the Finance Department**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nAs to the objections raised by the Finance Department, Respondent again contends that these were initially raised in a verbal manner but \"*purposefully omitted*\" in a Summary to the Chief Minister dated 20 May 1999.544 Respondent further notes that, contrary to an instruction from the Chief Secretary on the same Summary, the Financial Secretary was not present during the meeting held on 18 June 1999 and claims that the Secretary was \"*purposefully excluded*\" by Mr. Farooq and the Development Department given the Finance Department's strong objections to the draft addendum.545\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 170, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an),** pp. 5-8.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 171, *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 21 lit. b.\n\n521.\n\nIt is undisputed that in its letter of 12 October 1999, the Finance Department raised objections to the draft addendum.546 It is further undisputed that the final approval of this Department to the Addendum was never obtained. The objections raised by the Finance Department related to: (i) the mode and rate of repayment of the finance debt and related interest payments from the gross revenues under the new clause 12.5.1, which the Finance Department considered unclear; and (ii) the fact that it was left open in the new clause 12.5.2(b) which percentage of the GOB's gross revenues would be allocated to repayment of equity debt and that the 8-year repayment period, which could mean that \"*the GOB/BDA may have to allocate all of its gross revenue towards debt repayment thereby getting noting in monitory* [sic] *terms during initial 8 years of the commencement of the project*.\" The Finance Department therefore recommended \"*to settle this issue in such a way that the restriction of 8 years is withdrawn.*\"547\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 28.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 28.\n\n522.\n\nIn its response letter of 11 November 1999, BHP explained, *inter alia*, that it was not possible at that point to specify the mode and rate of repayment of finance debt because that would be known only once the debt would actually be incurred. As to the main objection regarding the 8-year repayment period, BHP stated that this was required by international financing guidelines and emphasized that \"*the tonnage and grade of current geological resource at Reko Diq is not commercially viable for going into mining phase*,\" which is why it had been agreed that the exact percentage would be left open until that stage was reached.548\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 30.\n\n523.\n\nIt is apparent from the record that the explanations provided by BHP did not solve the issue for the Finance Department. Following its inquiry of 29 December 1999 as to the opinion of the BDA on BHP's views,549 Mr. Habibullah Baloch of the BDA wrote to the Finance Department on 16 February 2000 that the arrangement objected to by the Finance Department \"*has already* [been] *agreed with BHP*\" and added that \"*the addendum has been vetted by the Law Department and approved by the Government and the Chairman BDA has been authorized by the Government to sign the addendum on behalf of the Government.*\"550 Following a further inquiry from the Finance Department on 24 March 2000 in which it requested that \"*a summary in this connection may please be moved to get final approval of the Hon'able Governor of Balochistan*,\"551 Mr. Baloch informed it on 14 April 2000 that \"*the addendum has already been signed by BDA and sent to BHP after its vetting by Law Department and approval by the Hon'ble Governor Balochistan*.\"552 Nevertheless, the Finance Department reiterated its objections to clauses 12.5.1 and 12.5.2(b) of the Addendum, in particular to the 8-year repayment period, in a letter dated 9 May 2000 and added that \"*the interest of the Government of Balochistan must be protected while deciding introduction of third party MINCOR in pursuance of Clause 14.3 of addendum to the Joint Venture Agreement*.\"553 It is thus clear from the record that the Finance Department did not approve the financial terms provided in the Addendum.\n\n**Exhibit RE-249**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 56.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 58.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 59.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(an)**, p. 60.\n\n524.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Rule 8(2) of the 1976 Business Rules provides:\n\n\"*If the various Departments concerned cannot reach agreement and the Minister after consultation with other Ministers concerned desires to press the case, the case shall be submitted to the Chief Minister or, with the Chief Minister's approval, to the Cabinet*.\n\n*Provided that where the Chief Minister is the Minister-in-Charge of the department, the final views of the other departments shall be obtained before the case is submitted*.\"554\n\n**Exhibit RE-20**, Rule 8(2).\n\n525.\n\nRule 46 of the 1976 Business Rules further provides:\n\n\"*On Finance Department's refusal to accord concurrence to any case, the department may submit such case to the Chief Minister for decision*.\"555\n\n**Exhibit RE-20**, Rule 46.\n\n526.\n\nAs martial law had been imposed in October 1999, there was no chief minister at the time and the responsible official was thus the Governor of Balochistan.556 While it is in dispute between the Parties whether the provisions of the 1976 Business Rules were complied with in respect of the involvement of the Finance Department, the Tribunal considers that it does not need to reach a decision on this issue. Even if there was a violation of these internal laws on the part of the BDA, this does not establish that such violation must be the result of corruption.\n\n*Cf*. Transcript (Day 1), p. 253 lines 6-11; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69. *See also* Draft Decision, \u00b6 742.\n\n527.\n\nIn this context, Respondent raises the allegation that: (i) Mr. Tahir was paid PAK Rs. 40,000 by Mr. Farooq in November 1999 to prevent him from informing the Planning & Development Department that two major vettings by the Law and Finance Departments had not been obtained; and (ii) Mr. Burq was paid PAK Rs. 2,000,000 by Mr. Iqbal in February/March 2000 to sign the Addendum despite outstanding approvals from the Law and Finance Departments.557 In addition, Respondent claims that Mr. Farooq was paid PAK Rs. 500,000 by Mr. Burq (out of the amount he had received from Mr. Iqbal) and received \"*periodic payments*\" from Mr. Iqbal.558\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 43 and 45.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 133 lit. b; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47.\n\n**The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 40,000 to Mr. Tahir**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nIn support of its first allegation regarding the alleged payment to Mr. Tahir, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of both Mr. Tahir and Mr. Farooq. In this regard, Mr. Tahir stated in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*Considerable pressure was put on the BDA by BHP to get the Addendum executed. The role of the BDA in this process had been to get the draft Addendum vetted by the Law and Finance Departments. Mr Muhammad Farooq was the driving force at the BDA behind the approval of the Addendum. Mr Farooq gave me PAK Rs. 40,000, which he said had come from BHP. He was also very anxious to get the Addendum signed. Following his payment to me of PAK Rs. 40,000, I assumed that Mr Farooq was being paid by BHP to get the Addendum signed*.\"559\n\nTahir I, \u00b6 7.\n\n529.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Tahir added:\n\n\"*Mr Farooq paid me this money in a meeting in his office at around the time that Mr Farooq wrote to the Additional Chief Secretary (Dev.) requesting early approval of the Addendum in November 1999. My salary in November 1999 was approximately PAK Rs. 14,000 to 15,000. If I had not been paid, I would have informed the GOB's Planning & Development Department that two major vettings (from the Law Department and the Finance Department) had not been properly obtained. This would have prevented or at least delayed signing of the Addendum in its current form*.\"560\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 16.\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Mr. Tahir initially testified in his first witness statement that both the Law and Finance \"*Departments never approved the Addendum*\" and that after the Governor had given \"*his approval to the BDA Chairman in December 1999*,\" Mr. Farooq did not agree with him that the Addendum should still be sent to the Law Department for vetting.561 In his second witness statement, however, Mr. Tahir changed his testimony and, referring to the three-day period between the request from the BDA on 28 December and the vetting by the Law Department on 31 December 1999, stated that in his experience, \"*this is not how the Law Department works.*\" He further stated that Mr. Farooq showed him the letter from the Law Department but did not explain to him how he had managed to achieve the vetting.562\n\nTahir I, \u00b6 6.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 14.\n\n531.\n\nEven if it were true that Mr. Tahir did not inform the Planning & Development Department of the two vettings that were still outstanding when it sent its summary to the Governor in early December 1999 requesting him to authorize the signing of the Addendum, Mr. Tahir himself testified that he did inform the Chairman of the BDA of the outstanding vettings (apparently notwithstanding the Law Department's letter of 31 December 1999) in early 2000:\n\n\"*When Mr Ameer Ali Burq came into office on 1 January 2000 as the new Chairman of the BDA, I briefed him on the Addendum. I told him that observations of the Finance and Law Departments remained outstanding. After a few days, Mr Farooq called me to reprimand me for speaking directly with the Chairman of the BDA and to remind me that he has already paid me to keep my mouth shut. When Chairman Burq agreed to sign the Addendum in March 2000 and I was asked by Mr Farooq and by Chairman Burq to sign as a witness, I therefore complied. I had already explained the process and issues to the best of my understanding to Chairman Burq and he still instructed me to witness the Addendum*.\"563\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 18.\n\n532.\n\nThis was also confirmed by Mr. Farooq who stated that \"*Mr Tahir briefed Mr Burq on the missing approvals, which angered me given Mr Tahir had been paid not to be an obstacle*.\"564 Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that even if it were established that a payment was made to Mr. Tahir in November 1999, such payment would have contributed to BHP's earning of a right or benefit related to its investment - given that Mr. Tahir nevertheless informed Mr. Burq of the (allegedly) outstanding vettings before the 2000 Addendum was signed.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 21 lit. i.\n\n533.\n\nIn any event, such payment would have come from Mr. Farooq rather than from BHP and Mr. Tahir only \"*assumed that Mr Farooq was being paid by BHP to get the Addendum signed*.\" As a result, such payment could not be attributed to BHP. This conclusion is confirmed by Mr. Farooq's testimony on this particular allegation. In his first witness statement, Mr. Farooq testified that after he had been paid by BHP \"*for facilitating the arrangement*\" with Mr. Burq in January 2000 (which will be addressed further below), he was told by Mr. Burq to get the Addendum signed as soon as possible. He added: \"*In order to do so, I remember using some of the money given to me by BHP to pay Mr. Tahir though I do not recall the precise amount*.\"565 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq corrected himself as follows: \"*I said in my first statement that I used money given to me by BHP to pay Mr Tahir. I now recall that I paid Mr Tahir out of my own pocket before I received payment of Rs. 500,000 from BHP. I needed to pay Mr Tahir up-front to get his cooperation.*\"566\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 8. *See also* Farooq I, \u00b6 28.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 21 lit. i (note 26).\n\n534.\n\nApart from the change in timing of the alleged payment (which would have been decisive regarding the possible impact it could have had on obtaining the Governor's authorization in December 1999), Mr. Farooq himself stated that he paid Mr. Tahir out of his own pocket, which would not render any such payment attributable to BHP.\n\n**The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 2,000,000 to Mr. Burq**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nAs noted above, Mr. Tahir informed the new Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Burq, in January 2000 that relevant approvals were still outstanding. Respondent submits that despite the authorization by the Governor, Mr. Burq was still concerned about the outstanding approvals and claims he was thus paid PAK Rs. 2,000,000 by Mr. Iqbal to sign the Addendum despite his concerns.567 In support of this allegation, Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46.\n\n536.\n\nIn his first witness statement, submitted by Respondent shortly after filing its Application, Mr. Farooq testified:\n\n\"*In January 2000, Ameer Ali Burq took over as Chairman of the BDA. During the early days of his Chairmanship, on my advice to Mr Iqbal, BHP paid to Mr Burq Rs. 2 million to ensure the Addendum was signed. This payment was made by Mr Iqbal in the office of the Chairman of the BDA in my presence. I was paid Rs. 500,000 for facilitating the arrangement. Mr Burq told me to get the Addendum signed as per BHP's requirements as soon as possible*.\"568\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 8.\n\n537.\n\nMr. Iqbal, whose witness statement was submitted by Respondent together with its Reply, described the alleged event as follows:\n\n\"*In around February/March 2000, Mr Arndt and I had a meeting with Mr Burq (Chairman of the BDA) and Mr Farooq to discuss the Addendum. Mr Arndt was angry at Mr Burq because he was refusing to sign the Addendum without it being cleared by the relevant departments. Mr Farooq took Mr Arndt to his office where they had a private discussion. Mr Arndt and I then returned to Karachi. Two days later, Mr Arndt gave me a briefcase that he said I should give to Mr Burq. Mr Arndt made a joke and told me the briefcase contained the Addendum. I went to the office of Mr Farooq first and then, with Mr Farooq, I went to the office of Mr Burq. I passed the briefcase to Mr Farooq who gave it to Mr Burq. The Chairman opened the briefcase and I saw that it contained money. The Chairman and Mr Farooq discussed in front of me how much money was in the briefcase, which was said to be 2,000,000 Rupees. It appeared that there had been a previous discussion about this sum of money, as this was what they were expecting. Mr Burq then said not to worry, that he would sign the Addendum, which he did soon after this meeting*.\"569\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 23.\n\n538.\n\nIn his second witness statement, which was also submitted together with Respondent's Reply, Mr. Farooq testified:\n\n\"*In a meeting that I attended in around February 2000 with Mr Arndt, Mr Iqbal and Mr Burq, Mr Burq said that he was not ready to sign the agreement as the process of approving the agreement had yet to be completed. After the meeting, Mr Arndt came to my office. He was furious with Mr Burq's position given the time, effort and money spent on the 2000 Addendum already. I told him not to worry and that he should give Mr Burq money. I negotiated the amount \u2013 Mr Burq first wanted AU$ 100,000 but we eventually agreed that he would be paid Rs. 2 million. A couple of days later, Mr Iqbal came to my office with a briefcase. I and Mr Iqbal went to the Chairman's office, where Mr Burq took and opened the briefcase and counted the number of bundles to satisfy himself that it was Rs. 2 million. He then instructed me to do what was needed to be done to get the 2000 Addendum signed. The 2000 Addendum was signed a few days later in my presence. I was given Rs. 500,000 by Mr Burq for my efforts.*\"570\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 lit. i.\n\n539.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Respondent and its witnesses mentioned for the first time in the Reply and accompanying (second) witness statements the role that the deceased Mr. Arndt allegedly played in the context of the alleged payments made to Mr. Burq in connection with the Addendum and the certification of BHP's 75% interest (which will be addressed further below). In its Rejoinder, Claimant further pointed out that Mr. Arndt had been employed by BHP only until August 1999 and was employed by TCC only in November 2003.571 In the following, there was an intense debate between the Parties as to the role of Mr. Arndt, if any, in the final phase of negotiations on the Addendum in early 2000.572\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 364.\n\nClaimant explained that Mr. Arndt died in April 2013. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 98.\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent described the involvement of Mr. Arndt as \"*a collateral issue which cannot detract from the evidence of bribery*,\" arguing that \"[e]*ven without mentioning Mr Arndt's role in these corruption events, Pakistan had direct evidence of Mr Iqbal (whose affiliation with BHP and authority to act on its behalf at that time is undisputed) paying the bribes, as well as from the negotiator, facilitator and one of the recipients of these bribes, Mr Farooq.*\"573 However, it has to be taken into account that, as from the submission of Respondent's Reply, Respondent and its witnesses have described Mr. Arndt as the person who negotiated and provided the funds for the alleged bribery payment to Mr. Burq.574 Mr. Farooq testified during the hearing that Mr. Arndt \"*was the main person\u2014the doer*\" and that he \"*used to decide this much money has to be given. He used to approve that, and Mr. Zafar used to do the delivery of money*.\"575 In light of this particular emphasis on the role of Mr. Arndt, the Tribunal considers it decisive in the evaluation of the evidence, in particular in assessing the credibility of the testimony given by Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq, whether Mr. Arndt's involvement has been established.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 342-343.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 183.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 771 lines 6-16.\n\n541.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Iqbal testified that when he joined BHP in September 1997, Mr. Arndt was the General Manager at the Reko Diq site. Mr. Iqbal further stated that in early 2000, he was told by Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Arndt that he could join Mincor, and in July 2000, he entered into an employment contract with TCC. With respect to Mr. Arndt, he testified:\n\n\"*At that time, the key individuals dealing with the project were Mr Schloderer (BHP, who was seconded to TCC at around the time that I joined), Bob Skrezeczynski (Commercial Manager at BHP Australia), David Moore (Mincor/TCC) and Mr Arndt (BHP, who joined TCC at around the time that I joined). I reported to Mr Arndt, who was the General Manager, both before and after I joined TCC.*\"576\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 7.\n\n542.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Iqbal corrected his testimony that Mr. Arndt had joined TCC \"*at around*\" the same time he joined to \"*after*\" that time.577 When asked to respond to Claimant's submission that Mr. Arndt had been retrenched in August 1999 and was therefore not involved in the Project until 2003, Mr. Iqbal testified:\n\n\"*A. In fact, BHP retrenched all of its employees, including myself, in phases and some of the employees were retrenched in early 1999. I was retrenched in May 1999, and then I was asked to continue work without any formal contract, and I think a similar position is with Chris.*\n\n*Q. And so, what dealings did you have with him after you were retrenched and he was retrenched?*\n\n*A. There was minimum office work after the work was closed down, and my interaction with Chris mainly were for the approval of the Addendum and approval for the 75 percent interest and the--and for the Deed of Waiver \u2013 two or three big tasks. That was my main engagement with him on these matters.*\n\n*Q. And why was he involved in those matters?*\n\n*A. I think that there was no other senior person of BHP there, and I was a junior accountant, I only had just started my career, and Chris was the only person who has experience of contract negotiation and dealing with government officials, so that's why he remained there for these matters.*\n\n*Q. And when did he stop being involved?*\n\n*A. He stopped working with us for a period of time when Mincor took over this Project in July 2000*.\"578\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 331 lines 13-16.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 332 line 10 to p. 333 line 11.\n\n543.\n\nWhen Claimant pointed out that Mr. Arndt's name was not included in the minutes of a meeting held with the Chief Secretary in April 2000, which was instead attended on BHP's side by Mr. Skrzeczynski, Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Iqbal,579 and suggested that this meant that Mr. Skrzeczynski and Mr. Schloderer had replaced Mr. Arndt in his role at negotiating the Addendum, Mr. Iqbal acknowledged that Mr. Arndt had not attended the meeting but denied that he had been replaced.580 He stated:\n\n\"*I think he was behind all those things because he was a person who had contact with the Government officials, and he was running this process. John Schloderer was a pure geologist and he had no connection and no expertise with dealing with the Government. Bob Skrzeczynski just visited Pakistan first time when I saw him bringing these letters. He didn't come back again in Pakistan.*\n\n*So, it was the only visit in my presence in Pakistan.*\n\n*So, these two people were--probably were not engaged in these type of working with Government of Balochistan, sir*.\"581\n\n*See* **Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 22.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 402 lines 9-19.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 403 lines 2-14.\n\n544.\n\nFinally, when asked why he continued to engage in the alleged secret business with Mr. Arndt \u2013 having confirmed that Mr. Arndt had told him to keep the alleged bribes a secret582 \u2013 even after Mr. Schloderer had replaced Mr. Arndt as Chief Executive, Mr. Iqbal responded:\n\n\"*Because he was continuing to be in Pakistan around us. He used to sit in our office, and I don't know what arrangement he had with BHP, but the work was continued as it was before August of '99, so there was no change in it. And just on the paper for the corporate matters, the name of Chief Executive--was changed to John Schloderer, and, therefore, I was doing some other corporate--for the corporate purpose, John Schloderer was replaced as the Chief Executive in Pakistan. So, this was just on the paper. Otherwise, John Schloderer didn't have any participation in this type of work ever.*\"583\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 407 lines 19-22.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 409 line 12 to p. 410 line 1.\n\n545.\n\nMr. Farooq was also confronted with Claimant's submission that Mr. Arndt had left BHP and the project in August 1999. He responded:\n\n\"\u2026 *He's been working with us in relation to the Addendum from the start, from '98. He was working with us for the approval of Addendum. He attended the meeting in August, June. In November, December he had a meeting with the Governor. He attended a meeting with the Additional Chief Secretary too.*\n\n*He has attended so many meetings with us. How can we say that he was not on their payroll --or that he had left. He had been attending the meetings with us. You can ignore it once or twice. You can't ignore 10 times that he has been with us. 10 times he's been dealing with us.*\n\n*He has attended the meetings. And if we say that he's not there--we can't say that. According to our knowledge, he was there. He was present. He was physically present*.\"584\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 773 line 10 to p. 774 line 2.\n\n546.\n\nWhen asked whether the letter from Mr. Schloderer to Mr. Farooq of 6 October 1999, which was signed by Mr. Schloderer as \"*Chief Executive,*\" meant that he had replaced Mr. Arndt as CEO at the site, Mr. Farooq stated:\n\n\"*This letter was not signed in Pakistan. It was sent from outside. And the work was closed at the site back then. Mr. Schloderer--Mr Chris, his duties used to change. Sometimes he was a site in-charge; sometimes he would become a geologist; sometimes he was in charge of the office. His duties used to change. He was not permanent on one specific aspect.*\n\n*This is the first time I've seen John Schloderer stated as Chief Executive.*\n\n*Q. Mr. Farooq, this letter is written to you, is it not?*\n\n*A. Correct.*\n\n*Q. So, you were dealing with Mr. Schloderer as Chief Executive, were you not?*\n\n*A. Correct.*\n\n*Q. So, does this refresh your recollection that Mr. Schloderer replaced Mr. Arndt as Chief Executive Officer when Mr. Arndt left BHP in August 1999?*\n\n*A. That's not correct. I cannot say this, whether Chris Arndt had left. Chris Arndt was present there, and all the dealings were through him--you are just spinning around the questions and asking me, that just because he wrote Chief Executive, he became the Chief Executive. The thing is that. Chris Arndt was working with us. What capacity he was working in, I don't remember but once I see the papers, I can tell you. His designation would change from time to time. In some ways--he, Arndt Chris was present there, and there is no suspicion about that. I'm hundred percent sure Christopher was present there, and I have explained it at length in the statement. That's why there was a need--the Opposition Statement, of TCC--they were not trying to accept this, our answers to the question, then I thought--then why shouldn't I tell them about Addendum? About how the Addendum happened and how much work went into it, and how much Chris Arndt helped us. How we gave money. How it happened*.\"585\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 780 line 7 to p. 781 line 22.\n\n547.\n\nClaimant's witnesses also testified on the alleged involvement of Mr. Arndt in the alleged illegitimate payment to Mr. Burq in early 2000. Mr. Skrzeczynski stated in his witness statement:\n\n\"*I knew Chris and he would not have done any such thing. Also, Chris had no access to that kind of cash, and it could not have just gone missing in our accounts. In any event, by August of 1999 Chris was no longer working on Reko Diq or with BHP Minerals at all. He had no involvement with Reko Diq while I was managing the project and obtaining all the necessary consents from the government and completing the deal with Mincor*.\"586\n\nSkrzeczynski, \u00b6 19.\n\n548.\n\nMr. Skrzeczynski further stated with regard to the negotiations on the Addendum:\n\n\"*We succeeded in getting the Addendum signed by entirely honest means. We had good reasons for the amendments to the CHEJVA, all of which had been extensively negotiated before I arrived. So our approach was simply to explain these reasons whenever questions were raised. It took patience, and we sometimes had to explain the same thing over and over again because the people we were dealing with had changed and were not always familiar with agreements of this kind. I traveled to Pakistan several times, and I, and other BHP employees, personally met with various GOB officials to address questions and explain the documents and the benefits of finalizing them. All this took a long time but that was similar to my experience in India, where I have also worked on deals and transactions.*\"587\n\nSkrzeczynski, \u00b6 15.\n\n549.\n\nDuring the hearing, when pointed to a meeting held with the Chief Secretary on 11 April 2000 in which the Chief Secretary had asked various questions about the Addendum at a time when it had already been signed, and when asked whether he was concerned that Mr. Arndt and Mr. Iqbal may not have properly explained the Addendum during the negotiations in 1999, Mr. Skrzeczynski responded:\n\n\"*A. I wasn't concerned. I didn't believe there was a problem. What I can tell you is I didn't negotiate changes to the Addendum. I was not there. I don't know that individuals in the BDA or the Government of Balochistan that they spoke to, who attended meetings. That was something I had no knowledge on. But when I would have gone there for this particular meeting, I would have been interested to try and clear up the situation so the matter could be finalized and we could proceed. That's the approach I would have taken.*\n\n*I'm not involved in those initial negotiations nor the terms. I just wanted the matter concluded and those two conditions precedent met. That was my job to get it done. So, what other people said, who they met, I have no knowledge*.\n\n*Q. Let's see what you said at Paragraph 15 of your Witness Statement about how you got this done.* [quoted above in paragraph 383]\n\n*But to be clear then, in fact, you never were involved in the negotiation of the Addendum or the explanation of the Addendum itself?*\n\n*A. Right.*\"588\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2129 line 7 to p. 2130 line 17.\n\n550.\n\nUpon the suggestion that his oral testimony did not accord with his written statement, Mr. Skrzeczynski explained:\n\n\"*Well, I find it difficult to see the nuance here. I said I don't know how many meetings I specifically had. I don't think it was many. I only went to Pakistan maybe three or four times. I needed to get the Addendum signed. I met with the officials. I explained their concerns. I can't--and I may have explained it in many different ways--that's what I'm getting a--until they were satisfied and they understood and we were on the same page. Joint Ventures are cooperative agreements. They are not adversarial agreements. So, we had to be--I had to make sure they were comfortable that we were doing something for our joint benefit. And that's why, when I say I had to go over it many times, I may have gone over it many times in different ways so that they could see that it was a win-win situation for both of us to get this done and signed. That's all I can say*.\"589\n\nTranscnript (Day 8), p. 2132 line 11 to p. 2133 line 5.\n\n551.\n\nMr. Moore testified with regard to the role of Mr. Arndt:\n\n\"*I obviously cannot provide any information about the time when Chris* [Arndt] *and Zafar* [Iqbal] *worked together at BHP, but from what I do know, Zafar's testimony is not accurate. Zafar claims that Chris joined TCC around the same time he did, which was in July 2000 as a carry-over from BHP in Karachi. But TCC did not hire Chris until over three years later, in November 2003, after TCC listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and had the resources to increase our personnel. Between August 1999 and November 2003, Chris was not involved in the Reko Diq Project. He would not, and certainly could not, have been meeting with government officials on TCC's behalf during that time period, much less ordering Zafar to deliver cash payments to government officials*.\"590\n\nMoore, \u00b6 55.\n\n552.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Moore confirmed that he was not involved in the negotiation of the Addendum and had no firsthand knowledge of how it was procured.591\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2236 lines 1-9.\n\n553.\n\nFurther, Mr. Hargreaves stated in his second witness statement:\n\n\"[N]*either Mr. Arndt nor Mr. Lakhani were involved with Reko Diq at the time the bribes were alleged to have been made.*\n\n*From August 1999 until late 2003 when he joined TCC, Mr. Arndt was not involved with BHP Minerals, and to the best of my knowledge was not working on Reko Diq in any capacity. I had worked at BHP Petroleum when Mr. Arndt was the Health Safety and Environment (*'HSE' *) Advisor for BHP Petroleum from December 1998 to August 1999. After August 1999, he continued to have some involvement, mostly from outside the country, with the Zamzama gas field discovery for BHP Petroleum as well as with its partner Premier-Shell on a nearby petroleum exploration license. From early 2002 to 2003, Mr. Arndt took up a demanding role with Clough Engineering developing the Sawan Gas Field in Sindh about 100 km away from Zamzama*.\"592\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n554.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Hargreaves testified that he was \"*shocked*\" by the allegations regarding Mr. Arndt as they were \"*completely out of character and so fundamentally inconsistent with what* [he] *knew of Mr. Arndt*.\"593\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 16.\n\n555.\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Iqbal and whether both he and Mr. Arndt were laid off or retrenched in the course of 1999, Mr. Hargreaves stated:\n\n\"*Yes, they were, but they were seconded. Chris was seconded for a while to Petroleum, to help out with some health, safety, and environment issues, and Zafar continued, I guess, as a contractor to BHP Petroleum.*\n\n*\u2026 I don't know whether that's strictly correct, whether he still was on a Minerals payroll, but we had a contract between Minerals and Petroleum, whereby Petroleum paid for a number of Minerals people to work at the Zamzama site, and Zafar administered that contract from Karachi.*\n\n*So, what his actual formal status with Minerals was, I don't know*.\"594\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2318 line 21 to p. 2319 line 12.\n\n556.\n\nMr. Hargreaves further confirmed that during the period from August 1999 until later 2003, he had no personal involvement in the Reko Diq Project.595\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2321 line 19 to p. 2322 line 6.\n\n557.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Williams stated that he knew Mr. Arndt very well. When asked to describe his relationship with him, he said:\n\n\"*A. \u2026 Chris and I were friends and colleagues for something over 45 years. I attended his wedding. I knew his wife. I knew his children. I knew his brother, I knew his sister, who were both respected professionals in their respective fields. Chris also worked directly for me for about six years as my chief geologist when I was the exploration manager for the western--BHP's western region in Australia. I guess I could describe him as my closest confidant in that period. So, we knew pretty much everything about what the other guy was thinking and what the business practice and behavior was. So, yes, I knew Chris extremely well. I had a lot of regard for him. I was also at his funeral.*\n\n*Q. And do you have any opinion or view as to Chris Arndt's integrity?*\n\n*A. Impeccable would be the only point that I would make. Chris was a careful and thorough geologist, had a lot of experience in Australia and overseas. I would trust him implicitly to carry through the company's behavior wherever he went. He was a very honorable fellow, high standards, and I guess I would have to say he demanded it of those around him.*\"596\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2188 line 10 to p. 2189 line 10.\n\n558.\n\nIn support of its submissions and the testimony of its witnesses that Mr. Arndt was hired by TCC only in November 2003, Claimant further relies on: (i) an e-mail sent from Mr. Schloderer to Mr. Moore on 23 October 2003 to which he attached Mr. Arndt's CV and \"*recommend*[ed] *hiring Chris for a position as Manager Pakistan Operations on a fly-in fly-out basis*,\" noting that he was \"*currently managing the Clough* [Engineering] *Karachi office*\";597 and (ii) a memorandum sent by Mr. Moore to Mr. Lakhani, Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Brian Lynn on 10 November 2003 in which Mr. Moore stated with regard to Mr. Arndt:\n\n\"*We will hire Chris Arndt, initially on a daily basis until we all feel comfortable with him. He will be hired in a technical role as a geologist reporting to John. There may have been some misunderstanding about his role. He is not an office manager or logistics manager or anything like that. He is a geologist, who will mostly be based at Nok Kundi or Reko Diq. In the setting up phase however he will assist us in putting in place some of the infrastructure that we will need*.\"598\n\n**Exhibit CE-510**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-511**, p. 4.\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Mr. Arndt's CV that was attached to the October 2003 e-mail, Mr. Arndt was employed at BHP Minerals, in the position of Chief Geologist, South Asia and Chief Executive in Pakistan, from February 1998 to August 1999. Mr. Arndt's description of his work experience included \"*Local administration of the project \u2013 negotiations with Baluchistan Government on amendments to Joint Venture*.\"599 During the relevant time period, his CV further listed engagements with: (i) Premier/Shell for the Dureji Project (Pakistan) from April to July 2000; (ii) BHP Petroleum, specifically for the exploration and construction phase of a gas plant at Zamzama (Pakistan), from December 1998 to August 1999 and from August 2000 to March 2001, respectively; and (iii) Holly Mining for the tender for the lease of the Saindak copper/gold mine (Pakistan) from September 2000 to May 2001. In addition, Mr. Arndt stated that his professional experience included consultant work at his own firm, CD Arndt and Associates, as from August 1999.600\n\n**Exhibit CE-510**, pp. 3 and 4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-510**, pp. 2-4.\n\n560.\n\nIn an e-mail dated 9 April 2001, Mr. Arndt wrote to sixteen recipients, among them Mr. Moore and Mr. Williams, with an update on his recent activities. He stated, *inter alia* :\n\n\"*I have only been in Perth for two weeks since November. For most of this time I have been working in Pakistan for BHP Petroleum on their Zamzama gas project. My contract with them started in August, and finished in mid March with the completion of the gas plant which is now in production. \u2026*\n\n*The other project I have been working on in Pakistan has been for Holly Mining. Holly Mining is a company that Bill Holly and I are using to bid for the lease of the Saindak porphyry copper/gold mine in far west Baluchistan*.\n\n\u2026 *Mincor is interested in using Saindak's infrastructure during their development of the H-4 deposit at Reko Diq and we would be keen to use some of Saindak's excess mining gear to toll mine at Reko Diq - eg contract stripping at H-4 or toll mining of the Western Porphyries*.\"601\n\n**Exhibit CE-738**, p. 3.\n\n561.\n\nFollowing a response from Mr. Alan Moore in which he asked, *inter alia*, how it worked in terms of relationship with Holly Mining \"[s]*ince you are still working for BHP*,\"602 Mr. Arndt answered on the same day:\n\n\"*I get the impression from reading your response that you think I am still with BHP. Actually I was retrenched at the time of the big purge (finished in August 1999) and this BHP Petroleum job was a separate contract through my consultancy company*.\"603\n\n**Exhibit CE-738**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-738**, p. 1.\n\n562.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent acknowledges that Mr. Arndt was \"*formally retrenched from BHP Minerals in August 1999*\" but nevertheless argues that he had both the motive and the means to pay the bribes to Mr. Burq in early 2000 because: (i) he was looking for a permanent job, preferably in Pakistan, and wrote to his former colleage at BHP, Mr. Saad Hussain, in April 2000 that \"*when the* [Chagai] *project does get going BHP have recommended* [me] *to Mincor to run the show in Pakistan*\";604 and (ii) he had received \"*well over two years' pay in a lump sum*\" when he was retrenched and, according to Respondent, apparently \"*decided to invest a part of that money to secure his future lead role in the Reko Diq project*.\"605\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 327 *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-518**, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 328 *quoting from* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2210 lines 6-9.\n\n563.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed in more detail the e-mail correspondence exchanged between Mr. Arndt and Mr. Hussain in April 2000 to which Respondent referred. On 2 April 2000, Mr. Hussain wrote in relevant part:\n\n\"*All is well here. Have'nt heard from you guys for a while, so thought that I'd give an update from my side.*\n\n*I hear that BHP and Government of Balochistan have now signed the Addendum to the JV agreement and things will move ahead with Chagai, although funding is still not clear and a third partner is being finalized. Most of the staff working for the project has relocated. However, some staff like geos and drivers are without jobs and are having a tough time. Nobody was retrenched from BDA!*\"606\n\n**Exhibit RE-518**, pp. 2-3.\n\n564.\n\nIn response to that e-mail, Mr. Arndt wrote in relevant part:\n\n\"*I have been following the political happenings in Pakistan with great interest. As I mentioned to you in my last e-mail, I are still interested in getting together a group to have a go at restarting Saindak Mine. Saindak plan to advertise next week for expressions of interest from group who would like to mine Saindak. The political events in Pakistan might discourage many from applying which would make it easier for us! The government has said that they want someone to restart the mine but the government would write off the capital and cover the outstanding loans, so that all we would have to worry about is the operating costs and presumable some capital to replace deteriorated plant. Our thoughts are that we could start it up at current capacity to get to know the orebody and then if everything goes OK do an expansion to a reasonable production rate, (exporting concentrates).*\n\n*Apart from Pakistan I are still looking for work in Australia, applying for jobs and getting a few interviews, and looking for work as a consultant. I have just got my first job taking a delegation from Anglogold to China in May/June to look at opportunities in China. I hope the trip might generate more work with Anglogold. I have also heard rumours that North Ltd might want me to do a similar trip to China for them, which would be great! Tim Hargreaves did mention to me in December that he might want be back when they restart exploration at Dadu in June or July, but I have not heard anything from BHPP recently. Re Chagai, the contract for Mincor (Iscor) to farm in on the project was finalised a couple of months ago, then BHP Minerals appointed a new finance guy at a very high level who wants to see all contracts and when he saw the Chagai deal that Ski and John Schloderer had negotiated he said he wants changes. John and Ski (and Mincor) are tearing their hair out!! When the project does get going BHP have recommended me to Mincor to run the show in Pakistan*.\"607\n\n**Exhibit CE-518**, p. 2.\n\n565.\n\nOn 23 April 2000, Mr. Hussain responded in relevant part:\n\n\"*I came across John Schloderer briefly at the Pearl Continental Hotel about a fortnight ago. He was confident that work would restart at Chagai in a few months. Lets hope so. Somehow, with another company getting involved, it seems to be complicated and the Govt of Balochistan is not simple to deal with.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*We were hoping to see you in Pakistan soon. Keep in touch and let me know in advance when you plan to come here as I travel a lot*.\"608\n\n**Exhibit CE-518**, p. 1.\n\n566.\n\nWhen Mr. Skrzeczynski was asked about Mr. Arndt's statement that \"*BHP have recommended me to Mincor to run the show in Pakistan*\" and whether that suggested that he had been given an expectation that BHP would try to make sure that he would get the lead role in the project, Mr. Skrzeczynski answered: \"*Maybe. But it certainly didn't come from me nor did I ever make that recommendation*.\" He further stated that he was not aware of such a recommendation being made.609\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2123 lines 1-10.\n\n567.\n\nOn 3 May 2000, Mr. Arndt wrote to Mr. Schloderer:\n\n\"*How did your trip go? Make some progress? My work with Anglogold has been postponed for at least 6 months, but I am thinking of going to China next month anyway, to see Sara in Wuhan and to knock on a few doors in Shanghai and Beijing looking for work.*\n\n*We are putting in our* 'Expression of Interest' *for Saindak this week. (Have I send you the ad already?)*\"610\n\n**Exhibit CE-857**, p. 1.\n\n568.\n\nMr. Schloderer responded:\n\n\"*I'm currently in Peru to help out on the porphyry program until activity begins on Reko Diq. The addendum has been signed and Mincor and BHP have a signed agreement. The Mincor proposal has been submitted to GOB and they have 90 days to match or accept. The chief secretary has promised that they will respond by the end of May. We'll see. I will be back in Pakistan on May 20 and back in Perth on May 30. Sorry to hear that the China trip got postponed. It must be frustrating. Note that Western Mining is active in China. Contact Howard Golden. I also received a call from Billiton regarding Tom Pollack. They are looking for a field person for China. Might be worth a call. My contact is David First in Melbourne but he is not dealing directly with the project. I don't have those contact numbers with me. Anyway it would be worth visiting the Billiton office if you go over. Thanks for the Saindak article. It will be interesting to see if they get any bids.*\"611\n\n**Exhibit CE-857**, p. 1.\n\n569.\n\nRespondent further refers to an e-mail from Mr. Abdul Bashir to Mr. Arndt on 14 May 2000 in response to an e-mail from Mr. Arndt of the same day, which contained no text but an attachment with the file name \"*Reko Diq.doc*.\" Mr. Bashir, who was working at the Zamzama camp at the time, wrote:\n\n\"*First of all thanks for excellent information regarding Reko diq. As you know it is a Mother day gift for us. Every one in the camp is very happy specially those people who worked with BHP Minerals in Chagai and every one praying to start again Reko diq and we start work together. Everyone wishes work with you in Reko diq*.\"612\n\n**Exhibit RE-521**.\n\n570.\n\nOn 13 May 2000, Mr. Arndt also wrote an e-mail with the subject line \"*Reko Diq*\" and an attachment to Mr. Hargreaves, stating \"*fyi (in case you have not seen what's in the press)*.\" The next day, Mr. Hargreaves responded: \"*Thanks. Good news \u2013 I think? It reads so well that I want to invest!*\"613\n\n**Exhibit RE-520**.\n\n571.\n\nClaimant, on the other hand, relies on e-mail correspondence between Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Arndt in support of its submission that Mr. Arndt was not involved in the Reko Diq project in any capacity during the relevant time period. Specifically, Claimant refers to an e-mail sent by Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Arndt's personal e-mail account on 16 May 2000 in which he wrote in relevant part:\n\n\"*Its really nice hear from you after a long time. I hope you are doing well. It is unfortunate that you could not get a job but I am confident that you will get a good job soon. It would be fine if you can attract a group to bid for saindak, that can bring you in Pakistan again. Please let me know if I may be of any help, in my personal capacity, for your work for Saindak project.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*As far as BHP is concerned, you would have heard that the GoB has signed the addendum and now we have submitted the Option Agreement to GoB for exercising its pre-emptive right under the Joint Venture Agreement. Everyone knows that GoB has to allow Mincor to come into the Project as GoB has no funds to buy and invest for BHP's share, but to describe this fact officially on paper by GoB will take time. The lazy beaurucratic* [sic] *system won't allow things to be happened at faster pace. Lets hope that GoB gives its consent for Mincor as soon as possible*.\"614\n\n**Exhibit CE-737**.\n\n572.\n\nThis e-mail was written in response to an undated e-mail from Mr. Arndt, which reads:\n\n\"*How are things going? It looks as if you could be getting a bit busier! I am still looking for work, but have a few things in the pipeline which could come off soon! One is trying to put together a group in Perth to tender for Saindak*.\"615\n\n**Exhibit CE-737**.\n\n573.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Iqbal testified that he wrote to Mr. Arndt \"*It is good to see you after a long time*\" because \"*we didn't see each other for about a month*.\"616 He also stated that his hope that \"*it* [the Saindak project] *can bring you in Pakistan again*\" meant that \"*he come back for good for working in Pakistan because he didn't have any permanent job in Pakistan at that time*.\"617\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 407 lines 1-3.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 393 lines 8-12.\n\n574.\n\nIn a further e-mail exchange shortly thereafter on 18 May 2000, Mr. Arndt informed Mr. Zafar that \"*I have just received a phone call from Premier Oil. They want me start work for them ASAP. So it looks as if I could be in Karachi on the weekend of 4th June, or there abouts. \u2026 So I hope to see you in a couple of weeks!*\" In response, Mr. Iqbal congratulated Mr. Arndt and stated that \"[m]*yself and other members of our Karachi/Dadu offices are looking forward to see you soon in Karachi*.\"618\n\n**Exhibit CE-864**.\n\n575.\n\nClaimant also relies on further e-mails, which confirm, in its view, that Mr. Arndt was not in Pakistan during the relevant time period. In an e-mail dated 18 February 2000, Mr. Zulfiqar Khan wrote from a BHP account to Mr. Arndt:\n\n\"*Long time no see. This is to let you know that you are missed sometimes (when I visit the field) and remembered often (when I wear the boots you brought me). I was hoping to see you back in Pakistan along with Mrs. Arndt. What happened about your job with Premier? I hope you get this note. It will be nice to hear from you/ see you again*.\"619\n\n**Exhibit CE-843**.\n\n576.\n\nIn an e-mail dated 18 March 2000, Mr. Sam Machmillan wrote to Mr. Arndt:\n\n\"*I haven't heard from you in a while and thought I'd see how things are going. Do you have any plans to come to Pakistan? I will be working with Lasmo in Karachi up to the end of the month. How are the mining prospects moving for Baluchistan?*\"620\n\n**Exhibit CE-845**.\n\n577.\n\nOn 23 April 2000, Mehmood wrote from BHP's Zamzama camp, in response to a Christmas card that Mr. Arndt had sent him, stating, *inter alia*, \"*No news from your side since long.*\"621\n\n**Exhibit CE-853**.\n\n578.\n\nClaimant further points to two e-mail chains of May 2000 regarding Mr. Arndt's attempt to transfer an amount of PAK Rs. 5,000 to Quetta. On 2 May 2000, Mr. Arndt wrote to Mr. S. Iqbal Ali regarding a Saindak Advertisement for leasing and asked: \"*Re the 5000 rp, I have not been able to find a bank in Australia that deals in Pakistan currency. Can I send the money in any other currency (by telegraphic transfer)?*\"622 On the same day, Mr. Arndt also wrote to Mr. Marcus Coghlan and Mr. Hargreaves, stating that \"*if you can think of any way I can get the 5000 rps to Quetta it would be appreciated. I have tried all the Australian banks and none deal in Pakistan currency*.\" Mr. Hargreaves responded that he would organize the transfer \"*from here*\" and suggested that Mr. Arndt buy him a beer \"*when we next meet (unless its in Pakistan!).*\"623\n\n**Exhibit CE-855**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-856**.\n\n579.\n\nRespondent argues that, despite his formal retrenchment, Mr. Arndt \"*remained the source of up-to-date information about the project for former colleagues*\"624 and refers to an e-mail from Mr. Hargreaves, who considered investing into the Reko Diq project, to Mr. Arndt in November 2000 where he wrote in relevant part:\n\n\"\u2026 *Are you still at Zamzama? Has anything happened with the China project?*\n\n*I have received an e-mail from Geoff Allen who is trying to assemble seed investors for Reqo Diq vi* [sic] *at he Tehtyan Coper* [sic] *Company's private placement. I and a couple of others are willing to have a punt, but I wanted to ask you first whether any of the BHPM people had put any of their own money into the project - which would signal greater confidence.*\n\n*Does BHP/Mincor have clear rights to export any copper or would they have to sell to the government and share the same risk of currency/payment as the gas sector? Has BHP/Mincor finally sorted out the tax/royalty issues or is it still something that would have to be negotiated with the Balochistan Government under the old provincial mining legislation?*\"625\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 329-330.\n\n**Exhibit RE-51** 4.\n\n580.\n\nWhen asked about why he would ask Mr. Arndt about what was happening regarding TCC in a time period around the end of June/July 2000, Mr. Hargreaves answered:\n\n\"*A. I guess there were a couple of reasons why I communicated with Chris. One was that Chis was a very good networker and kept contact with all of the ex-BHP people. So, he might have a sense of what was happening. But also at the time, Chris was looking at putting a bid to lease the Saindak Mine through a company called Holly Mining. So, Chris was actively involved in looking at copper business at Saindak, which is near Reko Diq. And I was asking himthings about taxes and royalties which he might have learned from, his work at Holly Mining.*\n\n*One of the concerns I had from my previous experience in Pakistan is that what were the hard currency restrictions going to be on any successful Mining Venture. That's why I asked those questions on currency payments.*\n\n*Q. But he wouldn't have known from his work on Holly Mining whether BHP Minerals people had put any of their own money into the Reko Diq Prject, would he?*\n\n*A. He might have known. Chris was an effective networker. But I don't recall that he ever answered this e-mail. And unless you've got a response to it, I certainly don't recall the Response. And I had to assume the non-response meant that he didn't know the answers to my questions.*\"626\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2329 line 1 to p. 2330 line 4.\n\n581.\n\nFinally, Mr. Hargreaves was asked about Mr. Arndt's role as contracting consultant to BHP Petroleum at Zamzama:\n\n\"*Q. So, you say it's north of Karachi. So, it's likely that he was traveling in and out of Karachi from time to time?*\n\n*A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. And you say that he kept contact with all the BHP people. So, your understanding is that he would have been in contact with BHP Minerals people at this period of time?*\n\n*A. Yes.*\n\n*\u2026 I probably should have said* 'BHP people,' *whether they were currently with BHP or formerly with BHP.*\"627\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2330 line 20 to p. 2331 line 17.\n\n582.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence set out above, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Arndt was not involved in any illegitimate payments to Mr. Burq in early 2000 as alleged by Respondent and that the testimony given by its witnesses Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq in that regard is false.\n\n583.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that Mr. Arndt's alleged involvement in a payment of PAK Rs. 2,000,000 to Mr. Burq was not mentioned by Mr. Farooq in his first witness statement but then addressed in detail in his second witness statement that was submitted together with Respondent's Reply and the witness statement of Mr. Iqbal. The Tribunal has not heard a convincing explanation from Respondent or its witnesses concerning the timing of the allegations implicating Mr. Arndt \u2013 regardless of whether or not this allegation was prompted by statements made in Claimant's Opposition, as suggested by Claimant.628\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 299.\n\n584.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal also considers it noteworthy that while Mr. Iqbal testified in his written witness statement that Mr. Arndt joined TCC \"*around the time*\" that he did and that he reported to Mr. Arndt as \"*General Manager*\" both before and after he joined TCC, he corrected such testimony during the hearing to the effect that Mr. Arndt joined TCC only \"*after*\" he did and acknowledged that Mr. Arndt had in fact been retrenched in 1999 and, on Mr. Iqbal's testimony, stopped working for the project in July 2000.\n\n585.\n\nBoth Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq further acknowledged during the hearing that Mr. Arndt was replaced by Mr. Schloderer as Chief Executive as of late 1999 and, even though they both claim that this replacement took place only on paper, it is undisputed that Mr. Schloderer signed the letters written by BHP as of October 1999 and that he participated in the official meetings after August 1999, including the meeting with the Chief Secretary in April 2000. In this regard, the Tribunal rejects the submission that Mr. Arndt continued to act and negotiate the 2000 Addendum in an unofficial capacity for BHP. While Mr. Skrzeczynski's testimony as to his own role in the explanation of the changes introduced by the 2000 Addendum to the GOB officials was not entirely clear, the fact remains that Mr. Schloderer was the Chief Executive in Pakistan at the time. It may have been interesting to hear Mr. Schloderer's testimony regarding his role in the final phase of negotiating the 2000 Addendum. However, even in his absence, the Tribunal cannot simply infer that his testimony would not have supported Claimant's position.\n\n586.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the contemporaneous documentary record further strongly indicates that Mr. Arndt was not acting in any capacity for BHP at the relevant time and that, in fact, he was not even in Pakistan. Contemporaneous e-mails and memoranda from Mr. Schloderer and Mr. Moore as well as Mr. Arndt's CV confirm that he was only hired by TCC in November 2003. Moreover, the various e-mails produced by Claimant from Mr. Arndt's personal e-mail account rebut Respondent's allegation regarding Mr. Arndt's alleged role in the final negotiation and execution phase of the 2000 Addendum. In the Tribunal's view, these e-mails demonstrate that Mr. Arndt remained very interested in the developments of the project, presumably because he hoped that he would be re-employed once the project progressed under Mincor, and therefore kept up-to-date regarding information available in the press and via his former colleagues at BHP.\n\n587.\n\nIn particular, if Mr. Arndt had indeed been the key person responsible for pushing the 2000 Addendum through by means of a bribe to the Chairman of the BDA, as alleged by Respondent, it is very unlikely that Mr. Schloderer would have informed him by an e-mail in early May 2000, *i.e*., over a month after the signing, that the Addendum had been signed \u2013 in response to the question: \"*Make some progress* ?\" Similarly, if Mr. Iqbal had been instructed by Mr. Arndt to pay a bribe for the signing of the Addendum, it is equally unlikely that he would have informed Mr. Arndt by an e-mail in mid-May 2000 that the Addendum had been signed \u2013 in response to the question: \"*How are things going?*\"\n\n588.\n\nIn addition, if Mr. Arndt had been constantly present during the negotiations of the Addendum and also in April 2000 in relation to the certification of BHP's 75% interest in the CHEJVA (which will be addressed in further detail below), it is not credible that Mr. Iqbal would have written in mid-May 2000: \"*Its really nice to hear from you after a long time*\" and would have expressed his hope that Mr. Arndt would soon find a job that would bring him back to Pakistan. In particular, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Iqbal's explanation during the hearing that he had written this e-mail after he had not seen Mr. Arndt \"*for about a month*\" and hoped that he would \"*come back for good*\" to Pakistan. In addition, the e-mail from Mr. Zulfiqar Khan, another BHP employee, written in February 2000, in which he also wrote: \"*Long time no see*\" and \"*I was hoping to see you back in Pakistan*\" indicates that Mr. Arndt was not in Pakistan at that time.\n\n589.\n\nFurthermore, while the e-mails that Respondent points to indicate that Mr. Arndt was hoping to find a job within the Reko Diq project once it continued with Mincor and may have been hoping \"*to run the show in Pakistan*\" for Mincor once the project \"*does get going*,\" this expectation does not support Respondent's allegation that he was in fact already acting on behalf of BHP in an unofficial capacity, pushing through the Addendum to achieve that result. In fact, the Tribunal considers it highly unlikely that Mr. Arndt, while being officially not employed by BHP, would take it on himself to pay a significant amount out of his own lump sum payment that he received when his employment with BHP ended in August 1999, as alleged by Respondent in its Post-Hearing Brief \u2013 in the absence of any other explanation as to how he would have obtained the necessary sum of money.\n\n590.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that Mr. Williams' testimony, who was close friends with Mr. Arndt for more than 45 years, left a strong impression on the Tribunal and confirms its conviction that Mr. Arndt was not secretly bribing the Chairman of the BDA while hoping to be re-employed in connection with the Reko Diq project in the future.\n\n591.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal is of the view that in light of the emphasis placed by Respondent and its witnesses on the role of Mr. Arndt in the alleged payments to Mr. Burq in early 2000, the absence of any evidence supporting this allegation and, in fact, the conclusion that the contemporaneous evidence in the record strongly indicates the contrary, *i.e*., that Mr. Arndt was not involved in any capacity with BHP at the time, is decisive in the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence of corruption regarding the Addendum. As the Tribunal does not accept that Mr. Arndt negotiated and provided the funds for any bribery payment to Mr. Burq, it likewise does not believe Mr. Iqbal's evidence that he delivered the alleged amount to Mr. Burq in order to get the Addendum signed despite the outstanding approval of the Finance Department. The Tribunal cannot infer from the absence of such approval that a payment must have been made. In particular, given the fact that the Governor of Balochistan had authorized the Chairman of the BDA to sign the Addendum by letter of 24 December 1999 and also given the correspondence exchanged with the Finance Department regarding its objections, it rather appears to the Tribunal that it was decided to proceed with the signing of the Addendum on the basis of the authorization by the Governor and the vetting by the Law Department. As noted above, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether this approach was in line with Business Rules of 1976. While the provisions cited by Claimant indicate that it was indeed possible to proceed without the approval of the Finance Department, even a violation of these Rules would not be sufficient to justifiy an inference of corruption.\n\n**The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 500,000 and Further \"*****Periodic Payments*****\" to Mr. Farooq**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n592.\n\nAs the Tribunal does not accept that the alleged payment of PAK Rs. 2,000,000 to Mr. Burq occurred, it also rejects Mr Iqbal's evidence that Mr. Burq passed a share of this payment on to Mr. Farooq for his assistance in ensuring the execution of the Addendum.629\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearng Brief, \u00b6 47.\n\n593.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, in its Reply, Respondent further alleges that certain \"*periodic payments to Mr Farooq*\" were made to secure the Addendum.630 While Respondent did not include a reference to specific evidence in this regard, Mr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*After I joined the OC, BHP began to provide me with small cash payments ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 for my support on the OC. The money used to be paid to me in my office by Mr Zafar Iqbal, BHP's Chief Accountant and Country Representative. At this time, BHP's priority was to get as much land as possible under Prospecting Licenses, to have annual fees waived, and to negotiate concessions of the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules 1970. The payments that I received from BHP at this time were in return for me not raising any objections or creating any problems for BHP*.\"631\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 133 lit. b.\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 6.\n\n594.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Iqbal testified as follows:\n\n\"*Before my next trip to Quetta \u2013 in late 1998 or early 1999 \u2013 Mr Arndt gave me a sealed package to deliver to Mr Farooq. I took it with me when I went to meet Mr Farooq. Mr Farooq opened the package in front of me and I saw that it contained money. He did not count it in front of me, but I saw that it was a relatively small amount, probably 10,000 Rupees or so. I do not remember what we were asking Mr Farooq to do on this occasion, but I believe it would have been a routine matter such as customs clearance of machinery or the renewal of a licence.*\n\n*I was a bit astonished, as a young accountant, to see my manager giving money for a government official. When I got back to Karachi, I spoke to Mr Arndt. Mr Arndt explained to me that we were working in a region where to get the right results these things need to be done. He said to me that this sort of thing did not matter and that we needed to keep our eye on the goal, which was to get the mine running. He told me, this time and on other occasions, that this was between me and him and not to tell anyone else.*\n\n*Mr Arndt gave me packages to deliver to Mr Farooq on a number of other occasions. This did not happen every time I visited Quetta, but it happened on at least three or four other occasions. On some of these occasions the package was opened in front of me and I saw that there was money inside, and on other occasions Mr Farooq put the unopened package straight into his drawer. I did not always know the specific reasons why we were giving money to Mr Farooq \u2013 this was between Mr Farooq and Mr Arndt. I was never told where the money came from, but I always presumed that Mr Arndt brought it in US Dollars from abroad when he came back from his rota leave (and then exchanged it for Rupees in Pakistan).*\"632\n\nIqbal, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq did not refer to any specific payments that he allegedly received in that context nor did he confirm Mr. Iqbal's testimony on the alleged involvement of Mr. Arndt. He stated:\n\n\"*While I was less influential and had less of an impact in the mid-1990s when I was a relatively junior officer, from the late 1990s I began to have an impact. There were many occasions, some of which are discussed below, where I pushed a decision through despite objections from relevant departments, where I side-stepped consultation by relevant departments and where I avoided proper application of the GOB Rules of Business or some other relevant rules. I also generally supported BHP/TCC in the OC meetings, for example by approving budgets even though in 1998-1999 I believed BHP were inflating their expenses (since I knew essentially no work was being carried out) and despite being the person that should question such documents as the General Manager Finance & Administration, BDA and then the Director of Finance, BDA. I acted in this way because I was being paid by BHP/TCC to favour them*.\"633\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 14.\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Mr. Iqbal nor Mr. Farooq's written testimony support Respondent's allegation that the alleged payments \u2013 other than the alleged payment to Mr. Burq in early 2000 \u2013 were made \"*to ensure the execution of the Addendum*\" (or any other of the 2000 instruments, which will be discussed further below). During the hearing, Mr. Iqbal confirmed with regard to the alleged first payment of about PAK Rs. 10,000 to Mr. Farooq that he did not know for which purpose it was made \"*but the matter in which we usually deal with BDA was clearance of---customs clearance and clearance of foreigners to visit Reko Diq area and Licenses Applications like this.*\" Mr. Iqbal further clarified that \"[o]*ne of those payments* [on which he testified in his witness statement] *was in connection with that Addendum*,\" referring to the alleged payment to Mr. Burq in early 2000.634 According to Mr. Farooq, the alleged payments were made in return \"*for* [him] *not raising any objections or creating any problems for BHP*\" and for \"push[ing] a decision through\" or \"generally support[ing] BHP/TCC in the OC meetings, for example by approving budgets.\"\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 338 line 19 to p. 339 line 14.\n\n597.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal has already found that the alleged involvement of Mr. Arndt in those payments did not happen. Mr. Iqbal did not specify in his witness statement when the alleged payments were made, in particular whether they were allegedly made before or after August 1999 when Mr. Arndt ceased to work at BHP. However, even if his testimony concerns, at least in part, a time period prior to August 1999, the Tribunal does not accept that Mr. Arndt asked Mr. Iqbal to deliver cash payments to Mr. Farooq on his behalf, justifying this conduct by saying \"*that this sort of thing did not matter and that we needed to keep our eye on the goal, which was to get the mine running*\" \u2013 at a time when BHP intended to farm out its interest in the project and cut down its budget for any further exploration work. On that basis, the Tribunal also rejects Mr. Iqbal's testimony that he delivered the alleged payments to Mr. Farooq.\n\n598.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion as to whether any payment made by Mr. Iqbal and instructed by Mr. Arndt, if it had been established, would have been attributable firstly, to BHP and, secondly, to Mincor and Claimant. It suffices to note that Mr. Arndt was undisputedly not acting in any official capacity for BHP at the time and, on Mr. Iqbal's own testimony, only he and Mr. Arndt knew of the alleged payments. Consequently, the Tribunal would already have its doubts as to whether such payments could be attributed to BHP. In addition, the Tribunal would also have its doubts as to whether a payment, even if attributable to BHP, could be attributed to Mincor and Claimant on the basis of a continuity of personnel with knowledge of the alleged payment or lack of diligence.\n\n**c. Allegations Relating to the April 2000 Certification of BHP's 75% Interest**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThird, the Tribunal will address Respondent's allegation that the certification of BHP's 75% interest in April 2000 was procured by the making of illicit payments.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nOn the basis of both Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq's evidence, Respondent alleges that two bribes were paid to secure BHP's 75% interest in the JV despite BHP not having completed the steps required to earn such interest:\n\ni. PAK Rs. 500,000 was firstly paid by Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Burq in April 2000 to approve the 75% interest letter by the BDA to BHP; and\n\nii. Out of this money, Mr. Farooq was then paid PAK Rs. 100,000 in the same month which, together with the periodic payments to Mr. Farooq, ensured he did Claimant's bidding and directed the issuing of the letter by Mr. Baloch (General Manager (Mines) at the BDA).635\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 72; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 188 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 27, Farooq I, \u00b6 9 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 27.\n\n601.\n\nSuch funds were purportedly provided by Mr. Arndt and for the aforementioned reasons set out in Section VII.D.1.b above in relation to the Addendum, Respondent maintains that there is no convincing evidence to demonstrate that he was not involved in the project at this time.636\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 73, 322-344.\n\n602.\n\nClause 3.2 of the CHEJVA stipulates that to earn this interest in the project, BHP was required to complete, at a minimum, Stage One and Stage Two activities within six years of the Commencement Date (by 20 January 2000).637 Respondent maintains that Stage One activities included examining existing data, collecting sediment samples from the Exploration Area, analysis of the samples and presenting the results in map form. Pakistan submits that Stage Two activities comprised a more detailed sampling of any anomalous gold areas, with Mr. Pierce recognizing that it is common practice to fly aeromagnetic surveys over covered areas to ensure identification of all such anomalies.638\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 191-197.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2023 lines 2-17.\n\n603.\n\nRespondent highlights the alleged irregularity that although the Addendum was signed after 20 January 2000, it still contained a replacement Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA which retrospectively sought to change the requirements for BHP to earn its 75% interest by replacing the need for BHP to complete a Feasibility Study first, with the need for BHP to acquire up to 10 Prospecting Licences, a step that it had already taken by that date.639\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 194-196.\n\n604.\n\nNonetheless, even leaving aside this Feasibility Study issue, Respondent contends that there is substantial documentary and witness evidence demonstrating that despite these conditions not being met, BHP was able to nonetheless secure certification through to aforementioned bribes to key government officials.640\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 188-190.\n\n**(a) \"*****Smokescreen\"*** **Tactics - Downplay and Misstatement of Certification Requirements**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, Respondent alleges that Claimant engaged in two \"*smokescreen*\" tactics to ultimately divert attention away from its failure to earn its interest under the CHEJVA:641\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92.\n\n606.\n\nFirstly, Respondent submits that Claimant downplayed the importance of the certification requirement. Respondent argues that claiming that it was \"*not a contractual document,*\" \"*nowhere required under the CHEJVA,*\" was not true; Respondent maintains that it was in fact vital to the foundation of TCC's investment and a condition precedent in the Option Agreement.642\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 75-81 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 266 lines 4-10 *and* **Exhibit CE-12**, Article 5.1.1(c).\n\n607.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that Claimant repeatedly misstated the requirements for the earn-out, suggesting that BHP had completed the requisite activities by March 1998.643 According to Respondent, Claimant's position is that although Stage One and Two activities had been completed, it chose not to inform Respondent in order to \"*preserve its ability to apply for new prospecting licences to the west of the Joint Venture area*\" (the \"**Western Area**\")*.*644 However, Respondent argues that this argument not only mischaracterizes the requirements, but is flawed for the following reasons:\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 82-92.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 83 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 384 *and* Pierce, \u00b6 89.\n\n608.\n\nRespondent submits that, as acknowledged by Claimant's own witnesses, the earn-out conditions under the CHEJVA were not contingent on exploration in just the ten Prospecting License areas, but the full Exploration Area.645 Respondent maintains that this reference added as a result of the Addendum, simply referred to the maximum amount of Prospecting Licences BHP could hold at any one time.646\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 84 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2005 line 20 to p. 2006 line 1, p. 2013 lines 3-10, p. 2014 line 21 to p. 2016 line 14 and p. 2018 line 9 to p. 2019 line 9.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 84.\n\n609.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant cannot provide an explanation as to why communication of its purported completion would prevent BHP obtaining licences in the Western Area (in fact Mr. Pierce acknowledged that the only thing stopping the attainment was the existing license over part of the area held by another company).647\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 88 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-246**, pp. 1-2.\n\n**(b) The Record up to 20 January 2000 (the Deadline for Completion)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nPakistan draws the Tribunal's attention to the contemporaneous documentary evidence from 1997-1999 allegedly demonstrating that the status of BHP's works in this time period was not on schedule, including Operating Committee meeting minutes (showing postponement of the aeromagnetic survey, decreased drilling activity), BHP's Monthly Reports (showing that field work was still continuing) and a Summary prepared for the Chief Minister in relation to the Addendum (where it was noted that \"*BHP is now trying to prolong the period of exploration programme and pre-feasibility by changing the original clause 3.2 of the JVA*\" \u2013 indicating that BHP felt it could not complete the works on time).648\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 200.\n\n611.\n\nMoreover, while Mr. Hargreaves suggested that both Stage One and Two activities were completed prior to January 2000, Respondent notes that he fails to identify a single minute or report which confirms the same.649 Respondent argues that in fact, in direct contradiction with his account, Mr. Iqbal, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Tahir have all cast doubt on the timeliness of completion.650 Whilst Mr. Iqbal stated that, at the time of the 75% interest letter in April 2000, he knew that BHP had virtually stopped exploration work for at least two years, Mr. Farooq (as a member of the Operating Committee) stated that the activities required to complete Stage Two had not been completed in time.651 Respondent submits that Mr. Tahir in fact revealed that both he and his boss (the General Manager (Mines) at the BDA) knew that BHP had not met its exploration requirements.652\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 201 *referring to* Hargreaves, \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 201 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 24, Farooq I, \u00b6 9, Farooq II, \u00b6 26 *and* Tahir II, \u00b6 21.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 201 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 24, Farooq I, \u00b6 9 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 201 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 21.\n\n612.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant's reliance on a single letter from Mr. Schloderer to Mr. Farooq asserting that this milestone had been reached, should be treated with caution given the irregularities surrounding its background.653 Pakistan submits that this letter was a response to Mr. Farooq's suggestion in October 1999 of a discussion of the exploration program in an Operating Committee meeting \u2013 Respondent thus perceives it as unlikely that three months before the deadline for the BHP to obtain its interest, the BDA's response would be to assert completion of the very activities BHP wished to discuss.654\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 198-203 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 180 *and* **Exhibit CE-433**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 202.\n\n613.\n\nMoreover, Respondent highlights the oddities in the fact that this letter was sent to Mr. Farooq who was not BDA Chairman at that time, Mr. Schloderer did not specify the date of or the event that led to BHP earning its interest and he did not seek the BDA's confirmation that the BHP had earnt this interest (but waited another six months to do so).655 Respondent further questions the fact that Mr. Schloderer was not based in Pakistan at the time, no supporting documentation was attached to the letter and Mr. Schloderer acknowledged the fact that \"*exploration will continue,*\" something not easily reconcilable with his confirmation that Stage Two activities had been completed.656\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 202.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 202; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 97 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2138 lines 8-13.\n\n614.\n\nRespondent further maintains that the \"*key*\" document on which Claimant relies to argue that BHP had completed Stages One and Two by March 1998, the Information Memorandum, does not assist its case.657 To the very contrary, Respondent argues that it shows that Stage Two work was not complete at PL-8 (Durban Chah), PL-1 (Ganshero), PL-2 (Koh-I-Sultan), and PL-6 (Shah Umah).658 Moreover, despite Mr. Pierce referring to an unidentified geologist who had allegedly informed him that Stage Two was complete, Respondent maintains that he acknowledged that it was not clear from the Information Memorandum, or indeed any other documents on the record whether Stage Two had been completed.659\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 89 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2044 lines 2-6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90 *referring to* Information Memorandum, section 9.4, 9.5, 9.7 and 9.9.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2050 lines 7-19.\n\n**(c) The Record from Between BHP's Deadline for Completion (20 January 2000) and 14 April 2000 (the Date on Which the BDA Confirmed that BHP Had Earned Its Interest)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nRespondent refers to a BHP authored document (February 2000) allegedly explicitly confirming Stage One to be complete and not stating the same for Stage Two.660 Respondent maintains that when this report refers to ten licences (and indeed says that first-pass drilling has only been completed over five), it can only be referring to the Joint Venture's ten Prospecting Licenses given that BHP obtained licences in respect of the Western Extension in 2003.661 Respondent submits that this not only supports the argument that Claimant has mischaracterized the requirements of the earn-out but also that Stage Two had not been completed, and the January deadline missed.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 84 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-54**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87, 92.\n\n616.\n\nRespondent submits that Mr. Baloch's letter sent (March 2000) to the GOB's Director of the DMD regarding a Prospecting License clearly indicated that he perceived Stage Two activities to be continuing.662 Moreover, Respondent maintains that the Joint Venture obtained renewals for two Prospecting Licenses on 19 November 1998 and a further Prospecting License on 21 February 2000 \u2013 the timing allegedly suggesting, with reference to Clause 7.1 of the CHEJVA, that exploration activities were continuing in these areas beyond January 2000.663\n\nRespondent's Reply,

maintains that the Addendum (March 2000) did not state that the requisite activities had been completed. Respondent rejects Claimant's suggestion that Article 2.4 of the Addendum should be interpreted so as to acknowledge that the GoB \"*accepted the work performed by\u2026BHPM up until the date of this amendment as valid performance*\", and points the Tribunal to a literal interpretation of the provision which states that not only have Stage One activities been completed, but talks of the Prospecting Licenses obtained \"*in order to enable BHPM to conduct Stage Two activities.*\"664 Ultimately, Respondent questions why BHP would have insisted that reference be made to the Stage Two activities if they had in fact already been completed.665 Respondent rejects Claimant's dismissal of this as a \"*historical relic*\" on the basis that it also existed in BHP's 29 July 1998 draft of the Addendum as nonsensical since on Claimant's case Stages One and Two were complete by March 1998, four months before this draft.666\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 207-208 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 207-208 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 181.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 96 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-504**, Recital C, Transcript (Day 1), p. 269 line 19 to p. 270 line 4, TCC's Opening Slides, p. 138, Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 98-102 *and* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 384.\n\n**(d) The Record After the Certification of BHP's 75% Interest (14 April 2000)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n618.\n\nWhile Respondent asks the Tribunal to approach the Pre-Feasibility Study and the Feasibility Study (on which Claimant relies) with care since they were produced at the end of the 2000s, long after the event, it emphasizes that these documents actually undermine Claimant's arguments.667 Respondent maintains that these documents in fact confirm the shutdown of the works from April 1998 to 1999, contradict the BHP monthly report (3 April 1998) which noted that \"*field work\u2026is continuing*\" and made many other references indicating that Stage Two exploration works continued long beyond January 2000.668\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 209 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 181, **Exhibits CE-472** *and* **CE-99**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 209(f) *referring to* **Exhibits RE-245**, p. 1, **CE-472**, p. 3-4 *and* **CE-99**, p. 4-4.\n\n619.\n\nRespondent also maintains that other documents after this point in time undermine Claimant's case, including Mincor's Quarterly Reports, Operating Committee Minutes and the Option Agreement (April 2000) through which BHP passed on exploration activities to Mincor and TCC \u2013 Respondent argues that had these been completed by BHP, there would have been no reason to pass them onto Mincor.669\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 84.\n\n620.\n\nDespite Claimant rejecting these documents as \"*inapposite,*\" Respondent submits that it implicitly acknowledged that Stage Two had in fact not been completed by February 2000 when it stated that \"*of all the documents cited, only the new Prospecting Licence granted on 20 February 2000 could serve to affirmatively rebut BHP's position that it completed Stage Two activities.*\" This new license encompassed Prospecting License PL-4 within the Exploration Area. Therefore, Pakistan argues that even on Claimant's narrow interpretation of Clause 3.2 as identified above, the fact that this license was applied for in July 1999 rebuts the argument that activities relating to the Prospecting Licenses were completed by March 1998 \u2013 if they had been completed, there was no need to apply for another license over the same area of land.670\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 389 *and* Draft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 325-328.\n\n**(e) Anomalies in the Process of Certification**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n621.\n\nRespondent argues that the abundance of evidence in relation to completion of Stages One and Two Activities and the array of anomalies in the record surrounding the certification of BHP's interest surrounding the fact that the BDA should have scrutinized BHP's claims that it had earnt its 75% interest, indicate that key BDA officials were in fact bribed to avoid scrutiny of the certification.671\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 104-111.\n\n622.\n\nRespondent perceives BHP's Mr. Skrzeczynski's letter to the BDA Chairman, Mr. Burq, requesting the confirmation from the Governor of Balochistan of certification to be \"*suspicious.*\"672 Respondent argues that clearly in an attempt to avoid broader scrutiny, the letter failed to set out in a supplementary report or otherwise, how or when the interest was supposedly earned.673 Additionally, Respondent argues that Claimant selectively neglected to mention that the letter attached a draft confirmation letter which BHP requested be put on the Governor's letterhead.674 This represented a break from protocol, under which the Option Agreement envisaged such confirmation to be negotiated as part of the Addendum.675\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 213; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 213.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-12**, Article 5.1.1(c).\n\n623.\n\nRespondent maintains that despite knowing that the requisite activities had not been completed, Mr. Tahir and Mr. Baloch experienced extreme pressure from Mr. Farooq to provide certification as evidenced by a BDA file note dated 13 April 2000.676 Respondent alleges that despite both expressing their concern of providing a false certification, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Tahir were concerned that they would lose their jobs if they did not do as Mr. Farooq requested.677\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 107 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 21, Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 215 *and* Ex RE-256, BDA File Note dated 13 April 2000.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 214 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 22 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 26.\n\n624.\n\nRespondent submits that Mr. Tahir was allegedly purposefully vague in his response and attempted to shield himself behind the Law Department given his views on the status of the work.678 Respondent described this file note as \"*incriminating*\" since Mr. Tahir himself confirmed that \"*I wanted the shelter of the law so I would not have to take \u2013 carry the responsibility of confirmation on my shoulders.*\"679 Claimant's suggestion that Mr. Baloch, as Mr. Tahir's superior in fact decided to reject his suggestion to consult the Law Department and confirm the certification is perceived as questionable by Respondent given Mr. Tahir's evidence that this was not a decision for Mr. Baloch to make.680\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 107 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 215 *and* Tahir II, \u00b6 22(b).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 108-109; Transcript (Day 2), p. 504 lines 6-9 *and* Tahir II, \u00b6 22(c).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 110.\n\n625.\n\nOn 14 April 2000, Respondent maintains that Mr. Baloch signed off on the certification letter, which was countersigned by Mr. Farooq on the same day (despite his knowledge that work had not been completed and that MMDD and Law Department input had not been received).681 Pakistan maintains that Mr. Burq, having said to Mr. Iqbal when he received his bribe of PAK Rs. 500,000 that he would \"*see how the BDA could sign the letter,*\" approved it on the same day.682\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 215.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 107 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 27.\n\n626.\n\nRespondent submits that theses anomalies which culminated in the certification within just three days of the letter, without involving scrutiny from any department outside the BDA, nor requesting evidence that the activities had in fact been completed, cannot be ignored. Respondent maintains that the only plausible explanation for the series of events is that it was motivated by corruption, which, Respondent alleges, direct witness evidence confirms.\n\n627.\n\nTo the contrary, Respondent questions the reliability of Claimant's witnesses. Respondent submits that Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Pierce's respective testimonies fell apart in cross-examination, but also, the latter's replacement from December 1998 (Mr. Skrzeczynski) provides no concrete evidence to substantiate his opinion that Stage Two activities were complete.683\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has failed to establish any of its allegations in relation to the certification.684 As a preliminary issue, Claimant highlights that the main bribery allegation centers on the alleged payment from Mr. Iqbal (on Mr. Arndt's instruction) to Mr. Burq in April 2000. Claimant maintains that at this time Mr. Arndt was simply not delivering cash envelopes for his former employer.685\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 178\u2013181; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 381\u2013391; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 96 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 266 line 4 to p. 273 line 7.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 97.\n\n**(a) The Alleged Anomalies in the Certification Process**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nClaimant perceives Respondent's allegations of anomalies within the approval process as a desperate attempt to salvage its case. Claimant argues that the claims lack merit given that Respondent mischaracterizes the April 2000 certification letter \u2013 it was provided as Mincor came into the project and therefore tied into wider discussions on the status of exploration work.686\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 98.\n\n630.\n\nMoreover, Claimant argues the supposed anomalies in no way detracted from the legitimacy of BHP's Stage Two activities.687 Claimant emphasizes that TCC witness Mr. Skrzeczynski testified that the speed of Balochistan's approval of the certification was nothing out of the ordinary given that it was a culmination of a series of meetings and communications.688 Claimant further notes that Mr. Skrzeczynski denied that BHP's letter requesting confirmation required extensive supporting documentation because he would have explained the matter in meetings with any relevant official present.689 Claimant emphasizes the frank and open testimony of Mr. Skrzeczynski and suggests that this exemplified the contrasting credibility of TCC's witnesses who emphatically denied any involvement in corruption, and those presented by Respondent.690\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2150 lines 10-15.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2142 lines 12-21 *and* p. 2152 line 9 to p. 2153 line 12.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 98-100.\n\n**(b) Stage Two Activities Were Complete on Time**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant argues that, being unable to establish any corruption, Respondent tries to meet its burden by questioning the validity of BHP's Stage Two activities.691 Claimant also highlights that even if Respondent were able to raise doubts as to the completion of these activities, this would be insufficient to establish that an underlying act of corruption actually occurred.692\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101.\n\n632.\n\nClaimant argues that through an analysis of the witness testimony as well as documentary evidence (including periodic reports, various correspondence, the content of the Operating Meetings and the Information Memorandum which specifically detailed the extent of these activities), it is clear that contrary to Respondent's allegations, BHP had conducted the Exploration Program activities in accordance with the requirements of the CHEJVA.693 BHP's exploration activities were allegedly \"*undisputable facts.*\"694\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 383; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2144 line 22 to p. 2145 line 7.\n\n633.\n\nClaimant maintains that despite both parties agreeing at the time that the exploration work was satisfactory through the Addendum in which the GOB \"*accepted the work* performed *by\u2026BHPM up until the date of this amendment as valid performance,*\" Claimant argues that Respondent seeks to go back and question the legitimacy of this work.695 Claimant relies on the technical expertise and testimonies of both Mr. Skrzeczynski and Mr. Pierce who both confirmed that BHP had completed the work required to acknowledging the 75% interest.696 Claimant submits that Mr. Skrzeczynski further explained that \"*the officials at the time... also agreed that\u2014with my point of view, that adequate work had been done, therefore, they were comfortable to sign the letter acknowledging a 75 percent interest.*\"697\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 2.4.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2144 lines 7-15 *and* p. 2016 line 17 to p. 2017 line 1.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2144 lines 7\u201315.\n\n634.\n\nClaimant emphasizes the fact that Respondent's own witnesses had no answer to these undisputed facts and in particular focuses on the testimony of Mr. Iqbal who at one point conceded that he lacked expertise to opine of the completion of both Stage One and Stage Two activities and that he was not aware of contemporaneous documents showing progress of exploration works after July 1998.698 Additionally, Claimant highlights that Mr. Tahir, who was responsible for monitoring the progress of BHP's work on the project, raised no technical challenges when asked whether Stage One and Two activities had been completed.699\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 104 *referring to* Transcript (Day 2), p. 365 line 15 to p. 367 line 3 *and* p. 367 line 18 to p. 369 line 9.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 104 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-256**, p. 3.\n\n**(c) Respondent's Misplaced Challenge on BHP's Entitlement to Earn Its Interest**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nClaimant argues that, given that Respondent cannot deny the obvious completion of Stage Two activities, it then attempts to challenge BHP's entitlement to earn its 75% interest. It allegedly does this through relying on language in the Information Memorandum to claim that testing was not complete on the Prospecting Licenses, reading the recitals in the Addendum out of context and lastly, imposing on BHP a requirement to complete an aeromagnetic survey, all three facts which Mr. Pierce refuted at the December 2016 Hearing.700\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2047 lines 19-21 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 200-201, 207-208.\n\n636.\n\nFirstly, Claimant submits that although the Information Memorandum was a document designed to attract other geologists to the project by indicating that there was still *\"open-ended potential,*\" Mr. Pierce explained that the BHP geologists had indeed determined that the company had fulfilled the Stage Two requirements.701\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2047 line 22 to p. 2048 line 8 *and* p. 2050 lines 7-9.\n\n637.\n\nSecondly, Claimant alleges that Respondent construes the Addendum's recitals completely out of context to advance the argument that BHP failed to complete Stage Two activities. Respondent alleges that this preambular phrase (in which BHP acknowledged that Stage One activities had been completed, but Prospecting Licences were obtained in order to enable BHP to conduct Stage Two activities) was inconsistent with BHP's stalled operations by 1999 to 2000. Claimant however maintains that there is no such inconsistency given that the negotiating history of the Addendum demonstrates that this text remained the same from July 1998 and was entirely consistent with other contemporaneous documents at the time and was a remnant from earlier negotiations.702\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 388 *referring to* Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100, **Exhibits CE-501** *and* **CE-503**; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2064 lines 11\u201317, **Exhibits CE-504**, Recital C *and* **CE-2**, Recital C.\n\n638.\n\nThirdly, Claimant alleges that Respondent disregards the straightforward obligations of the CHEJVA and attempts to impose an obligation on BHP to complete a Feasibility Study and an aeromagnetic survey.703 Claimant maintains that such an obligation cannot be said to exist based on a plain reading of the Addendum and an understanding of both the intent and purpose behind the clause. Claimant submits that although BHP had initially planned to undertake an aeromagnetic survey, Mr. Pierce confirmed in his testimony that it cannot be ignored that the CHEJVA (as amended by the Addendum) did not prescribe such a survey \u2013 it simply gave BHP the discretion to determine and to use appropriate methods to carry out Stage Two activities.704\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 386-387.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 387 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Schedule A; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2078 line 17 to p. 2079 line 1.\n\n639.\n\nMoreover, Claimant deems Respondent's interpretation of the CHEJVA exploration obligations, namely that BHP was required to conduct the exploration works for the entire Exploration Area covering 13,000 square kilometers and that because the agreed exploration work for certain areas within the original Exploration Area was not yet finished, \"*Stage Two was not complete*\" when Mincor became involved, to be \"*commercially senseless.*\"705 Claimant submits that the framework of the agreement rested on BHP identifying those anomalies which justified further work, therefore as Mr. Moore testified, \"[y]*ou couldn't possibly expect any exploration company to test every single target, because targets range in quality from strong, high quality targets down to very vague.*\"706\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108 referring to Transcript (Day 8), p. 2014 line 21 to p. 2016 line 4, Transcript (Day 9), p. 2257 line 16 to p. 2260 line 10 *and* p. 2255 line 2 to p. 2257 line 19.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 108 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2258 line 16 to p. 2259 line 6.\n\n640.\n\nClaimant further refers to Mr. Moore's explanation that ongoing exploration work after January 2000 does not suggest that Stage Two was not complete and therefore the interest was not earnt. As has been acknowledged previously, Claimant had significantly expanded the scope of the exploration program.707\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 108 *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 227 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2257 line 16 to p. 2259 line 6.\n\n641.\n\nFinally, Claimant specifically questions the documentary evidence used by Respondent to allege that exploration works continued in the period after January 2000.708\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 389 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 205-208.\n\n642.\n\nClaimant specifically argues that, of all the documents cited, only the new Prospecting License granted in February 2000 could serve to affirmatively rebut BHP's position that it had completed Stage Two activities. Claimant submits, however, that despite BHP's efforts from 1997, the DMD did not grant the requisite approvals to enable BHP to obtain this license by 20 January 2000.709\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 389*.*\n\n643.\n\nClaimant further submits that Respondent's reliance on the timing of two license renewals on 19 November 1998 is also misplaced.710 Claimant asserts that in reality on 5 July 1999, BHP relinquished Prospecting License PL-2 and thus only kept one license.711 Claimant maintains that the fact that BHP had decided to relinquish nine licenses strongly suggests that it had completed Stage Two activities for those areas and the findings did not support a decision to conduct Pre-Feasibility work.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 390 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 206.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 390 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(al)**, p. 240.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n644.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of Respondent's allegations of corruption in the context of the certification of BHP's 75% interest in the Joint Venture in April 2000, the Tribunal recalls that as of 1998, BHP intended to farm out its interest in the Reko Diq Project to a third party. After negotiations with Iscor had failed, the only interested party in 1999 and early 2000 was Mincor with which BHP had agreed on certain conditions precedent, which included, *inter alia*, a \"*confirmation that BHP earned its 75% interest in the joint venture on completion of Stage 2 and selection 10 PLs*.\"712 While Article 5.1 of the Option Agreement between BHP and Mincor, which set out the conditions precedent, contemplated that the confirmation would form part of the addendum to the CHEJVA, the confirmation was ultimately provided by the BDA in the form of a separate letter dated 14 April 2000, which was signed by. Mr. Habibullah Baloch six weeks after the signing of the 2000 Addendum. The confirmation letter made reference to BHP's letter of 11 April 2000 to which BHP had attached, *inter alia*, a draft letter seeking confirmation for the Governor of Balichstan that BHP had earned its 75% interest in the Chagai Hills Joint Venture, signed by Mr. Skrzeczynski,713 and then provided:\n\n\"*It is confirmed that M/s BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. have earned secenty-five percent (75%) Percentage Interest in the above Joint Venture as defined in the JV Agreement pursuant to clause 3.2*.\"714\n\n**Exhibit CE-12**, Article 5.1.1 lit. c.\n\n**Exhibit RE-255**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-193**.\n\n645.\n\nWhile Claimant initially took the position that the certification of BHP's 75% in the Joint Venture was a \"*collateral matter*\" that did not form part of the foundational elements of its investment,715 it later included its submissions on the 75% interest in its discussion of what it referred to as its \"*foundational rights*.\"716 Taking into account that the confirmation of the 75% interest was one of the conditions precedent for the farm out of BHP's interest to Mincor and also taking into account the Tribunal's previous finding in its Draft Decision that Claimant's 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture that was thereby established was one of the two primary pillars of its investment,717 the Tribunal agrees that Respondent's allegation of corruption regarding the certification of the 75% interest pertains to a crucial element of Claimant's investment.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 167, 178-181.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 343, 381-391; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 53-65, 96-108.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 629, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 632.\n\n646.\n\nRespondent claims that the following bribes were paid \"*to obtain a 75% interest in the CHEJVA, despite BHP not having completed the steps required to earn that interest*\":718\n\ni. PAK Rs. 500,000 by Mr. Iqbal \u2013 out of funds provided by Mr. Arndt \u2013 to the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Burq, in mid-April 2000 \"*to approve the issue of the 75% interest letter by the BDA to BHP*\";\n\nii. PAK Rs. 100,000 by Mr. Burq \u2013 out of the amount paid to him by Mr. Iqbal \u2013 in mid-April 2000 \"*to reward him for taking steps to obtain the 75% interest letter for BHP despited the required works not having been completed including directing Mr Baloch (General Manager (Mines) at the BDA) to issue the letter*.\"\n\niii. \"*periodic payments to Mr Farooq*\" to ensure, together with the payment of PAK Rs. 100,000, that Mr. Farooq \"*did TCC's bidding, including by directing Mr Habibullah Baloch to issue the 75% interest letter to BHP.*\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 72; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 188.\n\n647.\n\nIn support of these allegations, Respondent has presented witness testimony from Mr. Farooq, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Tahir, which will be addressed in further detail below.\n\n648.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the alleged bribes achieved the result that BHP was able to obtain a certification of its 75% interest in the Joint Venture even though it had not completed the work necessary to earn such interest under Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA.719 In that regard, the Parties are in dispute as to: (i) the scope of works that had to be completed under Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA; and (ii) whether BHP had in fact completed that required scope of works within the six-year period provided by Clause 3.2. In addition, there is a dispute as to whether, even if it was established that BHP had failed to meet the requirements of Clause 3.2, this would be sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that the certification was procured by corruption.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 74.\n\n649.\n\nAs to the direct evidence of corruption, *i.e*, the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Tahir, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that the emphasis Respondent and its witnesses have placed on the role that Mr. Arndt allegedly played in negotiating and providing the funds for the bribery payment to Mr. Burq renders the question of Mr. Arndt's role in the alleged corruption a decisive element in the Tribunal's evaluation of Respondent's witness evidence on the respective payments. This consideration equally applies to the alleged payment made to Mr. Burq as well as to his alleged passing on of a share of this payment to Mr. Farooq in relation to the certification of the 75% interest. Nevertheless, the Tribunal will review the witness testimony presented by Respondent on this matter in detail.\n\n650.\n\nIn this context, Mr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*Soon after the Addendum was signed, BHP asked Mr Burq and me to give a written undertaking on the letterhead of the Governor of Balochistan that it had earned its 75% ownership rights of the Chagai Hill Joint Venture Agreement (**CHEJVA**). I knew that the CHEJVA required certain exploration work to be done by BHP in certain time frames, and that this had not been completed by BHP. This was also highlighted to me by the then General Manager, Mines, BDA, Habibullah Baloch and Mr Tahir. Instead of making any observations, forwarding it to Law Department, or initiating a summary for the approval of the Governor, I asked Mr Baloch to issue a letter stating that BHP was entitled to a 75% interest in the joint venture as per the CHEJVA. He did so and BHP's interest was certified. In return for ensuring this was done, Mr Iqbal paid Mr Burq and I Rs. 500,000, of which I received Rs. 100,000. The money was paid to Mr Burq, in my presence in his office, by Mr Iqbal*.\"720\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 9.\n\n651.\n\nMr. Iqbal, whose witness statement was submitted by Respondent together with its Reply, testified with regard to the alleged payment:\n\n\"*I attended a meeting in Quetta with Mr Schloderer, Mr Skrezecynski, Mr Burq and Mr Farooq, where a draft letter regarding the certification of BHP's interest was handed over to the BDA (this was the letter that was later signed by the BDA). I recall that Mr Burq referred the issue to his technical team \u2013 Muhammad Tahir and Habibullah Baloch \u2013 who were of the opinion that Stage Two activities had not been completed. Following this meeting, Mr Farooq, Mr Arndt and I met for dinner at the Serena Hotel, Quetta, where Mr Farooq explained that he had a problem as his subordinates at the BDA had said that Stage Two had not been completed and he could not bypass their views. He also said that the certification could not be provided on the Governor's letterhead, as was being asked by BHP.*\n\n*Shortly after our meeting with Mr Farooq, Mr Arndt gave me a sealed envelope and told me to deliver it to Mr Burq. I understood what was inside the envelope. I gave the envelope to Mr Burq in front of Mr Farooq in Mr Burq's office. The Chairman counted the money in front of me, which came to 500,000 Rupees. He said that he would see how the BDA could sign the letter. The letter was signed shortly after*.\"721\n\nIqbal, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\n652.\n\nIn his second witness statement, which was submitted together with Mr. Iqbal's witness statement, Mr. Farooq gave the following description of the alleged payment:\n\n\"\u2026 [D]*espite what I knew to be the truth, I told Mr Baloch and Mr Tahir to certify BHP's interest and I threatened Mr Baloch that if he did not agree to BHP's request I would send him back to his old employer, Saindak Metals. I discussed BHP's request with various representatives of BHP, including in a meeting in Mr Burq's office where we received the draft letters regarding BHP's 75% interest and the GOB's pre-emption rights and in a dinner meeting at the Serena Hotel where I told Mr Arndt and Mr Iqbal that Mr Burq would need to be paid to give the certification.*\n\n*Once BHP had Mr Burq's approval for certification of BHP's 75% interest, following the payment of Rs. 500,000 to Mr Burq, I instructed Mr Baloch to issue the letter as per the draft provided by BHP, without further approval by the Governor or CM or referring the matter to the Mineral and Law Departments. During the preparation of this statement, I was shown the BDA case file note that was produced at the time and which I signed on page 4. I can confirm that both Mr Tahir and Mr Baloch were telling me at the time that BHP had not completed the required work and that the input of the MMDD and the Law Department should be taken. This never happened and the file note was signed-off under my instruction*.\"722\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\n653.\n\nFor the reasons set out in detail in the context of the 2000 Addendum above, the Tribunal is convinced that Mr. Arndt was not involved in any illegitimate payments to Mr. Burq in early 2000, neither to secure the 2000 Addendum nor to obtain the 75% interest certification, as alleged by Respondent and testified by its witnesses, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Farooq. In the Tribunal's view, the absence of any additional evidence supporting this allegation and, in fact, the conclusion that the contemporaneous evidence in the record strongly indicates the contrary, *i.e*., that Mr. Arndt was not involved in any capacity with BHP at the time, is again a decisive element in the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence of corruption regarding the certification of the 75% interest. As the Tribunal is convinced that Mr. Arndt did not negotiate or provide the funds for any illegitimate payment to Mr. Burq, it likewise rejects the claim that Mr. Iqbal delivered the alleged amount to Mr. Burq in order to obtain the certification of BHP's 75% interest.\n\n654.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal will again also review the circumstantial evidence adduced by Respondent and assess whether such evidence may in itself justify drawing the conclusion that certain acts of corruption contributed to BHP's obtaining the 75% interest certification. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Farooq's testimony regarding the concerns expressed by Mr. Baloch and Mr. Tahir regarding the completion of the so-called Stage Two activities is confirmed by the witness testimony of Mr. Tahir, who testified in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*In April 2000, BHP sought certification from the Governor of Balochistan that it had earned its 75% interest in the CHEJVA. BHP provided a draft letter to this effect. I was asked by Mr Muhammad Farooq to expedite the processing of BHP's request. Part of my job description was to review the progress of the joint venture partner of BDA under the CHEJVA.*\n\n*Given the complexity of the CHEJVA, and my own doubts as to whether BHP had in fact met their exploration requirements, I suggested that we should seek the advice of the Law Department on whether to provide the requested certification or not. Mr Farooq refused to take this advice, and told me that the certification must be issued. Feeling uncomfortable with what Mr Farooq had asked me to do, I raised the issue with my immediate supervisor, the General Manager of Mines, Mr Habibullah Badini. Mr Badini processed the letter as requested by BHP, despite the fact that there was significant doubt as to whether it had earned the interest. This reinforced my belief that Mr Farooq was being paid to advance BHP's interests*.\"723\n\nTahir I, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n655.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Tahir added that when they received BHP's request on 11 April 2000, \"*Mr Farooq became very agitated and said that it had to be done and done quickly.*\" He added that \"*Mr Farooq continued to insist that we confirm that the stage one and two activities were complete and issue a certification letter as per the draft forwarded by BHP. Mr Farooq shouted at us, telling us not to question him on the matter and that we should not cause him any problems if we wanted to continue working at the BDA*.\"724\n\nTahir II, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22.\n\n656.\n\nMr. Tahir further testified that, contrary to Claimant's submission, \"*BHP had not achieved the exploration requirements necessary to gain its 75% interest under the CHEJVA when it sought certification on 11 April 2000*.\"725 Mr. Tahir further considered it \"*highly irregular*\" that the certification letter was issued by the BDA three days after receiving it and that it was not approved by the Governor.726\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 24.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 25.\n\n657.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are two different aspects to be assessed in this regard: (i) whether the activites that needed to be completed pursuant to Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA in order for BHP to earn its 75% interest were in fact completed; and (ii) whether, taking into account the result of the assessment under (i) but also the other surrounding circumstances, the issuance of the certification letter by the Chairman of the BDA within three days of receiving BHP's request consitutes sufficient evidence to infer that such letter was obtained by an act of corruption.\n\n**(a) The Fulfillment of the Contractual Requirements for Earning BHP's 75% Interest**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will assess the evidence submitted by both Parties in relation to the question of whether the requirements of Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA for earning BHP's 75% interest in the CHEJVA had been met when the contractually stipulated six-year period expired. At the outset, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties are in dispute as to whether the 2000 Addendum introduced substantive (or only linguistic) changes into Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA, in particular whether it retrospectively eliminated the requirement of completing a feasibility study within the six-year period provided in Clause 3.2 (or only clarified its non-existence). This dispute has been addressed in the Tribunal's analysis of the 2000 Addendum above. However, while Respondent considers it \"*clearly irregular and improper*\" that the 2000 Addendum, which was concluded after the expiry of the six-year period, included an amendment to the requirements for BHP to fulfill in order to earn its 75% interest,727 it does not argue that any of the parties involved raised this as an issue at the time or considered it necessary that a feasibility study had to be completed in order to issue the certification letter.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 195.\n\n659.\n\nIn their further submissions, the Parties focused on the question whether the requirements as set out in the amended Clause 3.2 were fulfilled. Consequently, and taking into account that the certification was issued after the Addendum was signed and thus the new Clause 3.2 had come into effect, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine the changes made to Clause 3.2 in any detail but will also limit its assessment to the amended provision as introduced in Article 5 of the 2000 Addendum. The new Clause 3.2 provides: \"*BHPM shall earn a seventy five percent (75%) Percentage Interest in the Joint Venture by conducting within six (6) years of the Commencement Date, at its own expense (subject to Clause 7.2) the Stage One Activities and Stage Two Activities and acquiring up to a maximum of ten (10) Prospecting Licences (as finally determined by BHPM) in accordance with Clause 5.4 of the JVA. If the Operating Committee resolves that a Feasibility Study should be commissioned pursuant to Clause 11.2 BHPM shall complete such Feasibility Study at its sole cost within the time allowed by the Operating Committee for undertaking such Feasibility Study.*\"728\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 5 amending Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA.\n\n660.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the Commencement Date referred to in Clause 3.2 was 20 January 1994 and thus that the six-year period for completing the activities ended on 20 January 2000.729 Respondent further does not dispute that, by 20 January 2000, BHP had completed Stage One activities as described in Schedule A to the CHEJVA.730 According to Mr. Pierce, Stage One activities had been completed \"*well before 1998*\" when he joined the Reko Diq Project.731 Mr. Farooq confirmed in his second witness statement that the completion of Stage One activities had been agreed in the 2000 Addendum.732 Finally, there is no dispute between the Parties \u2013 and Respondent explicitly recognizes \u2013 that BHP had acquired ten Prospecting Licenses before 20 January 2000.733\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 179; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 192 (with note 630).\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-1**, Schedule A.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 82.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 26 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-2**, Recital C.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 192 *referring to* **Exhibit C-2**, Recital C.\n\n661.\n\nConsequently, the debate focused on the question whether BHP had completed Stage Two activities, which are also described in Schedule A to the CHEJVA:\n\n\"*If any anomalous gold areas are established on the first pass sampling programme then detailed sampling of those areas would be carried out. This would initially involve repeat BLEG sampling (to confirm the anomaly) at a closer spacing, followed by any other geochemical techniques felt to be necessary to fully define the source of the anomaly/ies (including possible soil, ridge-and-spur and rock chip sampling). Small scale mapping may be necessary. Once the anomaly is more precisely defined the programme would be extended to establish the size and nature of the associated mineralisation by any techniques considered appropriate, including the possible use of geophysics, drilling, geochemistry and down-hole geophysics.*\"734\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Schedule A.\n\n662.\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Iqbal testified:\n\n\"*A month after the Addendum was signed the BDA signed a letter dated 14 April 2000 regarding BHP's earning of interest in the Joint Venture. At the time, I knew that BHP had virtually stopped exploration work for at least two years \u2026 and that in the Addendum signed just a month before, BHP had acknowledged that whilst Stage One was complete, Prospecting Licences were obtained to enable BHP to undertake Stage Two activities. In 1999, we had stopped doing almost all technical work on the project.*\n\n*To my knowledge, as Finance Manager at that time, no studies or firms were engaged, commissioned or paid to undertake a pre-feasibility study inside Pakistan. I was generally aware of the work that was going on, as I was in charge of putting together reports to the BDA, which included a technical section. I had general discussions with Mr Schloderer and others regarding the status and phase of the work throughout this period. For example, I knew that the aerial survey was a big part of Stage Two, and we were all very excited about this study, but from 1997 onwards it was postponed. To my knowledge, it did not take place before the Addendum was signed. Late in 1999, Mr Schloderer provided me with a thin document that was described as a pre-feasibility study, which he asked me to submit to the BDA. Before this date, I had not heard of this document and I do not believe that the team in Pakistan had anything to do with preparing it.*\"735\n\nIqbal, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\n663.\n\nWhile Mr. Farooq did not comment on the (lack of) completion of Stage Two activities in his first witness statement, he testified in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*I received a letter from John Schloderer on 6 October 1999, which TCC refers to in its Opposition. Mr Schloderer said in the letter that Stage One and Stage Two activities had been completed, although he also said that further exploration work was required. I do not think I replied to this letter, although I do remember asking Mr Arndt why this letter had been written and saying that the matter needed to be discussed in detail at an OC meeting. No report or study was attached to the letter to justify this statement.*\n\n*I remember that a Pre-Feasibility Study (Stage Three work) was sent to the BDA, as is mentioned in Mr Schloderer's letter. This document consisted of some tables and maps without any mining, financial or development plans, and it was not taken seriously by the BDA. This document was also restricted to the Reko Diq Prospecting Licence and did not cover the larger CHEJVA area. I had raised the question of the Pre-Feasibility Study taking place during the 20 March 1999 OC meeting, where it was decided that the dates for a Pre- Feasibility Study was a matter for the OC; I do not remember a further OC meeting in 1999 where approval for commencing a Pre-Feasibility Study was discussed or given.*\n\n*So far as I am aware, the activities required to complete Stage Two had not been completed by 14 April 2000. BHP had been doing little work during 1998 and 1999 and my colleagues, Mr Habibullah Baloch (General Manager (Mines)) and Mr Muhammad Tahir (Additional General Manager (Mines)), expressed concern to me that Stage Two activities were incomplete. In fact, at the time that the 2000 Addendum was signed a few months later, we (the BDA and BHP) only agreed to state that Stage One activities had been completed*.\"736\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\n664.\n\nAs quoted above in full, Mr. Tahir testified in his first witness statement that \"*there was significant doubt as to whether [BHP] had earned the interest*.\"737 In his second witness statement, Mr. Tahir explained:\n\n\"*I am a geologist by profession and my immediate boss Mr Baloch was a mining engineer. We were the only two technical officers in the Mines Division of the BDA and were therefore solely responsible for monitoring progress. Under the CHEJVA, BHP had to complete certain* 'stage one' *and* 'stage two' *activities before it was entitled to earn a 75% interest in the joint venture. This was a technical matter and therefore Mr Baloch and I were also responsible for certifying whether the stage one and stage two activities were complete. When we received the letter from BHP on 11 April 2000, both of us knew that BHP had not completed these activities and that it had in fact found another party to farm out its exploration duties and rights to*.\"738\n\nTahir I, \u00b6 9.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 21.\n\n665.\n\nIn the contemporaneous file note of the BDA, Mr. Tahir prepared a note on 13 April 2000 in which he did not explicitly state whether or not Stage Two activities were in fact completed but rather suggested to obtain advice on the interrelation of the relevant legal provisions of the CHEJVA and the Addendum before confirming to BHP that it had earned its 75% interest in the CHEJVA.739 In his note of 14 April 2000, Mr. Baloch then stated in relevant part: \"*As AGM Mines confirmed \u2026 that BHP has completed the exploration works as per agreement during six years exploration programme, if approved the* [confirmation letter] *will be issued to BHP.*\"740 Both Mr. Farooq and Mr. Tahir confirmed that Mr. Baloch's remarks were approved by the signatures of Mr. Farooq and Mr. Burq on the same date.741\n\n**Exhibit RE-256**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-256**, p. 4.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 22 lit. d; Farooq II, \u00b6 27.\n\n666.\n\nClaimant takes the position that Stage Two activities were completed \"*well in advance of the contractually determined date \u2026 for the ten areas over which BHP held Prospecting Licenses*\" and that BHP had thus fulfilled its obligation to earn its 75% interest by 20 Jaunary 2000.742 In this regard, Claimant relies in particular on the witness testimony of Mr. Pierce and Mr. Skrzeczynski.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 383, 391.\n\n667.\n\nMr. Pierce testified in his witness statement that he had \"*no doubt in* [his] *mind that BHP fulfilled its obligations well before 2000 and was entitled to its 75% interest*.\"743 As to the disputed Stage Two activities, Mr. Pierce stated:\n\n\"[B]*y March 1998, BHP had already conducted significant exploration activities, nearly completed a Concept Study, and prepared an Information Memorandum for prospective joint venture partners. The Information Memorandum set out in detail the Stage Two works performed by BHP. It was clear from this Memorandum that BHP had completed Stage One and Stage Two works for the ten prospecting licenses BHP held at the time*.\"744\n\nPierce, \u00b6 75.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 85.\n\n668.\n\nMr. Pierce made specific reference to section 9 of the Information Memorandum, which \"*establishes that Stage Two activities were also completed \u2026 for each of the ten prospecting license areas*.\" According to Mr. Pierce, \"[i]*t is clear that Stage Two does not require that all areas must be drill tested provided that BHP employed other appropriate techniques*.\" He further explained that \"*BHP used various techniques within the scope contemplated by the Exploration Program to satisfy Stage Two activities*\" and added that \"[w]*hile an aeromagnetic survey would have been helpful, especially for the western extension area, it was not required as part of Stage Two activities in the original exploration area*.\"745 Mr. Pierce further testified:\n\n\"*Even though BHP had completed Stage One and Two activities for the ten PLs that it held at the time, in some correspondence we expressed to the BDA that Stage Two activities were* 'well advanced,' *which could suggest that they were not yet complete. The reason for that, as we explained several times to the BDA and the GOB, was that the results from Reko Diq indicated that there were potentially promising resources to the west of Reko Diq. BHP was keen to conduct additional testing if the BDA and GOB would agree to expand the scope of exploration and we hoped to swap out our existing prospecting licenses for new licenses over the expanded areas. If we were able to expand the Joint Venture's exploration activities to the west of Reko Diq and obtained new prospecting licenses, there would be additional Stage One and Stage Two works required for these new areas. However, as I mentioned earlier, the GOB did not respond, in a timely manner, to BHP's proposal. Since that left BHP with only the original ten PLs, in which BHP had already completed Stage One and Stage Two activities, BHP had earned its 75% interest*.\"746\n\nPierce, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88, 95.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 89.\n\n669.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the Parties are in dispute as to whether Stage Two activities had to be completed exclusively within the area covered by the ten Prospecting Licenses that BHP held as of 20 January 2000, as argued by Claimant,747 or whether this requirement applied to \"*any anomalous areas identified within the entire Exploration Area*\" as alleged by Respondent.748 During the hearing, Mr. Pierce first confirmed that Stage One activities applied to the full Exploration Area, which spanned 13,000 square kilometers. When asked whether \"*Stage Two involves looking at all of those anomalous areas, which were identified under Stage One and doing more detailed sampling of those anomalous areas,*\" he answered in the affirmative.749\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103. *See also* \u00b6 107.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 78.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2005 line 20 to p. 2006 line 17.\n\n670.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's interpretation of BHP's exploration obligations under the CHEJVA would \"*contravene industry practice and be commercially absurd*.\"750 In support of this argument, it relies on the testimony of Mr. Moore. Having confirmed that the Alliance Agreement between BHP and Mincor concluded in October 2002, concerned certain exploration activities for areas within the original Exploration Area and upon Respondent's suggestion that this meant that Stage Two activities had not been completed when Mincor became involved in the project in 2000, Mr. Moore answered:\n\n\"A. \u2026 [N]*o, I don't think it does. You would carry out this sort of program on every target that you came across. So, there were lots of targets. And what BHP would have done, I presume, is test the very best targets. And then there were these other targets. And an exploration is always a range of targets in lower and lower ever lower priority.*\n\n*So, in an exploration program, what you have to do is prioritize and test your best targets first. And then sometimes if they don't pan out to you, that's when you lose interest and get someone else to come in and test the other targets at no cost to yourself, which is exactly what BHP did here.*\n\n*Q. So, are you suggesting that actually it was in BHP's discretion to decide what it considered financially the most promising target, and just to do Stage Two for that, and then leave Stage Two for the other items for later?*\n\n*A. You couldn't possibly expect any exploration company to test every single target, because targets range in quality from strong, high quality targets down to very vague, you know, maybe/maybe-not-type targets.*\n\n*So, yes, the exploration company, the person spending the money, must have the discretion as to when to stop spending money. It was the interest to find something if they think that the chance of finding something now by spending yet more money on this 5th or 6th or 7th priority target. If there is no value in doing that, they must be allowed to make that decision*.751\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 108.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2257 line 16 to 9. 2259 line 6.\n\n671.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the requirement to carry out Stage Two activities within \"*any anomalous gold areas \u2026 established on the first pass sampling programme*\" as provided in Schedule A to the CHEJVA required BHP to complete those activities over areas outside of the areas covered by its ten Prospecting Licenses in order to earn its 75% interest. The Tribunal understands that in the absence of a Prospecting License, BHP was not permitted to carry out exploration works over a certain area, which is why BHP considered to swap some of its existing licenses for new licenses within an extended area.752 Pursuant to Clause 5.3.1 of the CHEJVA, the Joint Venture was further not permitted to hold more than ten Prospecting Licenses at the same time.753 The Tribunal also understands that, while BHP had applied for an extension of the Exploration Area within which it then intended to apply for new Prospecting Licenses (while relinquishing some of the original ones) in late 1997, the extension was granted only in February 2000 and Claimant was still holding the ten original Prospecting Licenses (even though it had relinquished nine of them by July 1999) when the six-year period expired on 20 January 2000.754 Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider that Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA should be interpreted to require BHP to carry out exploration works over areas that were not covered by the ten Prospecting Licenses it held and in which it was thus not even permitted to carry out any Stage Two activities at the time.\n\n*Cf*. Pierce, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 106.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, clause 5.3.1. *See also* **Exhibit CE-2**, Article 5 amending Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA.\n\n*Cf*. Pierce, \u00b6 92; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 86.\n\n672.\n\nHowever, this question does not have to be answered conclusively if, as alleged by Respondent, BHP also did not complete the Stage Two activities within the areas that were covered by its ten Prospecting Licenses. In that regard, Claimant refers to the Information Memorandum that BHP prepared in the context of its intention to farm out its interest in the Reko Diq project to a third party in March 1998. According to Claimant and Mr. Pierce, this Memorandum confirmed that BHP had already completed Stage Two activities within the ten areas covered by the Prospecting Licenses by that time.755 Mr. Pierce further testified that section 9 of the Memorandum resulted in \"*recommendations to relinquish almost all of these licenses*\" \u2013 except for Reko Diq.756\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 383 and Pierce, \u00b6 85 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-500**.\n\nPierce, \u00b6 87.\n\n673.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the language used in the Information Memorandum in fact indicates that at least for some of the Prospecting Licenses, Stage Two activities may not have been complete in early 1998.757 Specifically, as regards Prospecting License PL-8 at Durban Chah, section 9.4 describes the works carried out and concludes that \"[t]*he prospect remains inadequately tested*.\"758 As for Prospecting License PL-1 at Ganshero, section 9.5 notes that \"[t]*his system has not been drill tested*.\"759 Regarding Prospecting License PL-2 at Koh-I-Sultan, section 9.7 notes that \"[t]*he prospect is considered to have potential for both epithermal gold and porphyry copper mineralization*.\"760 Finally, as for Prospecting License PL-6 at Shah Umar, section 9.9 notes that \"[t]*his prospect has been briefly followed up*\" but that \"*the prospect has been adequately traversed and it is recommended that this program is completed*.\"761 For four other Prospecting Licenses, the respective sections concluded that these Licenses were to be relinquished.762\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90.\n\n**Exhibit CE-500**, section 9.4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-500**, section 9.5.\n\n**Exhibit CE-500**, section 9.7.\n\n**Exhibit CE-500**, section 9.9.\n\n**Exhibit CE-500**, sections 9.2, 9.3, 9.6 and 9.8.\n\n674.\n\nWhen pointed to the language in section 9.4 during the hearing and asked whether this suggested that further testing would be needed, Mr. Pierce testified:\n\n\"*I think you have to realize--that this in context. This was meant as--to attract other geologists to this Project, and to leave some open-ended potential was considered--is often done in these Information Memorandums. But specifically to this, the geologists would have determined that, based on their ground surveys, the results of those drill holes, that it is very unlikely we would find a deposit we were interested in.*\n\n*So, the decision was made not to do any further drilling, but we still didn't know exactly what was there. So, there is potential, but we had made a decision that we had completed the work, and we weren't going to do anything more on it*.\"763\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2047 line 22 to p. 2048 line 13.\n\n675.\n\nAfter he had explained that the geologists had recommended to do no further drilling on that specific Prospecting License in light of the comparison to the findings made at Reko Diq, Mr. Pierce was further asked the following:\n\n\"*Q. And if you have a certain amount of resources to invest--a certain limited amount of resources to invest, why you might prioritize one or the other. But the question we're exploring here is whether, for the purpose of your contractual obligations and exploring the full Exploration Area, actually, you had done the adequate testing that was required.*\n\n*And the question was not whether Reko Diq is better, but was, rather, you had sufficiently ascertained what the resources were here to say that Stage Two is completed?*\n\n*A. Well, I guess it's also fair to say that I wasn't in on that decision-making. The geologist had criteria that they examined to prioritize further work, and it was determined that, with the information they had, there were other higher priority areas and, yes, there was potential.*\n\n*It doesn't mean--but to the word of the Agreement, we believe we had fulfilled--the geologist told me they had fulfilled Stage Two. I wasn't part of that decision-making process.*\n\n*Q. So, the geologist informed you, you were done with Stage Two?*\n\n*A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. But, in fact, that's a decision that they've taken based on the information available to them?*\n\n*A. Correct.*\n\n*Q. And it's not clear on the information available to us, is it?*\n\n*A. No.*\"764\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2049 line 12 to p. 2050 line 19.\n\n676.\n\nClaimant further points to the fact that that BHP did relinquish eight of its ten Prospecting Licenses in December 1998 and a ninth one at Koh-I-Sultan in July 1999 and argues that this confirms that BHP considered Stage Two activities completed for these areas and decided that the findings did not support a decision to progress to Stage Three.765 When asked about the documentation of the completion of Stage Two activities and the recommendation to relinquish all of the Licenses (except for Reko Diq), Mr. Pierce answered:\n\n\"*A. I think, internally, there was discussion about that. I wasn't party to it because the drilling program was certainly complete. The full drilling program that was identified in the Fiscal Year 1998 had been completed by--I believe it had been completed by the time this Information Memorandum was completed.*\n\n*Q. So, in fact, you're saying it's not clear from the Information Memorandum, but there may be other documents that we haven't seen which show that?*\n\n*A. That drilling was completed or that--what's your question?*\n\n*Q. That Stage Two was completed for these 10 Prospecting Licenses by March '98.*\n\n*A. I'm not aware of any other documentation, no*.\"766\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 390 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(al)**, pp. 234, 240.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2056 lines 4-17.\n\n677.\n\nClaimant also relies on a letter from Mr. Schloderer to Mr. Farooq dated 6 October 1999.767 In that letter, Mr. Schloderer apparently responded to certain items of discussion suggested by Mr. Farooq in a letter of 4 October 1999 and stated in relevant part:\n\n\"*The conduction of exploration program has been in accordance with the terms and conditions of our JV agreement and has been completed prior to the January 20, 2000 target date, which is six years from the commencement date. Stage One and Two activities have been completed for the Exploration Area and the final PL selection made.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*We do not see any need for extension of the time period for the exploration. Exploration has been completed for the exploration area resulting in the final selection of the Reko Diq PL. Exploration will continue on the Reko Diq PL under the terms of the PL that has an initial period of 2 years with a 3-year renewal.

BHP regularly reported the progress of its exploration activities in Operating Committee Meetings and to the Government of Balochistan in Quarterly and Annual Reports as well as reported in the Pre-Feasibility Study presented to the BDA. By a letter dated 6 October 1999, BHP reported to the BDA that it had already completed a detailed exploration program. Because BHP had completed the steps necessary to earn its 75% interest as provided in the CHEJVA, the government's certification of that interest was simply recognition of a contractual right BHP had already earned*.\"771\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 33.\n\n680.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, Mr. Hargreaves did not make reference to any specific OC meeting or any specific quarterly or annual report where the completion of Stage Two activities was reported or discussed. In fact, regarding the progress of exploration activities, Mr. Hargreaves made reference to: (i) an OC meeting of 10 October 1997 in which it was noted that \"[m]*ajority of stage 1 activities have been comnpleted. Drilling and other exploration work is underway*\";772 and (ii) an OC meeting of 17 November 1997 in which the work program for June 1998 to May 1999 was discussed, which was to include \"*geological mapping, stream and soil geochemistry, ground geophysical techniques such as magnetics and electromagnetics, drilling, ore reserve calculations, environment and socioeconomic studies, metallurgical tests, transportation studies, hydrological investigations, security analyses, etc.*\"773 The Pre-Feasibility Study that was apparently provided to the BDA at the time is not in the record and has not been discussed in any detail by the Parties.774 As for the completion of such activities, Mr. Hargreaves' sole reference was to the 6 October 1999 letter from Mr. Schloderer.775 Mr. Hargreaves did not comment further on this issue in his second witness statement. When asked about his statement during the hearing and whether this was within his personal knowledge, Mr. Hargreaves answered:\n\n\"*A. Other than the fact that, after coming into Tethyan as an employee, I was able to discuss more fully and see the Reports and the results of the work that had been carried out.*\n\n*Q. But you weren't involved at the time, were you?*\n\n*A. No. But I think these statements refer to knowledge that I gained as--after mid-2005, when I became an employee of Tethyan*.\"776\n\n**Exhibit CE-431**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-432**.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 203 (note 669). To the Tribunal's knowledge, the document was not mentioned in Claimant's Rejoinder or its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n**Exhibit CE-433**.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2337 line 22 to p. 2338 line 7.\n\n681.\n\nIn addition, Respondent relies on a report of BHP dating from February 2000 entitled \"*BDA \u2013 BHPMIE CHAGAI JV, BALOCHISTAN, PAKISTAN*\" in which the status of work is described as follows:\n\n\"*A joint venture agreement was signed in 1993 between BHPMIE and the Government of Balochistan through Balochistan Development Authority (BDA). Stage One of the agreement i.e. regional reconnaissance over 13000 square kilometers (probably the largest porphyry belt held by any single N) has been completed using fly camps and field teams working in very remote areas. Access to some areas is very difficult and in some instances, field teams had to use camels and traverse on foot for several days. 10 prospects for Stage Two i.e. detailed exploration have been identified. Access tracks to these prospects have been developed.*\n\n*At the first prospect, Reko Diq where about 16800 meters have been drilled, we have hit mineralisation and encouraging assays have been obtained. Further drilling and surveys are necessary to delineate higher grade reserves which would make a mine viable. First pass drilling has been completed over five out of the ten prospects. Ground magnetic surveys, detailed geological mapping, surface sampling, topographic surveys, etc, are in hand. An aerial survey is planned in 1999. The N has exclusivity for this aerial survey area till February 2000.*\n\n*A cross cultural team has been developed at the project which is performing well under adverse climatic and logistic conditions*.\"777\n\n**Exhibit RE-54**, p. 2.\n\n682.\n\nRespondent also points out that Recital C of the 2000 Addendum, which was signed in March 2000 and thus after the expiry of the six-year period, provides:\n\n\"*Pursuant to the terms of the JVA, BHPM, on behalf of the Joint Venturers, has completed Stage One Activities (as defined in sub-clause 1.1 of the JVA) and has identified certain anomalous mineralised areas in respect of which the BDA and BHPM have jointly obtained ten (10) Prospecting Licences in order to enable BHPM to conduct Stage Two Activities on behalf of the Joint Venturers*.\"778\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Recital C.\n\n683.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Pierce noted that this language had been included in the 19 July 1998 draft and testified that \"[i]*t is clear that the language of the draft Addendum reflected our stated position in 1998, and its inclusion in the final Addendum of March 2000 was a remnant from our negotiations in 1998*.\"779\n\nPierce, \u00b6 100.\n\n684.\n\nWhen asked during the hearing whether the language in Recital C suggested that Stage Two activities were not completed, Mr. Pierce answered:\n\n\"*A. I can't disagree with that, but that wasn't my decision, whether Stage Two was finished; it was the geologist's decision.*\n\n*Q. But if the geologist had told you Stage Two was completed, why wouldn't you reflect that in the Addendum language?*\n\n*A. I believe it's because we had until January of 2000 to commit to that.*\n\n*Q. But we discussed earlier the importance of keeping a proper documentary record and updating your Joint Venture partner on progress on the exploration, didn't we?*\n\n*And we agreed that it would be important for you, apart from anything else, to show that BHP had done what it needed to, to have a proper documentary record, wouldn't it?*\n\n*A. Documentation is important, yes.*\n\n*Q. But, in fact, all the documentation that we have available suggests that Stage Two is not completed, doesn't it, at least at this stage?*\n\n*A. I'd have to agree with you, yes. It's not what I was told, but the documentation says that.*\n\n*Q. So, you agree with me that, on the basis of the documentation, including the Information Memorandum we looked at, it doesn't appear that Stage Two was completed at that stage, does it?*\n\n*A. The answer is yes, but as I've also stated, I wasn't the decision-making point to declare Stage Two done. That was the responsibility of the geologists to declare Stage Two done, and they had verbally told me that.*\"780\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2065 line 1 to p. 2066 line 11.\n\n685.\n\nClaimant considers Respondent's reference to documents dating from after 20 Jaunary 2000 \"*inapposite*\" and argues that, instead, \"*only the new Prospecting License granted on 21 February 2000 could serve to affirmatively rebut BHP's position that it completed Stage Two activities.*\"781 As pointed out by Respondent, this new Prospecting License PL-14 encompassed the area covered by PL-4 as well as additional land.782 According to Respondent, the only reason to apply for a new Prospecting License over the area covered by PL-4 was that Stage Two activities had not been completed for that area \u2013 given that it could have applied for an exploration license instead if it intended to proceed with Stage Three.783\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 389.\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibit CE-502**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101.\n\n686.\n\nRespondent also points out that the Option Agreement concluded between BHP and Mincor on 28 April 2000 provided for an Agreed Programme to be conducted by Mincor under the Alliance Agreement, which was concluded on 3 April 2002. Part 1 of this Agreed Programme consisted of \"*Drill Testing Bukit Pasir, North Kohi-Dalil & SW Kohi Dalil*\" as well as ground magnetics, trenching and sampling and reverse circulation drill testing. Part 2 consisted of an \"*Airborne EM Survey*,\" \"*Ground follow-up of EM Survey Results*\" and \"*Drill Testing of EM targets*.\"784 Respondent submits that all of these activites formed part of Stage Two activities under the CHEJVA and also makes reference to the subsequent reports and documents authored by Mincor and Claimant, which, in its view, support that exploration works forming part of Stage Two activities were carried out years after the expiration date.785 During the hearing, Mr. Moore confirmed that the areas of Bukit Pasir in North and Southwest Koh-e-Daleel were within the area covered by the Reko Diq license, *i.e*., Prospecting License PL-14, which later became Exploration License EL-5.786\n\n**Exhibit CE-12**, Schedule 1; **Exhibit CE-15**, Schedule 1.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 209.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2256 line 2 to p. 2257 line 3.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that when BHP requested confirmation of its 75% interest by letter of 11 April 2000, it did not attach any documents that would confirm the fulfillment of the requirements under Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA and, specifically, the completion of Stage Two activities. Mr. Skrzeczynski, who signed the letter on behalf of BHP, explained this as follows:\n\n\"*It would have been addressed--no, there was nothing attached to those letters, because it was addressed in the meetings that I had with the Chairman. I would have explained that, in my belief, we had justifiably earned our 75 percent interest. And that would have been core to the conversations, and they accepted it*.\"787\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2142 lines 15-21.\n\n688.\n\nWhen asked whether BHP's Joint Venture partner would have expected to see documents demonstrating that they had met their obligation, he testified:\n\n\"*Yes. And, again, because I wasn't operating the Project, I can't speak to that. But in all Joint Ventures with BHP and any other major company, you provide annual reports. If the Joint Venture says quarterly reports, you provide quarterly reports. In those reports would be the expenditure statements. That is just routine, standard business.*\n\n*Now, those documents must exist because there is no doubt that they would have been provided. So, all that information would be available and recorded.*\n\n*The issue that I think you are concerned with is with the definition of* 'Stage Two,' *was it exactly ticked off to the letter. And the answer to that question is, the definition of Stage Two work from a professional explorationist like myself is loose at best.*\n\n*But BHP had done significant work. 20,000 meters of drilling is a lot of drilling for an exploration Project. $8 million spent in the ground is a lot of money. We had done all the regional kind of work required to define anomalies. We had done additional work on the anomalies.*\n\n*So, in my opinion, when I visited the Project, made a technical assessment, walked the rocks, visited all the prospects, I was absolutely satisfied that we had completed Stage Two conditions, and that's what I managed to agree with the Chairman or whoever was the officials at the time. They also agreed that--with my point of view, that adequate work had been done, therefore, they were comfortable to sign the letter acknowledging a 75 percent interest.*\"788\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2143 line 7 to p. 2144 line 15.\n\n689.\n\nMr. Skrzeczynski further explained that the visit he was referring to was his first visit to Pakistan, together with Mr. Schloderer, which \"*may have been towards the end of '98*\" before Mr. Pierce left. He stated that, being an exploration geologist with over 45 years' experience, he would have gone and \"*see the critical things*,\" noting that \"[m]*ost of the work was done at Reko Diq where mineralization was discovered*.\" When asked whether he was thus relying on his personal assessment during that visit rather than any particular record that would demonstrate the completion to the BDA, he answered that \"*I have no records I can point you to, but the project records would be there. John Schloderer is also as an experienced explorer as I am. So, it can't be made up; I mean, it's just fact*.\"789 When asked whether he would not expect that a certification of BHP's 75% interest in the CHJEVA would be agreed and established on a proper documentary record before the interest was earned, he concluded:\n\n\"*Not necessarily because, as I mentioned before, the term of Stage Two was a very general definition, a very general definition. There are no specific things like X number of meters, exactly how many dollars, exactly how many samples. There are no numerical numbers; it is descriptions of generalized work. And, as I explained to you before, we did 20,000 meters of drilling, which is enormous. We did all the follow-up sampling that was required. We spent $8 million on the ground.*\n\n*And that quantum of work, in light of the definitions of Stage Two requirements, virtually all those points had been hit. Now--and as I say, it is not a quantifiable definition there. So, in good judgment and in good faith with the two Joint Venture Parties, we agreed--we agreed that Stage Two had been completed and 75 percent had been earned based on the effort that went in; not on any other peripheral, based on the work that was done*.\"790\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2144 line 22 to p. 2147 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2148 lines 3-21.\n\n690.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence set out above, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced that BHP had completed the Stage Two activities as agreed under the CHEJVA within the areas covered by the ten Prospecting Licenses it held at the time the six-year period provided in Clause 3.2 expired on 20 January 2000. Both Parties agree that the question of whether BHP had earned its 75% interest in the Joint Venture was a matter of fact rather than of regulatory discretion.791 The Tribunal is aware that the evidence of Claimant's witnesses indicates that the question of whether Stage Two activities were completed nevertheless involved a certain commercial judgment to be made by BHP and, possibly, its Joint Venture partner, in particular as to whether further exploration work should be conducted to fulfill the requirement of \"*detailed sampling of* [anomalous] *areas*.\"792\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 382; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 76.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Schedule A.\n\n691.\n\nHowever, neither Claimant nor any of its witnesses, in particular Mr. Skrzeczynski who applied for the certification in April 2000, could point to any document or to any specific meeting in which the completion of Stage Two activities was discussed. While there were numerous documents confirming that progress was made regarding these activities, they all described certain Stage Two activities as still outstanding or ongoing. There is no contemporaneous, documentary evidence \u2013 except for the 6 October 1999 letter signed by Mr. Schloderer, which did not attach any supporting documents \u2013 to establish that the Joint Venture partners had reached the conclusion that Stage Two activities were in fact completed. Mr. Skrzeczynski's reference to a site visit with Mr. Schloderer as well as to verbal statements made by BHP's geologists in this regard, both of which were not documented in any manner, did not convince the Tribunal.\n\n692.\n\nIt further appears from the record, and this is also indicated in Mr. Schloderer's letter of 6 October 1999, that further exploration work was to be carried out by Claimant in and after 2000 within the Reko Diq area, *i.e*., the area covered by the new Prospecting License PL-14. It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether these works were carried out within the area that was also covered by the original PL-4 and/or within the additional area where BHP was permitted to carry out exploration work only after it had been granted the larger PL-14 in February 2000. However, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that works were carried out within the entire area for which BHP had applied for a new Prospecting License, which included the original PL-4.\n\n693.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that BHP had fulfilled the requirements of Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA even when limiting the requirement of completing Stage Two activities to the areas covered by the ten Propsecting Licenses it was holding when the six-year period expired in January 2000. However, the possibility that the GOB might have refused the certification on that basis, does not exclude that the Joint Venture partners validly agreed in April 2000 that BHP had earned its 75% interest in the CHEJVA. Importantly, the record shows that even though Stage Two activities may not have been complete at the time, BHP had carried out a substantial amount of work. In the circumstances prevailing at the time, there may well have been legitimate reasons for the GOB to acknowledge BHP's interest in the CHEJVA. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls its findings above that the certification was one of the conditions precedent for Mincor to become involved in and further develop the project \u2013 at a time when BHP had decided that the project did not fulfill its internal requirement for further development. In the absence of any other interested parties, the GOB may well have been interested to have Mincor take over BHP's role in order to ensure the future development of the project.\n\n694.\n\nConsequently, the above assessment does not support a conclusion that the certification of BHP's 75% interest must have been the result of illegitimate payments. Therefore, secondly, the Tribunal will assess whether the process by which the certification letter was issued indicates that illegitimate payments were made.\n\n**(b) The Process by Which the Certification Letter Was Issued**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n695.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the letter dated 14 April 2000 by which the BDA confirmed that BHP had earned its 75% interest in the CHEJVA, was issued three days after it had received the request from BHP seeking such confirmation on 11 April 2000. There is further common ground that BHP's letter did not attach any supporting documents that would confirm the completion of Stage One and Two activities but, instead, \"*a draft of a letter seeking confirmation from the Governor of Balochistan that BHP has earned a 75% interest in the Chagain Hills Joint Venture*\" and asked that \"*the government may provide* [BHP] *with its consent in accordance with the above referred draft letters on its letterheads.*\"793\n\n**Exhibit RE-255**. At the same time, BHP also attached a draft letter \" *seeking certain consents to ist pre-emptive right pursuant to the Chagai Hills Joint Venture*.\" This issue will be addressed in the section on the 2000 Deed of Waiver and Consent below.\n\n696.\n\nRespondent considers it \"*suspicious*\" that BHP asked for this matter to be dealt with in a separate letter rather than in the Addendum itself, as it had been contemplated in the conditions precedent agreed with Mincor in the Option Agreement.794 However, while Respondent suggests that the purpose of this approach was to avoid broader scrutiny of the matter within the GOB, in particular by the Law Department,795 the Tribunal notes that BHP did ask that the letter be issued on the Governor's letterhead rather than by the BDA itself. As with the authorization letter issued by the Governor in the context of the 2000 Addendum, it may well have involved such \"*broader scrutiny*\" if the BDA had followed up on this request and obtained the signature of the Governor. The Tribunal again does not have to express an opinion as to whether the approach that was ultimately taken by the BDA, *i.e*., to issue the letter itself with the approval of its Chairman, was in compliance with the provisions of the 1976 Business Rules. Even a possible violation of these Rules by the BDA would not establish any wrongdoing on the part of BHP, including the making of an illegitimate payment.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 213.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105.\n\n697.\n\nRespondent further considers it \"[a]*stonishing*[]\" that it took only three days from BHP's request to the issuance of the letter by the BDA.796 As testified by Mr. Iqbal, the letter was handed over by Mr. Skrzeczynski and Mr. Schloderer during a meeting with Mr. Burq and Mr. Farooq.797 When pointed to the fact that no supporting documents were attached to the letter, Mr. Skrzeczynski testified that \"*it was addressed in the meetings that I had with the Chairman. I would have explained that, in my belief, we had justifiably earned our 75 percent interest. And that would have been core to the conversations, and they accepted it*.\"798 The Tribunal considers it likely that Mr. Skrzeczynski did explain to the Chairman of the BDA during the meeting on 11 April 2000 the reasons why they considered that BHP had \"*justifiably earned* [its] *75% interest*.\" It is also plausible that he explained that a confirmation of this interest was required under the Option Agreement with Mincor, the terms of which were outlined in a separate letter dating from the day before (to which a copy of the Option Agreement was attached).799 When asked whether he was surprised that the certification from the BDA came in within 72 hours of requesting it, Mr. Skrzeczynski answered:\n\n\"*Not necessarily. I think I must have done a good job, and I would have explained the need for urgency, and the need for urgency was so that we could get on, you know, and negotiate something which would be a win-win for both Parties. So, it's excellent that I got it back in that period of time. I couldn't predict how long it was going to take. I would have been very grateful*.\"800\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 216.\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 26.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2142 lines 16-21.\n\n**Exhibit CE-192***.*\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2150 lines 10-17.\n\n698.\n\nWhen Respondent pointed Mr. Skrzeczynski to the description in his witness statement of the process required to obtain the 2000 Addendum and the certification of BHP's interest and his statement that \"[a]*ll this took a long time*\"801 and suggested that this appeared to be \"*an astonishingly fast exchange*,\" Mr. Skrzeczynski answered: \"*Yes. But that was the conclusion of all of that process. That was the conclusion. It was agreed and the letter came back.*\"802 He further clarified that \"*one of the important meetings*\" he was referring to was with the Chief Secretary and, even though he could not remember the exact meeting, stated that \"*I would have gone through as long and as detailed as necessary to explain to the gentleman why it was reasonable and just that we should reach agreement.*\"803 When pointed to the fact that the minutes of the meeting held between Mr. Skrzeczynski, Mr. Schloderer, Mr. Iqbal, the Chairman of the BDA, the General Manager (Mines) of the BDA and the Chief Secretary on 11 April 2000 did not make reference to any discussion of the certification of BHP's 75% interest, Mr. Skrzeczynski stated:\n\n\"*No. It was a very\u2014clearly, it wasn't a minuted meeting and it wasn't a Joint Venture meeting. It was probably\u2014it was me. It was me as the new person trying to reach agreement with a third party explaining to the Chief Secretary what was happening. These must be the minutes that they produced, and I have no comment as to why they did it.*\n\n*But all those matters were obviously satisfied because they agreed to my proposed letters*.\"804\n\n*Cf*. Skrzeczynski, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2151 lines 4-9.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2152 line 16 to p. 2153 line 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2154 lines 13-21.\n\n699.\n\nEven though there is no reference in the meeting minutes to any discussion of the 75% interest certification, Mr. Skrzeczynski maintained that \"*that would have been a critical meeting*\" and that \"*there would have been discussions \u2026 largely because I was there*.\" He concluded that \"*it could have been another meeting. But it believe that was probably that meeting that I would have given my full explanation*.\"805\n\nTranscript (Day 8), p. 2155 line 11 to p. 2156 line 8.\n\n700.\n\nRespondent further places emphasis on the internal BDA file note concerning BHP's request, in particular the note prepared by Mr. Tahir on 13 April 2000, which has already been discussed above, and his corresponding witness testimony.\n\n701.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Tahir described the process for issuing the certification letter as follows: Upon receiving an internal file note from Mr. Baloch, which he initiated \"*under pressure from Mr Farooq*,\" Mr. Tahir was \"*intentionally vague in* [his] *response*\" and \"*deliberately did not confirm whether the stage one and stage two activities had been completed*\" but suggested that \"*before confirming to BHP \u2026 advice from the Law department may please be solicited.*\"806 According to Mr. Tahir, he used this language in order to \"*take shelter from the Law Department*\" because he knew that the required activities had not been completed but was \"*under a great deal of pressure from Mr Farooq*.\" Mr. Tahir further stated that, in his view, Mr. Baloch's subsequent statement on the same file note that \"*AGM Mines confirmed vide Para 96-98 ante that BHP has completed the exploration works as per agreement*\"807 was a deliberate \"*incorrect interpretation of [his] remarks*\" by Mr. Baloch, which was then approved by Mr. Farooq and Mr. Burq.808\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 22 *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-256**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-256**, p. 4.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 22.\n\n702.\n\nMr. Tahir further testified it was \"*highly irregular that the certification letter was provided by the BDA on 14 April 2000, just three days after it was requested by BHP on 11 April 2000.*\" Mr. Tahir further considered it \"*equally as irregular that this letter, which recognised for the first time that TCC had supposedly earned its 75% interest, a very significant milestone, was not put before the Governor of Balochistan for approval, as other issues of this importance were (for example, the Addendum) and as BHP had requested in its draft letter of 11 April 2000, where it asked that the certification be provided on the letterhead of the Governor of Balochistan*.\"809\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 25.\n\n703.\n\nAs noted above, Mr. Tahir's note indeed does not in itself confirm that Stage Two activities were complete. There is also no dispute that his immediate supervisor, Mr. Baloch, did not seek advice from the Law Department but issued the confirmation letter to BHP on the next day. While it is not clear from the file note why Mr. Baloch decided not to follow up on the advice of Mr. Tahir, this conduct does not establish an act of corruption. In fact, Respondent does not allege that Mr. Baloch received any illegitimate payment but rather that he was threatened by Mr. Farooq that he would lose his job if he did not sign the letter. However, even if the Tribunal were to consider such threat established, it would not constitute an act of corruption and, in any event, it would not be attributable to BHP.\n\n704.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Baloch signed the certification letter only after it had been approved by the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Burq. The Tribunal has already noted above that it does not believe that Mr. Arndt negotiated and provided the funds for any bribery payment to Mr. Burq and, as a consequence, that Mr. Iqbal delivered the alleged amount to Mr. Burq in order to obtain the certification of BHP's 75% interest. The same also applies to the alleged passing on of a share out of this payment to Mr. Farooq, which Respondent claims to have ensured, together with alleged \"*periodic payments*,\" that Mr. Farooq directed Mr. Baloch to issue the confirmation letter.810 As noted above, neither Mr. Farooq nor Mr. Iqbal's testimony support Respondent's allegation that the alleged periodic payments to Mr. Farooq were made in connection with any of the 2000 instruments. In any event and for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that these payments did not occur.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 188 lit. b.\n\n705.\n\nThe Tribunal also cannot infer the making of an illegitimate payment from the possibility that the GOB might have refused to accept that BHP had fulfilled the requirements of Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA when the six-year period expired in January 2000. It is apparent from the contemporaneous evidence on the record as well as from the testimony of Claimant's witnesses, in particular Mr. Skrzeczynski but also the testimony discussed in the context of the 2000 Addendum, that BHP made it clear to the GOB at the time that it was not interested in continuing to develop the project and that Mincor was apparently the only party who was.\n\n706.\n\nBHP also informed the GOB by a letter of 10 April 2000 of the terms on which Mincor was willing to enter into the project. Mincor was asking for a certification from BHP's Joint Venture partner that BHP had earned its 75% interest in the joint venture because BHP otherwise would not have had any secure contractual position to transfer. The GOB was interested in making progress with the project, which it knew would only happen if it allowed for the eventual transfer of BHP's contractual position under the CHEJVA to Mincor. The Tribunal therefore considers it plausible that the GOB may have been willing to acknowledge and confirm BHP's 75% interest in the CHEJVA even though it might have been arguable that some Stage Two activities in the Reko Diq area were still outstanding.\n\n707.\n\nIt may indeed appear unusual that the BDA issued the certification letter only three days after receiving BHP's request and without asking for supporting documents or a justification that Stage One and Two activities had been completed. However, it again has to be taken into account that the GOB was not acting in its function as a regulatory authority but rather in its function as BHP's Joint Venture partner with a 25% interest in the Joint Venture that would progress only once the transfer of BHP's interest to Mincor was completed. This may also explain why it was decided by Mr. Tahir's supervisor Mr. Baloch and the Chairman of the BDA Mr. Burq, who both participated in the meeting with Mr. Skrzeczynski and Mr. Schloderer on 11 April 2000, to issue the certification letter without seeking advice from the Law Department first. Against this background, the Tribunal cannot conclude from the circumstances surrounding the certification of BHP's 75% interest, that it must necessarily have involved illegitimate payments.\n\n708.\n\nConsequently, it can again be left open whether any payment, if established, would have been attributable, firstly, to BHP and, secondly, to Mincor and Claimant.\n\n**d. Allegations Relating to the June 2000 Deed of Waiver and Consent**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n709.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal will assess Respondent's allegation that June 2000 Deed of Waiver and Consent was procured by the previous making of illegitimate payments and the promise of further such payments in the future.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nRespondent notes that the Deed of Waiver and Consent was one part of a series of transactions in 2000 which led to Mincor/TCC's involvement in the project, given that under the CHEJVA, the GOB had a right to either refuse the transfer to Mincor/TCC or to exercise its pre-emption rights to itself take on BHP's interests.811\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 222, 224-226.\n\n711.\n\nRespondent alleges that three particular bribes or offers of bribes were particularly relevant to securing the Deed -\n\ni. Mr. Arndt promised Mr. Burq in mid-2000 that he would receive payments in the future provided he supported the Deed,812\n\nii. As well as receiving regular payments from BHP, a couple of months earlier, Mr. Farooq received the following proportions of two sums of money paid by Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Burq;\n\ni) PAK Rs. 2 million in relation to the Addendum; and\n\nii) PAK Rs. 500,000 in relation to the 75% certification of interest.813\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 219 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 29.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 133-218; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119.\n\n712.\n\nRespondent alleges that the consequences of such bribes were twofold. Firstly, Respondent maintains that such bribes diverted key GOB decision-makers away from adequately considering whether to exercise its right to withhold consent to the transfer from BHP to Mincor. Secondly, the evidence allegedly demonstrates that the BDA, and specifically those individuals who had been paid by BHP in relation to the Addendum and certification, played a key role in facilitating the Deed.814\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 221.\n\n**(a) There Was Reason for the GOB to Object to the Transfer**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that an element of cause would have been required for GOB to object to the transfer under Clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA, which it alleges existed due to the fundamental attributes of Mincor/TCC.815 Respondent emphasizes that Claimant was in agreement that BHP was one of the \"*most highly reputed mining companies in the world,*\" whereas Mincor in stark contrast was a \"*junior company*\" boasting both little experience and few profits and assets.816 In its Reply, Respondent displays in a table a comparison of BHP and Mincor's status, including their respective assets and operating revenue.817 Respondent alleges that given the comparably weak status of Mincor, it would have been expected that the GOB would question its introduction into the project and specifically how it would provide the required finance.818 Respondent alleges this to be the very reason for which the Addendum introduced the concept of external financing as discussed previously.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 227, 230-235.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 231 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 111 *and* Hargreaves I, \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 232.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 233.\n\n**(b) Anomalies in the Approval Process**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n714.\n\nWhile Respondent acknowledges that there were some deliberations by the relevant stakeholders over \"*whether GoB would exercise its preemptive right or consent to the transfer*,\" it alleges that there were clear anomalies in the Deed approval process including: (i) the emphasis on the GOB's pre-emption rights (Clause 14.3 of the CHEJVA), rather than its ability to withhold consent (Clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA); (ii) the improper influence of BDA individuals to whom payments were offered and/or had been paid; and (iii) the haste with which these deliberations were conducted.819\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 236 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 145.\n\n715.\n\nFirstly, Respondent highlights the ambiguity introduced through the Addendum in Clause 14.3.1 \u2013 it is left unclear whether Clause 14.3 is seeking to supplement Clause 14.1 or replace it (thus leaving it unclear whether the GOB retained the ability to block a transfer of BHP's rights if they did not consider the counterparty was suitable, rather than simply match the best offer BHP was able to procure from an interested party, regardless of suitability).820 Respondent maintains that Claimant exploited this ambiguity given that the GOB correspondence with key decision-makers only expressly referenced GOB's preemptive rights under Clause 14.3 and did not refer to its right to withhold consent under Clause 14.1.821 Respondent provides a range of evidence to substantiate this point including the 10 April 2000 letter from BHP to the Governor and the subsequent working papers for the Cabinet addressing BHP's proposal dated 10 April 2000 and 12 May 2000, all of which it alleges did not draw attention to GOB's entitlement to withhold consent.822\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 228-229.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 236-240.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237.\n\n716.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent maintains that when the Finance and Law Department's vetting was requested on 17 April 2000, Mr. Baloch again failed to mention the relevant blocking provision. Respondent therefore alleges that the Governor was never actually directly informed that the GOB had such a right if it considered Mincor an unsuitable replacement.823\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237(g).\n\n717.\n\nRespondent also advances evidence to suggest that there was indeed concern about Mincor's involvement and lack of credential which was raised in the meeting of BHP and BDA representatives as well as the Chief Secretary on 11 April 2000 and echoed by the DMD, the Industries Department and the Finance Department.824 This evidence allegedly demonstrates that, had the relevant stakeholders have known of their right under Clause 14.1, consent may well have been withheld.825\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 239.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 239 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 12.\n\n718.\n\nRespondent maintains that nonetheless, on 23 June 2000 the BDA wrote to BHP agreeing to transfer the interest using the draft letter provided by BHP in April of the same year.826 However, Respondent maintains that in stark contrast to the Summary provided to the Governor, this letter did indeed refer to both clauses with Mr. Burq allegedly signing this letter in order to demonstrate to BHP that he had \"*delivered*\" for them.827\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237(h) *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(ap)**, p. 39.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237(h) *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 28.\n\n719.\n\nSecondly, Respondent maintains that the deliberations were influenced by key BDA officials who had already received bribes in relation to the Addendum and certification of interest. In the face of Claimant's suggestion that this is merely *\"theorized*\" by Pakistan, Respondent refers to a \"*contemporaneous documentary record*\" to corroborate its allegation.828\n\n; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 131 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 392.\n\n720.\n\nRespondent submits that this demonstrates that Mr. Burq as BDA Chairman was heavily involved in the approval process and therefore his willingness and loyalty to assist BHP can only be explained by the bribes he had already received.829 In fact, Respondent alleges that BHP was so confident in his loyalty that the only necessary bribe for Mr. Burq concerned deferred incentives.830 Respondent submits: If Mr. Iqbal's evidence regarding this promise of a future payment to Mr. Burq was invented to suit Respondent's interests as alleged by Claimant, why would Mr. Iqbal only have invented a future incentive, rather than an actual bribe?831 Additionally, Mr. Iqbal's section 161 statement was dated 11 March 2016, the same day which Claimant filed its Opposition \u2013 Respondent therefore argues that there is no way Mr. Iqbal could have seen the Opposition when NAB interviewed him in order to provide a fictitious statement with the intent to plug a gap in Respondent's case.832\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 238.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 238.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 130.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-491**, p. 5; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111.\n\n721.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent maintains that Mr. Tahir played an important role in the process including preparing the revised Working Paper and liaising with BHP regarding comments from the Industries Department. Such willingness is allegedly due to the bribe he had already received in relation to the Addendum.833\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 179, 238(b).\n\n722.\n\nRespondent also maintains that while Mr. Baloch had not received a bribe, he nonetheless played a key role in the improprieties surrounding both the Addendum and the certification of interest and whilst Mr. Farooq's involvement in the Deed approval process was minimal, nevertheless, his willingness to assist can also be explained by the bribes he had already received.834\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 238(c)-(d).\n\n723.\n\nThirdly, Respondent maintains that the BDA was able to ensure that the process was hastily conducted with Mr. Tahir noting that everything was done in a hurry despite the importance of the transaction and the normal bureaucratic Balochistani procedure.835 Respondent thus submits that the speed of the transaction therefore also demonstrates a further anomaly in the Deed approval process.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 238(f) *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 26.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nClaimant perceives the attack on the Deed to be \"*remarkable*\" given that it was not even mentioned in Respondent's Application and therefore was initially \"*not the subject of any of Pakistan's corruption* allegations.\"836 Claimant maintains that despite acknowledging that the Deed was subject to stakeholder deliberations, in its Reply, for the first time, Respondent alleged that the Deed was corruptly procured.837 Claimant maintains that Respondent has not alleged that any direct payments were made to procure the Deed, but attempts to impugn the Deed on the basis of payments \"*relevant to*\" other agreements.838\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 392; Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 139.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 392 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 219-246, Farooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 *and* Iqbal, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 109.\n\n725.\n\nClaimant argues that not only is this allegation demonstrably false to the extent it relies on Mr. Arndt's involvement in April or June 2000, but it is also contrary to the documentary record which shows that the Deed was indeed subject to the normal review process by no less than ten government departments (including the Chief Secretary, the Industries Department, the Finance Department, the Law Department, the Cabinet, and the Governor).839 Claimant further maintains that Respondent itself acknowledges that the Deed was executed following careful deliberations.840\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 392 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 145.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111.\n\n726.\n\nClaimant suggests that Respondent's allegations are based entirely on the notion that BDA could have misled other departments of the Balochistan Government about their right to object to the transfer. From Claimant's perspective, this gives the Government far too little credit.841 On a plain reading of Clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA, it is wholly evident that BHP can only assign its interest to Mincor with \"*the prior consent of the non-assigning party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.*\"842 Simply because this clause had allegedly \"*not been pointed out by the BDA*\" does not convincingly demonstrate that this provision was overlooked by the relevant government departments.843\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 393 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 237.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 393 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause. 14.1.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 393 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 237(d).\n\n727.\n\nWhat is more, Claimant does not accept Respondent's argument that, had Clause 14.1 been considered, the GOB would have objected to the transfer. Claimant submits that the documentary record demonstrates that on review, the GOB perceived the transaction to be in the Province's best interests.844 Claimant further argues that Respondent even acted on the advice of an independent legal advisor who determined that the GOB's interests were protected by the transfer.845\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 394 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(ap)**, p. 37.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 112 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(ap)**, p. 38.\n\n728.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent misunderstands Mincor's role in this project and the general nature of the exploration mining industry.846 Respondent places significant emphasis Mincor's relative lack of credentials, and specifically lack of financial capabilities in comparison to BHP.847 Claimant maintains that not only is there no merit in the suggestion that Mincor would not have been able to access the same kind of debt finance as the global mining giant that is BHP, but Mr. Moore explained that \"*there are very few\u2026companies that go into a project with all the financing for the whole thing lined up from the start*\" *-* day one capital cannot be equated to a lack of qualification for the project.848 Claimant's witness further testified that the intention was always for Mincor to finance the project over time by issuing shares and offering equity to investors as Mincor upgraded and expanded the project.849\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 395.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 233.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 115 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 395 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 231 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2304 line 9 to p. 2305 line 10.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 395 *referring to* Moore, \u00b6 62.\n\n729.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent ignores the reality of the situation, namely, that which both Mr. Moore and Mr. Hargreaves confirmed in their respective testimonies \u2013 Mincor was an ideal Joint Venture partner and while BHP was indeed a more established company, its interest in the project had diminished significantly. Claimant maintains that to the contrary, Mincor was not only fully focused on the project, but also had the backing of a multi-billion dollar company in the form of Iscor and the benefit of Mr. Moore's 20 years of experience with global mining projects.850 Claimant thus rejects the suggestion that, because Balochistan could have questioned Mincor's credentials, the Tribunal should infer nefarious dealings.851\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 396; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 114 *referring to* Moore, \u00b6 59-61 *and* Hargreaves, \u00b6\u00b6 9-13.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 114.\n\n730.\n\nUltimately, Claimant argues that in view of the history of negotiations and the approval process of the 2000 instruments, one cannot reach the conclusion that those instruments were not commercially sensible for all parties and thus Claimant deems it \"*insulting*\" that Respondent claims that Balochistan was somehow tricked by TCC through alleged bribery.852 Claimant maintains that after open discussions about an investment in a project that no one but Mincor/TCC wanted, Balochistan made a reasonable decision that it knew would be to its benefit.853\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n731.\n\nAs a final event in 2000, the Tribunal will assess Respondent's allegation of corruption in connection with the Deed of Waiver and Consent that was signed by the Chairman of the BDA on behalf of the GOB and by BHP on 23 June 2000. By means of this document, the GOB, *inter alia*, \"*agreed*[d] *to waive any and all pre-emptive rights which it ha*[d] *under Clause 14.3 of the JVA* [as amended by the 2000 Addendum] *with respect to each of the Transfers and agree*[d] *that BHPM and MINCOR are free to conduct the Transfers between themselves without compliance with those pre-emptive rights*\" and further gave \"*any and all consents which it must provide under Clause 14.1 of the JVA with respect to the various transfers of interest under the JVA between BHPM and MINCOR in circumstances set out in the Option Agreement*.\"854\n\n**Exhibit CE-194**, Clauses 2 and 3 lit. a.\n\n732.\n\nThe Deed of Waiver and Consent corresponded to a further condition precedent agreed between BHP and Mincor in the Option Agreement, *i.e*., that \"[t]*he GOB and BDA have executed a Deed of Waiver in terms of which they waive any pre-emptive rights which may affect the transfer of interests between BHP and Mincor as required by the Alliance Agreement.*\"855\n\n**Exhibit CE-12**, Article 5.1.3.\n\n733.\n\nRespondent does not allege that any specific bribe was paid by BHP to obtain this document but claims that:856\n\ni. Mr. Arndt rejected a request for immediate payment but promised to Mr. Burq in mid-2000 that he would receive payments in the future once the project expanded \"*for procuring the approval of the DOWC and for signing it*\";\n\nii. the alleged recent bribes paid to Mr. Burq, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Tahir in relation to the 2000 Addendum and the certification of BHP's 75% interest \"*bought the BDA's cooperation*\";\n\niii. alleged \"*other regular payments previously received* [by Mr. Farooq] *from BHP*\" were made to earn his \"*continuous loyalty.*\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 219.\n\n734.\n\nAs to the results of the alleged \"*bribes, promises of bribes and Mr. Farooq's pressure*,\" Respondent refers to the fact that the GOB waived its pre-emptive rights under clause 14.3 of the CHEJVA and gave its consent under clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA. According to Respondent, \"*the insertion of Mincor, a new company and a mining minnow, without a tender and on more favourable terms than had been given to a mining giant BHP, was not in the GOB's interest*.\"857\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\n735.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent's allegations in respect of the Deed of Waiver and Consent are closely related to the same allegations it has made in respect of the Addendum and the certification of BHP's 75% interest. First, Respondent makes reference to the alleged illegitimate payments made to obtain the 2000 Addendum and the certification letter. The Tribunal has rejected Respondent's evidence as to the making of these payments. In addition, the Tribunal has found that Respondent has failed to prove that Mr. Arndt was acting in any capacity for BHP and, in fact, that he was even in Pakistan in early 2000. The Tribunal sees no reason to make a different assessment for the alleged promise by Mr. Arndt of future payments to Mr. Burq in mid-2000.\n\n736.\n\nSecond, Respondent again refers to \"*other regular payments*\" that Mr. Farooq had allegedly previously received from BHP, which, together with the alleged payments in connection with the Addendum and the 75% interest certification, led him to \"*order*[] *Mr Baloch and Mr Tahir to cooperate with Mr Iqbal to process the DOWC quickly*.\" As noted above, neither Mr. Farooq nor Mr. Iqbal's testimony supports Respondent's allegation that the alleged \"*regular payments*\" were made in connection with the 2000 instruments. In any event and for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal does not accept that these payments occurred.\n\n737.\n\nThird, Respondent again invokes the terms of the Addendum as being more favorable to the GOB's Joint Venture Partner than those of the CHEJVA. The Tribunal has addressed those terms in detail above and, while agreeing with Respondent that the Addendum indeed introduced significant changes into the CHEJVA that were more favorable to BHP, it also considered that the GOB may have had legitimate reasons for accepting those terms. This included in particular the undisputed fact that BHP was no longer interested in further pursuing the project and that the Addendum, the certification and the Deed of Waiver and Consent were conditions precedent under the Option Agreement by which Mincor became involved in the project.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Respondent further alleges the existence of certain \"*anomalies in the process of approval*\" of the Deed of Waiver and Consent, arguing that: (i) the GOB was under a misapprehension as to its rights under the CHEJVA as the discussions focused on whether the GOB should exercise its pre-emptive rights under clause 14.3 of the CJEVA, which were subject to a 90-days time limit, and not on whether the GOB should give or withhold its consent under Clause 14.1, which did not provide for a time limit; (ii) individuals at the BDA \"*who were favourable to BHP*\" and to whom payments had allegedly been made and/or offered \"*played a key role in recommending and facilitating the approval*\" of the Deed; and (iii) discussions were \"*relatively quick*\" in light of the GOB's previous agreement with the Addendum and the certification of BHP's 75% interest; and (iv) \"*there is evidence to suggest that there was concern amongst the GoB/BDA as to Mincor's involvement*\" and that, if the right under clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA had been known to the relevant stakeholders, \"*consent to the transfer may have been withheld*.\"858\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 236-239.\n\n739.\n\nAs to the first aspect, it is common ground that, by letter of 10 April 2000, BHP notified the BDA pursuant to clause 14.3 of the CHEJVA that it had received a proposal from Mincor to establish an Alliance Agreement by which Mincor could earn a share of BHP's interest in the Joint Venture. BHP outlined the structure and terms of the Alliance Agreement, attaching a copy of the Option Agreement, and concluded that this letter served as notification under clause 14.3.2 of BHP's intentions to enter into the Alliance Agreement, thus triggering the 90-day period for the GOB \"*to elect to enter into an agreement with BHP on the exact terms and conditions as the Option Agreement.*\"859\n\n**Exhibit CE-192**.\n\n740.\n\nRespondent notes that in its letter, BHP did not draw the BDA's attention to \"*the separate right to withhold consent to the transfer under Clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA if it believed Mincor was unsuitable.*\"860 However, as Respondent itself noted, BHP's letter to the BDA of 11 April 2000 attached a draft letter to be signed on the Governor's letterhead, which made reference to clauses 14.1 and 14.3.2 of the CHEJVA.861 In the working paper for the Cabinet prepared by Mr. Baloch on 10 April 2000, there is no reference to clause 14.1 but the Cabinet decided on 11 April 2000 that the BDA obtain the views of the Law and Finance Departments in this matter.862 In his letter to the Law and Finance Departments of 17 April 2000, Mr. Baloch again only referred to clause 14.3 of the CHEJVA.863\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237 lit. a.\n\n**Exhibit RE-255**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, pp. 6-8, 24.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, pp. 19-20.\n\n741.\n\nThe Law Department responded on 25 April 2000 that it returned the draft Option Agreement unvetted because \"*the Administrative Department has not specified the points on which they intend to seek advice of the Department*\" but also noted that \"*from perusal of the record it has been observed that at present no law point is involved in the matter which requires considerable consideration of this Department*,\" leaving it up to the BDA \"*to deal with the matter in accordance with the terms and conditions as laid down in the Agreement already executed between BDA and BHP for the Exploration of Gold, Copper and Associated Mineral in Chagai District*.\"864 In Respondent's view, this letter shows that the absence of any consideration of clause 14.1 also passed by the Law Department.865 However, given the Law Department's express reference to the CHEJVA in accordance with which the BDA should deal with the matter, the Tribunal is not convinced that this is actually the case.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 26.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237 lit. d.\n\n742.\n\nIn the revised working paper for the Cabinet prepared by Mr. Tahir on 12 May 2000, it is noted that \"[a]*ccording to the Agreement/Addendum, BHP can sell their interest to a Third Party subject to pre-emptive right of its joint venture partner i.e., GOB/BDA. The matter was discussed by the cabinet in its meeting held on 11.4.2000. It was decided that BDA may examine the proposal in consultation with the concerned departments of Government of Balochistan. BDA has obtained the views of the departments which are incorporated in the working paper*.\"866 In its meeting on 19 May 2000, the Cabinet decided that \"*the Law Department should get the agreement examined by a corporate lawyer to see as to what extent the interests of the provincial government stand protected and what further legal remedial measure are available to the government*.\"867 In accordance with this decision, the Law Department directed the BDA in a letter of 23 May 2000 to contact Mr. Shakeel Ahmed, legal advisor to the GOB, for these purposes.868\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, pp. 30-31.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 35.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 34.\n\n743.\n\nIn a summary for the Governor relating to BHP's proposal prepared by Mr. Baloch on 12 June 2000, reference is made to the GOB's pre-emptive rights to be exercised within 90 days and to the Cabinet's decision to have the Alliance Agreement examined by a corporate lawyer. Mr. Baloch reported that the Law Department had consulted Mr. Ahmed: \"*As per his opinion (F/F), the interest of the Government is duly protected. He advised that the GOB/BDA may execute with BHP the deed of waiver and consent as per drafts proposed by BHP and vetted and modified by him*.\" On that basis, Mr. Baloch proposed that \"*GOB/BDA may not pre-empt the proposed arrangements between BHP & Mincor*\" and that \"*BDA may be authorized to execute with BHP the Deed of Waiver and Consent on behalf of the Governor, as per drafts placed at F/G*.\" He further noted that the Industries, Finance and Law Departments concurred with the submission of this summary to the Governor and that the Minister for Planning and Development had approved the proposal set out above.869\n\n**Exhibit CE-434**, p. 2.\n\n744.\n\nWhile Respondent emphasizes that again no reference was made in this summary to clause 14.1,870 Mr. Baloch reported that the GOB's legal advisor had examined the drafts proposed by BHP \u2013 which did make reference to both Clauses 14.1 and 14.3 \u2013 and that he had advised that the Deed of Waiver and Consent as modified by him \u2013 which also made reference to both provisions \u2013 could be executed by the BDA. On that basis, Mr. Baloch notified BHP on 23 June 2000 that \"[p]*ursuant to clauses 14.1 and 14.3.2 of the JV Agreement*,\" the Governor elected not to exercise his pre-emptive right and to give the necessary consents for the transfer of BHP's interest to Mincor.871 The Deed of Waiver and Consent was signed on the same day.872\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 237 lit. g.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 39.\n\n**Exhibit CE-194**.\n\n745.\n\nOn the basis of the contemporaneous record set out above, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that the GOB was deliberately put under a misapprehension as to the existence of its right under clause 14.1 to withhold its consent to the transfer of BHP's interest to Mincor. Besides the fact that clause 14.1 provides that the \"*consent shall not be unreasonably withheld*\"873 and thus \"*some element of cause*\" was necessary for the GOB to object, as Respondent acknowledges,874 it is clear from the record that both the Law Department of the GOB and an external corporate lawyer reviewed the draft agreement and, in particular, Mr. Ahmed, also reviewed and modified the draft letters provided by BHP on 11 April 2000. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to assume that the GOB was not aware of its rights under the CHEJVA and, more importantly, that this was a deliberate strategy of BHP and individuals at the BDA such as Mr. Farooq, Mr. Burq, Mr. Baloch and Mr. Tahir that would justify to draw the conclusion that illegitimate payments were made or offered to obtain the Deed of Waiver and Consent.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, clause 14.1.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 227.\n\n746.\n\nThe second aspect of the alleged \"*anomalies*\" invoked by Respondent have thus also been addressed. Specifically, the Tribunal is not convinced that the approval process of the Deed of Waiver and Consent was influenced by the above-mentioned individuals in the manner described by Respondent. In any event, the Tribunal does not consider it established that any of the illegitimate payments or offers that Respondent claims to have been the reason for these individuals' favorable treatment to BHP actually occurred. As set out in detail above, this applies in particular to the payments and offers allegedly made by Mr. Arndt (through Mr. Iqbal) to Mr. Burq.\n\n747.\n\nAs to the third aspect, the Tribunal notes that the discussions with the GOB regarding the Deed of Waiver and Consent may well have been conducted \"*relatively quickly*\" because the Deed, together with the Addendum and the certification of BHP's interest, formed part of the package required under the Option Agreement for Mincor to become involved in the project and the Addendum had been under discussion since 1998. The Tribunal does not see how this would qualify as an \"*anomaly*\" of the approval process and, in any event, the record shows that the GOB first directed the BDA to obtain advice from the Law Department, as well as the Industries and Finance Departments, and then also requested that advice be obtained from a corporate lawyer. Only upon the approval by all of these Departments, the opinion from the external lawyer and the approval of the Minister for Planning and Development did the Governor approve the signing of the Deed of Waiver and Consent.\n\n748.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that \"*there is evidence to suggest that there was concern amongst the GoB/BDA as to Mincor's involvement*\" as result of which the GOB's consent \"*may have been withheld*\" if this right had been known. In this regard, Respondent relies on the minutes from the meeting held on 11 April 2000 with the Chief Secretary, which record that the Chief Secretary \"*quarried*,\" *inter alia*, about \"*the credentials and implications of Mincor's proposal to be inducted in the project*.\" The minutes further provide:\n\n\"*Chief Secretary was under the impression that the original joint venture agreement did not provide for the parties to withdraw from the project. Therefore it has to be ensured that BHP's role as partner is not being withdrawn at the cost of other partner's interest. Chief Secretary also instructed that the credentials and capability of Mincor must be ensured so that the project does eventually run according to the original joint venture agreement*.\"875\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(ap)**, p. 22.\n\n749.\n\nRespondent further refers to a letter from the Finance Department of 9 May 2000 which has already been referred to above in the context the Tribunal's analysis on the Addendum. In that letter, the Finance Department reiterated its opinion regarding the changes to the financing terms under the CHEJVA introduced by the Addendum and further noted at the end that \"*the interest of Government of Balochistan must be protected while deciding introduction of third party MINCOR in pursuance of Clause 14.3 of addendum to the Joint Venture Agreement*.\"876\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(an)**, p. 60.\n\n750.\n\nIn addition, Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Tahir, who stated in his second witness statement regarding the introduction of Mincor (albeit in the context of the Addendum):\n\n\"*I, together with my immediate supervisor Mr Habibullah Baloch (sometimes also called Mr Habibullah Badini), who was the General Manager of Mines at the BDA, became aware of the game that BHP was playing in terms of Mincor's proposed involvement in Reko Diq at the time that the Addendum was being negotiated, in mid-to-late 1999. While we at the BDA initially had high hopes that BHP, a large multinational company, would undertake the exploration and development activities set out in the CHEJVA, it became clear that BHP had no interest in doing so and wanted to farm out these obligations to a new, smaller company, Mincor. There were major concerns regarding Mincor taking on the project at the DMD* [Directorate Mineral Development] *and at the Industries Department. I recall that the Director of the DMD, Mr Shahnawaz Marri, and the Secretary of the Industries Department, Mr Arif Azeem, voiced concerns that BHP had benefitted from (i) the relaxations granted by the Industries Department of the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules 1970 (BMCR) and (ii) the reservation of more than three million acres of land by the DMD, both primarily because of BHP's status as a world class mineral exploration company, and that these rights should not be farmed out to a junior company like Mincor. Mr Marri was also concerned that a smaller company would not have the financial resources to explore, develop and mine the exploration area, nor the technological expertise. He worried that this would prevent development of the Reko Diq project*.\"\n\n751.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that there is no evidence that would suggest that any analysis was undertaken by the GOB with regard to Mincor's ability to perform the obligations under the CHEJVA.877 In this regard, Respondent places particular emphasis on the fact that Mincor was a junior mining company or, as Respondent put it, a \"*mining minnow*\" compared to the \"*mining giant*\" BHP.878 Respondent argues that it would thus have been \"*natural for the GOB to have reservations over the introduction of Mincor to the project*\" and questions both Mincor's \"*experience and ability to implement a project of this scale*\" and how it intended to finance the project.879\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 239 lit. d.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123. *See also* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 231.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 233.\n\n752.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Moore, who was CEO of Mincor at the time, explained that it is \"*a common situation in the mining industry, where a major mining company does not want to continue with an exploration project and passes it along to a junior mining company*.\"880 He further explained:\n\n\"*Typically a junior exploration company will take on a difficult exploration project and, if successful, will either develop it through raising equity finance or, if it is a project of a size to interest a major company, sell it to that major company in a deal that usually involves a take-over of the junior company \u2013 as happened with TCC.*\n\n*Mincor was also not a completely typical junior company. Mincor had the backing of Iscor, a multi-billion dollar company, as a 40% shareholder. I also had personal relationships with the executives in BHP who managed Reko Diq, due to the abortive deal I had negotiated with them while I worked for Iscor. \u2026 Mincor was already familiar with the Project, had already visited the site, and could rely on much of the due diligence that Iscor had already conducted \u2013 all of which was a significant advantage to BHP, saving at least 6 months-worth of work that a new suitor would have needed to evaluate the asset. It is easy to see why BHP were willing to talk to us.*\n\n*Mincor also had excellent credentials. As the CEO of Mincor, I had a background in geology and nearly 20 years of experience with mining projects around the world at Shell/Billiton and Iscor. I also had direct hands-on experience in porphyry copper systems, and the importance of this to the people who managed BHP's Reko Diq project, who were primarily geologists, should not be under-stated. Mincor offered a small startup's flexibility and willingness to take risks, strong technical credentials, known and trusted individuals who already had a good knowledge of the Reko Diq Project, and the added heft of a major mining company as controlling shareholder. For all of these reasons, Mincor was also a better partner for the GOB than BHP was at that time*.\"881\n\nMoore, \u00b6 59.\n\nMoore, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n\n753.\n\nWhen asked during the hearing how Mincor anticipated to raise the level of financing required for the then-envisaged project at H-4 (Tanjeel), Mr. Moore explained:\n\n\"*So, it's really the classic process of exploration finance by junior companies. You spend a little bit of money in the ground, and you make a discovery. Actually, making the initial discovery isn't that expensive. You spend a bit more money, and you sort of bulk it up. The discovery gets reflected in your share price. The value of your company rises. You use that higher share price to raise more money. And then you get money to carry out the Feasibility Study. And now, you've got a something of proven value that is reflected in your share price, and you use your shares to raise a final round of financing for the development. And, normally, you try and get about 70 percent debt, 30 percent equity, and youdevelop the mine.*\n\n*This happens throughout the world, sometimes with very small companies financing very, very big billion dollars-plus projects. So, there is very few mining or exploration companies that go into a project with all the financing for the whole thing lined up from the start. You grow with the Project. The key thing is to be successful in discovering, in making that discovery. If you make that discovery, everything else flows from that*.\"882\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2304 line 9 to p. 2305 line 10.\n\n754.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence set out above, the Tribunal is not convinced that there were concerns within the GOB regarding the introduction of Mincor to the project which, if it had been aware of its right under Clause 14.1 of the CHEJVA, would have led it to object to the transfer of BHP's interest to Mincor. While the minutes of the meeting of 11 April 2000 indicate that the Chief Secretary indeed expressed certain concerns regarding Mincor, there is no further documentary evidence to support Respondent's allegation that consent would have been withheld. In particular, the Finance Department's note in its 9 May 2000 letter does not establish that it objected to the introduction specifically of Mincor to the project. While Mr. Tahir refers to \"*major concerns*\" raised by the Directorate Mineral Development and the Industries Department, there is no reference to any contemporaneous documents that would demonstrate that such concerns were indeed raised at the relevant time.883\n\nReference is made only to the 1994 Relaxations and the letter also dating from 1994 by which the Director, Mineral Development informed the BDA that the area of land had been reserved in its favor. **Exhibits CE-189** and **RE-49**.\n\n755.\n\nFinally, in light of Mr. Moore's testimony quoted above and also taking into account that Respondent did not question the testimony of Claimant's witnesses that Mincor was the only interested party at the time, the Tribunal is not convinced that it was not in the interest of the GOB to waive its pre-emptive rights and give the necessary consents to the transfer of BHP's right to Mincor. In the absence of any other interested parties, it also does not appear that putting out a tender for BHP's interest would have produced a different result.\n\n756.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not believe that there were any \"*anomalies*\" in the approval process of the Deed of Waiver and Consent that would justify to draw the conclusion that illegitimate payments were made or offered in this process.\n\n**e. Allegations Relating to the 2006 Novation Agreement(s)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nFifth, the Tribunal will examine Respondent's allegation that the 2006 Novation Agreements were secured by various corrupt acts.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n758.\n\nRespondent alleges the following acts of corruption were relevant to the securing of the novation of BHP's interests in the CHEJVA (the agreement through which the GoB agreed that TCC would replace BHP as a party to the CHEJVA and enjoy all of BHP's rights and benefits thereunder) and three exploration licenses (EL-5, EL-6 and EL-7). In respect of the CHEJVA and EL-5, two novation agreements were signed on 1 April 2006 (together the \"**Novation Agreements**\").884 Respondent maintains that each of the following constitutes an illegal benefit under Pakistani law.885\n\ni. Firstly, Respondent maintains that there was an improper influence over and the offering of an incentive to the BDA's legal counsel (Mr. Malik) by Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Iqbal and TCC's lawyer Mr. Rizvi in February 2006 to ensure that he would not be an obstacle during the negotiations and would assist TCC to get the deal through quickly.886\n\nii. Secondly, Respondent submits that gifts were made to the BDA Chairman, Mr. Yousaf in March 2006, in return for his support in respect of the Novation Agreements, including the execution of those agreements.887\n\niii. Thirdly, Respondent maintains that key individuals promised to get Mr. Farooq appointed as Chairman of the BDA if he got the Novation Agreements signed, together with receiving regular payments to earn his loyalty to TCC (including in relation to the Addendum and the certification).888\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 124 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-3** *and* **CE-447**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 121.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120(a).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120(b).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120(c).\n\n759.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, Respondent emphasizes the considerable pressure Claimant's management was under to conclude the four novation agreements.889 Respondent notes that Claimant was subject to an unsolicited takeover offer in December 2005 and in March 2006, Atacama Copper Pty Ltd (\"**Atacama**\"), a subsidiary of Antofagasta, made an offer to Claimant's shareholders to acquire all of their shares. The pressure increased due to Atacama's offer period, during which, conditions had to be satisfied, including the execution of a novation agreement.890\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 253-256.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 255.\n\n760.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's assertions that through the Deed, \"*the GOB explicitly consented to the introduction of TCC into the CHEJVA and contractually bound itself to sign the Novation Agreements.*\"891 Respondent maintains that to say that there was any kind of contractual entitlement to transfer its right to Claimant is a falsification on what was agreed between BDA and BHP.892 Respondent submits that, in fact, the consents contained within the Deed applied only to transfers of interest under the CHEJVA to Mincor or any \"*company or companies through which Mincor \u2026 intends to carry out the business and activities referred to in the Option Agreement.*\"893 Respondent submits that Mincor's intention to immediately withdraw from the project following the transfer in Antofagasta's favor, was thus not foreseen by the Deed, which only permits internal restructuring by Mincor. Otherwise, it would have been a blanket waiver of GOB's pre-emptive rights and consent to any transfer to any third parties at any future time.894\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 250 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 139, 151.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 251.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 251 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-194**, Clauses 1 (definition of \"*Transfers*\" and \"*MINCOR*\"), 2, 3(a).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 251.\n\n761.\n\nRespondent thus argues that the execution of the Novation Agreements was the fulfilment of a condition precedent for the takeover of TCC in 2006, not merely the fulfilment of a 2000 promise.895 The agreements therefore required due consideration and negotiation. Pakistan alleges that what ensued however, was corruption.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 252 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 154.\n\n762.\n\nRespondent sets out in its Post-Hearing Brief an overview of the approval process behind the Novation Agreements which took place towards the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006.896 Contrary to Claimant's suggestion that this approval process was proper, Respondent maintains that documentary and witness evidence demonstrates the following anomalies in the process.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 257-267.\n\n**(a) The Lack of Proper Approval of the Novation Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n763.\n\nDescribed as the \"*elephant in the room*\" that Claimant cannot avoid, Respondent relies on Mr. Farooq's evidence and the documentary record to allege that the Novation Agreements never received the Chief Minister's or the Governor's approval, nor adequate Law and Finance Department vetting.897 Respondent maintains that despite the Chief Secretary's instruction for the BDA Chairman to \"*coordinate with Law, BDA and Finance*\" and, then, to put \"*a commented proposal safeguarding our interests* \u2026 *up for approval of Competent Authority*\" in September 2005, there is no evidence to suggest that such direction was acted upon and thus that such events occurred (which Respondent also alleges contravened the GOB Rules of Business 1976, Rules 7(3), 8(1), 13(1) and 14(3) and (4)).898\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 271 *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 14 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 36.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 271 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 36, **Exhibits RE-268**, pp. 4-5 *and* **RE-20**.\n\n764.\n\nRespondent refers to Mr. Malik's testimony in which he confirmed that he did not want to witness the Novation Agreements without Law Department vetting, but was pressured to do so by Mr. Farooq. Despite Claimant's claims that it encouraged the input of the relevant departments, Respondent maintains that there is no document to suggest that Claimant insisted on Law Department vetting, nor that the Finance Department was ever consulted regarding the Novation Agreements.899\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 271 *referring to* Malik, \u00b6 4, Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 158 *and* Hargreaves, \u00b6 41.\n\n765.\n\nRespondent submits that Mr. Farooq admitted that given the stringent timeframe, it was agreed that the Chairman should be persuaded to sign the Novation Agreements alone (*i.e*., without the MMDD also signing). Mr. Farooq did so by advising the inexperienced then-Chairman of the BDA that he could sign on behalf of the Governor, based on the 1999 authorization in respect of the Addendum.900\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 272(b) *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 14.\n\n**(b) The Crucial Role of Mr. Farooq**\n--------------------------------------\n\n766.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Mr. Farooq's motivation to be appointed as Chairman of the BDA and his deep involvement in the process had a significant effect on the approval.901 The suggestion that Claimant would not have the power to appoint him as Chairman is denied by Respondent by reference to the testimony of influential individuals including Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Lakhani and Col. Sher Khan whose recommendations went a long way in determining who should be appointed as Chairman.902 Respondent refers to various meetings in early to mid-2006 in which Col. Khan and Mr. Flores allegedly made clear to Chief Minister Yousaf and Chief Secretary Rind that Claimant wanted Mr. Farooq to become BDA Chairman.903\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 277-280.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 276 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 32 *and* Khan II, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 276 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 23.\n\n767.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent maintains that witness evidence and Claimant's e-mail exchanges clearly demonstrate Claimant's awareness of Mr. Farooq's influence over and involvement in the Novation Agreement approval process and its subsequent use of this influence to ensure approval was obtained.904\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 277-279 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-438** *and* **Ex RE-321**.\n\n768.\n\nIn response to Claimant's argument that Mr. Farooq's persuasion of the Chairman would have been unnecessary, Respondent maintains the contrary \u2013 Mr. Farooq's persuasion was necessary, given there was a lack of vetting by concerned departments and higher approval for the Novation Agreements, such that Mr. Yousaf wrongly felt that he had the discretion to sign the Novation Agreements on behalf of both the BDA and the Governor.905\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 280.\n\n**(c) Attributability of Mr. Farooq's Conduct**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n769.\n\nRespondent alleges that the acts of Mr. Farooq are attributable to Claimant given his role over the course of his 14-15 year involvement in the project as TCC's *de facto* representative in Pakistan.906 Despite its awareness of his corrupt reputation, Respondent maintains that TCC took no steps to distance itself from him, nor to raise any complaint in relation to his 2006 promotion to BDA Chairman, preferring to maintain a close relationship with him given that he was instrumental in advancing Claimant's project.907 Respondent refers to the statements of Mr. Hargreaves who acknowledged his \"*good working relationship with Mr. Farooq*\" and Mr. James who noted that he was \"*looking forward to meeting many times*\" with Mr. Farooq during his tenure, as evidence of the strength of this relationship.908\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 353 *referring to* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2129 lines 8-11.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 57-59.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 59 *referring to* Hargreaves, \u00b6 63, Iqbal, \u00b6 17, **Exhibits RE-284** *and* **RE-218**.\n\n770.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that there is extensive documentary evidence further demonstrating the lengths to which Mr. Farooq would go to support BHP and TCC, including but not limited to communication with the Additional Chief Secretary seeking early approval of the Addendum, Mr. Schloderer's letter to Mr. Farooq concerning the completion of Stage One and Two activities, communication concerning the draft novation agreements and also his attempts to obtain the airstrip rights for free.909\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 61.\n\n771.\n\nRespondent notes that witnesses have repeatedly testified that Mr. Farooq was accepting bribes in return for favoring and advancing BHP's and later Claimant's interests in the project and his loyalty to TCC rather than the Government.910 Witnesses have also painted a picture of him as a secondary conduit (alongside Col. Khan) for money to be used for bribes to pass from Claimant to other Balochistan officials in connection with virtually every key moment of the project.911 Thus by his conduct and his relationship, Respondent maintains that Claimant cannot separate itself from Mr. Farooq's conduct on its behalf.912\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 383; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 450 *referring to* Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n**(d) Improper Influence over Mr. Malik**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n772.\n\nRespondent questions the impartiality of \"*independent corporate counsel*\" Mr. Malik based on witness statements showing that he acted contrary to his obligations to his client, the BDA.913 Respondent submits that witnesses confirmed that he replaced BDA's long-standing counsel at Claimant's request given criticisms relating to the Addendum.914 Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Farooq described collusion between himself and Mr. Malik to secure the Novation Agreements, something which was motivated by Claimant's promise to help Mr. Malik get a job at a specific law firm.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 281 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 158.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 282 *referring to* Iqbal, \u00b6 32 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 37.\n\n773.\n\nApart from Claimant's alleged awareness of the job offer at the law firm of Antofagasta's lead counsel, Mr. Rizvi, Respondent contends that contemporaneous documents cast further doubt on Mr. Malik's independence, arguing that: (i) Claimant was paying him for interrelated work (novations of EL-6 and EL-8) in circumstances where it was obvious a conflict may arise; and (ii) Claimant was giving Mr. Malik instructions and was aware of his advice to the BDA regarding the novations of the CHEJVA and EL-5.915 Respondent alleges that it is evident that the promise of a job and further instruction given by Claimant to Mr. Malik shifted his loyalty from BDA towards TCC. Respondent thus argues that the BDA was not represented in the novation agreement negotiations by independent legal counsel as it should have been.916\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 286; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-216**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135.\n\n**(e) Gifts to Mr. Yousaf**\n---------------------------\n\n774.\n\nFinally, Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Farooq to confirm that gifts were made to Mr. Yousaf, including \"*a Rolex watch and a cigar case.*\"917 Respondent alleges that such expensive gifts undoubtedly had an impact when Mr. Farooq came to persuade Mr. Yousaf to sign the Novation Agreements.918\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 287 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 38.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 287 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 38.\n\n775.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's allegation of a lack of \"*real bribery or corruption*\" and that Pakistan's case is limited to \"*allegations of very small favors to low-level and relatively insignificant people,*\" effectively invites the Tribunal to tolerate a certain level of corruption, something contrary to the scheme of the UNCTAD and OECD Convention, transnational public policy and Pakistani law.919\n\n; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 511; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 276 lines 7-9 and p. 278 lines 12-15, Transcript (Day 6), p. 1591 lines 1-3, *both referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 38, Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 397, Transcript (Day 1), p. 276 lines 9-11 and p. 26 lines 5-14.\n\n776.\n\nRespondent alleges a causal link between the Novation Agreements and the earlier corruption events; but-for BHP's corruption procuring the Addendum, the certification of BHP's interest and the Deed, Claimant would never have farmed into the project, and thus would not have had the opportunity to establish the Novation Agreements transferring BHP's purported interest in the CHEJVA to it. Respondent therefore alleges that these events, procured by bribery and but-for which there would have been no Novation Agreements, must be considered \"*real bribery and corruption.*\"920\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 136.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n777.\n\nOn a preliminary note, Claimant emphasizes that the main novation agreement is the only one where any conduct attributable to TCC could possibly affect its Treaty rights since this is the only contract by which TCC became party to the CHEJVA, through which its investment was admitted in Pakistan for purposes of the Treaty.921\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 118.\n\n778.\n\nClaimant highlights that despite Mr. Farooq's statement that he was \"*not aware of any specific payments made to get the Novation Agreement signed,*\" Respondent persevered, developing unsubstantiated allegations of illicit gifts and job promises.922 Claimant instead maintains that: (i) BHP was contractually entitled to transfer its rights in the CHEJVA to Claimant; (ii) the Novation Agreements were carefully negotiated; (iii) the record disproves the allegation that Mr. Farooq's was paid to ensure signing or that he persuaded the Chairman to sign; and (iv) the allegation of improper influence over Mr. Malik is unsubstantiated.923\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 38 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 247.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 156-165; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 397-404.\n\n779.\n\nUltimately, Claimant alleges that Respondent has \"*failed to prove that any of this alleged corruption actually occurred, much less that the Novation was corruptly procured so as to have any effect on TCCA's right to recover for Pakistan's breaches of the Treaty*.\"924\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 131.\n\n**(a) Contractual Entitlement to Transfer Its Rights in the CHEJVA to Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n780.\n\nClaimant denies that it would have been necessary to use corruption to secure the Novation Agreements, arguing that Balochistan was legally required to execute these agreements by virtue of the Deed and the Addendum.925\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128.\n\n781.\n\nClaimant submits that the Deed provided that the GOB, acting through the BDA Chairman, \"*agrees to do all things and sign all documents necessary to give effect to the Transfers,*\" while the Addendum provided that \"*where there is an assignment\u2026all Parties to this Agreement shall execute all documents necessary to assign or transfer such Percentage Interest.*\"926\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 398 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-194**, Clause 2 *and* **CE-2**, new Clause 14.5.\n\n782.\n\nClaimant challenges Respondent's argument that the Deed did not contemplate the entry of a new third party.927 This argument allegedly contradicts Respondent's objections to the 2000 Addendum and Deed, *i.e*., that BHP's substitution by Mincor was against Balochistan's interests. Claimant submits that the transfer to TCCA (not Antofagasta) was expressly contemplated by the 2000 Agreements.928\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 250-251.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 399.\n\n**(b) Careful Negotiation of the Novation Agreements**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nClaimant maintains that the documentary record demonstrates that the Novation Agreements were the subject of extensive evaluation. Claimant submits that there is nothing on record to support the allegation that MMDD's proposal that a \"*meeting be convened\u2026for consideration of the case in consultation with the Finance, Law and M&M Departments*\" did not take place.929 Additionally, Claimant submits that since Respondent refused to produce documents in relation to how the Novation Agreements were approved, it cannot now rely on an absence of evidence about that very process.930\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 400 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 271(a) and **Exhibit RE-268**, p. 5.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 401 *referring to* Claimant's Redfern, at 50 (Request 29).\n\n**(c) Mr. Farooq's Testimony**\n------------------------------\n\n784.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has not adequately explained how TCC could have secured Mr. Farooq's appointment as BDA Chairman.931 Claimant submits that both Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan explained that the Chairman is selected by the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary and therefore, as supported by the evidence of Mr. Flores and Mr. Hargreaves, it is hard to see how TCC could have influenced this process beyond simply making a recommendation or \"*putting in a word*\" on behalf of Mr. Farooq, especially when at the time it found it difficult even to get a preliminary meeting with these individuals.932\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 402; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 120-122.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 122 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 32, Transcript (Day 2), p. 548 lines 9-21, p. 551 lines 5\u201317 and p. 549 lines 5\u201320, Transcript (Day 4), p. 1026 line 20 to p. 1030 line 12, Flores, \u00b6 31, Flores II, \u00b6 14, Hargreaves, \u00b6 64, Hargreaves II, \u00b6 29 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2593 lines 3-15, p. 2597 line 21 to p. 2598 line 18; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 402 *referring to* Hargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\n785.\n\nMoreover, Claimant submits that the ever-changing nature of Mr. Farooq's testimony in relation to his purported guarantee of appointment as Chairman and the aforementioned motivation for him to lie to the NAB given his kickback scheme involvement, render his other claims regarding the gifts made to Mr. Yousaf, lacking credibility.933 Not only does Claimant maintain that these allegations are so vague that Respondent has not even alleged a payor, but it submits that the testimony of Mr. Hargreaves demonstrates that Mr. Yousaf genuinely supported and had interest in the project \u2013 he therefore did not need to be bribed.934 Claimant contends that his enthusiasm made perfect sense given the potential of the project to transform the local economy through employment, skills development, and revenue to Balochistan though profits to the joint venture partnership and royalties to public treasury.935\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 121, 125.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 124-126 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 38 *and* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 31.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 126.\n\n786.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant argues that, although Respondent now refuses to acknowledge it, it is indisputable that the highest-ranking officials of both the Federal and Provincial Governments openly supported and encouraged TCC's investment. Claimant maintains that, as the Tribunal has already found, \"*various officials on the highest levels of both GOB and the GOP, including the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan as well as the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary of Balochistan, assured Claimant of their support for its investment.*\"936 Claimant therefore suggests that it is inconceivable that TCC would have any reason to interfere with the inner workings of the BDA hierarchy when far higher authorities than Mr. Farooq had already determined the investment to be welcome.937\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123 referring to Draft Decision, \u00b6 951.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123.\n\n**(d) Attributability of Mr. Farooq's Conduct**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n787.\n\nMoreover, Claimant argues that documentary evidence relied upon by Respondent to support the cornerstone of its case, namely that \"*Mr. Farooq acted as a de facto TCC representative in Pakistan,*\" actually shows nothing more than an ordinary working relationship between representatives of the Joint Venture parties.938 Claimant submits that there is actually documentary and witness evidence (from Dr. Jezek and Mr. Hargreaves) refuting this supposed loyalty - for example concerning the Novation Agreements, Mr. Farooq and the BDA actually supported MMDD Director-General Maqbool Ahmed in his refusal to sign the Novation Agreements on behalf of the MMDD.939\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 214-216.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218 *referring to* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 26.\n\n788.\n\nClaimant submits that there is nothing suspect about Mr. Farooq's relationship with TCC \u2013 Balochistan chose him as the Government's liaison to the Joint Venture by appointing him as a member of the Operating Committee and thus TCC had no choice but to work with him.940 Claimant maintains that Mr. Farooq was never an employee or consultant of TCC and thus cannot be considered the \"*directing mind and will*\" of TCC.941 Claimant maintains that in his dealings with TCC, he was simply acting as *Balochistan's* representative in the Joint Venture and was simply fulfilling *Balochistan's* obligations under the CHEJVA; there is no basis to attribute his acts to Claimant.942\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 216 *referring to* Boggs I, \u00b6 12 *and* Flores I, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 213-214.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 213-214 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\n789.\n\nMoreover, Claimant maintains that Respondent's allegations that TCC did not take any steps to distance itself from Mr. Farooq, nor raise any complaint in relation to Mr. Farooq's promotion to BDA Chairman, miss the point.943 Claimant submits that Ms. Boggs' lack of familiarity with Mr. Farooq upon his promotion not only contradicts his supposed \"*key role in the project*\" but also any suggestion that TCC played a role in his appointment.944\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 219 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 57, 59.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 220 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 11.\n\n**(e) Mr. Malik's Independence**\n--------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nClaimant firstly perceives the allegation that Mr. Malik represented \"*two parties in their negotiation of a contract*\" to be a desperate attempt to establish some sort of corruption related to the Novation since Balochistan did not have an interest in Exploration Licenses EL-6 or EL-8 and was not a party to the novations of those licences.945 Moreover, Claimant argues that there is no evidence to conclude that Mr. Malik materially affected the Novation Agreements' outcome, nor that he did not act in his client's best interests.946\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 404 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 286 *and* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 34.\n\n791.\n\nClaimant also disputes Respondent's allegation that Mr. Malik \"*was appointed at TCC's request*\" based on the documentary record.947 Not only does the record demonstrate the BDA's invitation of offers by newspaper advertisements for the outside counsel position, but it also confirms that the BDA's appointment of Jamshid Malik was news to Claimant and that they did not know who he was at the time.948 Additionally, what Claimant perceives should be telling is that after Mr. Hargreaves had refuted such an allegation in his witness statement, Respondent did not even question him about it at the hearing.949\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 281.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-268** \u00b6 17 *and* **CE-739**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127 *referring to* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 22.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n792.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that on 1 April 2006, the GOB, BHP and Claimant concluded the 2006 Novation Agreement concerning the CHEJVA, which provided, most importantly, that \"*TCC shall replace BHPB under and as a party to the JVA*.\"950 On the same date, the same parties also concluded a further novation agreement concerning the Exploration License EL-5 jointly held by the Joint Venture partners, which provided that \"*TCC shall replace BHPB as the holder of the Transferred Interest* [*i.e*., BHP's 75% interest in Exploration License EL-5].\"951 Together, these two agreements are referred to as the \"**Novation Agreements**.\" While it was originally envisaged that two additional novation agreements would be signed in respect of Exploration Licenses EL-6 and EL-8 in which BHP held 100% at the time,952 it was decided in mid-March 2006 that the transfer of those Licenses would be carried out pursuant to applications to the MMDD under 2002 BM Rule 64 only.953 The reason for this change in approach to the transfer is in dispute between the Parties and will be addressed in further detail below.\n\n**Exhibit CE-3**, Clause 2 lit. a.\n\n**Exhibit CE-447**, Clause 2 lit. a.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., **Exhibit CE-438**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-444**.\n\n793.\n\nThere is further common ground that Antofagasta's offer of 9 March 2006 to acquire all of Claimant's shares and thus to take over Claimant from Mincor was subject to the conditions that, *inter alia*, before the end of the Offer Period on 11 April 2006:\n\n\"*(A) a novation agreement is entered into under which Tethyan is substituted for BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. as a party to the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement; and*\n\n*(B) Tethyan is duly registered as the holder of a 75% interest in EL5 and a 100% interest in EL6 and EL8*.\"954\n\n**Exhibit RE-275**, p. 3.\n\n794.\n\nWhile Respondent does not allege that any specific illegitimate payments were made in connection with the Novation Agreements, it does claim that these Agreements were secured by \"*various corrupt acts*,\" constituting \"*illegal benefits under Pakistani law*\":955\n\ni. An offer by Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Rizvi, Antofagasta's local lead counsel, of a job and instructions to Mr. Jamshid Malik, BDA's outside legal counsel, in February 2006 \"*to ensure that he would not be an obstacle during the negotiations of the Novation Agreements and would assist TCC to get the deal through quickly*\";\n\nii. Valuable gifts given by \"*TCC*\" to Mr. Yousaf, Chairman of the BDA, in March 2006 \"*to gain support for the Novation Agreements, including the execution of those agreements*;\"\n\niii. A promise by Col. Khan, Mr. Arndt and Mr. Hargreaves to Mr. Farooq that \"*they would get him appointed as BDA Chairman if he ensured the Novtion Agreements were signed*\";\n\niv. \"*regular payments made to Mr Farooq prior to 1 April 2006*,\" which together with the above-mentioned promise were meant \"*to earn his loyalty to TCC*.\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 247.\n\n795.\n\nIn support of these allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, Mr. Malik, Mr. Iqbal and Col. Khan, which will be addressed in detail below.\n\n796.\n\nRespondent submits that, as a result of these illegal benefits, \"*BHP obtained the Novation Agreements in which inter alia the GoB agreed that TCC would replace BHP as a party to the CHEJVA and enjoy all of BHP's rights and benefits under the CHEJVA*.\"956 In this regard, the Parties are in dispute as to whether: (i) the GOB had already agreed to the transfer of BHP's rights to Claimant under the 2000 Deed of Waiver and Consent and was thus contractually bound to sign the Novation Agreements; and (ii) there was a lack of proper approval of the Novation Agreements. In addition, there is a dispute as to whether, even in the absence of proper approval, this would justify drawing an inference that illegitimate benefits were given.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124.\n\n**(a) The Relevance of Claimant's Conduct in the Negotiations and Execution of the Novation Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n797.\n\nIn its Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal found that for the purposes of assessing whether Claimant had an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and, specifically, whether such investment was \"*admitted*\" by Respondent *\"subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time*,\" the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement concerning the CHEJVA constituted the relevant point in time as of which such assessment had to be made because Claimant thereby became party to the CHEJVA and took over BHP's rights and obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* its Joint Venture partner.957 Similarly, in the context of assessing Claimant's legitimate expectations, the Tribunal confirmed that it considered the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement as the main investment decision.958\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 637, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 640.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 897, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 900.\n\n798.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant concludes from this finding that the Novation Agreement \"*is the only agreement where any conduct attributable to TCCA could possibly affect its Treaty rights*\" and Respondent therefore must establish that the execution of this Agreement was procured by corruption in order to succeed on its Application.959 At the same time, Claimant argues that none of the conduct alleged by Respondent \"*could possibly amount to corruption causing the execution of the Novation Agreements*\" because, pursuant to the Deed of Waiver and Consent, the GOB \"*was legally required to execute those agreements*.\"960\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 118.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128.\n\n799.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, claims that the transfer to TCC as it was carried out in 2006 was not contemplated by the Deed of Waiver and Consent, which applied to a transfer between BHP and Mincor, including \"*companies through which Mincor Resources NL intends to carry out the business and activities referred to in ithe Option Agreement*,\" but not the transfer to TCC as a separately-owned, stand-alone company that was soon to be owned by Antofagasta. In addition, and in any event, Respondent argues that the GOB retained discretion \"*as regards the mechanism and wording of any such transfer of interests*.\"961 Respondent considers the execution of the Novation Agreements to be \"*a significant event in the life of the project*,\" which \"*could not have been completed without the GoB's cooperation and consent*.\"962\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 250-251; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 126.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127.\n\n800.\n\nThe Tribunal takes the view that it is not necessary to make a finding on whether the provisions of the Deed of Waiver and Consent placed the GOB under a contractual obligation to consent to the transfer of BHP's interest in the circumstances prevailing in early 2006. It suffices to note at this point that, as explained by Mr. Hargreaves in his first witness statement, the purpose of the Deed was to provide the necessary security that was required on the part of TCC, which was investing significant time and capital into the exploration works at Reko Diq, that it would eventually be entitled to \"*step up to the contractual rights*\" of BHP when it came to producing and profiting from this investment.963\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 36.\n\n801.\n\nIn any event, however, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that an obligation of the GOB to consent to the transfer would not extend to the exact content of the particular Novation Agreements or the question by whom they would be signed or approved. As Mr. Hargreaves testified, what had to be discussed were \"*the details of how to implement that earlier agreement* [*i.e*., the Deed of Waiver and Consent].\"964 The same applies to the timing of the execution, which was undisputedly of relevance in the circumstances, given the limited validity period of Antofagasta's offer and the parallel hostile bid of a third party, Crosby, whose offer was not conditioned on the execution of any novation agreements.965 Consequently, the Tribunal cannot exclude that if there had been an act of corruption in the context of negotiating or executing the Novation Agreements, it could have contributed to Claimant's becoming party to the CHEJVA and thus have fulfilled the necessary causal link between an illegitimate benefit and Claimant's investment.\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 37. *See also* Hargreaves II, \u00b6 20.\n\n*Cf*.

Mr. Hargreaves confirmed during the hearing that it was a \"pr *essing issue*\" to achieve the deadline for fulfilling the condition precedent set by Antofagasta in its offer and further that the hostile offer of Crosby \"*didn't have that condition*\" but that they were \"*absolutely cheering for Antofagasta because* [they] *thought that this was the best opportunity for Pakistan*.\" Transcript (Day 9), pp. 2352-2353.\n\n802.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal takes note of Claimant's submission that, on Respondent's own argument, there would have been no reason for the GOB not to allow for the transfer of BHP's interest to TCC under the allegedly new circumstances prevailing in 2006. Claimant argues that, after claiming that the entry of Mincor in 2000, which Respondent described as a \"*mining minnow and novice*,\" was against the GOB interests, Respondent cannot complain about the decision in 2006 to allow for the entry of Antofagasta, which marked the entry of a new \"*mining giant*.\"966 The Tribunal also recalls the finding it has made in its Draft Decision that Claimant's activities in Pakistan, including the entry of Antofagasta and, later that year, of Barrick Gold, were highly welcomed and encouraged on every level of the GOB and the Government of Pakistan (\"**GOP**\") at the time.967 The Tribunal will bear these considerations in mind in its evaluation of the evidence adduced by Respondent.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 395; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 130.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 637, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 640.\n\n803.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that there was \"*high-level support for Antofagasta's investment*\" but argues that this is \"*no response to direct evidence of corruption*.\" In this regard, it claims that Claimant: (i) \"*encouraged the BDA to push through the* [Novation Agreement] *without certain key approvals*\"; (ii) made promises to Mr. Farooq \"*to ensure that he would wield his influence on the process*\"; (iii) exercised improper influence on the BDA's corporate counsel, Mr. Malik; and (iv) gave expensive gifts to the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Yousaf, \"*to secure his support*.\"968\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 249.\n\n**(b) The Alleged Lack of a Proper Approval Process**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n804.\n\nAs to the approval process, Respondent primarily relies on the absence of any evidence that the Novation Agreements were vetted by the relevant departments, in particular by the Law Department, as directed by the Chief Secretary in September 2005, and the fact that it was decided in March 2006 that the Novation Agreements would not be signed by a representative of the MMDD but only by the Chairman of the BDA. In addition, Respondent invokes the absence of an express authorization from the Governor for the signing of the Novation Agreements by the Chairman of the BDA.\n\n**(i) The Alleged Absence of Relevant Departmental Approvals**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n805.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the Chief Secretary wrote underneath a note written to him by the Chairman of the BDA on 19 September 2005, which referred, *inter alia*, to the draft novation agreement: \"*May coordinate with Law, BDA and Finance and then a commented proposal safeguarding our interests to be put up for approval for competent authority*.\"969 Respondent further notes that while the MMDD proposed to convene a meeting to be held with the referenced departments, Mr. Farooq wrote a few days later: \"*Since agreement has not been finalized as yet, we may inform CS office accordingly informing progress so far made in the matter*.\"970 Respondent also points to the minutes of the OC meeting on 11 February 2006, which record:\n\n\"*In terms of the novation of BHP's interest in the CHEJV and EL5 to TCC, TCC advised that the final versions of the Novation Agreements would be submitted in the following week. BDA advised that it expected that since these had already been reviewed it expected that they could be approved quickly be the provincial Law Department for signature provided the changes were not major*.\"971\n\n**Exhibit RE-268**, p. 4.\n\n**Exhibit RE-268**, p. 5.\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 6.\n\n806.\n\nRespondent claims that there is no evidence that the Law Department or the Finance Department vetted or approved the Novation Agreements as the Chief Secretary had directed in September 2005 and, relying on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, that he was actually \"*trying to side-step a cross-departmental meeting*\" and that there is no evidence that such a meeting ever took place.972 In his first witness statement, Mr. Farooq stated that \"[a]*s a result of* [his] *efforts, the Law Department was bypassed when the Novation Agreement was signed in 2006*.\"973 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq stood by this statement but added that \"*although there was discussion of these agreements amongst GOB departments, full vetting and approval by the concerned departments and senior individuals did not take place as per the instructions of the CS in the 21 September 2005 note*.\"974\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 271 lit. a (with note 906).\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 14.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 36.\n\n807.\n\nClaimant, on the other hand, notes that there is also no evidence that a meeting between the relevant departments did *not* take place and emphasizes that Respondent refused to produce any documents in response to Claimant's document production request for \"[d]*ocuments reflecting the process by which* 'the 2006 Novation Agreement between the GOB and TCC' *was approved including documents reflecting that it was allegedly* 'pushed across the line by Mr. Farooq despite it not having been vetted by the GoB's Law Department.\"975 Claimant notes that Respondent argued in its objection to this request that, *inter alia*, it was \"*for Pakistan to discharge its burden of proof for positive aspects of its claims/defences (in this instance that irregularities/impropriety tainted the procurement of the Novation Agreement)*\" and further that it was for Respondent \"*to determine what if any documents are necessary to be produced and on which it wants to rely in order to meet the burden of proof.*\"976 The Tribunal denied Claimant's document production request on that basis, noting that Respondent had acknowledged that it \"*bears the burden of proof for positive aspects of its claims/defenses*.\"977 Against this background, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, given Respondent's burden of proof regarding the existence of anomalies in the approval process, it cannot merely invoke the absence of evidence to the contrary.\n\nClaimant's Redfern Schedule as of 26 April 2016, Request No. 29.\n\nClaimant's Redfern Schedule as of 26 April 2016, Responses and Objections, p. 51.\n\nClaimant's Redfern Schedule as of 26 April 2016, Tribunal's Decision, p. 50.\n\n808.\n\nAs for Respondent's reference to Mr. Farooq's comment on the 21 September 2005 note, the Tribunal considers that this note, in itself, does not provide any indication that Mr. Farooq intended to \"*side-step*\" the Law and Finance Departments but rather that their consultation would be postponed until there were finalized drafts to be reviewed. Mr. Farooq also did not make reference to this note in his witness statements. According to Mr. Farooq's testimony, there was further a certain amount of discussion with these departments, which means that they were not completely bypassed as alleged by Respondent.\n\n809.\n\nIn addition, as pointed out by Claimant, on 24 February 2006, it transmitted final drafts of the Novation Agreements to the Chairman of the BDA \"*for review and approval by the Balochistan Law Department*\" and stated that \"[i]*n case the Law Department proposes changes, please advise as soon as possible following which TCC will discuss with the other parties and when agreed incorporate these into the execution copies*.\"978 Similarly, on 26 February 2006, Claimant provided the drafts to the BDA's external counsel, Mr. Malik, \"*for your review and perusal with the law department with Farooq's help*.\"979\n\n**Exhibit CE-437**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-438**.\n\n810.\n\nMr. Hargreaves confirmed during the hearing that when the Novation Agreements were signed by the Chairman of the BDA, he assumed that all the relevant approvals had been obtained. While he freely admitted that he did not check whether this, or any other agreement he signed in Pakistan, had, in fact, obtained such approvals, he stated that \"[t]*he presumption is that the civil servants do their job according to their rules, and when the documents are ready for signature, you sign them*.\" He also confirmed that this was left to Mr. Farooq as \"[t]*hat was his role*.\"980\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2360 line 3 to p. 2361 line 1.\n\n811.\n\nIn these circumstances and taking into account that it was indeed the role of the BDA under the CHEJVA to make applications and obtain relevant approvals, the Tribunal considers that even if the approval of the Law Department may ultimately not have been obtained in accordance with the 1976 Business Rules of the GOB, such a failure could not prejudice Claimant. In particular, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that it would have been for Claimant to \"*insist*[] *on Law Department vetting in circumstances where it was not clear that it was being sought*.\"981\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 271 lit. b.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Mr. Masood Malik, Additional General Manager (Planning) at the BDA, testified that he did not want to sign the Novation Agreement as a witness without the vetting by the Law Department but ultimately did so because Mr. Farooq insisted.982 Mr. Malik did not state, however, that he informed any representatives from Claimant or BHP of his concerns, nor that anyone else besides Mr. Farooq insisted on him signing the Agreement. Therefore, even if the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Malik's testimony was correct, this would not change the finding above that it was not for Claimant do more than to submit the draft agreements \"*for review and approval by the Law Department*\" and that it cannot be prejudiced if such approval was ultimately not obtained.\n\nMalik, \u00b6 4.\n\n813.\n\nThe same applies to the approval of the Finance Department. Even though Claimant may not have made express reference to this Department in its letter, there is no evidence that this Department raised any concerns in the discussions referred to by Mr. Farooq that remained outstanding at the time of the signing. As noted above, it would have been for Respondent to discharge its burden of proof as regards the alleged anomalies in the approval process.\n\n**(ii) The Alleged Improper Influence over the BDA's External Counsel, Mr. Jamshid Malik**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n814.\n\nAs for the fact that the BDA was further advised by external counsel, Respondent claims that the BDA's counsel, Mr. Jamshid Malik, was not acting as an independent advisor to the BDA but was rather \"*appointed at TCC's request and acted in TCC's favour*.\"983 As pointed out by Claimant, the Chairman of the BDA noted in his 19 September 2005 note to the Chief Secretary that the \"*BDA invited offers through leading newspapers for appointment of a solicitor/advocate having sufficient experience in international agreements for vetting agreements submitted by TCC. M/s Jamshid & Davood Law Firm of Quetta was selected for the purpose*.\"984 Respondent alleges that this was only a formality, with Mr. Malik already having been chosen beforehand, and refers to the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, who stated in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*Mr Malik was appointed in the place of Shakil Law Firm, who had advised the BDA since 1974 (the inception of the BDA). Mr Arndt had asked me to get another law firm involved, other than Shakil Law Firm, who TCC had found to be against them during the 2000 Addendum negotiation. Although a public tender had to be issued for a law firm to do this work, this was simply a formality as it had already been decided that Mr Malik would be hired. I had a number of frank conversations with Mr Malik once he was appointed \u2013 I was friends with Mr Malik's father, so I was comfortable speaking to him in this way. I explained to him that my aim was to help TCC and he told me that he was interested in getting an appointment with a big law firm through TCC (which he did). He suggested to me that we should together be helpful to TCC. I recall that Mr Malik did not raise any big objections during the processing of the Novation Agreements*.\"985\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 281.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-268**, \u00b6 17.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 37.\n\n815.\n\nClaimant rejects the allegation that it was involved in the selection of Mr. Malik and points to an e-mail dated 15 August 2005, in which Mr. Hargreaves reported internally:\n\n\"*BDA has appointed a Quetta based Lincoln's Inn barrister called Jamshed Malik, whose claim to fame is that he is the son of someone famous (we don't know whom yet). Jamshed can't be too busy as Farook has just volunteered him for 2 days - 25th and 26th and decided he can go to Karachi. Sikandar already has him under investigation! I will write to BDA tomorrow to confirm these dates and I will see Khairas tomorrow evening in Islamabad to try and organise him for some of those times as well as for a meeting with us on the 24th in Karachi*.\"986\n\n**Exhibit CE-739**.\n\n816.\n\nMr. Hargreaves further testified in his second witness statement that \"*the recommendation for the GOB to obtain independent legal advice was raised by TCC's lawyers, Kabraji & Talibuddin during negotiations in late 2005, but the BDA handled the selection and appointment of its counsel in which TCC played no part.*\"987\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 22.\n\n817.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Iqbal testified in his witness statement that \"[s]*omeone from TCC (I do not recall who it was) recommended Mr Malik to Mr Farooq and the Chairman of the BDA in a meeting that I attended*.\"988 Mr. Farooq, on the other hand, stated that he was friends with Mr. Malik's father and did not confirm that the recommendation to hire his son had come from TCC. Mr. Hargreaves' contemporaneous e-mail also does not provide any indication that they were in any manner involved in the selection process. While the record indicates that Mr. Malik may have been chosen because of his father's relationship with, and thus, possibly, on the recommendation of, Mr. Farooq, Respondent has failed to establish that \"[s]*omeone from TCC*\" had any say in this process.\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 32.\n\n818.\n\nRespondent further claims that Mr. Malik was improperly influenced by Claimant to collude with Mr. Farooq in the negotiation of the Novation Agreements by: (i) paying for interrelated work regarding the novations of Exploration Licenses EL-6 and EL-8; (ii) giving him instructions and being \"*aware of his advice to the BDA regarding the novations of the CHEJVA and EL-5*\"; and (iii) being aware of an offer to him of a job with the law firm of Antofagasta's lead counsel, Mr. Rizvi.989 In this regard, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq quoted above and that of Mr. Iqbal, who testified that \"*TCC influenced Mr Malik in the following ways*\":\n\n\"*(a) Mr Malik was offered a job at the firm of Antofagasta's lead lawyer, Mr Ahsan Rizvi, if he was helpful in shaping the opinion of the BDA and others in the GoB to get the Novation Agreements signed in a quick timeframe. This offer was made by Mr Rizvi during a meeting that I attended at the Serena Hotel, Quetta. Mr Hargreaves very much knew that Mr Malik was offered a job at Mr Rizvi's firm and encouraged this. I know that Mr Malik did join Mr Rizvi's law firm in Karachi in 2006.*\n\n*(b) Mr Jamshid Malik was also retained by TCC in respect of the EL-6 and EL-8 novations, for which TCC paid him directly. Mr Hargreaves had no concerns over hiring and paying Mr Malik to advise on this issue, even though it was interrelated with the CHEJVA and EL-5 novations (for which he was supposed to be working for the BDA) and the BDA raised a question over whether the GoB should have an interest in EL-6 and EL-8. Mr Hargreaves encouraged me and Mr Rizvi to use Mr Malik to push the deal through*.\"990\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 286.\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 32.\n\n819.\n\nAs to the first aspect of the alleged influence, it appears to be undisputed that Mr. Malik was in fact hired by the law firm of Mr. Rizvi in 2006. Mr. Hargreaves denies, however, that he was involved in any manner in this aspect, testifying in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*I also deny Mr. Farooq's and Mr. Iqbal's claims that TCC or I played a role in Jamshid Malik getting a job with a big law firm. Sometime in 2006, Ahsan Rizvi, Antofagasta's lawyer at the time who later became TCC's lawyer, had mentioned in passing to me his idea to hire someone like Mr. Malik with experience and contacts in Quetta. This idea was not instigated or encouraged by TCC or me. I do not recall why Mr. Rizvi brought this up or why he thought he needed to share this with me. I did not have an opinion either way about the merits of Mr. Rizvi's idea or the suitability of Mr. Malik as a candidate. I also do not recall making any comment or opinion to Mr. Rizvi in response. I believe that Mr. Rizvi ultimately decided to hire Mr. Malik, but again, I did not encourage or take any part in that decision*.\"991\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 32.\n\n820.\n\nAs for the second aspect, Respondent also refers to an e-mail sent by Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Malik on 26 February 2006, attaching drafts of the Novation Agreements, in which he did not copy anyone from the BDA. In this e-mail, Mr. Iqbal referred to a telephone conference on 24 February 2006 and stated: \"*As discussed, please find attached four novation agreements for CHEJVA, EL5, EL6 and EL8 for your review and perusal with the law department with Farooq's help.*\"992\n\n**Exhibit CE-438**.\n\n821.\n\nIn addition, Respondent relies on an e-mail from Mr. Iqbal to Mr. Hargreaves dated 6 March 2006 in which he wrote in relevant part:\n\n\"*Jamshid* [Malik] *has reviewed and forwarded four drafts of the novation agreements to Farook along with his comments that these are in accordance with our discussion with BDA and he (Jamshid) is satisfied with them.*\n\n*Jamshid has a concern that he was hired by BDA to review novation agreements for EL5 only. I told him that we will pay for his time he will spend on novation agreements for EL6 and EL8. The benefit for us to route these agreements through him and BDA is that they are in a good position to get these cleared from law department in a one go. He was agreed to it.*\n\n*I also spoke to Farook and he said he is reviewing the agreements and will take action on these shortly. He was happy to carry novation agreements for EL6 & EL8 to the law department for us although they do not belong to the joint venture*.\"993\n\n**Exhibit RE-321**.\n\n822.\n\nClaimant notes that the GOB did not have an interest in Exploration Licenses EL-6 and EL-8 Licenses and was not a party to their novation.994 Mr. Hargreaves further testified in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*Moreover, I do not recall hiring and paying Mr. Malik directly in respect of the EL-6 and EL-8 novations. I have now seen a copy what appears to be an incomplete e-mail exchange between Mr. Iqbal and myself dated 6 March 2006. Mr. Iqbal's e-mail is a response to my request for feedback from Mr. Malik on the Novation Agreements dated 4 March 2006. Even after seeing these e-mails I still cannot recall whether TCC in fact hired and paid Mr. Malik, which Mr. Iqbal claims.*\n\n*At the time, EL-6 and EL-8 were exclusively held by TCC, in which the GOB did not have any interest. In any event, if TCC had retained Mr. Malik in respect of the EL-6 and EL-8, this would not have been a secret, but open and known to the BDA. Moreover, Mr. Malik was generally suitable to provide advice because of his familiarity with the project and the transaction. Had TCC retained Mr. Malik, my impression was that the BDA would have permitted Mr. Malik to act as long as the BDA did not have to pay him for doing TCC work. In fact, the BDA may have preferred Mr. Malik's involvement to stay aware of developments in these transactions because the BDA hoped to gain an interest in EL-6 and EL-8, as long as the BDA did not have to pay for it*.\"995\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 404; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n823.\n\nWhile the Tribunal does not find that Claimant was aware of and encouraged a job offer to Mr. Malik made at some point in 2006 by Antofagasta's local counsel, Mr. Rizvi, the record does indicate that Claimant may have paid or at least offered to pay Mr. Malik for his review of the initially contemplated novation agreements regarding Exploration Licenses EL-6 and EL-8. The record further does show that Mr. Iqbal appeared to be in direct contact with Mr. Malik at the time. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this amounted to improper influence given the explanation provided by Mr. Hargreaves regarding the interrelation of the four novation agreements, coupled with the BDA's reasonable unwillingness to pay for the review of documents to which it was not party. Mr. Hargreaves further stated that the BDA would have been aware of such an arrangement at the time \u2013 a statement that Respondent has not disputed.\n\n824.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. Malik exercised any relevant influence during the negotiations of the 2006 Novation Agreements. Respondent submits that on the basis of the evidence it has adduced, \"*it would appear that the improper actions in respect of Mr Malik on TCC's behest had an impact on the procurement of the Novation Agreements.*\"996 It further argues that as a result of shifting his loyalty to TCC, \"[t]*he BDA was \u2026 not represented in the Novation Agreements negotiations by independent legal counsel as it should have been*.\"997 Mr. Iqbal testified in this regard that \"*Mr Malik went on to be a great help to TCC during the process of negotiating the Novation Agreements. I know that Mr Hargreaves was very pleased with Mr Malik's contributions, as well as with his enthusiasm and willingness to help*.\"998 The Tribunal notes, however, that neither Respondent nor Mr. Iqbal identify any specific action or omission of Mr. Malik that was supposedly \"*helpful*\" to them and went against the GOB's interests. Apart from the fact that Respondent has not pointed to any requirement for the BDA to be represented by outside legal counsel during the negotiations, it has thus failed to establish any specific impact that Mr. Malik has or failed to have during the negotiations of the Novation Agreements.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 286.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135 lit. a.\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 33.\n\n**(iii) The Change of Approach to the Signatories of the Novation Agreements**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe second issue raised by Respondent concerns the undisputed fact that, contrary to the initial approach, which contemplated that four novation agreements would be signed, *inter alia*, by the Director General of the MMDD (as was still reflected in the drafts circulated by Claimant on 16 March 2006),999 it was decided shortly thereafter that BHP would submit applications for the assignment and transfer of Exploration Licenses EL-5, EL-6 and EL-8 to the MMDD,1000 while two Novation Agreements for the CHEJVA and EL-5 would be signed by the Chairman of the BDA.1001 According to Claimant, this change came about at a meeting held between representatives from BHP, Claimant, the BDA and the MMDD on 18 March 2006 where the Director General, Mr. Ahmed, refused to sign the Novation Agreements.1002 In this regard, Claimant refers to Mr. Hargreaves who stated in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*In March 2006, I attended a meeting with the GOB, BDA officials including Mr. Farooq, and BDA's lawyer to sign the Novation Agreements. Up until that meeting we had been planning to have four Novation Agreements and expecting that the Director General of the Mines and Minerals Development Department (*'MMDD' *) would have been one of the signatories to all four agreements. However, at the March meeting the Director General, supported by external counsel and by Mr. Farooq, refused to sign the Novation Agreements. They took the view that there was no reason for the MMDD to be a party to any of the Novation Agreements. Rather, the Novation Agreements for the CHEJVA and exploration license EL-5 should be executed by the BDA on behalf of the GOB by virtue of the GOB's 25% interest in the joint venture. The MMDD would only consider the formal applications under Rule 64 of the Balochistan Mineral Rules to accomplish the actual license transfers.*\n\n*These comments from the GOB, the BDA, and their counsel prompted BHP and TCC to reorganize the transaction to follow the structure Balochistan had proposed. In accordance with this new structure, on 28 March 2006, I transmitted revised and final drafts of the Novation Agreements for the CHEJVA and EL-5 to the BDA, which the BDA signed on 1 April 2006. In parallel, on 28 March 2006, I transmitted, on behalf of BHP, its applications under Rule 64 for transfers of EL-5 and two other exploration licenses. On 8 April 2006, the MMDD approved these applications and assigned the EL-5 in favour of TCCA*.\"1003\n\n*See* **Exhibits CE-441**, **CE-442**, **CE-443** *and* **CE-492**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-444** and **CE-445**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-3** and **CE-447**.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 159.\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n826.\n\nRespondent does not deny that Mr. Ahmed raised objections to signing the Novation Agreements at the 18 March 2006 meeting but claims that this had been agreed beforehand during a \"*dinner-meeting*\" in mid-March 2006 held between Mr. Arndt, Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Ahmed.1004 Respondent refers to the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, who had not mentioned such meeting in his first witness statement but had more generally testified that \"*there was tremendous pressure on myself by Col. Khan to get the Agreement signed quickly without any changes from the draft agreed upon by BHP and TCC.*\"1005 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq then stated:\n\n\"*One evening shortly before 18 March 2006, I had dinner at a hotel in Karachi with Mr Hargreaves, Mr Arndt and Maqbool Ahmed Hussain (Director General of the MMDD). I showed the TCC representatives the (unhelpful) comments made by the CS in a Note on 21 September 2005 in relation to the Novation Agreements, for the BDA to* 'coordinate with Law, BDA and Finance and then a commented proposal safeguarding our interests be put up for approval of competent authority'*. I explained to them that it was not possible for the novations to be approved and executed through the proper channels in the timeframe they required. These requirements caused some concern amongst them and I and Mr Maqbool Ahmed told them that the best way to get the Novation Agreements signed without these further steps was for the Chairman of the BDA alone (and not the MMDD also) to sign the Novation Agreements. Mr Arndt immediately supported our suggestion, while Mr Hargreaves took a bit of convincing. We agreed that Mr Hargreaves would handle the CS and while I would focus my attention on persuading the Chairman of the BDA to sign the Novation Agreements (contrary to the CS's direction). At this dinner, I warned TCC to be careful about making Mr Yousaf (the new Chairman of the BDA) uneasy and that I would manage him. We also discussed my intended appointment as the Chairman of the BDA.*\n\n*The 18 March 2006 meeting was for the purpose of discussing the process for getting the Novation Agreements signed. As arranged at the earlier dinner meeting, Mr Maqbool Ahmed and I raised objections to the Novation Agreements being signed by the MMDD and instead proposed that only the Chairman of the BDA sign the Novation Agreements on the part of the GoB. It is therefore not true that TCC did not know about this change to the structure of the transaction before this meeting or that there was no reason for me raising an objection. The whole purpose of my objection was to bypass the other approvals that would otherwise be required to be obtained.*\"1006\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 272 lit. a.\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 14.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n827.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Hargreaves rejected the allegation that he and Mr. Arndt had participated in a private meeting with Mr. Farooq and Mr. Ahmed and maintained that he had \"*learned about the request to change the transaction at the meeting in March 2006 attended by the GOB, BDA officials, and BDA's lawyer, and not at that private meeting in which a plan was also devised for* [him] *to* 'handle' *Chief Secretary (*'CS' *) KB Rind*.\"1007 He added:\n\n\"*Even though representatives for Antofagasta and TCC tried to explain the reasons why we thought the DG should sign, he refused to do so. He insisted that the Novation Agreements for the CHEJVA and exploration license EL-5 should be signed by the BDA only, as the BDA was the GOB's agent contractually. In contrast, he wanted to preserve the MMDD's role as regulator of the mining sector. In that capacity he would not make a contractual agreement; instead, he would only approve formal transfer applications under Rule 64 of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, subject to undertakings TCC was to provide assuming BHP's obligations and liabilities*.\"1008\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 25. *See also* \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 26.\n\n828.\n\nMr. Hargreaves maintained that the Director General's refusal was the reason for the reorganization of the transaction and that, ultimately, the two Novation Agreements were signed and the applications for the transfer of the three Exploration Licenses approved \"*not because* [TCC] *had circumvented rules and processes, but because it had complied with them*.\" Mr. Hargreaves further rejected the allegation that he or others at TCC schemed to \"*handle*\" the Chief Secretary, testifying that he \"*was in no position to* 'handle' *these officials* [*i.e*., the Chief Secretary or the Chief Minister]\" as he \"*could not even arrange a single meeting with either of them prior to Antofagasta's acquisition of TCC*.\" He denied that TCC had \"*a number of meetings with CM Yousaf and CS Rind over the course of early-mid 2006*\" and testified that he did not meet the Chief Secretary, who did not join the Chile trip in December 2006, \"*until even later than that, well after Antofagasta acquired TCC.*\"1009\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n829.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that during his cross-examination, Mr. Hargreaves acknowledged that the new process agreed during the 18 March 2006 meeting was simpler than the one previously contemplated and added that \"*I guess we should be thankful for the Government proposing a simpler process*.\"1010 However, when asked whether he remembered that Mr. Farooq had told him that this was \"*a plan to circumvent the proper channels*,\" Mr. Hargreaves responded:\n\n\"*No, I don't. There was no plan to circumvent proper channels. There was some discussion about what the proper channels were, and that was clarified by giving us a two-channel process; one through the Mines Department and one through the BDA*.\"1011\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2358 lines 16-18.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2359 lines 1-5.\n\n830.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as Mr. Hargreaves testified, the MMDD's no longer being a signatory to the Novation Agreements may have made the signing process simpler than originally planned. However, BHP still had to and did file applications for the renewal and assignment of its (interest in the) Exploration Licenses with the MMDD, which were separately approved by the Director General in his function as the Licensing Authority.1012 Therefore, the Tribunal does not accept that the change in approach agreed on in March 2006 served to circumvent relevant approvals. In particular, if as alleged by Respondent, Mr. Ahmed from the MMDD was part of a secret plan, while the Chairman of the BDA was not, the Tribunal does not see the reason why the plan should have involved removing Mr. Ahmed as signatory from the Novation Agreements.\n\n**Exhibits CE-18**, **CE-449** and **CE-450**.\n\n831.\n\nAs for the alleged \"*handling*\" of the Chief Secretary by Mr. Hargreaves, there is no evidence of any such conduct or that Mr. Hargreaves would have had the necessary influence to \"*handle*\" the GOB official, in particular taking into account Mr. Hargreaves' testimony that he met him for the first time after the Chile trip, *i.e*., long after Antofagasta had acquired Claimant.\n\n**(iv) The Alleged Lack of Authorization from the Governor**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nRespondent also argues that there was no authorization from the Governor of Balochistan for the Chairman of the BDA to sign the Novation Agreements.1013 It again refers to Mr. Farooq who stated in his first witness statement that \"*I also managed to persuade the Chairman at the time, Arbab Yousaf, to sign the Novation Agreement on behalf of the BDA.*\"1014 In his second witness statement, he added:\n\n\"*Mr Yousaf, who was unfamiliar with what was going on at the BDA at this time, agreed, on my advice, to sign the Novation Agreements on behalf of the Governor of Balochistan on the basis of the Governor's authorisation of December 1999, without us obtaining a fresh authorisation and approval by the Governor (which I knew was improper). I pushed the agreements through as I was being pressurised by BHP/TCC personnel to avoid delay*.\"1015\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 272 lit. b.\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 14.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 36.\n\n833.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of whether the Chairman of the BDA was properly authorized to sign in particular the CHEJVA, but also the Addendum and the Novation Agreements, was already discussed at an earlier stage of these proceedings. In its Draft Decision, the Tribunal found that even if there was an internal issue within the GOB regarding the proper authorization of the CHEJVA (which Respondent claimed to have continued in the signing of the Novation Agreement),1016 there was no evidence that any Government representative suggested at any stage prior to early 2011 that the CHEJVA was invalid. The Tribunal further found that the reasons for which the Supreme Court ultimately declared the CHEJVA (and also the Novation Agreement) invalid did not concern any illegal conduct on the part of Claimant but rather failures on the part of the GOB and the BDA to comply with their internal laws.1017\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Respondent's Rejoinder on Liability and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 25.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 637-638, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 640-641.\n\n834.\n\nAs noted above, it is further undisputed by Respondent that Antofagasta's investment in Pakistan had high-level support.1018 As Mr. Hargreaves testified in his first witness statement:\n\n\"*In early 2006, we also had high-level meetings with GOB officials, including a meeting with the Governor, to discuss Barrick and Antofagasta's future participation in the Reko Diq project. Representatives of the BDA also attended this meeting. Antofagasta's Chairman, Jean-Paul Luksic, also met with GOP and GOB officials including Pakistan's Prime Minister and the Governor of Balochistan. At these meetings, formal substitution of TCC for BHP's interest was openly discussed. The GOP and GOB officials understood that Antofagasta and Barrick would jointly own TCC and enthusiastically supported their development of the mine*.\"1019\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 249.\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 39.\n\n835.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Chairman of the BDA lacked the proper authorization from the GOB to sign the Novation Agreements and thus to allow for the entry of Antofagasta into the project.\n\n**(v) The Alleged Improper Influence over Mr. Farooq and the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Yousaf**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n836.\n\nRespondent claims that Mr. Farooq improperly influenced the Chairman to sign the Addendum without proper authorization and that he was motivated to do so by a promise that TCC would get him to be appointed Chairman of the BDA if he managed to get the Novation Agreements signed. In addition, Respondent alleges that the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Yousaf, was given expensive gifts by TCC.\n\n837.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that Respondent does not raise an allegation that any illegitimate payments were made or offered in connection with the Novation Agreement. Mr. Farooq confirmed in his second witness statement that he was \"*not aware of any specific payments made to get the Novation Agreements signed*.\"1020\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 38.\n\n838.\n\nMr. Farooq further testified:\n\n\"*However, TCC did give Arbab Yousaf, who became the new Chairman of the BDA in January 2006, gifts, such as a Rolex watch and a cigar case. These were given to the Chairman in his room at a hotel (I do not recall which one) in Karachi prior to a meeting on 18 March 2006*.\"1021\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 38.\n\n839.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Mr. Farooq does not identify any individual who is supposed to have given these gifts on behalf of TCC.1022 Mr. Hargreaves further testified in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*Chairman Yousaf was one of the few BDA chairmen who expressed interest in the project and in fact was the only one to visit the Reko Diq site during his tenure. In all my dealings with him, he expressed support for and a legitimate interest in the project. There was no reason to feel uneasy or distrust him. Chairman Yousaf's support was genuine and, contrary to Mr. Farooq's insinuations, not bought by gifts that TCC allegedly gave him such as \"a Rolex watch and a cigar case*.\"1023\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 403; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 31.\n\n840.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Respondent's allegation regarding the alleged gifts to Mr. Yousaf is not sufficiently substantiated.1024 Also taking into account Mr. Hargreaves' testimony on the nature of Mr. Yousaf's interest in and support for the project, the Tribunal is not persuaded that any illegitimate gifts were given to Mr. Yousaf to ensure that he would sign the Novation Agreements.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 403.\n\n841.\n\nRespondent further claims that Mr. Farooq was promised by several individuals at TCC that they would get him appointed Chairman of the BDA if he managed to get the Novation Agreements signed. In his first witness statement, Mr. Farooq testified in this regard:\n\n\"*Col. Sher Khan had promised me that if I managed to get the Novation Agreement signed as he wished, he would work to get me appointed as the Chairman of the BDA, a longstanding ambition of mine. Col. Sher Khan and TCC came good on their promise. In June 2006, I was appointed Chairman of the BDA*.\"1025\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 14.\n\n842.\n\nCol. Khan did not mention the alleged promise in his first witness statement but then confirmed Mr. Farooq's testimony in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*I understand that Mr Farooq has explained how, in 2006, I (and others) promised that if he worked with TCC to have the Novation Agreements executed, TCC would in return work to have Mr Farooq appointed as the Chairman of the BDA. I can confirm that I made this promise to Mr Farooq in the months prior to the signing of the Novation Agreements and that, contrary to what Mr Hargreaves and Mr Flores now say, TCC did exert their influence to have Mr Farooq installed as the BDA Chairman in June 2006.*\n\n*The position of Chairman of the BDA is appointed by the Chief Minister of Balochistan (CM). The appointment to this position \u2013 like many others in Balochistan \u2013 depends almost entirely on political will and personal influence. In mid-2006, the CM was Jam Yusuf, who was a very corrupt man. TCC (myself and then-CEO Eduardo Flores) had a number of meetings with CM Yusuf and CS Rind over the course of early-mid 2006. At many of these meetings, we made it clear that TCC wanted Mr Farooq to be the Chairman of the BDA because it would mean that things would get done for the project. I recall one meeting in the month or two after the Novation Agreement was signed which Mr Flores and I attended with CS Rind in which we expressly recommended that Mr Farooq be appointed as Chairman. TCC's endorsement carried significant weight. There was enthusiasm for Antofagasta in Government circles at that time. Mr Farooq was duly appointed Chairman of the BDA in June 2006*.\"1026\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n843.\n\nMr. Farooq also expanded on this allegation in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*I always wanted to become Chairman of the BDA, as this was an important and influential post and personally of great significance to me. However, it was difficult for me to become Chairman because I was a BDA cadre officer (and had not spent time in more prestigious parts of the civil service) \u2013 I am the only Chairman from the BDA cadre to date. Also, I was not affiliated with any local caste. I therefore needed to rely on Mr Hargreaves and Col. Sher Khan, who were influential people, to recommend me to CM Jam Yousaf and CS Rind, which I know they did. It was ultimately the CM and CS that would decide who the new Chairman would be. However, the reality was that senior individuals at TCC (including Mr Hargreaves and Col. Sher Khan) were extremely influential and could impact the CM's and CS's decision. Although I said in my first statement that it was Col. Sher Khan that promised to get me appointed as Chairman of the BDA if I got the Novation Agreements signed. I now recall that Mr Arndt and Mr Hargreaves made similar promises. I also relied on my relationship with CM Yousaf, who used to take his share from me of money received from contractors and to whom I paid money to get my appointment over the line*.\"1027\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 32.\n\n844.\n\nMr. Flores responded to Mr. Farooq's testimony of the alleged promise given to him by Col. Khan:\n\n\"*I am not aware of any such arrangement and believe this claim to be false. It also makes no sense. Neither Col. Khan nor anyone else at TCC had the ability to influence the Provincial Governement's political appointments*.\"1028\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 31.\n\n845.\n\nMr. Hargreaves stated in in his first witness statement that he was \"*surprised by Col. Khan's alleged promise*\" and also by Mr. Farooq's purported \"*longstanding ambition*\" to become Chairman of the BDA. He testified:\n\n\"*I am not even sure that was the case since Mr. Farooq told me, and I had also heard from others, that he wanted to remain BDA's Director of Finance to avoid the politics associated with the chairmanship. More importantly, TCC and Col. Khan had no influence over the appointment of the BDA Chairman. Presumably, the GOB appointed the Chairman of the BDA. We also had no problem with the then-Chairman, Arbab Yousaf, and would have been happy to see him continue to chair the BDA. He was the only BDA Chairman who visited the Reko Diq site, and had considerably more involvement with and knowledge of the project than his predecessors*.\"1029\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 64.\n\n846.\n\nIn his second witness statement, *i.e*., after he had been directly implicated by Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan's testimony, Mr. Hargreaves responded as follows:\n\n\"*Since TCC had conducted itself perfectly lawfully in obtaining the Novation Agreements and the license transfers, Mr. Farooq's and Col. Khan's allegations about how I or perhaps others at TCC schemed to* 'handle' *CS Rind or to somehow get Mr. Farooq appointed BDA Chairman are false and even bizarre. I never promised Mr. Farooq any such thing. Moreover, the truth was that I was in no position to* 'handle' *these officials or influence them so as to win Mr. Farooq the BDA Chairmanship. I could not even arrange a single meeting with either of them prior to Antofagasta's acquisition of TCC. In early 2006, we even travelled to Quetta with senior Antofagasta representatives but could not get an audience with Chief Minister of Balochistan (*'CM' *) Yousaf. It was certainly not the case that TCC* 'had a number of meetings with CM Yousaf and CS Rind over the course of early-mid 2006.' *In fact, the Chile trip was the first occasion during which I actually interacted with the CM, and since the CS did not join the trip I did not meet him until even later than that, well after Antofagasta acquired TCC. Given that I could not get a meeting CM Yousaf or CS Rind, even when we tried to introduce key decision-makers from one of the largest mining companies in the world, it should be evident how farfetched it is to allege that my endorsement* 'carried significant weight' *or* 'could impact' *CS Rind and CM Yusuf*.\"1030\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\n847.\n\nMr. Flores also responded to Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan's testimony in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*These allegations are all false. As I stated in my previous witness statement, to my knowledge, TCC played no role in the appointment of Mr. Farooq as Chairman of the BDA, and had no ability to influence government appointments in Balochistan. In addition, I made no request or suggestion concerning the appointment of Mr. Farooq as BDA Chair in any meetings with government officials in 2006, and to my knowledge, Col. Khan did not do so either. In fact, I recall that I first learned of Mr. Farooq's appointment from Tim Hargreaves, when he explained that Mr. Farooq was actually the fourth person to be appointed BDA Chairman in that year alone.*\n\n*Moreover, the supposed timing of these claims demonstrates how false they are. Mr. Farooq has said that he was appointed as BDA Chairman in June 2006. As I have explained, my first trip to Pakistan occurred in May 2006, shortly after I was appointed TCC CEO. A copy of my itinerary for that trip has been submitted as Ex. CE-515. While I and other TCC colleagues met with representatives of the BDA on two days of this visit (see id. at 2), I did not meet with Chief Minister Yousaf or Chief Secretary Rind during this trip, and certainly would not have had time in my busy schedule to meet with them multiple times prior to Mr. Farooq's June 2006 appointment*.\"1031\n\nFlores II, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n848.\n\nThe memorandum by which Mr. Hargreaves informed Mr. Flores on 21 June 2006 of, *inter alia*, Mr. Farooq's appointment as Chairman of the BDA, reads in relevant part:\n\n\"***BDA Chairman changes again today!***\n\n*Mohamad Farooq was officially appointed as Chairman BDA today. The good news is that Farooq has been associated with the project for 13 years and is the most knowledgeable and competent person with whom we have been associated. The bad news is that he is the 4th Chairman of the year and is now at risk of being politically ousted as he is now in a more vulnerable political position (the record was 13 Chairmen rotated through the post in a single year!). If Farooq's appointment signals GOB recognition of the growing importance of the project and the need for continuity it presents us with a window of opportunity to move ahead on the* [mineral] *agreements*.\"1032\n\n**Exhibit CE-516**, p. 1.\n\n849.\n\nDuring the hearing, all four witnesses were cross-examined on this issue. When Mr. Farooq was asked whether he had given a bribe to the Chief Minister to become Chairman of the BDA, he answered: \"*Yes, I gave him a bribe, but TCC helped me more in this regard.*\" When referred to his written testimony that Col. Khan and Mr. Hargreaves recommended him to Chief Minister Yousaf, he responded that \"*Colonel Sher Khan was not alone in this\u2014the CEO, Mr. Flores was there. Their CEO was there. They helped me, and they said,* 'If you keep helping us with our work of mining and mineral, we'll make your Chairman.'\"1033 Mr. Farooq then confirmed that the decision on who becomes Chairman of the BDA is made by the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary.1034 In response to the question whether it was therefore his testimony that Mr. Hargreaves and Col. Khan recommended him to these two officials rather than \"*make*\" him Chairman, he stated:\n\n\"*To recommend and put in a good word is the only thing needed to make someone. recommending someone that's what they could do. I was an ex-cadre man. I could not become Chairman. I needed some recommendation from the people they bribed, or met or partied with---they had influence over the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary, so they could do this for me\u2014they could get my job done, and they could do this for me*.\n\n*And I asked them for their recommendation. Recommendation means to put in a good word. They used to meet them so that's why my job was done and they played the mid part in this*.\"1035\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 545 line 15 to p. 546 line 6.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 548 lines 16-21.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 549 lines 8-22.\n\n850.\n\nMr. Farooq further confirmed his written testimony that he also \"*paid money to get* [his] *appointment for the job*\" and that his influence regarding the appointment of Mr. Mandokhail as Chairman of the BDA in 2003 \"*was there because of the money* [he] *was paying*.\"1036\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 551 lines 6-22.\n\n851.\n\nCol. Khan confirmed during the hearing that he had testified on the alleged promise he made to Mr. Farooq only in his second witness statement, stating that he \"*was not directly involved, but* [he] *knew what was happening*.\" Col. Khan further testified that he knew about this alleged promise at the time he submitted his first witness statement and at the time he talked to the NAB, but the \"*NAB did not speak to* [him] *on the subject of the Novation*.\"1037 Col. Khan then confirmed that the Chairman of the BDA was not appointed by TCC but rather by the Governor of Balochistan and described Claimant's alleged involvement in the appointment as follows:\n\n\"[I]*n our case, yes, we put in a word, and because he had done a fantastic job for us, a very much\u2014a job which was totally impossible, and we had promised that we put in a word, and I remember taking Mr. Eduardo Flores to the Chief Minister, and we put in a word for his becoming the Chairman of the BDA*.\"1038\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1026 line 20 to p. 1028 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1029 line 14 to p. 2030 line 10.\n\n852.\n\nWhen Mr. Flores was confronted with the testimony of Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan that TCC had lobbied to get Mr. Farooq appointed as Chairman, he again denied this allegation, stating \"[t]*hat's, again, something that never happened*.\"1039 More specifically, when confronted with Col. Khan's testimony that he and Mr. Flores had made clear to the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary that they wanted Mr. Farooq to be Chairman, Mr. Flores answered:\n\n\"*A. The answer is no. I'm sorry. It doesn't make sense. Mr. Farooq was not the person that can make a big change, potentially, in the business.*\n\n*Q. No, but he was someone who had been very helpful, hadn't he?*\n\n*A. On the operational side, I would say yes, but that's something that the company was trying to develop a much bigger business in the country, in the region.*\n\n*Q. Indeed, but to do that, you needed, in place at the BDA, someone who would look after TCC's interest?*\n\n*A. Absolutely. \u2026 Interests of TCC, including 25 percent of the Government of Balochistan. They were owners of the Project as well*.\"1040\n\nTranscript (Day 10, p. 2586 lines 1-6.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2586 line 11 to p. 2587 line 5.\n\n853.\n\nMr. Flores further confirmed that Mr. Farooq was \"*a very good person in terms of helping facilitating, et cetera*\" but also stated that \"*the company was also interacting with all of the agencies of the Balochistan Government, in order to get the permits*.\"1041 In response to the question whether, against the background that the Reko Diq project had just been acquired by two large mining companies, the endorsement by TCC's CEO of a person with whom it wished to deal at the GOB and the BDA would carry considerable weight, Mr. Flores responded: \"*Of course it would be helpful, but not in the level that that the company lobbied to maintaim him as a Chairman of the BDA, or to become Chairman of the BDA.*\"1042\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2587 lines 9-12.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2588 line 21 to p. 2589 line 13.\n\n854.\n\nFinally, Mr. Flores stated with regard to his first trip to Pakistan in May 2006 that he recalled having had coffee with Mr. Farooq at the Serena Quetta hotel but that he had \"*no background of Mr. Farooq at that time. That makes no sense for me trying to convey the message that he might stay or become Chairman of the BDA*.\" Mr. Flores further did not remember having met the Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary on this trip. When asked about the two full days of meetings in Quetta referenced in his itinerary for the trip, he answered that he did not recall having had those meetings. He added: \"*I don't remember what we did those two days, if those two days happened. I'm trying to remember 10 years ago, and not easy for me to mention what else happened. But I don't remember to have had a meeting with the Chief Minister.*\"1043\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2591 line 5 to p. 2594 line 5.\n\n855.\n\nMr. Hargreaves was not questioned about the alleged promise to Mr. Farooq. In the context of the allegation that Mr. Farooq overcharged TCC in respect of the airfares paid for the Chile trip, which will be discussed in further detail below, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that he considered Mr. Farooq very helpful for TCC and added: \"*I just want to record my appreciation of all that he did for us. He's characterized as a villain, but he was very helpful for Tethyan*.\" When asked whether he thus considered it good news when Mr. Farooq was appointed Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Hargreaves responded: \"*I thought it was good that we had the continuity preserved. But I also saw it as a risk because of the rotating seat of the Chairman. I felt that we may not have him there for very long*.\"1044\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2440 lines 4-16.\n\n856.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this final statement accords with Mr. Hargreaves' contemporaneous memorandum in which he reported about Mr. Farooq's appointment as Chairman of the BDA, which has been quoted above at paragraph 683 above. While it is clear from Mr. Hargreaves' testimony that he considered Mr. Farooq's assistance in relation to the Reko Diq project very helpful, the Tribunal thus considers it questionable whether Claimant would have even wanted Mr. Farooq to be in the politically exposed position of Chairman, which was described by both sides as a \"*revolving door*\" given that Mr. Farooq had been the fourth Chairman appointed in the course of one year, while Mr. Farooq's previous assistance had been independent of his different positions within the BDA.1045\n\n*Cf*. Transcript (Day 9), p. 2240 line 17 to p. 2441 line 8.\n\n857.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant and, in particular, Col. Khan, Mr. Hargreaves or Mr. Flores, would have been in a position to exercise notable influence on the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary who were in charge of nominating the Chairman of the BDA. During the hearing, both Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan confirmed that the sole contribution that any of them could have made was to \"*put in a word*\" for Mr. Farooq. In the Tribunal's view, however, this is not equal to a promise from Claimant that Mr. Farooq would be made Chairman of the BDA if the Novation Agreements were signed and, thus, it is doubtful whether this could be considered as an exercise of improper influence, even if it were considered established that someone from Claimant had \"*put in a word*.\"\n\n858.\n\nIn addition, Respondent has failed to establish that Mr. Hargreaves or Mr. Flores did, in fact, \"*put in a word*\" for Mr. Farooq. In particular, the Tribunal does not consider it sufficient evidence that, according to his itinerary, Mr. Flores had two days of meetings in Quetta during his first trip to Pakistan in May 2006. First, Mr. Flores could not recall having had a meeting with either the Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary on that occasion. Second, even if there was a meeting with either of these officials at that point, this would still not accord with Col. Khan's testimony that he and Mr. Flores had \"*a number of meetings with CM Yusuf and CS Rind over the course of early-mid* 2006,\" given that Mr. Flores was in Pakistan only once before Mr. Farooq became Chairman. Mr. Hargreaves, whom Mr. Farooq described as \"*extremely influential*,\" also testified that he had not been able to arrange a single meeting with these two officials and only met them during the Chile trip in December 2006 and, in the case, of the Chief Secretary, only thereafter. There is no documentary evidence in the record that any meeting took place between Mr. Hargreaves and either the Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary prior to Mr. Farooq's appointment as Chairman.\n\n859.\n\nFinally, the internal memorandum prepared by Mr. Hargreaves also does not give any indication that he or Mr. Flores had been involved and, on Respondent's case, succeeded in having Mr. Farooq appointed. To the contrary, the memorandum reports both an upside and a downside to this development, which speaks against Respondent's allegation that both the author and the recipient of this memorandum had lobbied to get Mr. Farooq appointed.\n\n860.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Mr. Farooq himself testified that he paid a bribe to the Chief Minister to become Chairman of the BDA in June 2006 and that he had also managed to get Mr. Mandokhail appointed to the same position in 2003 by exercising his influence and paying money. Thus, the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Farooq's testimony that he would not have been able to become Chairman without the alleged recommendation from Claimant.\n\n861.\n\nFinally, as to the alleged promise made prior to the execution of the Novation Agreements, the Tribunal notes that while Mr. Farooq initially testified in his first witness statement that such promise was made by Col. Khan, he stated in his second witness statement that he remembered that Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Arndt made similar promises to him. During the hearing, he then testified that Mr. Flores had also been involved. Col. Khan, on the other hand, did not mention the alleged promise at all in his first witness statement, then confirmed in his second witness statement that he had made the promise and went to the Chief Minister with Mr. Flores. He did not, however, make reference to Mr. Hargreaves or Mr. Arndt. By contrast, Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Flores consistently denied having made any promise to Mr. Farooq or having \"*put in a word*\" for him with the Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary and also consistently explained why they considered that they would not have been in a position to do so and why it would not have made sense in their view to make such a recommendation. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that either Mr. Hargreaves or Mr. Flores made a promise to Mr. Farooq. While Mr. Farooq further made reference to Mr. Arndt in his second witness statement, the Tribunal considers that his involvement in the alleged promise has not been substantiated.\n\n862.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is aware that Col. Khan confirmed that he himself made a promise to Mr. Farooq on behalf of Claimant. The Tribunal is not convinced, however, by this testimony, taking into account the inconsistencies referred to above and the fact that Col. Khan could not point to any specific occasion on which the alleged recommendation to the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary was made.\n\n863.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal therefore does not accept that Mr. Farooq was promised by Claimant that he would be appointed Chairman of the BDA if he secured the signing of the Novation Agreements. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion at this point whether the conduct of any individual, in particular of Col. Khan, would have been attributable to Claimant.\n\n864.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent has thus failed to establish that any illegitimate benefits were promised or bestowed by Claimant in connection with the Novation Agreements. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunal also rejects the allegation that the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Yousaf, was persuaded by illegitimate means to sign the Novation Agreements. In that regard, the Tribunal also recalls its earlier finding that there is no reason to assume that it would have been against the GOB's interests in early 2006 to consent to the replacement of BHP by TCC and thus to allow for the entry of Antofagasta, one of the world's largest copper mining companies, into the project. In line with the Tribunal's previous finding that TCC's activities in Pakistan were highly welcomed and encouraged at every level of the GOB and the GOP at the time, the Tribunal therefore does not accept that the negotiation or execution of the Novation Agreements was tainted by corruption.\n\n**f. Additional Allegation Pertaining to the Time Period Prior to the Execution of the Novation Agreements**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n865.\n\nAs a final note in the context of the making of Claimant's investment, the Tribunal makes reference to an additional allegation raised in Respondent's Application that pertains to the period prior to the execution of the Novation Agreements, *i.e*., the allegation that Mr. Shehbaz Mandokhail received during his tenure as Chairman of the BDA from August 2003 to May 2005 monthly payments of PAK Rs. 100,000 to 200,000 from Mr. Farooq, allegedly \"*on behalf of TCC*\" in exchange for \"*looking after their affairs in relation to Reko Diq*.\"1046 Respondent did not make any further reference to this allegation in its subsequent submissions. Claimant briefly addressed it as one of Respondent's \"*other scattershot allegations*.\"1047\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 33.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 272.\n\n866.\n\nMr. Mandokhail testified in his witness statement:\n\n\"*In addition to my salary referred to above (paid by cheque) and throughout my tenure as Chairman of the BDA, I used to receive a monthly sum of between PAK Rs 100,000 to PAK RS 200,000 in cash from Mr Farooq. Mr Farooq told me that this came from TCC in return for looking after their affairs in relation to Reko Diq. He told me that he received money frequently from TCC on many occasions*.\n\n*During this time, I had an office in the same building and on the same corridor as Mr Farooq. Colonel Sher Khan, who was the Governmental Affairs Manager for TCC, used to visit Mr Farooq in his office frequently. I never saw Col Sher Khan give money to Mr Farooq, but they both told me on numerous occasions that this was what happended \u2013 they were two sides of the same coin.*\n\n*On five or six occasions, the two of them came into my office to discuss a number of matters relating to the Reko Diq project, including security for TCC staff to visit the Reko Diq mine and other matters such as land for the airstrip (discussed below). Col. Sher Khan told me during at least one of these meetings that he was* 'looking after Mr Farooq'*. As a result, TCC requirements relating to the Reko Diq project were always given top priority.*\"1048\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n\n867.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement about Mr. Mandokhail and his predecessor as Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Sheryar Khan Mehsud, as follows:\n\n\"*In 2003, Sheryar Khan Mehsud was the Chairman of the BDA. He was critical of TCC and raised a number of objections to their conduct, particularly the delays in exploration. I also knew that he would be difficult to bribe. I spoke with Chris Arndt, who was general Manager at the time, who asked me to manage the Chairman. I suggested to Mr Arndt that it would be easier if we just got someone else appointed as Chairman of the BDA. He agreed. My choice was Shehbaz Khan Mandokhail, an ex-Director of the BDA, who I believed would be amenable to taking bribes and would therefore do TCC's bidding. This was based on my knowledge having worked with him before and I explained this to Mr Arndt. Mr Arndt and I agreed that TCC would complain to the CM about Mr Mehsud and that I would lobby to get Mr Mandokhail the job. We were successful, and Mr Mandokhail was appointed Chairman of the BDA in late 2003. Soon after his appointment, CM Yousaf told Mr Mandokhail in my presence that he would be rewarded if he looked after TCC's interests. From 2003, I made regular cash payments to Mr Mandokhail to ensure his assistance. I funded these payments from sums I received from BDA's contractors. During Mr Mandokhail's tensure as Chairman, TCC never faced any serious problems*.\"1049\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 12.\n\n868.\n\nCol. Khan stated in his first witness statement that he started to pay Mr. Farooq \"*to get things done*\" after Mr. Farooq had told him \"*that it would be very difficult for TCC to achieve its goals without paying bribes*\" and after he had raised this issue with Mr. Flores \"*in 2006 or 2007*.\"1050 While Col. Khan testified that he was aware of Mr. Farooq's corrupt reputation already from his initial interactions with him \"*around 2002 / 2003*,\"1051 he did not state that he personally made any payments to Mr. Farooq before his alleged discussion with Mr. Flores in 2006 or 2007.\n\nKhan I, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 9.\n\n869.\n\nApart from the fact that the Tribunal does not consider that the specific purpose of any of the alleged payments to Mr. Mandokhail was sufficiently substantiated, it is not convinced that any such payments, if they were indeed made by Mr. Farooq, could be attributed to Claimant. The witness testimony of Mr. Mandokhail and Mr. Farooq is contradictory in this regard. Mr. Farooq confirmed during the hearing that the payments he allegedly made to Mr. Mandokhail were \"*a Chairman's cut*\" out of the money he received from the BDA's contractors.1052 Mr. Mandokhail, on the other hand, denied that he was participating in what Claimant described as \"*the scheme by which Mr. Farooq and other officials took a kickback from \u2026 the BDA contract*\" and that he received \"*any money from any other sector*,\" *i.e*., besides the money he allegedly received from Claimant.1053 While he insisted that the money he had received came from Claimant, Mr. Mandokhail also confirmed that he had never seen Col. Khan or anyone else on behalf of Claimant giving any money to Mr. Farooq.1054 Finally, Col. Khan also did not testify that he made any payments to Mr. Farooq prior to 2006.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 571 line 14 to p. 572 line 20.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1402 lines 2-19 and p. 1406 line 20 to p. 1407 line 1.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1412 line 4 to p. 1413 line 17.\n\n870.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that this final allegation pertaining to the time period preceding the execution of the Novation Agreements has not been proved.\n\n**g. Conclusion on Respondent's Allegations Relating to the Making of Claimant's Investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n871.\n\nFor the reasons set out in detail above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not established any of the alleged acts of corruption in connection with the so-called \"*foundational*\" aspects of Claimant's investment, *i.e*., those relating to and leading up to the establishment of its investment.\n\n872.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal will further assess all allegations of corruption relating to events in the performance of the investment. If and to the extent the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that any such allegation has been established, it will decide on the legal consequences of such finding.\n\n**2. Allegations Relating to the Performance of Claimant's Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nIn the context of the performance of Claimant's investment, Respondent raises allegations concerning additional events, which it describes as \"*integral to TCC's* 'bundle of rights'\" and as having a \"*significant impact on the establishment and the value of TCC's interest*.\"1055 In chronological order, these events are the following: (i) two trips made at the invitation of Claimant's respective parent companies by GOP and GOB officials first to Chile in December 2006 and second to Toronto and Nevada in March 2007; (ii) the grant of an airstrip lease on 10 May 2007; (iii) the extensions of Exploration License EL-5, most importantly the second extension granted on 1 December 2007; (iv); the grant of a surface rights lease on 22 May 2008, as amended on 27 September 2008; (v) certain events surrounding visa applications, which occurred mostly in 2009; and (vi) the negotiations on a mineral agreement from 2007 to 2009 and preparations for the Mining Lease Application that was filed in February 2011.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 106.\n\n**a. Allegations Relating to the 2006 Chile Trip and the 2007 Canada Trip**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n874.\n\nRespondent alleges that two excessive overseas trips were set up with a view to influencing the discretion of the government officials it needed to support the proposed Mineral Agreement and these trips were fraudulently disguised on Antofagasta's books.1056\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 329.\n\n**(a) December 2006 Chile Trip**\n--------------------------------\n\n875.\n\nRespondent dismisses Claimant's argument that the all-expenses paid Chile trip for eleven GOB/GOP officials had a legitimate purpose, incurred reasonable costs and that SONAMI's involvement was unremarkable.1057\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 176-196 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 20, \u00b6\u00b6 92-98 *and* Transcript (Day 1), p. 97 line 20 to p. 98 line 4.\n\n876.\n\nWhile recognizing that the schedule provided for exposure to mining operations and \"*featured scheduled days of mining-related activities,*\" Respondent argues that the documents and evidence paint a different picture.1058 Respondent notes that six GOB delegates arrived late, thereby missing two full days of the schedule, and refers to Mr. Flores' testimony that the visit to the Los Pelambres mine was \"*not well attended by the GoB delegates,*\" meaning that one of the two remaining days was spent enjoying Santiago.1059\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 330; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 178.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 178-180 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 23 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2515 line 12 to p. 2516 line 2.\n\n877.\n\nRespondent dismisses Claimant's explanation that poor health and old age led to poor attendance at the mine. It refers to Mr. Flores' changing testimony as to whether these individuals had undergone medical examinations prior to the trip. In addition, Respondent argues that this demonstrates an oversight on Mr. Hargreaves' part who should have been aware of these individuals' inability to attend.1060 Respondent submits that what was portrayed as an educational itinerary was merely a day of meetings and dinner.1061\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 180 *referring to* Flores I, \u00b6 44, Flores II, \u00b6 23 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2513 line 6 to p. 2514 line 21.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 181.\n\n878.\n\nRespondent maintains that even if Claimant could successfully prove an educational purpose, this alone would not make it \"*legitimate*\" since Antofagasta's anti-corruption policy expressly prohibits \"*any economic benefit under any pretext or circumstances and using any means.*\"1062\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 330 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 208 *and* **Ex RE-434**, Antofagasta Crime Prevention Manual dated November 2014 at p.13.\n\n879.\n\nRespondent argues that the Chilean National Mining Association, SONAMI, was used to conceal the gross expenditure on Government officials from Antofagasta's books, as confirmed by Mr. Flores.1063 Respondent maintains that Claimant's witnesses could provide no plausible explanation as to how inserting SONAMI into the payment structure served any legitimate purpose.1064 Respondent further maintains that SONAMI also provided cover for the potential corruption offense which would have been committed under Pakistani law if Claimant had paid for the trip, as confirmed by Mr. Flores and alluded to by Mr. Hargreaves (had the invitation letter not indicated that the costs would be bourne by SONAMI, the delegation may not have accepted the invitation).1065\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2651 lines 9-13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 183.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 184-187 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2538 line 12 to p. 2539 line 9, p. 2539 lines 10-17 and p. 2539 line 18 to p. 2540 line 2 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2386 lines 4-13.\n\n880.\n\nRespondent further submits that, despite attempts to downplay accommodation and hospitality levels, missing invoices and before considering the stopover, the costs were disproportionately high.1066 In its Reply, Respondent includes a cost breakdown and claims that these costs strayed beyond the bounds of propriety to keep the GOB officials happy.1067 Respondent argues that the excess of attendees, excessive spending on lavish entertainment and excessive stopover trips clearly breached the Code of Ethics, Barrick Gold's Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy as well as Antofagasta's Anti-Corruption policy prohibiting entertainment in excess of USD 100.1068\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 333-334, 349-354 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 212.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 349-354.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 78.\n\n881.\n\nRespondent submits that the ultimate objective of the trip was to curry favor with those Government officials on whom Claimant relied for the grant of various licenses and approvals, and most importantly, the Mineral Agreement, as confirmed by Mr. Hargreaves' e-mail.1069 Despite the suggestion that the Mineral Agreement negotiations had not begun at the time of the trip, Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Flores both testified that this agreement, without which the project was not viable, was very much at the front of Claimant's mind at the time.1070 Moreover, Respondent maintains that Mr. Flores accepted that: (i) Claimant held meetings with Government officials shortly after the trip; (ii) was in fact considering circulation of a Draft Mineral Agreement at that stage; and (iii) by February 2007, had identified the key individuals in the Mineral Agreement negotiation on the Government side.1071\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 188 *referring to* **Ex RE-293**, E-mail, subject: Bonds Invoices (Chile Trip), dated 17 December 2006.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 190-191 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 25, Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 279, Transcript (Day 9), p. 2361 lines 2-12, Flores II, \u00b6 22 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2504 lines 18-21.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 191 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2504 lines 18-21*,* p. 2505 line 22 to p. 2506 line 4, p. 2506 line 21 to p. 2507 line 2 *and* p. 2508 lines 4-9.\n\n882.\n\nRespondent further argues that the stopovers in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro and Nice were wholly improper \u2013 there was no business need for these stops.1072 Mr. Flores and Mr. Hargreaves explained the criteria used to determine what level of expenditure would ultimately be deemed acceptable; Pakistan submits that, measured against this criteria, the London stopover \"*did increase the cost significantly*\" and was therefore excessive.1073 Additionally, Respondent maintains that Claimant's total abdication of responsibility compounded its impropriety given that it made no effort to investigate who approved these stopovers and both Mr. Flores and Mr. Hargreaves denied accountability.1074\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 192-196; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 336.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 193 *referring to* Flores I, \u00b6 42, Transcript (Day 10), p. 2527 lines 18-19, p. 2520 line 22 to p. 2521 line 2, Hargreaves I, \u00b6 54 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2379 line 15 to p. 2380 line 7 *and* p. 2383 line 18 to p. 2384 line 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2502 lines 9-13, p. 2520 lines 3-7 and lines 13-17, p. 2568 line 13 to p. 2569 line 1 *and* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2397 line 22 to p. 2398 line 2.\n\n883.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that Col. Khan's extraordinary expenses on the London stopover were approved without question and in addition, he was allegedly given USD 5,000 in cash from Mr. Flores with which to \"*show the GoB delegates the* 'high life' *in London.*\"1075 Similarly, Respondent submits that the fact that Mr. Farooq was allowed to secure an additional benefit by using his son's own travel agency, Elektra Travel International, to book the flights and in fact its mark-up of the air fares by USD 10,000, was also entirely overlooked.1076\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 335 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 196 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-298**.\n\n**(b) March 2007 Canada Trip**\n------------------------------\n\n884.\n\nRespondent submits that the Canada trip and its stopovers in London and Rome similarly breached company policy, Pakistani law and the FCPA.1077 Respondent maintains that there was a clear crossover in terms of attendance with the Chile trip, with attendance from key decision-makers in the Mineral Agreement discussions (including Chief Secretary Rind, who Mr. Flores deemed to be \"*absolutely*\" one of the key men).1078 Despite Mr. Flores' and Ms. Boggs' testimony that the stopover\" *holidays*\" requested could not be accommodated, Respondent maintains that they took place and were funded by Claimant.1079 Respondent maintains that the testimony of Mr. Flores and Ms. Boggs denying their awareness of this is remarkable given their specific involvement in obtaining legal advice on the propriety of such stopovers.1080 Nonetheless, Respondent maintains that Claimant must be held accountable for these breaches irrespective of who approved them.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 197-199.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 197 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2570 lines 14-20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199 *referring to* Transcript (Day 11), p. 2880 lines 15-17, p. 2882 lines 8-10, p. 2886 line 18 to p. 2887 line 2 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2568 line 21 to p. 2569 to 14 *and* p. 2570 lines 2-4.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199 *referring to* Transcript (Day 11), p. 2886 line 18 to p. 2887 line 2 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2568 line 21 to p. 2569 line 14.\n\n**(c) Result**\n--------------\n\n885.\n\nRespondent alleges that these trips contravened: (i) Barrick Gold's Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy; (ii) Antofagasta's Code of Ethics; and (iii) Articles B3 and B9 of the Antofagasta Crime Prevention Manual.1081 Respondent submits that the trips amounted to acts of improper influence on the Government officials involved and despite not resulting in the signing of the Mineral Agreement, they resulted in delegates acting favorably towards Claimant in the wake of the trips, which led to an expanded exploration programme, the approval of the airstrip lease and the surface rights order.1082\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 200-203 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2534 line 20 to p. 2535 line 5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204.\n\n886.\n\nRespondent thus maintains that these trips demonstrate that Claimant and its shareholders did not maintain a robust compliance culture as claimed and the misconduct is in fact compounded by Claimant's failure to investigate and hold any officer accountable for them.1083 Respondent emphasizes the lack of investigation against anyone within Claimant's company, Barrick Gold or Antofagasta in relation to Elektra Travel's involvement or the delegates' expenses on the London stopover.1084 Respondent maintains that this impropriety continued when Claimant failed to disclose documents relevant to these trips and only did so under threat of adverse inference after Pakistan had joined the dots in relation to SONAMI's involvement to reveal concealment of USD 78,000 in relation to the Chile trip as well as Mr. Flores' complicity in an accounting fraud with SONAMI.1085\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 301-309.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206, \u00b6\u00b6 301-309 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2439 line 18 to p. 2440 line 3 *and* **Exhibit RE-298**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 309 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 26, 81, 327(f) *and* Supplemental Reply, \u00b6 10, 16-23.\n\n887.\n\nUltimately, Respondent maintains that these failures evidence a fundamental lack of diligence on the part of Claimant in managing its investment and that these acts of corruption disentitle Claimant to any protection of its investment under the Treaty.1086\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent mischaracterizes the educational trips, ignoring the testimony of Claimant's witnesses and the contemporaneous documents which serve to confirm the legitimate purpose of the trips.1087 Claimant contends that Respondent has advanced no evidence of a corrupt intent nor a *quid pro quo.*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 270.\n\n**(a) December 2006 Chile Trip**\n--------------------------------\n\n889.\n\nClaimant submits that there can be no reasonable dispute as to the legitimate educational purpose behind the trip for the following reasons.\n\n890.\n\nFirstly, Claimant submits that not only did Mr. Flores testify that the trip helped to educate GOP and GOB officials about the requirements for and benefits of large-scale mining projects, but as evidenced by media reports at the time and an e-mail to Antofagasta employees in 2006 emphasizing that \"[t]*he main objective of this visit is to familiarize the Government of Pakistan with how Chile has developed its mining industry and how its major actors (government, investors, unions, suppliers, and contractors, etc.) properly coordinate with one another to create one of the most productive industries in the country,*\" this was always maintained as the main objective.1088\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 271-274 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-459** *and* **CE-458**; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 143 *referring to* Flores I, \u00b6 35, **Exhibits CE-814**, **CE-521**, p. 3 *and* **CE-524**.\n\n891.\n\nClaimant argues that no weight is to be attached to Mr. Hargreaves' e-mail purportedly demonstrating the \"*ultimate objective of the trip*\" because it was taken out of context.1089 Claimant maintains that as Mr. Hargreaves explained, the ultimate purpose was something far bigger than the Mineral Agreement \u2013 developing the mining industry in Balochistan.1090\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 152-153; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 277-279 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 25, Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 78(c) (*citing* **Exhibit RE-293**).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151.\n\n892.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Mr. Flores also specifically denied the alleged corrupt purpose behind the trip and Col. Khan, in his early statements to the NAB, even emphasized the trip's intended educational purpose (before then exaggerating claims of corruption in response to Claimant's exposure of the gaps in Respondent's case).1091\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2644 lines 5\u20138 *and* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1031 line 14 to p. 1036 line 8.\n\n893.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's emphasis on the unexpected changes to the itinerary, the GOB delegation's travel plans and their reported disinterest in some activities, does not negate the legitimate intentions behind the trip.1092 Claimant submits that Respondent ignores that: (i) Claimant did not plan for and had no control over the shortened itinerary; (ii) Claimant organized a second trip to the Los Pelambres Mine; and (iii) productive meetings and dinners between Federal and Provincial officials and the Chilean Mining Minster which \"*fostered bilateral relations between Chile and Pakistan*\" did take place.1093 Claimant explains that, following meetings with the delegates, the Chilean Foreign Minister described the visit as the \"*high point of bilateral relations which would further strengthen the already existing ties*\" between the two countries.1094\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 145 *referring to* Transcript (Day 1), p. 102 lines 1\u20136.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 145-148 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2374 line 21 to p. 2375 line 2, p. 2382 line 6 to p. 2383 line 12, p. 2459 line 21 to p. 2460 line 3, Transcript (Day 10), p. 2510 lines 9\u201311, p. 2637 lines 14\u201320, p. 2632 lines 12\u201316, p. 2633 lines 2\u20134, p. 2636 lines 16\u201321, **Exhibit CE-519** *and* Flores I, \u00b6 37, 46.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 272 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-519.**\n\n894.\n\nClaimant perceives Respondent's allegations to be nonsensical given the timeline of the Mineral Agreement negotiations which had not even begun at the time of the Chile trip, questioning how it was created to secure an agreement nowhere near finalization.1095 Claimant notes that it did not send a proposed draft of the Mineral Agreement until July 2007, with negotiations only commencing in December 2007 (and then indeed extending for a further three years).1096\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 152.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 152 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-216**, Boggs I, \u00b6 37, **Exhibit CE-219**, p. 4 *and* Boggs I, \u00b6\u00b6 40\u201345.\n\n895.\n\nResponding to the allegations that expenses were \"*extraordinarily high,*\" Claimant maintains that the largest expense was understandably the flights (maintaining that it is not surprising that first-class and business-class arrangements were made for these delegates), while other expenses including accommodation, internal travel and translation services were entirely reasonable and consistent with the schedule.1097\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 284-285 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 332.\n\n896.\n\nReferring to Mr. Flores' testimony, Claimant argues that there was no intent to give the GOB officials some kind of holiday on the stopovers.1098 In fact, Claimant argues that the officials took advantage of Claimant's good intentions, requesting additional stopovers in different locations and avoiding to obtain Claimant's approval by booking through Mr. Farooq's son's travel agency.1099 Claimant maintains that Mr. Hargreaves was unaware of these specific travel arrangements and did not find out that the GOB officials had used Mr. Farooq's son's travel agency until after the trip.1100 Claimant further argues that the stopover in London was not in itself unreasonable given the lengthy journey, lack of direct flights and health condition of the Chief Minister.1101 However, once in London, Claimant submits that the officials again took advantage of TCC's expectation of reasonable and incidental expenses, with Col. Khan concealing excessive leisure expenses as accommodation costs which did not alert TCC to what was happening.1102\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2639 lines 6\u201320.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155 *referring to* Flores I, \u00b6 43 *and* Hargreaves I, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155 *referring to* Hargreaves I, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 286 *referring to* Flores, \u00b6 42 *and* Hargreaves I, \u00b6 54.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156 *referring to* Khan II \u00b6 30 *and* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1033 line 6 to p. 1036 line 8.\n\n897.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's claims of cash payments allegedly made in Chile and London, Claimant dismisses Mr. Aziz's suggestion that Mr. Farooq received payments whilst on the Santiago trip, given Mr. Farooq's denial of such.1103 The payment to Col. Khan in London is further denied by Claimant on the basis that Col. Khan's testimony changed and unraveled at the hearing and Mr. Flores flatly denied making such a cash payment.1104\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 157 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 157-160; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 287 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 26 *and* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1121 lines 19\u201322 and lines 8\u201315.\n\n898.\n\nIn relation to SONAMI's role, Claimant argues that Pakistan relies on a mistranslation of an internal Antofagasta e-mail to contend that Mr. Flores tried to distance the SONAMI payment from TCC to conceal the cost of the trip. In fact, Claimant argues that the document itself as well as Mr. Flores' and Mr. Hargreaves' testimonies reveal that TCC processed the expenses in an entirely \"*transparent way*\" and that SONAMI's motive behind sponsoring the trip was in no way sinister, but in fact an attempt to advance bilateral relations between Chile and Pakistan.1105\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 275-276; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 163-164 *referring to* Supplemental Reply, \u00b6 19(b) (*quoting* **Ex.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n901.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of Respondent's allegations concerning the trips made by certain federal and provincial Government officials at the expense of Claimant or its respective parent companies to Chile in December 2006 and to Toronto and Nevada in March 2007, the Tribunal notes that these allegations do not relate directly to a specific right or benefit that Claimant obtained in respect of its investment. As will be discussed further below, it is disputed between the Parties whether there is a causal link between these trips and specific steps in the chronology of Claimant's investment, in particular the Mineral Agreement negotiations. In any event, however, it is Respondent's position that regardless of any such link, the events surrounding particularly the Chile trip are relevant in the present case. Taking into account the emphasis placed by Respondent on these events, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence adduced by the Parties in relation to the two trips attended by Government officials.\n\n**(a) The December 2006 Chile Trip**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Alleged Lack of a Legitimate Purpose of the Chile Trip**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n902.\n\nRespondent claims that \"*TCC engaged in two excessive overseas trips with a view to influencing the discretion of government officials TCC needed to support the proposed Mineral Agreement.*\"1110 According to Respondent, particularly the Chile trip served no legitimate purpose.1111 In support of its submission, Respondent relies primarily on the witness evidence of Col. Khan and Mr. Farooq.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 176.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 178 *et seq*.\n\n903.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Col. Khan testified that in his presence, Antofagasta's chairman, Mr. Luksic, \"*complained that people in Pakistan didn't know anything about mining and needed to understand who TCC (and Barrick and Antofagasta) were and what a mining operation looked like,*\" and further stated that both Mr. Luksic and Mr. Flores \"*were of the view that government officials from GoB and GoP had to be* 'won over'.\" Col. Khan then described the visit in Chile as follows:\n\n\"*The delegation was put up at one of the best hotels in Santiago \u2013 the Royal Hyatt. Whilst a few mine visits were organized, the trip was essentially one big party and there were non-stop lunches, dinners, massage services and parties, with all bills paid by Antofagasta / TCC. Mr Flores had told me that the* 'sky is the limit' *in terms of spending on the delegation and that I should not hold back to ensure that all the delegates' needs were taken care of.*\"1112\n\nKhan I, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24.\n\n904.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Col. Khan added that \"*whilst there were optional mine visits etc. to give the trip some credibility, the real purpose of the trip was entertain and win favour with officials. No one on the trip (and least of all the Chief Minister) was interested in mining.*\"1113\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 27.\n\n905.\n\nMr. Farooq, who was one of the GOB delegates on the Chile trip, confirmed Col. Khan's testimony in his first witness statement, testifying that \"*Antofagasta treated the delegates to lavish entertainment, including a stay in a five star hotel and every other indulgence such as expensive dinners and trips to night clubs, along with massages etc*\" and that \"*the purpose of the trip was to win favour with government officials, particularly as TCC wanted to procure the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease*.\"1114 In his second witness statement, he expanded on this statement:\n\n\"*The purpose of the trip from TCC's point of view as I understood it was to get near to the key people involved in the project, as they wanted favours from us and they wanted the Mineral Agreement to be finalised. The purpose of the trip from at least the GOB's perspective was mostly as an excuse to go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the CM Jam Yousaf being particularly intent on going to Rio*. \u2026 *Those from the GOB that attended the Santiago part of the trip were not interested in the educational aspects of the trip (most of those that attended had nothing directly to do with mining), so excuses were made so that people did not need to attend the whole programme and we enjoyed our leisure time*.\"1115\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 55.\n\n906.\n\nClaimant, on the other hand contends that both trips \"*served to educate Provincial and Federal officials about the requirements for and benefit of large-scale mining projects, and to develop ties between the officials and their foreign counterparts*.\"1116\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139.\n\n907.\n\nIn a contemporaneous e-mail sent by Mr. Flores, who was Claimant's CEO at the time, to various Antofasta employees shortly before the Chile trip on 7 December 2006, he described the planned visit as follows:\n\n\"*The main objective of this visit is to familiarize the Government of Pakistan with how Chile has developed its mining industry and how its major actors (government, investors, unions, suppliers, and contractors, etc.) properly coordinate with one another to create one of the most productive industries in the country. We will visit the deposits in Los Pelambres and Chuquicamata; we will meet with the authorities of the Second Region, the Ministry of Mining and Foreign Relations, and also with the authorities of Sonami, the Mining Board, and Aprimin.*\n\n*We hope that by the end of the visit, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) and the Government of Balochistan (GoB) will have a better understanding of the challenges that Pakistan will face in developing its mining industry in the future*.\"1117\n\n**Exhibit CE-814**, p. 3.\n\n908.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Mr. Flores further explained that the trip was meant to address what he considered to be a \"*knowledge gap*\" on the part of the GOP and GOB officials as a result of which \"*they did not appreciate what an operation like that would entail with respect to infrastructure and technological requirements, manpower, contractors, resource contributions, regulatory challenges, tax implications, or social benefits.*\"1118 Mr. Flores therefore considered that the trip had three distinct purposes: (i) \"*to demonstrate to the Government officials firsthand how a major industrial mining operation was run in an area that was geographically very similar to Chagai*\"; (ii) *\"to explain Antofagasta's experience and success in developing analogous mining operations*\" that could serve \"*as a model for what the Reko Diq project could achieve*\"; and (iii) \"*to foster relationships between Pakistani officials and their Chilean counterparts, as well as with other mining companies in Chile, all of whom could provide valuable insights on how to develop and encourage a mining industry*.\" Mr. Flores added: \"*Achieving all three goals was very important for the future of TCC, as it would be difficult to negotiate the Mineral Agreement and Shareholders Agreements with the Governments if they did not understand the requirements and benefits of a project like Reko Diq*.\"1119\n\nFlores I, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 37.\n\n909.\n\nSpecifically, in response to Col. Khan's testimony that \"*the real purpose of the trip was to entertain and win favour with officials*,\" Mr. Flores stated that \"[t]*his allegation is completely false. As the program for the trip reflects, every day the agenda featured meetings and activities from morning until evening designed to give the federal and provincial officials exposure to large-scale, industrial mining and the relevant business and regulatory considerations*.\"1120 He further denied having said to Col. Khan that \"'the sky is the limit' *in terms of spending on the delegation*\" and testified that, instead, Col. Khan \"*was only authorized to cover reasonable, incidental expenses incurred by the delegates*.\"1121\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 22. *See also* Flores I, \u00b6 52.\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 53.\n\n910.\n\nSimilarly, in response to Mr. Farooq's testimony that the Chile trip was arranged because they wanted \"*the Mineral Agreement to be finalised,*\" Mr. Flores testified that this allegation was \"*fabricated*\" and disproven by the timing of Mineral Agreement negotiations, which had not yet begun at the time the Chile trip took place.1122 He also stated:\n\n\"*If these allegations are meant to suggest that the Chile trip was an effort to improperly influence government officials to act in favor of TCC, they are false. We certainly believed that seeing these mines in operation, and speaking with representatives from the Chilean Government, industry groups, and other mining companies would allow the Pakistani officials to better evaluate the challenges and benefits of such a project, and therefore place them in a better position to negotiate these agreements. But it is a complete mischaracterization to claim that we conducted the trip in exchange for the approval of these agreements*.\"1123\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 25.\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 49.\n\n911.\n\nMr. Hargreaves confirmed Mr. Flores' testimony in his first witness statement, testifying that \"[t]*he objective of the trip \u2026 was educational: to provide opportunities for Pakistani and Balochistan government officials to learn more about large-scale mining ventures by touring successful mines and associated infrastructure, and meeting with Chilean mining officials and industry groups.*\" He further explained that \"[s]*uch educational trips are common practice in the mining industry before beginning operations in a country where the local officials are unfamiliar with large-scale mining operations*.\"1124\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 48.\n\n912.\n\nIn response to Mr. Farooq's testimony that Claimant's real objective was to get \"*favours from* [officials] *and* [TCC] *wanted the Mineral Agreement to be finalized*,\" Mr. Hargreaves considered that \"*there is no basis to Mr. Farooq's implication that by the trip TCC hoped to obtain the Mineral Agreement illicitly*.\"1125 He added:\n\n\"*There is of course nothing nefarious about TCC hoping ultimately to negotiate a suitable Mineral Agreement, or thinking that we could be more successful in that process if our key national staff were able to act as ambassadors of TCC to help explain the Mineral Agreement concept to the stakeholders and that they together with our counterparties had some basic idea of what we were seeking and why we were seeking it. We firmly believed that the more the GOP and GOB representatives understood about large scale mining operations and the issues associated with them, the more fair and effective our negotiations would be for all parties. It is much harder to negotiate with someone who has no idea what you are talking about than with someone who at least understands the proposals and why you are making them*.\"1126\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 38.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 40.\n\n913.\n\nMr. Hargreaves emphasized his view that \"[w]*hile Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan portray the trip essentially as* 'an excuse' *for GOB officials* 'to go to Rio de Janeiro' *or* 'to entertain and win favour with officials' *because of the GOB's lack of engagement in the program, this was never the aim of the trip*.\"1127\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 43.\n\n914.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is considerable discrepancy between the Parties' positions as to what was the purpose of the Chile trip. As the relevant question for the Tribunal to assess is whether Claimant did, or at least intended to, illicitly influence the Government officials attending the trip, the Tribunal first considers it necessary to distinguish the trip as it was envisaged and planned by Claimant and its parent companies from the trip as it was viewed and carried out by the GOB officials.\n\n915.\n\nIn this regard, it is undisputed that Claimant and its parent companies invited eleven Government officials, five from the GOP and six from the GOB, for a visit to Chile in December 2006.1128 A formal invitation letter was issued by the Chilean Minister for Energy and Mines.1129 These officials included: (i) the Federal Minister for Petroleum & Natural Resources, H.E. Ammanullah Khan Jadoon; (ii) the Joint Secretary at the MPNR, Jehangir Khan; (iii) the Deputy Director (G&M) at the MPNR, Kurram Bhatti; (iv) the Personal Secretary to the Federal Minister, Syed Tauqir Hussain; (v) the Special Advisor the the Federal Minister, Mohammad Zubair Khan;1130 (vi) the Chief Minister of Balochistan, H.E. Jam Muhammad Yousaf Khan; (vii) the Provincial Minister of Balochistan, Abdur Rehman Jamali; (viii) the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, Farid Uddin Ahmedzai; (ix) the Chairman of the BDA, Muhammad Farooq; (x) the Secretary to the Chief Minister, Tahir Nadeem; and (xi) the Director General of the MMDD, Maqbool Ahmed.1131\n\nAs to the selection of this delegation, *see* Flores I, \u00b6 40.\n\n**Exhibit CE-455**.\n\nIt remains unclear to the Tribunal whether the Special Advisor to the Federal Minister actually attended the trip given that he is not included in the itinerary circulated by an employee of Antofagasta as part of the GOP delegation, which was to arrive in Chile on the following day. **Exhibit CE-458**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-458**; Flores I, \u00b6 40.\n\n916.\n\nThe visit was scheduled to last for five days and, according to the itinerary, it included acitivities such as a tour of the Los Pelambres mine in the Andes mountains, a visit to the Chilean State owned (Coldelco) North Division Mining Operations, meetings with the Chilean Mining Association (SONAMI), Chilean Government officials, the Chilean Mining Council and representatives from Claimant's parent companies.1132\n\n**Exhibit CE-458**.\n\n917.\n\nRespondent recognizes that \"[t]*he formal itinerary prepared by Antofagastas does indeed reflect these* [mining-related] *activities*.\"1133 It emphasizes, however, that while the visit was scheduled for five days, the delegation from the GOB arrived late and was able to participate only in the events scheduled for days four and five of the trip. In addition, Respondent refers to Mr. Flores' testimony that the visit of the Los Pelambres mine, which was re-scheduled for the GOB delegates to day five, \"*was not well attended by the GoB delegates*.\"1134\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 178. *See also* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 330.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179, *quoting from* Flores II, \u00b6 23.\n\n918.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not raised any allegation that the delegates from the Federal Government, who attended all five days of the visit, did not participate in the scheduled events \u2013 except for the visit to the Los Pelambres mine, which is located at a high altitude in the Andes mountains and caused altitude sickness for several delegates.1135 Mr. Flores described the tours and meetings in his first witness statement and also noted that the visit received favorable press coverage in both the Chilean and Pakistani media.1136 Mr. Hargreaves testified in his second witness statement with regard to the GOP officials:\n\n\"*Based on what I saw during the trip, which included meetings with Chilean Ministers, Chilean trade and industry representatives, and executives from major Chilean mining companies, the GOP delegates and their Chilean counterparts made the most of these opportunities. Indeed, I supplied the GOP officials with information that was intended for a report on the trip to the Federal Parliament, and I believe that the officials actually submitted such a report that described the trip's legitimate objectives and benefits. I note that I have seen no allegations of impropriety by the GOP delegates who also attended the Chile trip and whose enthusiasm and interest in all aspects of the mining business, and engagement with their Chilean counterparts made me personally proud*.\"1137\n\n*Cf*. Flores I, \u00b6 44.\n\nFlores I, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48. *See also* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 272-273, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-519**, **CE-520** *and* **CE-524**.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 43.\n\n919.\n\nSecond, as to the GOB officials, it is undisputed that they arrived three days late in Chile and therefore participated only in the events scheduled for the fourth and fifth day of the visit.1138 Mr. Hargreaves testified in his second witness statement that \"*the GOB officials did not embrace this opportunity in the same way*\" and added that \"*despite* [Claimant's] *best efforts, the GOB engineered the circumstances to make their own travel arrangements at the last minute*\" and therefore \"*missed parts of the educational program that had been arranged for them*,\" which he considered \"*frustrating and disappointing*.\"1139 During the hearing, Mr. Hargreaves then explained:\n\n\"*The problem that the Balochistan delegation had was that President Musharraf had made an unplanned trip to Quetta shortly before the delegation was due to leave to open the kidney center and a women's conference.*\n\n*Now, although we had set the dates and got agreement between the Government of Pakistan and Balochistan, we didn't have control on the President's agenda. So, when he decided he wanted to go to Quetta, the ability of the Balochistan delegation to travel was cut back, and this was the frustration which I think I've communicated in my Witness Statement. And I think I might have been a little unkind on Farooq, because at the time, I thought that he was the one who was jerking us around, but I later realized that it was the President, and that's why the delegation came late*.\"1140\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-458**.\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 44.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2374 line 20 to p. 2375 line 14.\n\n920.\n\nMr. Hargreaves further testified that, while the delay of the GOB delegation was discussed at the time, \"*it just wasn't registered on any of us that this was the reason why they were delayed*.\" He then clarified:\n\n\"*At the time we knew of the visit. So, the significance of it impacting the schedule, we were so busy trying to deal with other things, and the Balochis weren't showing up. We ran with the Federal Government delegation. We did all the activities. We were frustrated that they didn't arrive. It all--it was a chaotic time. We didn't sit down and say, you know,* 'What's happening here?' *We just went with what we had*.\"1141\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2366 line 18 to p. 2379 line 4.\n\n921.\n\nMr. Flores confirmed during the hearing that they had learned of the visit of the President to Balochistan \"*a couple of days before launching the entire visit*\" and, after analyzing the situation, came to the conclusion that it would still be worth going forward with the trip despite the fact that the GOB delegation would have only two days, \"*at least for visiting a mine and \u2026 one of the most important meetings with the Mine Minister in Chile, attending with both delegations*.\"1142\n\nTanscript (Day 10), p. 2510 lines 8-22.\n\n922.\n\nAs for the events scheduled for after the GOB delegation arrived, Mr. Flores testified in his second witness statement that these \"*were generally well attended by both the federal and provincial delegates,*\" except for the re-scheduled visit to the Los Pelambres mine, which was \"*not well-attended by the GOB delegates*,\" which in his recollection was \"*due to health concerns and* [was] *in no way connected to an ulterior motive such as entertainment*.\"1143 During the hearing, Mr. Flores confirmed that the delegates who were absent from the visit, which made up almost half of the time they spent in Chile, would have \"*presumably spent their time in Santiago instead.*\"1144 He added:\n\n\"*One issue we did not plan very well was the specific safety requirements for visiting a mine at that altitude. I think the Delegation of Balochistan was not properly fit for that trip. And one of the reasons for also canceling that, once they were in Chile, it was about that safety revelation from our company.*\n\n*That was not part of the plan. We should have planned that in more details*.\"1145\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 23.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2512 lines 1-9.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2512 lines 10-19.\n\n923.\n\nWhen asked why they decided to go ahead with the trip even though the GOB officials could attend only the last two days, Mr. Flores explained that the \"*main two reasons*\" were that they were trying to adapt the agenda to accommodate the late arrival and that they did not have any alternative to conduct the visit. He added:\n\n\"*We in the company decided to go ahead mainly because--one of the main reasons was bringing together the Government of Pakistan and Government of the Balochistan together in front of the Chilean authorities. That was a very good opportunity we did not want to miss*.\"1146\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2630 line 19 to p. 2631 line 12.\n\n924.\n\nIn response to the question why they intended to bring these Government officials together, Mr. Flores explained:\n\n\"*The main concept was trying to get the full picture from the Chile authority regarding the mining business development, and this is a coordinated effort between regional and Federal Government authorities. It was a very good opportunity for them to really discuss together with the Chilean Minister at this time, and it proved to be a very, very, very good meeting. It took longer, I remember, and they were very pleased in terms of the questions and discussion together*.\"1147\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2632 lines 8-21.\n\n925.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal notes that, while the visit of the GOB officials undisputedly did not include as many mining-related activities as originally planned, this was due to reasons beyond Claimant's control, *i.e.,* a visit of the President of Pakistan to Balochistan, which required the presence of the GOB officials. It appears to the Tribunal that when Claimant's representatives found out about this scheduling conflict shortly before the trip was about to start, they attempted to make the best of this situation by re-scheduling a visit to the Los Pelambres mine and the meetings with Chilean authorities that they considered most essential to achieve the stated purpose of the visit. As for the fact that several GOB delegates could not attend the mine visit due to health reasons, Mr. Flores freely admitted that this should have been planned in more detail before the trip. In the Tribunal's view, this does not, however, establish that the real purpose of the trip was to entertain and \"*win the favor*\" of the GOB officials.\n\n926.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Respondent argues, *inter alia*, that in light of the short stay of the GOB officials, the known cost of the trip of USD 245,000 or USD 20,500 per delegate,1148 was disproportionate *vis-\u00e0-vis* the educational element of the visit.1149 In response to that suggestion, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed during the hearing that in hindsight \"*would I want it to have been done better? Yes, I would*.\"1150 Claimant argues that the costs presented by Respondent are \"*significantly overstated*\" because they also include expenses of participants other than the GOP and GOB officials, in particular expenditures for personnel of Claimant and its parent companies, and thus do not allow for a per-delegate allocation. According to Claimant, the aggregate per delegate expense is less than USD 18,000, about half of which is allocated to the costs of the international flights.1151\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Supplemental Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 181; Respondent's Supplemental Rejoinder, \u00b6 13.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2381 line 15 to p. 2382 line 2.\n\nRespondent's Supplemental Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14 and Annex 1.\n\n927.\n\nEven if the corrections to the total costs for the trip presented by Claimant were deemed accurate, the Tribunal would agree with Respondent that the expenses for a visit of the GOB officials, which Mr. Flores described as \"*one of day of effectiveness*,\"1152 might be considered disproportionate if the trip had been planned for this short time period from the outset. However, the fact remains that Claimant's representatives were notified of this change only a few days before the trip and were faced with the option to cancel the entire trip, including for the GOP officials who undisputedly attended all five days of the trip, or to go ahead with it despite the shortened stay of the GOB officials. As explained by Mr. Flores:\n\n\"*The one-day educational visit turned to be the end of a process, a very dynamic process in which, first, Government of Balochistan were willing to attend half of the visit, and then we were facing health problem with the people in order to attend what we considered an important part of the visit, and that's where we continued with the concept of bringing them into Chile. The visit to the mine was something very, very important, but we faced that situation just in Chile, not before*.\"1153\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2518 lines 6-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2517 line 18 to p. 2518 line 5.\n\n928.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to assess the proportionality of the travel and accommodation expenses incurred for the GOB delegation based on the actual length of their stay in Chile. In any event, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's argument that the trip lacked any educational, and thus legitimate, purpose.\n\n**(ii) The Stopovers Made on the Way Back from Chile**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n929.\n\nIn addition to the events in Chile, Respondent claims that certain stopovers made by the delegates on their way back from Chile to Pakistan were improper. Specifically, Respondent refers to: (i) a stopover of three days in Rio de Janeiro for five delegates; (ii) a stopover of three to four days in London for nine delegates; a stopover in New York for two delegates; and (iv) a stopover in Nice for Mr. Farooq. Respondent argues that these stopovers were unnecessary as they served no educational purpose and notes that the expenses for the stopover in London alone amounted to almost USD 50,000.1154\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 192; Respondent's Supplemental Reply, \u00b6 103.\n\n930.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Mr. Farooq stated that \"[a]*stopover was arranged in London on our return, where we also enjoyed lavish entertainment*. *The cost of the London trip was picked up by Col Sher Khan on behalf of TCC*.\"1155 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq added that the delegates \"*went sightseeing in limousines along with other entertainment (including massages and lunches/dinners)*.\"1156\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 21.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 55.\n\n931.\n\nCol. Khan described the stopover that he \"*hosted*\" in London as follows:\n\n\"*We stayed for 2 nights at the Hilton, Park Lane, which I had arranged. I had an American Express TCC Corporate Credit Card to use in London for the delegation. This card had no fund limit and I was the only Pakistani employee who was given such a credit card. Every delegate wanted their own limousine to take them around London and, in one delegate's case, the limousine bill for just one day was over thousand pounds as he travelled outside London. Delegates also shopped a lot and, as a result, I had to pay around five hundred pounds as excess baggage for the delegates at the airport when we left*.\"1157\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 25.\n\n932.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Col. Khan specified that he spent: (i) AUD 1,323.60 on \"*excess baggage fees for members of the delegation*\"; (ii) GBP 1,421.29 at the Hilton Park Lane on \"*limousines and massages enjoyed by the delegates*\"; and (iii) a further GBP 9,252.81 at the Hilton Park Lane on \"*leisure expenses of the GoB / GoP guests during their stay*.\"1158 Col. Khan further stated that he \"*was encouraged to spend as much as necessary to ensure that the delegates had a good time*\" and added that the expenses recorded on his credit card were \"*approved immediately and without any questions by Chris Arndt*.\"1159 In addition, Col. Khan testified that he was given USD 5,000 in cash by Mr. Flores in Santiago \"*to cover incidental entertainment expenses in London*\" and \"*to show the GoB delegates the* 'high life' *in London*,\" which according to Col. Khan was spent on prostitutes and massages.1160\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 31.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 32.\n\n933.\n\nMr. Hargreaves testified in his first witness statement with regard to the stopovers:\n\n\"*During the planning of the trip, the Balochistan delegation asked us to schedule a stopover in London on the return trip. We considered that to be acceptable, so long as it did not interfere with the educational purpose of the trip or add materially to the cost. We were also aware that Jam Muhammad Yousaf had health issues. Once we expressed some willingness to agree to stop-overs, the delegations multiplied their requests, asking for stops in Rio de Janiero and New York instead of or in addition to the stop in London. Despite being pressed by the delegations for these additional requests, we insisted on limiting expenses and we imposed cost control by using TCC's usual travel agency to book rooms directly with the London hotel and to issue vouchers to the delegates*.\"1161\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6 54.\n\n934.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Hargreaves clarified that \"[t]*here was an approved stopover in London and a requested stopover at the Balochistan delegates' expense in Rio on their way back*\" but acknowledged that the delegates' flights to Rio, as well as to London, New York and Nice were ultimately paid for by Antofagasta.1162 He added that Claimant \"*reluctantly agreed to accommodate London*\" but when an additional request for Rio was raised, the delegates were told: \"[O]*n your expense, on your time*.\"1163\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2372 lines 4-10.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2380 lines 14-16.\n\n935.\n\nAs for the London stopover, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that Claimant paid for the delegates' hotels and expenses but stated that he did not have any personal knowledge of any entertainment they allegedly enjoyed during their stay.1164 He did not confirm that an extra USD 50,000 was spent on the London stopover but considered that, if this amount were correct, it was \"*rather high*.\"1165 Mr. Hargreaves further testified that to his knowledge, and having checked with the travel agent at the time, the London stopover did not cost \"*significant extra costs in the flights*,\" which \"*was the basis on which we said, okay, a stopover is going to be permissible*.\"1166 Finally, he testified that at the time he wrote an e-mail to Mr. Arndt and Col. Khan on 25 November 2006 stating that they could support the London stopover, he \"*thought it was a two-day stopover*\" but \"*wasn't contemplating five days.*\"1167 In that e-mail, Mr. Hargreaves had written in relevant part:\n\n\"*After discussing with Eduardo* [Flores], *we can support the London stopover for the delegation on the way back from Santiago on the basis that this is a long trip and such stopovers are customary with Pakistani delegations. \u2026*\n\n*In terms of payment, it would be useful if the travel agent can arrange hotel packages with vouchers through the airlines and issue and* [sic] *invoice for bed and breakfast to be paid from Santiago. Whilst in London, Sher Khan can pay for meals not included on the voucher via his credit card (even though these would be Tethyan costs, they are customary and reasonable and I believe acceptable from a corporate ethics point of view).*\n\n*In terms of the Balochistan delegation, I think that we can also offer this facility even though I note they will stay 3 nights in London as this will offset our inability to cover their Rio trip and I note that not all of the delegation is stopping over in London*.\"1168\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2372 line 11 to p. 2373 line 7.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2379 line 15-19.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2378 line 22 to p. 2379 line 7.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2392 line 9 to p. 2393 line 6.\n\n**Exhibit RE-289**.\n\n936.\n\nMr. Flores, who was copied in on that e-mail, responded on the next day that he \"*concur* [red] *with Tim's recommendation*.\"1169\n\n**Exhibit RE-289**.\n\n937.\n\nWhen pointed to the fact that the e-mail mentioned a stay of three nights, Mr. Hargreaves answered: \"*Okay. Three nights. I thought it was two*.\"1170 He further explained: \"*I think that there was disappointment in our reluctance to sponsor a trip to Rio. The request was made, and we said no. So, to soften the* 'no,' *I agreed to the three days in London*.\"1171 In response to a question regarding the overall flight costs, Mr. Hargreaves testified that he \"*was an advisor, not the person doing the detail on this trip*.\"1172 Similarly, he answered that he did not know whether all four stopovers had been part of the itinerary from the outset because he \"*wasn't following it to that level of detail.*\"1173\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2393 lines 18-22.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2397 lines 9-12.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2397 line 20 to p. 2398 line 2.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2400 lines 1-5.\n\n938.\n\nMr. Flores recalled the planning of the stopovers in his first witness statement as follows:\n\n\"*There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Santiago, and there are many potential connection and layover options. Several of the Balochistan officials requested stopovers in London and Rio. Mr. Khan and Mr. Rizvi also made similar requests, and explained that many Pakistanis viewed stopovers as customary when traveling long distances internationally. Finally, I recall that Col. Khan informed me that Chief Minister Yousaf specifically cited his poor health as the reason he needed a stopover. Our view was that a stopover was permissible, provided that it did not interfere with the objectives of the trip or increase the cost significantly.*\n\n*As planning progressed, the requests of the provincial officials became increasingly demanding, with some asking for multiple stopovers in different locations*.\"1174\n\nFlores I, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n939.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Flores explained that he had personally travelled from Chile to Pakistan more than 20 times and considered \"*stopovers to be something acceptable because of the length of the trip. The minimum hours, it's about 30 in a combined group of planes*.\" However, Mr. Flores also explained that his understanding of a stopover was to stay \"*overnight and taking the plane the next morning*.\"1175\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2522 lines 11-20.\n\n940.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Flores denied Col. Khan's testimony that he had been given a corporate credit card with no fund limit and and stated that \"[a]*ll corporate credit cards held by TCC employees had a credit limit, and were to be used only for business-related expenses.*\" He added that \"[i]*n the context of this trip, that would include paying for reasonable, incidental expenses in the hotel in which they were staying*\" but denied that Col. Khan was authorized to cover the costs for limousine services or excess baggage. Mr. Flores further stated that he would not have seen Col. Khan's credit card statements at the time and therefore did not know whether he actually made such payments. He testified that \"*Col. Khan was a trusted employee who was well aware of our company policies, so I had no reason to think that he would not have followed those policies when accompanying the Government delegation*.\"1176 Mr. Flores added that Claimant's company policy at the time required at least two signatures to authorize payments on behalf of the company and recalled that \"*Mr. Andt and a pre-designated staff member would have been authorized to approve the reimbursement amount Col. Khan requested, without requiring any involvement from* [Mr. Flores].\"1177\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 54.\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 27.\n\n941.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Flores testified that he had not been aware of all the stopovers and of the \"*substantial expenses*\" reimbursed to Col. Khan before he prepared his witness statement in this arbitration. He recalled that what had been discussed was a stopover in London on the way to Chile and a stopover in Rio on the way back but acknowledged that ultimately all stopovers were made on they way back to Pakistan and that the stopover in Rio was an addition. Mr. Flores explained that he had approved two locations \"*with the concept that it was either an overnight or day before taking the next plane to home or traveling to Chile*.\" In response to the question who approved a stopover of three to four nights in London, Mr. Flores stated that \"[e]*ither Tim* [Hargreaves] *or Chris* [Arndt] *was in charge of the full process*.\"1178\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2518 line 21 to p. 2520 line 17; p. 2527 lines 1-19; p. 2568 line 9 to p. 2569 line 1.\n\n942.\n\nWhen asked whether the London stopover significantly increased the cost, Mr. Flores responded: \"*I hundred percent agree. This is what I realized after looking details in preparing my Statement. But it wasn't the discussion and the conversation when I approved this and the concept I approved with Tim*.\" He added that he never discussed with Mr. Hargreaves \"*the specific details, timing, how long it's going to take, how much cost is going to be increased*.\"1179 Mr. Flores further stated that he while he was not involved in the approval of the expenses of Col. Khan's expenses for the London stopover, he considered that it \"*was not appropriate to approve this*.\"1180\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2520 line 22 to p. 2521 line 15.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2528 line 15 to p. 2530 line 9.\n\n943.\n\nBoth in his written and his oral testimony, Mr. Flores denied that he gave USD 5,000 in cash to Col. Khan to spend on the stopover in London. He added that he could not remember any occasion on which he gave any amount of cash to Col. Khan and saw no reason to do so given that Col. Khan had a corporate credit card. During the hearing, he added that he had \"*no authority in order to get that cash without being approved by someone else in the company*,\" noting that \"*it's not easy for any senior person in the company to get cash in that amount in Chile.*\" Mr. Flores further strongly rejected having had any conversation with Col. Khan about showing delegates the \"*high life*\" in London or about entertainment with prostitutes, which he considered deeply offensive.1181\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 26; Transcript (Day 10), p. 2530 line 16 to p. 2531 line 10.\n\n944.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties, and Mr. Hargreaves explicitly confirmed during the hearing, that the stopovers made by the delegates on their way back from Chile to Pakistan did not serve any educational purpose.1182 Mr. Flores further confirmed that stopovers of three to four days in Rio and London were \"[a]*bsolutely not*\" something for which there was no alternative.1183 Mr. Flores also freely admitted that \"*the learning of the specific amounts being incurred by the company being authorized by our people contravened completely this policy*,\" *i.e*., Barrick Gold and Antofagasta's anti-corruption policies concerning entertainment.1184 By contrast to Mr. Hargreaves, who testified about his belief that the relevant anti-corruption policies of Claimant and its parent companies had been complied with,1185 Mr. Flores explicitly acknowledged several breaches of these policies in the context of the stopovers. When asked why no action was taken as a result of those breaches, Mr. Flores testified:\n\n\"*I was aware of the figures and details of that stopovers or entertainment only this year. That was never discussed at the time I was the CEO of the company, never brought to my attention. I consider that, of course, is a breach in the internal guidelines of the company. Me being the most senior person, should have been aware of this*.\"1186\n\n*Cf*. Transcript (Day 9), p. 2378 lines 15-18.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2522 line 21 to p. 2523 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 10, p. 2533 lines 6-9 *being shown* **Demonstrative RD-8**.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2394 lines 8-13.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2533 line 10 to p. 2535 line 5.\n\n945.\n\nMr. Hargreaves did not consider the \"*stopover on the way back from a very long trip*\" to be in breach of FCPA regulations.1187 In response to questions raised by the Tribunal, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that he and Mr. Flores had obtained legal advice on whether the stopover in London would be in breach of Pakistani laws and stated that they also asked \"*lawyers from Barrick*\" whether it was in breach of the FCPA and that \"*they gave the view it was acceptable*.\" He also confirmed that they did not obtain legal advice as regards the stopovers in Rio, New York or Nice.1188\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2381 lines 1-5.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2386 line 1 to p. 2388 line 3.\n\n946.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is rather apparent, and Mr. Flores admitted without hesitation, that the stopovers, in particular the three-day stopover in London with expenses paid by Claimant, were not in compliance with the anti-corruption policies of Claimant or its parent companies. First, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that a stopover on a trip that involved thirty hours of flying cannot *per se* be deemed improper. The Tribunal also considers that the stopover for a delegation of elderly gentlemen who are not used to long-distance travelling and some of whom were suffering from certain health issues may have to be somewhat longer than that for a frequently travelling person such as Mr. Flores.\n\n947.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also agrees with Respondent that a stopover of three nights in London, which apparently caused additional costs of at least USD 50,000, may well go beyond what can be considered in compliance with anti-corruption policies. As to the additional stopover in Rio for some of the delegates as well as for the shorter stopovers in New York and Nice, the Tribunal understands that the delegates had to pay for their hotels and expenses themselves but Antofagasta still paid for all of the flights. The Tribunal further understands that the two delegates that went to New York did not have an additional stopover on their way back to Pakistan. By contrast, the stopovers in Rio and Nice occurred in addition to the stopover in London, and thus cannot be deemed jusitified by the above-mentioned considerations.\n\n948.\n\nAt the same time, it strongly appears from the record that the request for stopovers came from the GOB officials, who also decided to make their own travel arrangements via a travel agency owned by Mr. Farooq's son. It is disputed between the Parties whether the flight itinerary, including the involvement of Mr. Farooq's son in booking the flights, was known to Claimant's representatives prior to the trip. Mr. Farooq testified in second witness statement that \"*TCC knew as* [he] *requested permission to do this before going on the trip*.\"1189\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 57.\n\n949.\n\nMr. Iqbal testified in this regard:\n\n\"*Mr Arndt and I knew that Mr Farooq's son was running a travel agency in Karachi named Elektra Travel International. Mr. Farooq would often suggest that we use his son's agency. Mr Arndt allowed Mr Farooq to arrange the travel tickets to Chile for the GoB officials. I would therefore be very surprised if Mr Arndt did not know about the arrangements*.\"1190\n\nIqbal, \u00b6 35.\n\n950.\n\nMr. Hargreaves testified in his first witness statement that they \"*tried to make the flight arrangements for the GOB delegation, but the GOB delegation did not provide TCC's travel agency with information it needed. At the last minute, they told us they would make their own arrangements. They did not provide TCC or Antofagasta any details of those arrangements until after the trip*\" when they submitted their invoices for reimbursement in early 2007. Mr. Hargreaves further testified that he found out only after the trip that the travel agency used by the GOB was owned by Mr. Farooq's son. He added:\n\n\"*Our review of the invoices suggested that Mr. Farooq and his son had taken advantage of Antofagasta by over-charging for the tickets. I was irritated that they had taken advantage of us, but it would have almost certainly been unsuccessful to dispute those charges at that point since the trip had already occurred*.\"1191\n\nHargreaves I, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.\n\n951.\n\nAccording to a \"*Summary of invoices received from Elektra Travel International for GOB visit to Chile*\" dating from February 2007, which compared the costs charged by this travel agency with those charged by Claimant's own travel agency, Bonds Travel Bureau, for the same flights, the difference amounted to USD 10,101.88.1192\n\n**Exhibit RE-297**.\n\n952.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Hargreaves specifically denied Mr. Farooq's testimony that the latter had requested permission in advance for this arrangement and added that this made no sense \"*given* [his] *reaction to finding out about this several months after the trip concluded*.\" Mr. Hargreaves testified that he \"*recall*[ed] *being irritated and expressing that* [they] *had been* 'gouged' *by Mr. Farooq's son*.\"1193 During the hearing, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that despite his testimony that they had \"*been taken advantage of*,\" he did not raise any concern or complaint with those responsible for doing so at the time.1194\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 45.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2407 lines 12-17.\n\n953.\n\nMr. Flores confirmed Mr. Hargreaves' testimony that Claimant had not known that the GOB officials had used a travel agency owned by Mr. Farooq's son until their requests were submitted to Claimant for expense reimbursements.1195 During the hearing, he clarified that he personally became aware of this fact only when preparing his witness statement in this arbitration. In response to the question whether, if he had known about this at the time, this would have caused him concern about the propriety of the trip, he stated: \"*Absolutely. I consider that a very bad decision from us*.\"1196\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 43.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2563 line 18 to p. 2564 line 10.\n\n954.\n\nBased on the evidence set out above, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Claimant's representatives knew about the precise travel itinerary, including the specific number and length of stopovers for each delegate, in advance of the trip. Similarly, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's argument that Claimant's representatives were aware prior to the trip that the GOB officials would use a travel agency owned by Mr. Farooq's son and, more importantly, that this agency would significantly overcharge for the flight costs. Mr. Farooq only vaguely stated that he requested permission to use this agency, without specifying from whom such permission was sought and whether it included charging a markup to the flight costs as a disguised benefit to Mr. Farooq. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that a detailed comparison between the costs charged by Elektra Travel and Claimant's travel agency was prepared in February 2007 rather indicates the contrary. In addition, neither Mr. Farooq nor Mr. Iqbal testified that Mr. Hargreaves or Mr. Flores knew about this arrangement. While Mr. Iqbal stated that Mr. Arndt let Mr. Farooq arrange for the flight tickets, he only presumed that he also knew of the arrangement with the travel agency of Mr. Farooq's son.\n\n955.\n\nAt the same time, it is undisputed that the full flight itinerary as well as the overcharge by the travel agency owned by Mr. Farooq's son became clear shortly after the trip when the GOB delegation filed requests for reimbursement of their expeneses. Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that he became aware that they had \"*taken advantage of Antofagasta*\" in early 2007. It is further undisputed that neither Mr. Hargreaves nor anyone else from Claimant's side raised any complaints *vis-\u00e0-vis* Mr. Farooq or any other of the GOB officials regarding either the flights and stopovers or the overcharge. Mr. Flores freely admitted that this was \"*a very bad decision.*\"\n\n956.\n\nAs will be discussed further below, the Tribunal considers that this alone cannot be sufficient to establish that Claimant intended to improperly influence the Government officials attending the trip and stopovers in view of the upcoming Mineral Agreement negotiations. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes into account Claimant's argument that \"[e]*ven if, in hindsight, it would have been more prudent if TCC had held firm and refused to accept Balochistan's demands, they do not detract from the essential educational purpose of the trip and are not indicative of any corrupt intent or quid pro quo arrangement*.\"1197\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155. *See also* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 213.\n\n**(iii) The Involvement of the Chilean Mining Association (SONAMI)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n957.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that Claimant and Antofagasta committed an \"*accounting fraud*\" together with the Chilean National Mining Association, SONAMI, because at least USD 150,000 of the costs of the Chile trip were invoiced to SONAMI but were actually funded by Antofagasta by means of donation payments that it made to SONAMI before the latter actually made the invoiced payments. According to Respondent, \"*there is simply no other explanation*\" for this arrangement than that the purpose was to conceal the expenditures from Antofagasta's books and to disassociate them from Claimant.1198 Respondent further claims that this arrangement provided \"*legal cover*\" to the officials from the GOP and GOB attending the trip because Pakistani law would not have permitted them to accept the invitation if it had been known that the trip was at the expense of Claimant or its parent companies.1199\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 182, 206; Respondent's Supplemental Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 184.\n\n958.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that the costs of the trip were paid by SONAMI using funds provided by Antofagasta but denies that this was part of an \"*elaborate concealment scheme*.\" Claimant submits that while SONAMI initially intended to cover all costs of the trip, it was agreed during the preparation phase as the budget developed that Antofagasta would reimburse such costs through a donation. According to Claimant, the processing of the expenses within Antofagasta occurred in a transparent manner as they were charged to an account expressly linked to Claimant and invoices were left as backup to the donation made to SONAMI.1200\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 162-164; Claimant's Supplemental Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20.\n\n959.\n\nWhile Col. Khan did not mention the involvement of SONAMI in his first witness statement, he testified in his second witness statement:\n\n\"\u2026 *I am aware that the Chilean National Mining Association (SONAMI) was the entity which paid for the flights and accommodation of the GoB / GoP delegation for the Chile trip. The Chile trip was jointly arranged by Mr Flores and me. The issue of expenses came up whilst we were planning the trip's details. Mr Flores told me that the expenses for myself, Naseer Ahmed and Hafeez Ur Rehman would be borne by TCC whereas the delegation's expenses would be paid by SONAMI. I was surprised by this and asked Mr Flores why SONAMI was paying for a trip being arranged by TCC. Mr Flores replied that he did not want the expenses of the trip to be linked with TCC, and that Antofagasta would later settle the bill with SONAMI. I am unsure whether it ever did so*.\"1201\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 33.\n\n960.\n\nIn response to Respondent's allegation that the costs were paid by SONAMI in order to avoid an audit trail showing a breach of anti-corruption policies and Pakistani law, Mr. Flores stated in his second witness statement:\n\n\"*The Chile trip was not an attempt to bribe these officials, and none of the arrangements were made to avoid an audit trail. Like Antofagasta and TCC, SONAMI, the Chilean government officials, and the Pakistani delegates all viewed the trip as a valuable opportunity to foster relationships between the Pakistani delegates and the Chilean mining community and to strengthen bilateral relations between Chile and Pakistan. We all recognized that as the oldest mining association in Chile with the broadest membership, SONAMI offered an excellent platform for these important objectives. For its part, SONAMI was an active and enthusiastic supporter of the trip: it agreed to be the official sponsor, issued the formal invitations to the federal delegates, and participated in planning several aspects of the agenda, including the meetings with representatives from other mining companies. It also agreed to pay expenses incurred for the trip in the first instance, and Antofagasta reimbursed those expenses through a donation to the association*.\"1202\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 24.\n\n961.\n\nRespondent places particular emphasis on an e-mail exchange dating from December 2006 in which accounting details regarding the donation payments from Antofagasta to SONAMI were discussed and Antofagasta's Chief of Accounting, Mario Pizarro, suggested that \"[i]*n order to disassociate it completely from the visit, we should charge the payment to the Executive Vice Presidency account*.\"1203 Mr. Flores responded to this suggestion that \"[t]*he payment must be charged to the Pelicano account (cash). While we do not charge Bonds Travel expenses for accounting purposes, they must be left as backup to the donation made to Sonami and is charged to Pelicano. The SPV has nothing to do with the issue*.\"1204\n\n**Exhibit RE-511**, p. 15.\n\nExhibit RE-511, p. 14.\n\n962.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties and was confirmed by Mr. Flores during the hearing that Project Pelican was the codename used by Antofagasta for its acquisition of Claimant to maintain confidentiality leading up to the transaction.1205 Respondent further does not dispute Claimant's submission that after the transaction Antofagasta continued to use the code name \"*Pelican*\" for the cost center it used to track finances associated with TCCA.1206 Respondent initially alleged that the \"*SPV*,\" which according to Flores had \"*nothing to do with the issue*,\" was a reference to TCCA and thus that Mr. Flores' aim was to disassociate the payment from Claimant.1207 Claimant pointed out, however, that in the Spanish original of the document, the respective sentence reads: \"*La VPE no tiene nada que ver en el tema*\" and clarified that Mr. Flores was in fact referring to the suggestion of Mr. Pizarro to charge the payment to the account of \"*la vicepresidencia ejecutiva*.\"1208\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Rejoinder, \u00b6 18; Respondent's Supplemental Reply, \u00b6 19 lit. b; Transcript (Day 10), p. 2649 lines 20-22. *See also* **Exhibit RE-512**.\n\n*Cf*.

This is an e-mail from the accountant person in Antofagasta giving the--or using the word* 'disassociate.' *We never disassociate. We put together all of the details of the transaction in each of the books of the company, and that was not--that was never the intention.*\"1209 Mr. Flores disagreed with Respondent's suggestion that this was a deliberate scheme to hide the cost of the trip from Claimant's and Antofagasta's books and he reiterated that \"[t]*he company provided all details, all records, and every single document in terms of the transaction. We, at least at that time, were not hiding anything in terms of the cost*.\"1210\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2547 line 18 to p. 2548 line 2.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2549 lines 18-21.\n\n964.\n\nRespondent further points out that the formal invitation letter issued by the Chilean Minister for Energy and Mines on 3 November 2006 stated that the trip was \"*sponsored by the Chilean Mining Association*.\"1211 Similarly, a letter from SONAMI to the Minister for Petroleum & Natural Resources dated 10 November 2006 \"*confirm*[ed] *that the Chilean Mining Association will sponsor at its cost the visit of up to 10 delegates from the Governments of Pakistan and Province of Balochistan*.\"1212\n\n**Exhibit CE-455**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-287**, p. 5.\n\n965.\n\nWhen confronted with this letter during the hearing, Mr. Flores testified that \"[t]*hat was the initial intention. This is a month ahead of the specific details--this is ahead of one month of the visit, and the initial intention was for SONAMI to bring, at their cost. But then, in terms of planning and putting together the budget, it was obvious that this was not going to be put under the SONAMI account.*\"1213 He added that \"*the purpose of the letter was basically to start invitation while details were still in progress*.\"1214 While Mr. Flores did not confirm that he was familiar with antibribery laws in Pakistan, he testified as follows:\n\n\"*Q. So, would you have been aware, in general terms at least, that it is an offense of corruption for a government official to accept or obtain any valuable thing without consideration from any person that he knows to have been or likely to be concerned in business transacted or about to be transacted?*\n\n*A. I will agree.*\n\n*Q. So, isn't it right that, by providing a letter from SONAMI saying that they were going to pay for the trip at their cost, that would, in effect, provide cover for the potential offense that would otherwise be under Pakistani law if TCC or its shareholders were paying for the trip?*\n\n*A. From what you're saying in terms of the antibribery Pakistani, the answer is yes.*\n\n*Q. And if the letter had said that the trip was at TCC's or its parent company's costs, then the delegation may not have been able to accept it; is that right?*\n\n*A. That's right. We never received any comment, in particular, after sending the letter in the way you're explaining and never rejected*.\"1215\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2536 line 22 to p. 2537 line 6.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2538 lines 6-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2539 line 3 to p. 2540 line 2.\n\n966.\n\nWhen asked by a member of the Tribunal about the rationale for the arrangement to pay the invoices through SONAMI \"*using the funding from Antofagasta*\" rather than directly by Antofagasta \u2013 with SONAMI nevertheless being the sponsoring entity to invite the delegation \u2013 Mr. Flores answered that \"[t]*here was no other reason that that was the initial concept we put as the process. We continued, then we realized about the size, and we continued without changes*.\"1216 Finally, in response to the question from the President of the Tribunal whether, retroactively, he considered this way to proceed with those payments as correct, Mr. Flores answered: \"*Absolutely not*.\"1217\n\nTranscript (Day 10, p. 2651 line 6 to p. 2652 line 20.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2653 lines 6-13.\n\n967.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by the explanation provided by Claimant and Mr. Flores regarding the involvement of SONAMI in the payment process for the Chile trip. In particular, it appears noteworthy to the Tribunal that less than one month before the trip was about the start, both the Chilean Minister for Energy and Mines and SONAMI itself stated in official correspondence to the Pakistani Government officials that the trip was sponsored \"*at its cost*\" by SONAMI \u2013 a statement that was apparently never officially corrected.1218 However, in the Tribunal's view, this does not suffice to assume that Claimant and its parent companies thereby intended to disguise illegitimate benefits to the Pakistani Government officials. In particular, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's argument that the internal accounting documents of Antofagasta establish the intent to disassociate the donation payments to SONAMI from Claimant and thus an \"*accounting fraud*,\"1219 taking into account that Mr. Flores gave explicit instruction to charge the expense to the Pelican account and to keep the invoices as \"*backup to the donation*.\"1220\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit RE-287**, p. 5.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206.\n\n**Exhibit RE-511**, p. 14.\n\n**(b) The March 2007 Trip to Toronto and Nevada**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n968.\n\nThe second trip invoked by Respondent occurred on the occasion of the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference in Tokyo and also included a visit to Barrick Gold's Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Mr. Flores described the purpose of this trip as follows:\n\n\"\u2026 [T]*he PDAC conference and visit to Barrick's Nevada mine gave the federal and provincial officials significant opportunities to learn more about the global mining industry and the experience and success of one of TCC's shareholders. PDAC is one of the largest mining conferences in the world, and each year brings together thousands of participants from the public and private sector from a wide range of countries. \u2026* [The] *exchange of information and ideas between and among government representatives happens often at PDAC, and was one of the principal reasons Barrick and TCC organized the visit.*\n\n*The federal and provincial officials who were able to travel to the Goldstrike mine in Nevada also gained an appreciation of the scale and operations at a major gold mine. Those who had gone to Chile had seen Antofagasta's and Codelco's copper mines and related facilities, so this trip gave them the opportunity to see the different methods involved in the extraction and processing of gold ore\u2014a valuable insight, since Reko Diq is a mixed copper-gold deposit. Chief Secretary Rind, who had been unable to attend the Chile trip, expressed to me that he was pleased and thankful that he had the chance to learn about mining operations by observing the Goldstrike mine and discussing operations with Barrick personnel*.\"1221\n\nFlores II, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. *See also* Boggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\n969.\n\nIn the context of the March 2007 trip, Respondent has not raised any allegations regarding the itinerary in Toronto or Nevada but notes that the trip again included a three-day stopover in London.1222\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 339; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 197.\n\n970.\n\nIn an e-mail sent to Mr. Flores on 27 February 2007, *i.e*., a few days before the delegation was to arrive in Toronto, Col. Khan provided an update on the visit and reported, *inter alia*, the following two issues:\n\n\"*We are facing a problem on our return, Mr Farooq is requesting for 3 days holidays in London like before. I have discussed this with both Tims. I have not got an answer.*\n\n*Mr. KB Rind wishes to travel to Rome, London, Karachi while Mr Farooq and Mr Tahir want to go direct to London*.\"1223\n\n**Exhibit CE-523**, p. 2.\n\n971.\n\nMr. Flores responded to this update as follows:\n\n\"*Thank you for the update on the people moving into Canada this week end. In particular, regarding the stopovers request we at Tethyan recommend not to allow visitors to run separate or particular agendas in the way flying back to Pakistan under the company account. This is because there is no reason to break-up the trip while Toronto and Pakistan are well covered by airlines on a single trip. Chile was an exception and we did allow for stopovers while there was no other alternative.*\n\n*Hope you can tell our visitors and explain the reasons for not allowing this. In any case, they are free to make any additional changes but under personal charges only.*\"1224\n\n**Exhibit CE-523**, pp. 1-2.\n\n972.\n\nFinally, Ms. Boggs, who had been copied in on Mr. Flores' response, commented:\n\n*Thanks for this response which is exactly correct. We cannot be seen to be providing* 'holidays' *as a part of this trip as that will invalidate the entire trip for everyone. If the delegates wish to add on days in Toronto or stops along the way, they must be responsible for those personal charges. The delegation is already arriving two days earlier than expected, and we have been planning on them leaving on March 10, so I assume that any stays beyond that day will be picked up by the individuals*.\"1225\n\n**Exhibit CE-523**, p. 1.\n\n973.\n\nIn her fourth witness statement, Ms. Boggs explained that she \"*was very sensitive to any improper implications, and \u2026 made clear that this would be an educational trip with only reasonable expenses.*\" She added that she \"*obtained extensive legal advice from outside counsel as to how to structure the trip to meet the requirements of the law*.\" On that basis, Ms. Boggs testified that she gave \"*clear instructions that the costs of any stopovers that took place would be paid personally by the official and not by TCC.*\"1226\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n974.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Flores also made reference to the above quoted correspondence and stated that he was \"*disappointed to learn in the course of preparing for these proceedings that, against* [his] *explicit instructions, these requests for stopovers were accommodated at TCC's expense.*\" He added that \"[h]*ad he known that the officials were still planning to make these stopovers,* [he] *would have instructed that they must bear the costs themselves*.\"1227 Ms. Boggs acknowledged Mr. Flores' statement during the hearing but did not confirm herself that the stopovers were accommodated at Claimant's expense. She further stated that she was \"[a]*bsolutely not*\" told about the stopovers at the time.1228\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 36.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2886 line 18 to p. 2887 line 2.\n\n975.\n\nIn response to the question who would have authorized the stopovers, Mr. Flores responded that he could not answer that question and reiterated that he had given instructions to the team not to allow the stopovers.1229 Ms. Boggs assumed that the arrrangements had been made by Col. Khan but also stated that she was \"*speculating in the sense that there was a clear understanding of how the trip was to be arranged*\" and that she did not expect Mr. Flores to have authorized the trip, which meant that they could have been authorized by no one else but Col. Khan.1230\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2569 line 22 to p. 2570 line 4.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2887 line 3 to p. 2888 line 9.\n\n976.\n\nBased on the evidence, the Tribunal does not consider it established that either Ms. Boggs or Mr. Flores were aware of the stopovers in London and, for Chief Secretary Rind to Rome, at the time of the trip. At the same time, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that in spite of the experience that Claimant's representatives had made only a few months earlier as regards the travel arrangements on the Chile trip, it appears that neither Mr. Flores nor Ms. Boggs actually verified at the time whether the clear instructions they had given to Col. Khan in late February 2007 had been followed.\n\n977.\n\nNevertheless, it has again to be noted that it is not for this Tribunal to make findings on whether this lack of supervision has caused possible breaches of Barrick Gold's anti-corruption policies and/or the relevant anti-corruption laws. The relevant question remains whether Claimant did, or at least intended to, improperly influence the Government officials attending the Toronto & Nevada trip and stopovers in view of the upcoming Mineral Agreement negotiations, which cannot be established by showing a lack of supervision.\n\n**(c) Causal Link to Claimant's Investment**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n978.\n\nAs a further step, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that it is not sufficient for Respondent to establish improper conduct attributable to Claimant but it also has to establish a causal link to Claimant's investment in the sense that such improper conduct must have contributed to obtaining a right or benefit related to Claimant's investment. As noted above, it is disputed between the Parties whether such causal link exists between the two trips to Chile and Toronto/Nevada and any specific steps in the chronology of Claimant's investment, in particular the Mineral Agreement negotiations.\n\n979.\n\nRespondent argues that \"[t]*hese trips amount to acts of improper influence on the government officials involved, from which it is reasonable to infer that TCC was thereafter treated more favourably by those officials*.\"1231 In the Tribunal's view, an inference cannot be based merely on the fact that the trips and stopovers occurred in the way they did but in accordance with the standard of proof established above, there must be \"*solid*\" and \"*persuasive*\" evidence on the basis of which the Tribunal can conclude that Claimant's investment was treated more favorably by the Government officials that attended the trips.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204.\n\n980.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes Respondent's argument that the benefits provided to the Government officials on the trips \"*are criminal offences even if there was no tangible effect obtained by TCC.*\"1232 The Tribunal agrees that, in the context of criminal law, improper conduct may not necessarily have to actually achieve the result that it was aimed to achieve in order to amount to a criminal offense. However, the Tribunal must emphasize that it is not assessing whether any of the people or companies involved committed a criminal offense but rather whether the alleged improper conduct has any impact on the protection of Claimant's investment under the Treaty. As the Tribunal has found above, this requires a causal link between the improper conduct and a right or benefit obtained by Claimant in relation to its investment.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204.\n\n981.\n\nConsequently, it is not sufficient for the Tribunal to consider it likely that Barrick's and Antofagasta's internal anti-corruption policies were breached on certain aspects of the trips and that the practice of Claimant's purported \"*culture of compliance*\"1233 may not have been as spotless as Claimant portrayed it to be. It is also not for this Tribunal to assess whether provisions of the relevant anti-bribery laws, in particular those under Pakistani law or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the US, have been breached. Rather, the Tribunal will examine what Respondent claims to be the results of the two trips in respect of Claimant's investment under the Treaty.\n\n*Cf.* Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 159, 241, 264 *et seq*.\n\n982.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent acknowledges that what it claims to have been the main intent of the trips, *i.e*., the signing of a Mineral Agreement, was not achieved. Nevertheless, Respondent alleges that the trips \"*did result in a number of delegates acting favourably toward TCC in the wake of the trip*\" and invokes three \"*example*[s]\": (i) during the OC meetings held in 2006 and 2007 where the expansion of Claimant's exploration program to the Western Porphyries was discussed and agreed, the GOB's representatives Mr. Farooq and Mr. Ahmed, who both attended the two trips, did not raise any objections \"*despite the fact that the benefits to TCC far outweighed those to the BDA/GoB*\"; (ii) Mr. Farooq \"*successfully lobbied*\" for the approval of Claimant's airstrip lease at a reduced rate and the relaxation of certain applicable criteria for the approval; and (iii) Mr. Ahmed approved the amendment of the order granting the Surface Rights Lease in September 2008.1234\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204.\n\n983.\n\nAs for the first \"*example*\" invoked by Respondent, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Mr. Farooq and Mr. Ahmed's \"*decision*\" not to raise any objections, and in fact to agree, to the expansion of Claimant's exploration program to the Western Porphyries was caused or facilitated by the attendance on the Chile and Toronto/Nevada trips. The circumstances and reasons leading up to the decision to change the focus of exploration works from Tanjeel to the Western Porphyries have been extensively dealt with in the Draft Decision and the Tribunal has no reason to deviate from its previous findings and to now assume that the benefits of this decision to Claimant \"*far outweighed*\" those to its Joint Venture partner that would in fact have benefitted alike from exploiting the larger reserves identified at the Western Porphyries.\n\n984.\n\nAs regards the second and third \"*example*[s]\" relied on by Respondent, the Tribunal does not accept, for reasons that will be set out in further detail below, that the approval of either the airstrip lease or the Surface Rights Lease was caused or facilitated by corruption. In the present context, it suffices to note that there is no indication that in 2007 and 2008, either Mr. Farooq or Mr. Ahmed acted in the way they did as a result of the two trips they had attended months or, in case of the Surface Rights Lease, over a year before the leases were granted.\n\n985.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address Respondent's argument that the main purpose of particularly the Chile trip was \"*currying favour with those government officials on whom TCC relied for \u2026 most importantly, the Mineral Agreement.*\"1235 It is undisputed between the Parties that a Mineral Agreement was never signed, *i.e.,* that Claimant ultimately did not obtain the benefit that it allegedly intended to obtain by inviting GOP and GOB officials on the trips to Chile and Toronto/Nevada. The Tribunal further recalls the findings it has made in its Draft Decision as regards the reasons for which the negotiations for the Mineral Agreement stalled as from 2009 and were ultimately abandoned, *i.e*., most relevantly, the GOB's growing hostility towards the project and its decision to develop its own Government-only project at Reko Diq.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 188.\n\n986.\n\nOn that basis, the only relevant allegation could be that Claimant attempted \u2013 albeit unsuccessfully \u2013 to improperly influence the Government officials in order to obtain a Mineral Agreement. While the Tribunal considers it doubtful that an attempt to exercise improper influence would be sufficient to establish the necessary causal link to Claimant's investment, it does not need to express a conclusive opinion on this point if it is not convinced that Claimant even attempted and thus intended to exercise such improper influence over the Government officials by means of these trips.\n\n987.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent places particular emphasis on an internal e-mail written by Mr. Hargreaves on 18 December 2006 as part of a discussion with Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Brett Clark, Claimant's financial controller, regarding the reimbursement and accounting of costs incurred in relation to the Chile trip. In response to a question raised by Mr. Iqbal who would pay the invoices for the three employees of Claimant who participated in the trip, Mr. Hargreaves stated that \"[t]*he costs for Sher Khan, Naseer and Hafeez are TCC costs. I would put these costs against the Mineral Agreement budget area of TCCA which was the ultimate objective of the trip*.\"1236\n\n**Exhibit RE-293**, p. 1.\n\n988.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Hargreaves explained the rationale behind his e-mail of 18 December 2006 as follows:\n\n\"*In the e-mail, I was addressing a question about the trip-related costs for three national employees of TCC, Sher Khan, Naseer Ahmed, and Hafeez Baloch. Their attendance at the trip was necessary because as the project and Mineral Agreement progressed, they would serve a key role on a grassroots level dealing with the community, staff, and other stakeholders to explain the implications of the Reko Diq project. An important part of our strategy for the Mineral Agreement, quite apart from the negotiations with the Governments, was to conduct outreach in local communities so that they could understand the implications and benefits of a major mining economy and not view it as a threat. The Chile trip, therefore, was also intended to educate the TCC staff as much as the government officials on issues like infrastructure, transportation, and social impacts. If TCC expected the staff to communicate positive messages to the community on these issues, they would be much better prepared to do so after taking in what they saw and learned in Chile. To my mind, there was nothing wrong with allocating the trip-related expense of the TCC staff to the Mineral Agreement budget because their attendance on the trip was legitimately for that ultimate purpose. I am dismayed by Mr. Farooq's attempt to use my statements to convey that they reflected a broader sinister purpose to use the Chile trip to buy out government officials in respect of the Mineral Agreement. This is clearly not the case because I was only referring to TCC's own costs, which had nothing to do with the government officials.*\"1237\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 39.\n\n989.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that \"[i]*t was well understood that the purpose of the trip was to win favour with government officials, particularly as TCC wanted to procure the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease*.\"1238 In his second witness statement, he added that as he understood it, Claimant \"*wanted favours from us and they wanted the Mineral Agreement to be finalised*.\"1239\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 22.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 55.\n\n990.\n\nMr. Hargreaves rejected the suggestion that Claimant was hoping to have the Mineral Agreement signed without serious review and deliberation as a result of the Chile trip. He emphasized that in December 2006, the parties had not yet started any discussions on the Mineral Agreement for the Western Porphyries project and formal negotiations had not started when he left TCC in July 2007. He added that the Mineral Agreement \"*was going to be a detailed and possibly complex document that both governments and whatever advisers they engaged would scrutinize very carefully*,\" which they expected would \"*take a long time*.\"1240\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 41.\n\n991.\n\nMr. Flores also testified that Mr. Farooq's testimony was \"*disprove* [n]\" by the timing of the negotiations, as there was not even a finalized internal draft at the time of the trip and Claimant sent its request to commence negotiations on the Mineral Agreement to the GOB only in June 2007.1241\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 25.\n\n992.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that that the chronology of the Mineral Agreement negotiations is undisputed, in particular that Claimant formally requested their commencement by letter of 4 July 2007 and the first draft that was exchanged dates from 9 July 2007.1242 Neverthelesss, the Tribunal considers it realistic and supported by the record that the upcoming negotiations were already on the front of Claimant's representatives' minds when planning for the trip. In fact, as quoted above, Mr. Flores testified in his first witness statement that to achieve the three goals of the trip, *i.e*., demonstrating to the Government officials how a major industrial mining operation was run, explaining and showing to them Antofagasta's experience and success in developing such mining operations, and fostering relationships between Pakistani and Chilean mining officials, was \"*very important to the future of TCC, as it would be difficult to negotiate the Mineral Agreement and Shareholders Agreement with the Governments if they did not understand the requirements and benefits of a project like Reko Diq*.\"1243\n\n**Exhibits CE-214** and **CE-216**.\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 37.\n\n993.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Flores confirmed that \"[f]*or TCC the principal purpose of the visit was to introduce these officials, who were responsible for the development of the mining industry in Balochistan and Pakistan, to the demands and potential benefits of modern, large-scale mining, to put them in a position to engage in meaningful negotiations on key agreements down the line*.\"1244 During the hearing, Mr. Flores confirmed that the most important agreements coming down the line were the Mineral Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement.1245 He also confirmed that by February 2007, *i.e*., before the second trip to Toronton/Nevada in March 2007, they had identified the two key individuals on the GOB's side for the negotiations, both of whom attended one of the two trips.1246\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 22.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2504 lines 18-21.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2508 line 4 to p. 2509 line 3.\n\n994.\n\nMr. Hargreaves testified in his second witness statement that, in his view, there was \"*nothing nefarious about TCC hoping ultimately to negotiate a suitable Mineral Agreement.*\" He testified: \"*We firmly believed that the more the GOP and GOB representatives understood about large scale mining operations and the issues associated with them, the more fair and effective our negotiations would be for all parties.*\"1247\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6 40.\n\n995.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that the objective of the Chile trip was \"[t]*he process towards a mineral agreement*\" and \"*the first step on what was to be a very long path*.\"1248 He acknowledged that the Mineral Agreement and how they were going to go about negotiating it was part of their thinking already in the summer of 2006 and that it was a key document for Claimant to obtain.1249 Mr. Hargreaves also testified that \"*the ultimate purpose was something far bigger than a mineral agreement \u2026 it was developing a mining industry like Chile in a place like Balochistan.*\"1250\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2368 lines 6-10.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2362 lines 7-16.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2370 lines lines 14-20.\n\n996.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal considers it plausible to assume that the upcoming Mineral Agreement negotiations did play a role in Claimant's planning for the trips, including in the selection of the attending Government officials. However, as the Tribunal has noted above, this does not necessarily mean that Claimant thereby intended to improperly influence or \"*to curry favour with*\" the attending Government officials in order to procure the signing of a Mineral Agreement without proper review. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Flores and Mr. Hargreaves provided a reasonable explanation in relation to the Chile trip, *i.e*., that they intended to show the Pakistani Government officials how large-scale mining operations had been developed and were now successfully run in a region that was geographically not dissimilar to Balochistan and they wanted them to meet Chilean mining officials who had been dealing with the regulatory and other challenges associated with building such an industry in the past. This in turn was intended to foster the officials' understanding of the position that Claimant would take and the requests it would make in the upcoming Mineral Agreement negotiations.\n\n997.\n\nSimilarly, in relation to the Toronto trip, Mr. Flores and Ms. Boggs plausibly explained that their intention was for the GOP and GOB officials to meet with mining officials from other countries, in particular, from Canada, on the occasion of the PDAC conference and further to gain an understanding of the operations at Gold Barrick's gold mine and the benefits it entailed for the local community.\n\n998.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, none of this can be deemed an exercise of improper influence. As found above, the trips as such, both to Chile in December 2006 and to Toronto and Nevada in March 2007, had a legitimate, educational purpose*.*\n\n999.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls its finding that the stopovers made on the way back from these trips, in particular those to London, were not justified by the educational purpose of the trips. However, the Tribunal does not consider it established that specifically these parts of the trip were planned by Claimant with the aim to exercise improper influence or to obtain improper benefits. Based on the record, it appears rather clear to the Tribunal that it was the GOB officials who raised requests for multiple stopovers and they in fact made their own travel arrangements which were not known to Claimant until the GOB had filed a request for reimbursement of the flight costs. Therefore, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that there was a corrupt intent on Claimant's part to accommodate these stopovers in order to gain undue advantage in the Mineral Agreement negotiations.\n\n1000.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal can agree with Claimant's argument, which was already cited above, that \"[e]*ven if, in hindsight, it would have been more prudent if TCC had held firm and refused to accept Balochistan's demands, they do not detract from the essential educational purpose of the trip and are not indicative of any corrupt intent or quid pro quo arrangement*.\"1251\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155. *See also* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 213.\n\n1001.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that Respondent has failed to establish any causal link between the stopovers that occurred on the way back from the trips to Chile and Toronto/Nevada and any right or benefit that Claimant obtained or at least attempted to obtain in respect of its investment. Consequently, any improper conduct in connection with these stopovers cannot be deemed to have affected or \"*tainted*\" the investment. As a result, the Tribunal thus does not have to decide whether and to what extent an unsuccessful attempt to improperly obtain such a right or benefit could have an impact on Claimant's claims under the Treaty.\n\n1002.\n\nIn the absence of such any causal link between improper conduct and Claimant's investment, the Tribunal also finds that Claimant's conduct cannot be deemed to amount to contributory fault or have any further impact on the quantum of its claim for damages under the Treaty.\n\n**b. Allegations Relating to the 2007 Airstrip Land Lease**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1003.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will assess Respondent's allegations in connection with the Airstrip Land Lease that was granted to the Joint Venture in May 2007.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1004.\n\nRespondent alleges that witness evidence and the record demonstrates that Claimant engaged in bribery to circumvent Balochistani land law and the mining licensing regime to secure land rights over land in 2006-2007 in relation to an airstrip.\n\n1005.\n\nRespondent submits that the following bribes were paid and acts of corruption offered to secure a lease over 3 sq. km. of land to enable Claimant to construct a private airstrip -\n\na) Col. Khan paid PAK Rs. 400,000 to Mr. Mandokhail (then Senior BoR Member) in May 2007 so that he recommended that the GoB relax the Land Lease Policy's eligibility criteria and allot airstrip land at a 40% discounted rate.1252\n\nb) Mr. Asmatullah (BoR Assistant Secretary) did not object this relaxation as he was promised future career assistance.1253\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 169 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-171**, clauses 2 and 6, Farooq I, \u00b6 28, Khan I, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 33, Farooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42 *and* Corrected Mandokhail, \u00b6 17.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 174 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 18 *citing* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 288(b), 292(j) *and* Asmatullah I, \u00b6 4 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 42.\n\n1006.\n\nRespondent submits that the result was that Claimant obtained a 30-year lease, at a reduced rate, over a sensitive and significant piece of military land.1254\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292, 296.\n\n1007.\n\nRespondent relies on Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan, Mr. Mandokhail and Mr. Asmatullah's evidence to demonstrate that the process of obtaining the lease was far from \"*routine*\" and \"*arms-length.*\"1255 Respondent notes that the Land Lease Policy contains strict eligibility criteria requiring the land to be leased only to local villagers or landless farmers, unless the GoB \"*in special cases for* [the] *development of an area, relax*[ed] [the] *eligibility criteria by way of notification in the official gazette*\"; however, these obstacles did not deter Claimant.1256\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 290-291 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 188, 190.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-171**, clauses 2, 6(3).\n\n1008.\n\nRespondent maintains that Mr. Farooq intercepted Mr. Mandokhail's Summary for the Chief Minister dated 3 March 2007 (which proposed that the GOB consider the market rate for the airstrip land \u2013 PAK Rs. 10,000/acre) before the Chief Minister could give his approval. Mr. Farooq allegedly then sent his comments on this summary to Chief Secretary Rind, proposing a reduced rate of PAK Rs. 5,000/acre and a relaxation of the eligibility criteria under clause 2 of the Land Lease Policy.1257 Respondent submits that at the same time, Mr. Farooq was discussing the matter with Mr. Mandokhail and persuaded him to exercise his discretion to recommend that the GOB approve the lease at the lower price and with relaxed criteria, in exchange for payment.1258\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-464**, p. 2, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n1009.\n\nRespondent notes that in the EDO's report dated 27 April 2007, the officer maintained his assessment of the market value of the land at PAK Rs. 10,000/acre but noted that the selection of the \"*current price is solely your prerogative.*\" Mr. Mandokhail then exercised his discretion on 9 May 2007 both to recommend that the GOB allot the airstrip land at a rate of PAK Rs. 6,000/acre and to relax the eligibility criteria in the Land Lease Policy \"*in case of persons to whom a mineral title has been granted under the* [BMR].\"1259 Respondent maintains that the Chief Minister hastily approved the recommendation and, contrary to the GOB Rules of Business 1976, the Law Department was not consulted.1260\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 *referring to* **Exhibits CE-466**, p. 1 *and* **CE-464**, p. 3, \u00b6 10.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-20**, rules 7(3), 8(1), 14.\n\n1010.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant is wrong in stating that the publication of the relaxation means that it was not procured by corruption. While under clause 6(3) of the Land Lease Policy, it was indeed necessary for the relaxation to be made public in order to be valid, Respondent maintains that unusually only 20 copies of the Gazette notification were printed (compared to the habitual 100-200 copies). Respondent thus maintains that this demonstrates that the bribes ensured relaxation was obtained in exactly the form that Claimant wanted and on an accelerated basis.1261\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 294.\n\n1011.\n\nRespondent also argues that these actions of Mr. Farooq go far beyond \"*appropriate administrative support*\" and in fact constitute interference in the standard approval process.1262\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 413 *and* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\n1012.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent highlighted what it considers to be mischaracterizations made by Claimant in its Rejoinder and at the 2016 Hearing.1263 Firstly, Respondent rejected the argument that the relaxation was \"*not extraordinary*\" due to the federal approvals obtained by Claimant to construct an airstrip.1264 Respondent maintains that Claimant ignores the eligibility criteria which make clear that leases are only granted to local inhabitants and such requirement may be relaxed only in \"*special circumstances.*\"1265 Moreover, Respondent submits that the discount was not mere \"*pocket change*\" as alleged by Mr. Hargreaves, but savings amounted to a substantial PAK Rs. 3 million.1266\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 170-173.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 410.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-171**, clauses 2 and 6(3).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2426 lines 4-7.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1013.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has failed to prove that the administrative process for the airstrip was anything other than legitimate and routine and suggests that the allegations Respondent makes are based on several false premises.1267\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 408.\n\n1014.\n\nFirstly, Claimant submits that Respondent's allegations are premised on its characterization of the land lease granted by the GOB as extraordinary.1268 According to Claimant, the key requirement for the airstrip was the federal approvals which were duly obtained, something which is not questioned by Respondent.1269 Additionally, Claimant maintains that Mr. Farooq did not have an improper relationship with TCC; he upheld his obligation to provide \"*administrative support as required for the obtaining of all leases, licences\u2026.*\"1270 Claimant argues that as Mr. Hargreaves made clear at the Hearing, the reduced rate was the product of an arms-length negotiation, whilst if there ever was a \"*special case*[] *for* [the] *development of the area*\" as required by the Balochistan Land Lease Policy, Claimant argues that the establishment of the first modern mine in the history of Pakistan was it.1271\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 409.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 247-249 *referring to* Livesey IV, \u00b6 23, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 413 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 251 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2426 line 4 to p. 2427 line 7 *and* **Exhibit RE-171**, clause 6(3).\n\n1015.\n\nSecondly, Claimant submits that Respondent is unable to explain why the Chief Minister's approval of the lease within a day is suspect, when in reality Claimant had obtained the necessary federal approvals, the land had been surveyed and the Board of Revenue had determined an appropriate price for the lease.1272\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 414 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 292(h), **Exhibits CE-207**, **CE-462**, **CE-466** *and* **CE-464**, p. 464.\n\n1016.\n\nThirdly, Claimant notes that its witnesses, Mr. Livesey and Mr. Hargreaves, expressly deny Respondent's allegations and maintain that Claimant's only intention was to \"*pay the fair amount and move forward with matters,*\" explaining why Mr. Farooq's offer to get the lease for free was rejected.1273 Claimant maintains that in contrast, Respondent's witness testimony is contradictory and unreliable \u2013 Mr. Mandokhail adjusted his testimony to conform with other witnesses, dismissing the same error made three times as a \"*typing error*\" (despite one being handwritten), and Mr. Farooq contradicted himself in relation to Mr. Asmattulah's promised \"*career assistance.*\"1274 Specifically in relation to the aforementioned career assistance, Claimant argues that Respondent cannot show causation; specifically it cannot show that had he failed to remain silent, the lease would not have been obtained.1275\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 252 *referring to* Transcript (Day 9), p. 2412 lines 20\u201321, p. 2432 lines 2\u20137 *and* **Exhibit RE-285**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 253-255.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 256.\n\n1017.\n\nLastly, Claimant reiterates that in any event, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Asmatullah's actions are not attributable to TCC.1276 Not only did Mr. Asmatullah testify that no one from TCC ever paid him, but Claimant maintains that Respondent has submitted no evidence that any monies that Mr. Farooq allegedly paid to Mr. Asmatullah were in relation to TCC, instead of just part of the admitted bribery and kickback schemes, which had no connection to TCC or the Reko Diq project.1277\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 256.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 256 *referring to* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1344 lines 18\u201320, Farooq I, \u00b6 26 *and* Transcript (Day 2), p.568 lines 3\u201320 *and* p. 572 lines 9\u201320.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n1018.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that on 10 May 2007, the Board of Revenue, acting through its Senior Member Mr. Mandokhail, issued an order by which it granted the Joint Venture a 30-year land lease over an area of 3 square kilometers (750 acres) for the construction of an airstrip for the Reko Diq project. It is further undisputed that the lease was granted at a rate of PAK Rs. 6,000 per acre and on the basis of a relaxation of the eligibility criteria set out in the applicable Land Lease Policy 2000.1278\n\n**Exhibit CE-213**.\n\n1019.\n\nIn this context, Respondent claims that the following bribes were paid or benefits given by Claimant to secure the airstrip lease:1279\n\ni. PAK Rs. 400,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokhail in or around May 2007 \"*in return for Mr Mandokhail exercising his discretion to recommend that the GoB allot the landstrip at a below-market rate of PAK Rs. 6,000/acre and relax the eligibility criteria required by the Land Lease Policy that would otherwise have prevented TCC leasing the land, and to sign the order granting TCC the lease*\"; and\n\nii. Career assistance by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah in the form of a promotion to Secretary Board of Revenue in December 2007 in return for Mr. Asmatullah \"*not object*[ing] *to the relaxation or reduced rate as he should have done*.\"\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 288; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 169, 174.\n\n1020.\n\nIn support of these allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan, Mr. Mandokhail and Mr. Asmatullah, which will be addressed in detail below.\n\n1021.\n\nRespondent claims that, as a result of these alleged bribes, Claimant was able to obtain \"*a blanket relaxation of the Land Lease Policy, without consulting the Law Department as required*\" and \"*a 30-year lease over a politically sensitive and significant piece of land at a discount of approximately USD 49,500 from the market rate*.\"1280\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175.\n\n1022.\n\nBased on the documentary record, the Tribunal understands that the chronology of events leading up to the order granting the land lease was as follows. On 17 October 2006, Mr. Flores wrote to the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Farooq, requesting that the BDA arrange the transfer of 3 square kilometers of land to the Joint Venture for the purposes of constructing an airstrip and attached a map showing the required land. In this letter, Mr. Flores noted that Claimant had received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to construct the airstrip and was hoping to commence construction by the end of the year.1281\n\n**Exhibit CE-465**, p. 2.\n\n1023.\n\nAccording to e-mail exchanges between Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Arndt as well as between Mr. Iqbal and Mr. Hargreaves dating from September and early October 2006, respectively, Mr. Farooq had told Mr. Iqbal that he would attempt to get the land free of costs from the GOB. Mr. Arndt also stated that he remembered Mr. Farooq saying that \"*the BDA would make this land available as part of the GOB's contribution to the JV*.\"1282\n\n**Exhibits RE-284** and **RE-285**.\n\n1024.\n\nIn a Summary for the Chief Minister dated 3 March 2007, Mr. Mandokhail stated that according to a report submitted by the Executive District Officer (EDO) Revenue Chagai, the prevailing market value of the land in question was PAK Rs. 10,000 per acre and thus proposed that GOB consider leasing out the requested area at that rate.1283\n\n**Exhibit CE-464**, p. 1.\n\n1025.\n\nOn 5 April 2007, Mr. Arndt wrote to Mr. Farooq that Claimant had obtained legal advice, which concluded that the Joint Venture was not eligible to be granted a land lease under clause 2 of the Land Lease Policy but that the GOB had the authority to relax the eligibility criteria under clause 6(3), which required a public notification of the relaxation \"*as a special case for development of the district*.\" The letter attached a draft notification, which Mr. Arndt asked to be issued prior to the land allotment.1284\n\n**Exhibit RE-173**.\n\n1026.\n\nApparently before the Summary of 3 March 2007 had reached the Chief Minister, Mr. Farooq commented on it on 17 April 2007 that the land was required \"*for an important mega project*\" and noted that the BOR had recently allotted State land to Claimant as Joint Venture partner of the GOB at a rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 per acre in the same area. He thus considered that the market rate proposed by the EDO \"*cannot be termed justified*\" and instead proposed to allot the land at the rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 and to relax the eligibility criteria pursuant to clause 6(3) of the Land Lease Policy.1285\n\n**Exhibit CE-464**, p. 2.\n\n1027.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimant had indeed been granted land at a rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 per acre in late 2005 in connection with the installation of tube wells and pipelines.1286 While Respondent claims that this was also a below-market rate that was granted only due to the BDA's \"*financial constraints*\" and that enabled Claimant to obtain the land \"*at a significant discount*\" of more than USD 3 million,1287 it does not raise any allegations of corruption in connection with that previous land lease.\n\n**Exhibit RE-273**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 lit. e.\n\n1028.\n\nMaking reference to Mr. Farooq's comments on the Summary, on 24 April 2007, the Board of Revenue requested the EDO to survey the relevant area and to reassess the market value of the land.1288 In his letter of 27 April 2007 to which he attached his report, the EDO stated in relevant part:\n\n\"*So far as the increase in price of land is concerned, it is submitted that the price increased with land development and increased population. This is tur* [sic] *that earlier the land was allotted to TCC AT Rs 5000 / acre now we have enhanced the price and proposed Rs. 10,000/acres. However the succession of current price is solely your prerogative. We will have no objection in this regard.*\n\n*However, It is suggested to increase the price to 6000 Rs / Acre. This would be reasonable and in favor of Government of Balochistan and for Board of Revenue*.\"1289\n\n**Exhibit CE-465**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-466**.\n\n1029.\n\nMaking express reference to Mr. Farooq's comments on 17 April 2007 as well as the re-submitted report of the EDO, on 9 May 2007, Mr. Mandokhail recommended in the Summary for the Chief Minister that the GOB consider allotting the land at a rate of PAK Rs. 6,000 per acre \"*in favour of M/S Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan Ltd. with the relaxation of eligibility criteria stipulated in Clause 2 of LLP 2000 in case of persons to whom a mineral title has been granted under the Balochistan mineral rules, 2002*.\"1290\n\n**Exhibit CE-464**, p. 3.\n\n1030.\n\nOn the same day, the Chief Minister approved Mr. Mandokhail's recommendation, and on the next day, Mr. Mandokhail issued the order granting a 30-year land lease for the purposes of constructing an airstrip to the Joint Venture, at a rate of PAK Rs. 6,000 per acre and \"*with the relaxation of eligibility criteria stipulated in Clause 2 of LLP-2000*.\"1291\n\n**Exhibit CE-213**.\n\n**(a) The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 400,000 to Mr. Mandokhail**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1031.\n\nRespondent claims that Mr. Mandokhail exercised his discretion on 9 May 2007 to recommend the land lease at a below-market rate of PAK Rs. 6,000 per acre and the relaxation of the eligibility criteria in return for being paid PAK Rs. 400,000 by Col. Khan in Mr. Farooq's presence. While Respondent also notes the \"*breakneck speed*\" with which the Chief Minister approved Mr. Mandokhail's recommendation,1292 it does not raise any allegation that a bribe was paid to the Chief Minister in this regard. Therefore, the Tribunal will limit its assessment to whether Respondent has established that Mr. Mandokhail indeed received an illegitimate payment in connection with his recommendation of 9 May 2007 and the issuance of the order on the following day.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 lit. h.\n\n1032.\n\nIn his witness statement dated 24 June 2015, Mr. Mandokhail testified that in return for approving the Summary to the Chief Minister and signing the order granting the land lease, \"*Mr Farooq and Col. Sher Khan came to* [his] *office and Col. Khan gave* [him] *PAK Rs 500,000 in cash.*\" He added that the money had been in a brown envelope, which he put in his briefcase.1293 In his corrected witness statement dated 11 October 2016, which was submitted by Respondent shortly before Mr. Mandokhail gave oral testimony, he corrected, *inter alia*, the amount he purportedly received from Col. Khan to PAK Rs. 400,000.1294 During the hearing, Mr. Mandokhail stated that the original number of 500,000 had been a \"*typing error*.\"1295\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\nCorrected Mandokhail, \u00b6 17.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1437 lines 2-3.\n\n1033.\n\nMr. Mandokhail stated that he did not have any record of this payment because it was \"*a small amount*\" that he did not put in his bank account but spent \"*here and there, on* [his] *children's education, and on household expenses*.\" When asked how he remembered the specific amount of PAK Rs. 400,000, which is recorded in his statement before the Group of Experts of 2 June 2015,1296 he answered: \"*Money is a thing, which you don't forget about.*\" He added: \"*You have to remember these things*.\"1297 When referred to his Section 161 statement before the Public Service Commission dated 12 August 2015, which records that Col. Khan had given him \"*Rs. 500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Rupees),*\"1298 Mr. Mandokhail testified that \"[i]*t could be that this one is a typing error as well*.\"1299 Similarly, when referred to his Section 164 statement before the Judicial Magistrate in Quetta dated 24 February 2016 which records that he had been given \"*RS 500,000.00 (Five lakh rupees),*\"1300 Mr. Mandokhail stated: \"*Like I said before, it could be a typing error. I did not write it. Magistrate has written it*.\"1301\n\n**Exhibit RE-440**, \u00b6 6.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1434 line 15 to p. 1435 line 7.\n\n**Exhibit RE-450**, p. 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1438 lines 19-20.\n\n**Exhibit RE-483**, \u00b6 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1439 line 21 to p. 1440 line 1.\n\n1034.\n\nIn response to the question when he had realized that there was a typing error in his witness statement, Mr. Mandokhail testified: \"*With time, when I was preparing for this hearing, I was reading my statements again and again, and then I realized that the amount has been noted incorrectly*.\"1302 When asked how he had come to the realization of this inaccuracy, he denied that he had been told what any of the other witnesses had testified and answered: \"*One remembers when you try to remember such things, and you do remember that this thing might be wrong*.\"1303\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1442 line 22 to p. 1443 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1445 lines 3-5.\n\n1035.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his first witness statement that he had made payments to Mr. Mandokhail but did not mention any specific occasion or amount. He stated that after having had a discussion with Mr. Flores \"*in 2006 or 2007*,\" he \"*began paying Mr Farooq to get things done*\" who told him that he used that money \"*to pay off other department officials, particularly the Board of Revenue (BOR) from whom* [they] *were seeking different leases and concessions (in contradiction to Balochistan rules and legislation).*\" Col. Khan further stated that while he asked Mr. Dad to make some of these payments \"*as, where possible*, [he] *didn't like to personally hand over bribes*,\" he \"*did have to deal directly with Mr Mandokhail \u2026 since he was a senior Bureaucrat and an ex-Chairman of the BDA*.\"1304 Col. Khan further testified:\n\n\"*The payments to Mr Mandokhail and others allowed us to achieve many things which would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for the Reko Diq project. This included, for example, obtaining the airstrip in a sensitive military area and acquiring surface rights over approximately 600 square kilometres, and obtaining security clearances without due process*.\"1305\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 14.\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 15.\n\n1036.\n\nMr. Farooq confirmed in his first witness statement that he \"*witnessed a payment being made to Mr Mandokhail by Col. Sher Khan as a reward for securing the airstrip*.\"1306 In his second witness statement, he testified that Claimant \"*was desperate to have an airstrip at the Reko Diq site, but this was always going to be a challenge*.\" He confirmed that he originally thought that he could get the land be granted to Claimant for free due to his relations with Mr. Mandokhail but then found out that Mr. Mandokhail had recommended a rate of PAK Rs. 10,000 to the Chief Minister. Mr. Farooq stated that he \"*took the Summary from the CS (Mr K B Rind) before the CM could give his approval*\" and suggested a reduced rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 per acre and also discussed this with Mr. Mandokhail \"*beyond the official correspondence*.\"1307 Mr. Farooq added:\n\n\"*Had I not made this recommendation and had I not convinced Mr Mandokhail to exercise his discretion to reduce the rate, TCC would have paid Rs. 10,000 per acre, rather than Rs. 6,000 per acre.*\n\n*Mr Mandokhail was paid Rs. 400,000 for his help with the rate reduction and for his recommendation that the eligibility criteria in the Land Lease Policy 2000 (LLP) be relaxed. I was with Col. Sher Khan when this money was paid to Mr Mandokhail. \u2026 We did a great favour to TCC by getting the LLP relaxed as per the draft provided by TCC*.\"1308\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 28.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n1037.\n\nRespondent also refers to the testimony of Mr. Livesey, who was Claimant's Project Director at Reko Diq at the time. In his fourth witness statement, which was submitted in the previous phase of the proceedings, Mr. Livesey testified with regard to the airstrip lease:\n\n\"*Both the provincial and federal governments also assisted TCC's work at the site by granting (and later renewing) the permits TCC needed to build and operate a private airstrip at the Reko Diq site. The required permits include a security clearance from the Pakistan military which would allow the issuance of No-Objection Certificates to construct and operate the airstrip from the Balochistan Government, a surface rights lease over the land used, and finally, an airstrip license from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (\"CAA\"). I recognized that the licensing of an airstrip in such a remote location, close to two international borders, might prove to be challenging. I believed that it would be a good litmus test for our ability to work in the Chagai area, and would also help us to get a sense for the level of support from the military and the provincial and federal governments, as all would be party to the permitting and approvals process.*\n\n*I recall being impressed that both the initial application and renewal processes for the federal airstrip license went exceptionally smoothly, with our applications approved in line with the regulatory guidelines and with the minimum of hassle\u2014sometimes within a matter of weeks. For example, on 29 November 2007 we informed the CAA that construction of the airstrip was complete, and we requested a final inspection so that the necessary license could be issued. The CAA promptly carried out the inspection and issued a private airstrip license to TCCP in early January 2008, which was renewed annually thereafter. Furthermore, Balochistan actively assisted us in obtaining the necessary federal approvals, which further supported my feeling of goodwill for the project from our provincial partners*.\"1309\n\nLivesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n1038.\n\nIn response to Mr. Farooq's testimony that Claimant was \"*desperate to have an airstrip at the Reko Diq site*,\" Mr. Livesey testified in his seventh witness statement that before building its own airstrip, Claimant was using an airstrip within a three-hour drive from Reko Diq, which he considered to be \"*adequate access to the site*\" and \"*not unusual*\" in the mining industry, \"*especially in the exploration and feasibility stages before initial mine development*.\" He added that \"[t]he *re were obvious advantages to the proposal* [of constructing an airstrip], *including convenience and greater security and safety of TCC personnel*\" but denied that this could be qualified as \"*desperat*[ion]\" as the existing airstrip \"*remained a viable alternative*.\" Mr. Livesey further stated that if the GOB had not been supportive of Claimant's airstrip application, they might have waited until a later stage of the project, which was common in his experience \"*because of the substantial outlay required for an airstrip.*\"1310\n\nLivesey VII, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\n1039.\n\nMr. Livesey testified that Claimant \"*fully complied with the required proceeses to obtain the required approvals and licenses from both the Provincial and Federal Governments for the airstrip*\" and denied the interpretation of his previous testimony as an indication of illicit conduct. He clarified that \"*most of the approvals needed to construct the airstrip were actually from the Federal Government, not the Provincial Government*\" and referred to \"*security clearance from the Pakistani military, which allowed the issuance of (i) an airstrip clearance from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (\"CAA\"); (ii) No-Objection Certificates from the Balochistan Government for the construction and operation of the airstrip; and (iii) a surface rights lease from the BAlochistan Board of Revenue (BOR\") for the land used*.\"1311 Mr. Livesey testified that the surface rights lease \"*was the least of these requirements*\" and explained that obtaining the license from the federal CAA had been a \"*multi-step process*,\" which involved site visits before and after construction of the airstrip, periodic inspections of the runway and equipment, training on firefighting, and installing security checks and procedures. Mr. Livesey stated \"[i]*t is because of the many steps in this process that* [he] *was impressed to see the application and renewals by the CAA go so smoothly*.\"1312\n\nLivesey VII, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nLivesey VII, \u00b6 24.\n\n1040.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Hargreaves stated that the securing of the airstrip was \"*important*\" and \"*a priority project*\" for Claimant at the time but did not confirm the suggestion that he was \"*chasing \u2026 up*\" the application in an e-mail exchange with Mr. Iqbal in October 2006.1313 In his e-mail of 3 October 2006, Mr. Hargreaves had written: \"*Chris* [Arndt] *also mentioned that we had made enquiries to GOB in respect of the lease of land for the airstrip. Can you please confirm and, if so e-mail me a copy of the application*.\" In response, Mr. Iqbal told him that he had spoken with Mr. Farooq about the land lease, who would attempt to get the land free of cost, but no formal application had yet been filed. Mr. Iqbal added he understood from a different e-mail from Mr. Hargreaves that \"*we will decide it after your meeting with BDA during your next visit to Pakistan.*\"1314\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2409 line 18 to p. 2411 line 22.\n\n**Exhibit RE-285**.\n\n1041.\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Iqbal's report that, *inter alia*, Mr. Farooq would try to get the land free of costs from the GOB, Mr. Hargreaves testified:\n\n\"A. \u2026 *This was an offer from offer Farooq to get land for free, which we didn't want. We wanted to pay for the land. This was an insignificant amount of money, and, to me, it was a place we didn't want to go. We just want to pay for the fair amount and move forward with these matters*.\n\n*Q. Well, you don't say that, do you? There is no response to Mr. Iqbal saying\u2014*\n\n*A. I'm not going to tell Zafar; I'll tell that to Farooq. And I told Farooq that we didn't care about getting the land for free. You know, we're there as a foreign company spending millions of dollars. We're not going to go and do a dodgy deal for a bit of free land in the desert. This was a red herring*.\"1315\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2412 line 16 to p. 2413 line 7.\n\n1042.\n\nMr. Hargreaves confirmed that Mr. Farooq's offer \"*had a smell about it*\" and stated that they \"*didn't entertain those things*.\" He also confirmed that he was aware at the time that there had been a fax dating from July 2005, quoting the rates that Claimant would be charged for the land, and that subject to changes in the rates they would have to pay for the land at the rate set by the Board of Revenue.1316 Mr. Hargreaves further testified that he had not been aware at the time that Claimant obtained the land at a 40 percent discount from the Board of Revenue's original recommended rate.1317 When asked whether he left that up to Mr. Farooq, he answered:\n\n\"*I was leaving this up to the people that were, you know, line management. I just find this puzzling. This is such a small amount. This is pocket change. I don't know why they would do this, these things. It just puzzles me. Farooq is trying to ingratiate himself on this transaction. It just makes no sense to me.*\"1318\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2413 line 22 to p. 2416 line 22.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2425 lines 9-12.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2426 lines 4-10.\n\n1043.\n\nMr. Hargreaves stated that he would not characterize Mr. Farooq's offer as corrupt but rather as unnecessary, adding:\n\n\"*Farooq was trying to tell us,* 'Hey, I can get this for you.' *I'm sure he could have got it for us without paying anything to anybody and just said:* 'Look, we're 25 percent partner in this project. We need to do something for Tethyan. Let's give them this land for free.' *The Chief Minister had that discretion. He could have exercised it. But what I was saying is,* 'We don't need that. Let's not use up that political capital on matters like this.'\"1319\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2432 lines 8-16.\n\n1044.\n\nMr. Hargreaves further confirmed that he was aware of the need for a relaxation of the eligibility criteria in the Land Lease Policy but considered it \"*something that should have and would have been granted through \u2026 the normal application process*\" and not \"*something that required some sort of dodgy deal*.\" He characterized the relaxation as a \"*routine process*\" and noted that the same had been given to Claimant for other land it had previously leased.1320\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2427 line 16 to p. 2428 line 17.\n\n1045.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence in the record, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that Mr. Mandokhail received a payment of PAK Rs. 400,000 from Col. Khan in or around May 2007 in return for exercising his discretion regarding the rate at which the land would be leased and the relaxations of the eligibility criteria. First of all, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that in all three written statements of Mr. Mandokhail given before the Public Service Commission, the Magistrate and this Tribunal, respectively, it is recorded that Mr. Mandokhail received an amount of PAK Rs. 500,000 from Col. Khan. While a corrigendum to Mr. Mandokhail's written witness statement in this proceeding was submitted shortly before the hearing, in which he corrected, *inter alia*, the amount he allegedly received in connection with the airstrip lease, the Tribunal does not believe his testimony that all three written statements, which were recorded before different authorities, contain the same \"*typing error*.\" Further, Mr. Mandokhail's testimony that he simply came to remember the correct amount in preparing for this hearing \u2013 albeit without being referred to Mr. Farooq's second witness statement in which an amount of PAK 400,000 had been recorded \u2013 also does not appear plausible to the Tribunal.\n\n1046.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Claimant intended to exercise influence over Mr. Mandokhail as regards either the rate to be paid per acre for the lease or the relaxation of the eligibility criteria. As for the rate, Respondent has placed great emphasis on the fact that based on the assessment of the EDO that the prevailing market rate was PAK Rs. 10,000, Mr. Mandokhail initially recommended in his Summary for the Chief Minister in March 2007 that the land be granted to Claimant at that rate, but that upon intervention of Mr. Farooq Mr. Mandokhail then recommended a lower rate in May 2007. In this regard, the Tribunal first notes that while Mr. Farooq did intervene in April 2007 and recommended a rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 which had been used in a previous land lease, this rate was not simply adopted but the Board of Revenue asked the EDO for a further assessment and report. In his report of 27 April 2007, the EDO explained that the rates had increased and that they had therefore proposed a rate of PAK Rs. 10,000. However, he explicitly stated that he would have no objection to adopting a lower rate and even \"*suggested to increase the price to 6000 Rs / Acre. This would be reasonable and in favor of Government of Balochistan and for Board of Revenue*.\" On that basis, it appears plausible to the Tribunal that Mr. Mandokhail agreed with the EDO that this was a \"*reasonable*\" rate and therefore decided to follow his suggestion, which still involved an increase of PAK Rs. 1,000 per acre on the rate adopted in 2005.\n\n1047.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal takes note of Mr. Hargreaves' testimony that the amount Claimant \"*saved*\" through the rate reduction, *i.e.*, USD 49,500, was \"*insignificant*\" compared to the amounts that Claimant and its parent companies were spending on the Reko Diq project at the time. While the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to adopt the term \"*pocket change*\" used by Mr. Hargreaves, it agrees that it does not appear very likely that Claimant would have taken the risk of engaging in corrupt activities in return for saving a five-digit amount while investing several million dollars in the exploration of Reko Diq.\n\n1048.\n\nWhile Respondent placed considerable emphasis during the examination of Mr. Hargreaves on Mr. Farooq's initial offer to get the land free of cost, it is clear from the record that this offer did not materialize. In addition, there is no indication that this offer was triggered by Claimant or that Claimant's representatives even considered this to be in their interest. To the contrary, Mr. Hargreaves testified that because this offer \"*had a smell about it*,\" they did not want to entertain it but rather pay an appropriate rate for the land. It is not documented whether Mr. Hargreaves in fact told that to Mr. Farooq, but the record shows that Mr. Farooq's actual intervention was then limited to suggesting a lower rate in line with what had been determined as the applicable rate in 2005. The Tribunal does not consider it established that this intervention went beyond the obligation of the BDA, as the authority representing the GOB on the Joint Venture, to provide \"*appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of*,\" in this case, necessary land rights under clause 7.2(a) of the CHEJVA.1321 This obligation was also noted in the Tribunal's Draft Decision as forming part of Claimant's legitimate expectations that the GOB would continue to provide support for, and facilitate, Claimant's investment as it had before and during the time period in which the Novation Agreement was signed.1322 In any event, even if it were otherwise, the Tribunal does not believe, for the reasons explained by Mr. Hargreaves, that Mr. Farooq was acting on instructions from Claimant and thus that his actions would be attributable to Claimant.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 940-943, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 944-947.\n\n1049.\n\nAs to the relaxation, it is undisputed that neither Claimant nor the Joint Venture met the elegibility criteria under clause 2 of the Land Lease Policy 2000, which provided that land was to be leased only to residents of the same district or persons that possessed no or less than a certain specified area of land. It is also undisputed that pursuant to clause 6(3) of the same Policy, \"[t]*he Government may, in special cases for development of an area, relax eligibility criteria by way of notification in the official gazette*.\"1323 While it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether a similar relaxation had been granted to Claimant in the past, given that Respondent argues on the one hand that it was of an \"*unprecedented blanket nature*\"1324 but refers on the other hand to a previous lease of land to the BDA and Claimant in November 2005,1325 it was in any event within the discretion of the GOB to grant a relaxation to the Joint Venture for the purposes of constructing the airstrip.\n\n**Exhibit RE-171**, clauses 2 and 6(3).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 291.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 lit. e, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-273**. This order does not make reference to any relaxation of the eligibility criteria. It is thus unclear whether a relaxation was required and, more importantly, whether it was obtained in that case.\n\n1050.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal takes note of Mr. Livesey's testimony who explained that the land lease was only the final step in obtaining the necessary licenses for the airstrip and that Claimant was in fact much more concerned with fulfilling the requirements for obtaining the license from the federal Civil Aviation Authority. Respondent has not raised any allegations of corruption in connection with any of the federal licenses, which had already been obtained when the Joint Venture applied for the land lease with the Board of Revenue. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider it conspicuous that the GOB, being Claimant's Joint Venture partner in the Reko Diq project, decided to grant the relaxation.\n\n1051.\n\nRespondent argues that contrary to the 1976 Business Rules, the Law Department was not consulted prior to granting the relaxations.1326 While it may be correct that a consultation was required under the 1976 Business Rules and there is indeed no indication that the views of the Law Department were sought, a failure within the GOB to abide by its own internal rules does not establish that the land lease was obtained by corruption. In particular, Respondent does not allege that the Chief Minister, who approved Mr. Mandokhail's recommendation without consulting the Law Department, received any improper payments or other benefits from Claimant.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 lit. h.\n\n1052.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that in the circumstances, neither the recommendation of the reduced rate of PAK Rs. 6,000 per acre nor the relaxation of the eligibility criteria justify an inference that Mr. Mandokhail was improperly influenced in connection with the airstrip lease. Also, taking into account the credibility concerns expressed above regarding Mr. Mandokhail's testimony on the amount he allegedly received, the Tribunal thus concludes that Respondent has failed to establish that Claimant made an illegitimate payment to obtain the airstrip lease.\n\n**(b) The Alleged Career Assistance Provided to Mr. Asmatullah**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1053.\n\nRespondent further alleges that Mr. Asmatullah, who was Assistant Secretary to the Board of Revenue at the time, did not object to the reduced rate or the relaxations \"*as he should have done*,\" which was rewarded by career assistance in December 2007 when Mr. Farooq requested that he become Secretary to the Board of Revenue.1327\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 174; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 292 lit. j.\n\n1054.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Asmatullah testified that Mr. Farooq \"*secured a waiver*\" of the eligibility criteria under the Land Lease Policy 2000 and added that \"[w]*hile there is a power to relax this requirement, there are certain steps that must first be taken. As the steps were not taken, it was my job to raise objections, yet in this case I raised no objection.*\"1328 Mr. Asmatullah did not specify in his witness statement why he did not raise any objections. However, he stated in a more general context that he was posted to the position of Secretary in December 2007 \"*at the request of Mr. Farooq*\" who told him that \"*he wanted* [him] *in the position of Secretary because it would be easy to get things done for TCC*.\" Mr. Asmatullah further testified that \"*Mr. Farooq acted as TCC's personal partner. He was a powerful man and you did not say no to him*\" because, otherwise, \"*you would lose your job within 15 minutes*.\"1329\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 10.\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 8.\n\n1055.\n\nMr. Farooq stated in his first witness statement that he \"*made payments to Sheikh Asmatullah for his assistance including in relation to obtaining the airstrip and surface rights*.\"1330 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq corrected his previous testimony, stating that he \"*did not make a monetary payment to Sheikh Asmatullah on this occasion,*\" *i.e*., in connection with the land for the airstrip, but explained that he \"*now recall*[ed] *that* [he] *made payments to Mr Asmatullah and helped him with his career for his assistance with later events.*\" He maintained that they \"*did a great favour to TCC by getting the LLP relaxed as per the draft provided by TCC*.\"1331\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 28.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 42 (with note 44).\n\n1056.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Mr. Asmatullah nor Mr. Farooq confirmed Respondent's allegation that Mr. Asmatullah refrained from raising any objections to the land lease for the airstrip in return for career assistance, which he allegedly received from Mr. Farooq in December 2007, *i.e*., seven months after the lease had been granted. In fact, Mr. Farooq specifically corrected himself by stating that he helped Mr. Asmatullah with his career \"*for his assistance with later events*.\" Mr. Asmatullah himself also indicated that the reason for him not raising any objections may have been that he did not want to lose his job; he did not mention that he was promised to receive career assistance at any point before it was allegedly given in December 2007. Consequently, Respondent has not established that any future career assistance would have been the reason for Mr. Asmatullah not raising any objections.\n\n1057.\n\nFor the reasons set out in connection with the alleged payment to Mr. Mandokhail above, the Tribunal further does not believe that there was any reason for which Ms. Asmatullah \"*should have*\" objected to the land lease as alleged by Respondent. In addition, even if he had objected, Respondent has not established that the Assistant Secretary to the Board of Revenue would have had any considerable influence on the decision-making process, which, as Respondent recognizes, was a discretionary one. Finally, the Tribunal notes that there is no allegation that Mr. Farooq had any instruction from Claimant to provide career assistance to Mr. Asmatullah. Therefore, any improper benefit involved with that assistance would not be attributable to Claimant.\n\n**(c) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1058.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent has not established that Claimant made any improper payments or gave improper benefits in order to obtain the airstrip lease.\n\n**c. Allegations Relating to the 2007/08 Renewal of Exploration License EL-5**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1059.\n\nThird, the Tribunal will assess Respondent's allegations raised in relation to the renewal of Exploration License EL-5 in December 2007.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1060.\n\nRespondent alleges that the following payments were made and acts of corruption occurred to ensure that the MMDD found that Claimant's second extension of Exploration License EL-5 over 90% of the exploration area was justified and to secure the grant of various rights and extensions in relation to EL-5 -\n\na) Mr Farooq testified that he paid bribes of between PAK Rs. 20,000-30,000 to Mr. Ahmed on several occasions during Mr. Ahmed's time as Director General and Secretary of the MMDD.1332\n\nb) Col. Khan testified that he made a payment to Mr. Ahmed around the time of the Chile trip for approximately PAK Rs. 30,000-40,000.1333\n\nc) In return for payments from Claimant and its assistance in getting Mr. Farooq appointed as BDA Chairman, Mr. Farooq also admitted to not raising challenges in Operating Committee Meetings against the EL-5 extension as he should have.1334\n\nd) Payments were made by other individuals at TCC, including Mr. Arndt to Mr. Ahmed to secure Claimant's rights in relation to exploration licences.1335\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 52 *and* Farooq I, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 34 *and* Transcript (Day 3), p. 843 line 21 to p. 844 line 5.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 313, 325 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 53.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 313 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 52.\n\n1061.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's argument that it would not have offered a bribe to procure the extension of EL-5 because it was already entitled to the extension under the BM Rules and CHEJVA, misrepresents the operation of the MMDD and the procedure for applying for a second extension.1336\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 317.\n\n1062.\n\nFirstly, Respondent submits that even if Claimant met the criteria for obtaining an extension, that would not necessarily mean bribes were not necessary to secure the extension \u2013 as Mr. Farooq and Mr. Tahir explained, \"*everything would be done on payments\"* at the MMDD.1337 Respondent claims that the various payments to Mr. Ahmed thus make sense since, as both Secretary and Director General of the MMDD, he was effectively running the department.1338\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 318 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 52 *and* Tahir II, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 318.\n\n1063.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that Claimant is incorrect in arguing that it was \"*entitled*\" to the extension.1339 Respondent notes that under the 2002 BM Rules, each time a renewal is made, it should be for 50% of the exploration area prior to the application date.1340 For licenses concerning over 50% of the existing area (as is the case here, where the second extension concerned 90%), renewal is discretionary. Respondent maintains that the bribes were thus employed to ensure the MMDD granted the renewal despite there being insufficient \"*technical or other reasonable grounds*\" to do so.1341 Respondent refers to Mr. Tahir's testimony in which he explained that renewal of a license over such a large proportion of an exploration area was unprecedented and that Claimant's justifications were inadequate.1342 Respondent rejects Claimant's justifications for seeking the second renewal, specifically arguing that challenges to EL-5 before the Balochistan High Court did not prevent Claimant undertaking exploration work (as the High Court did not impose any stay on Claimant's work) and mineral agreement negotiations and delays in obtaining Government approvals to open a local office were unconnected to the exploration work and thus should not have affected its progress.1343\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 319.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 319 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 29(2)(c)(ii)-(iii).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 164-166; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 313-326 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-1**, rules 29(2)(c)(ii)-(iii) *and* Tahir II, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 321 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 32 *and* **Exhibit RE-15**, Exhibit 1, p. 318.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 323 *referring to* Tahir II, \u00b6 33 *and* **Exhibit CE-61**.\n\n1064.\n\nMoreover, Respondent condemns Claimant reliance on the Operating Committee meeting in October 2007 which preceded its application for renewal to argue that the BDA \"*endorsed and supported*\" Claimant's recommendation that that EL-5 be renewed for a further three years since Claimant failed to mention that Mr. Farooq was the only representative of the BDA at this meeting.1344 Mr. Farooq indeed admitted that he considered Claimant's justifications \"*flimsy*\" but nonetheless felt obliged to show his support given the payments he had received previously and Claimant's role in securing his appointment as BDA Chairman.1345\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 325 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 174, *further referring to* **Exhibit CE-64**, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 325 *referring to* Farooq I, \u00b6 14 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 53.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1065.\n\nFirstly, Claimant argues that Respondent has not proven that the EL-5 renewals were corruptly procured, and rather refers to the record which allegedly demonstrates that Claimant applied for and received the renewals in accordance with the 2002 BM Rules.1346 Claimant maintains that just because it was not automatically entitled to the renewal and the regulator had discretion to deny the application does not mean that there was an abuse of the MMDD's discretion.1347\n\nClaimant's Post- Hearing Brief, \u00b6 257.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 423 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 315, 318.\n\n1066.\n\nClaimant maintains that the BDA fully endorsed its opinion that there were indeed \"*technical or other reasonable grounds*\" justifying renewal of the license over more than 50% of the area due to the vast expansion of the scope of Claimant's exploration program in May 2006.1348\n\nClaimant's Post- Hearing Brief, \u00b6 257 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-64**, p. 4, James I, \u00b6 28 and **Exhibit RE-15**, p. 11.\n\n1067.\n\nSecondly, Claimant argues that Respondent's bribery allegations are contradicted by contemporaneous evidence and witness evidence showing that there was \"*extensive discussion and careful consideration within the company.*\"1349 Claimant refers to the testimony of Mr. Flores and Mr. James who explained that Claimant understood the renewal to be critical and thus carefully considered its justifications.1350 Claimant questions why after such hard work and the establishment of a detailed internal strategy document that specifically contemplated two \"*fallback alternatives*\" in the event the license was not extended, Claimant would resort to bribery to guarantee renewal.1351\n\nClaimant's Post- Hearing Brief, \u00b6 260 *referring to* James II, \u00b6 15. *See* **Exhibits CE-20**, **RE-15**, **CE-64** *and* Flores II, \u00b6 42.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 260 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 42 *and* James II, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 260 *referring to* **Exhibit CE-525**; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 425.\n\n1068.\n\nMoreover, Claimant submits that not only do Mr. James and Mr. Flores deny Respondent's allegations, maintaining that Claimant obtained the renewal lawfully and without bribery payments, but such allegations are too vague to test; they provide mere estimations of the amounts and timing of the bribes and cannot specify the alleged *quid pro quo*.1352 Claimant considers the allegations legally deficient, arguing that Pakistan cannot show that but for such bribes, Claimant would not have obtained the renewal.1353\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 262.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 263.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n1069.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the Director General of the MMDD, acting as Licensing Authority, granted to the Joint Venture, *inter alia*, the following licenses: (i) on 18 May 2002, Exploration License EL-5 for a 3-year period over an area of 973.75 square kilometers;1354 (ii) on 9 April 2005, a first extension of EL-5 for a further 3-year period over a reduced area of 482.72 square kilometers;1355 and (iii) on 1 December 2007, a second extension of EL-5 for a further 3-year period over a slightly reduced area of 435.02 square kilometers.1356 While Respondent claims that acts of corruption occurred in relation to \"*the EL-5 extensions*,\"1357 indicating that it refers to both extensions, its specific allegations concern purported payments made to Mr. Maqbool Ahmed in late 2006 and 2007 and thus relate only to the second extension of EL-5 granted in December 2007. The Tribunal also notes that the first extension granted in April 2005 bears a different signature and thus appears to have been signed by a person different from Mr. Ahmed. In addition, Respondent's arguments regarding the alleged lack of justification for a renewal of EL-5 also relate only to the second extension.\n\n**Exhibit CE-16**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-17**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-20**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 313.\n\n1070.\n\nIt is further undisputed between the Parties that the second renewal of Exploration License EL-5 was considered and granted pursuant to the particular requirements of Rule 29(2)(c)(ii) and (iii) of the 2002 BM Rules and that the assessment of these requirements involved regulatory discretion to be exercised by the Licensing Authority.1358 Rule 29(2)(c)(ii) provides that that an application for a second renewal shall not be made \"*in respect of an area of land greater in extent than fifty per cent of the exploration area immediately prior to the date of that application, or such other proportion of the exploration area as the licensing authority may determine on good technical or other reasonable grounds*.\" Rule 29(2)(c)(iii) further provides that an application for a second renewal shall not be made \"*unless the application can satisfy the authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits and that the proposed activities could not have been reasonably completed during period of the first renewal.*\"1359\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 319-320; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 423.\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, Rule 29(2)(c)(ii) and (iii).\n\n1071.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the explanations provided by Claimant in its application for the second extension of EL-5 provided \"*inadequate*\" justification to grant such extension pursuant to the requirements of Rule 29(2)(c)(ii) and (iii).1360 In support of this argument, it relies on Mr. Tahir who testified that \"*the technical and other challenges that TCC relied upon were unconvincing*.\" In particular, Mr. Tahir considered that neither the challenge to Claimant's right to EL-5 in the Balochistan High Court, nor the negotiations on the draft Mineral Agreement, nor the necessary Government approvals to be obtained to open Claimant's Pakistani branch office, affected Claimant's ability to complete its exploration activities and feasibility study and thus did not justify a second extension of EL-5. In his view, \"[b]*y this stage, thirteen years after the CHEJVA's commencement date, it was far too late to be discussing feasibility and extensions.*\"1361\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 321-324. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 166.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n1072.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it considered the reasons provided by Claimant in support of its application for the second extension of EL-5 already in its Draft Decision. In particular, the Tribunal found that, contrary to Respondent's suggestion, the term \"*full feasibility study*\" could not commercially reasonably be interpreted to require Claimant to submit a feasibility study on each and every deposit within the exploration area or to prevent a phased development starting with an initial mining project and expanding it over the years once the initial project had paid off.1362 The Tribunal further held that Claimant's decision to change the focus of its exploration works in the course of 2006 and its plans to conduct a feasibility study over the deposits at the Western Porphyries (instead of that at Tanjeel) was known to the GOB and approved by its representatives on the OC meeting during a meeting held on 26 October 2007.1363 In addition, the Tribunal noted that this shift in focus was explicitly mentioned in Claimant's second renewal application.1364\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 1215-1216, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1219-1220.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 1217, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1221.\n\nDraft Decision, \u00b6 1218, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-15**, p. 10, *maintained in* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1222.\n\n1073.\n\nRespondent points out that the conclusion drawn by the Tribunal in its Draft Decision was that the scope of the Feasibility Study did not provide a valid ground for rejecting the Mining Lease Application in 2011 and argues that no finding was made on the validity of the grounds presented by Claimant in its renewal application.1365 The Tribunal does not agree with this latter statement because its finding that the Licensing Authority could not use this as a ground for rejection was in fact based on the consideration that Claimant's renewal application fulfilled the statutory requirements under the 2002 BM Rules, in particular Rule 29(2)(c)(iii), and was thus eligible to be granted by the Licensing Authority.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 324, *referring to* Draft Decision, \u00b6 1223.\n\n1074.\n\nClaimant's witness Mr. Hugh James testified in his first witness statement that \"[t]*he magnitude of the Reko Diq project made it impossible to complete all the necessary work for the Mining Lease by the end of the first extension of EL-5*.\" He added that it was therefore explained to the BDA at the OC meeting in October 2007 that a second extension over 90% of the current area was needed, and on that basis, the OC authorized Claimant to apply for the second renewal. Mr. James stated that the reasons were explained in the application and \"*there was no irregularity and no need to pay bribes; TCC obtained this renewal by complying fully with the regulatory process laid out by the Provincial authorities*.\"1366\n\nJames I, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n1075.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. James explained that the extension \"*was a matter of great importance for TCC*\" and \"*the subject of extensive discussion and careful consideration within the company*.\" He further stated that around October 2007, Claimant developed an internal strategy document concerning the renewal, which was prepared based on the input of various teams and himself and approved by the Board. According to Mr. James, this document demonstrates that \"*TCC considered the matter at length, including the approach to and requirements of the application, and the rationales to justify relinquishing less than 50% of the area*\" and that \"*TCC did not take for granted that it would get the extension*\" and in fact developed two \"*fallback alternatives*\" in case the application would be denied.1367\n\nJames II, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 18.\n\n1076.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the Parties' agreement that Claimant was not entitled to an automatic renewal of EL-5 but that the Licensing Authority's decision involved the exercise of discretion. On that basis and taking into account Mr. James' testimony on the preparation of the application and its approval in the OC meeting of October 2007, Respondent would have to establish that this discretion was exercised in favor of Claimant's application not on the grounds that the new discoveries at the Western Porphyries had led to a change in focus of the exploration works which required additional time to complete the necessary exploration works, but because of the alleged acts of corruption.\n\n1077.\n\nIn this context, Respondent claims that the following improper payments were made to secure the second extension of EL-5:1368\n\ni. On several occasions, PAK Rs. 20,000 to 30,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Ahmed \"*to ensure that TCC was granted the rights and extensions of its exploration licence (El-5) that it wanted*\";\n\nii. Payments from TCC to Mr. Farooq and assistance in getting him appointed as Chairman of the BDA in return for Mr. Farooq \"*refrain*[ing] *from speaking up against TCC in the Operating Committee meetings, including to challenge TCC's recommendation in October 2007 that it seek an extension of EL-5 over 90% of the existing exploration area, despite the lack of a proper justification for doing so*\";\n\niii. PAK Rs. 30,000 to 40,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Ahmed \"*at around the time of the Chile trip \u2026 in connection with TCC's exploration licenses*\"; and\n\niv. Payments by \"*other individuals at TCC, including Mr. Arndt*\" to Mr. Ahmed \"*to secure TCC's rights to exploration licenses*.\"\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 313; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162.\n\n1078.\n\nIn support of its allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan and Mr. Tahir, which will be addressed in detail below.\n\n1079.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant's application did not meet the criteria for renewal, but argues that even if did, \"*to secure any action at the MMDD, payment was necessary.*\"1369 Mr. Farooq testified in this regard that \"*the MMDD was the sort of department where nothing could be done without payment*.\"1370 Similarly, Mr. Tahir stated that \"*everything at the MMDD was done by making payments; the clerk dealing with any request would take money and send a share of the money up the chain to the Director General of the MMDD and the Secretary of the MMDD*.\" Mr. Tahir added:\n\n\"*Even for a simple task, such as sending a letter to the relevant district administration, money would need to be paid. For larger tasks, like obtaining an exploration licence extension, money would need to be paid directly to the Director General and the Secretary of the MMDD. I know that Mr Maqbool Ahmed, who was Director General of the MMDD from 6 January 2005 to 16 April 2007 and also Secretary of the MMDD from 1 December 2006 until 6 November 2008, used to take payments of this nature and I would not be surprised if he had taken them from Mr Farooq and TCC*.\"1371\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 315.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 52.\n\nTahir II, \u00b6 30.\n\n1080.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it does not have to decide whether was a general practice of taking corrupt payments at the MMDD, as alleged by Respondent. Even if that were the case, this would not be sufficient to establish that improper payments, attributable to Claimant, were made to obtain the second extension of EL-5. Therefore, it will now turn to the examination of the individual allegations raised by Respondent.\n\n**(a) The Alleged Payments of PAK Rs. 20,000 to 30,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Ahmed**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1081.\n\nIn support of its first allegation, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq who stated in his first witness statement that he \"*paid Secretary Maqbool of the MMDD on two or three occasions to extend the ELs to cover TCC's delays and notwithstanding that TCC should have been applying for a Mining Lease*.\"1372 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq confirmed:\n\n\"*I paid Maqbool Ahmed at the MMDD directly small amounts of between Rs. 20,000 to 30,000 on several occasions in exchange for expediting TCC's work and not raising unnecessary objections and including at around the time that the second extension was requested. Mr. Maqbool was my classfellow and friend, so I felt comfortable asking for him to help to get work done for TCC. I am sure that Mr Arndt, Col. Sher Khan and others knew about these payments and were paying Mr Maqbool directly, as he told me that he was getting money from TCC*.\"1373\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 16.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 52.\n\n1082.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that both Respondent's submissions and Mr. Farooq's testimony on the alleged payments made by him to Mr. Ahmed are rather vague.1374 In particular, Mr. Farooq mentioned \"*two or three*\" or \"*several*\" occasions on which he allegedly gave money to Mr. Ahmed but did not specify for which purpose the individual payments were made. The same applies to Col. Khan's testimony in his second witness statement that he was aware that \"*Mr Farooq used to pay* [Mr. Ahmed] *small amounts for processing and approving certain approvals etc. which TCC required from time to time*.\"1375\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 258.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 34.\n\n1083.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Farooq did not testify that he received the money or an instruction to pay money from Claimant. He also did not state that he expressly told any of Claimant's representatives about the payments but only suggested that Mr. Arndt, Col. Khan \"*and others*\" knew about them. Mr. James testified in his second witness statement that he had \"*no knowledge of any such bribes, and no reason to believe that any were paid*.\"1376\n\nJames II, \u00b6 17.\n\n1084.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that even if Mr. Farooq made any payments to Mr. Ahmed and even if any of them were made in connection with the second renewal of EL-5, there is no basis for attributing such a payment to Claimant.\n\n**(b) The Alleged Payments and Career Assistance to Mr. Farooq**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1085.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq further testified as follows:\n\n\"*Once TCC had made a decision I would always try to help them, because of the payments that I received from TCC and their role in securing my appointment as Chairman of the BDA. When TCC recommended in the OC meeting on 26 October 200758 that it seek a second extension of EL- 5 over a large majority of the existing exploration area, despite my view that the justifications that it gave for doing so were flimsy, I did not object. I felt I needed to support TCC, whether right or wrong*.\"1377\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 53.\n\n1086.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Respondent nor Mr. Farooq raise any specific allegation of a payment being made by a specific person of TCC to Mr. Farooq in the context of the second extension of EL-5. Mr. Farooq rather makes a general reference to \"*the payments I received from TCC*,\" without identifying any specific occasion or payor in this regard.\n\n1087.\n\nAs to the alleged assistance of Claimant to Mr. Farooq in his becoming appointed Chairman of the BDA in mid-2006, the Tribunal recalls its findings in the context of the allegations relating to the 2006 Novation Agreeements above that Respondent has failed to establish that any of Claimant's representatives would have been in a position to exercise notable influence on the GOB officials who were in charge of nominating the Chairman of the BDA or that they indeed did \"*put in a word*\" for Mr. Farooq as alleged by Respondent.\n\n1088.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that this second allegation has not been sufficiently substantiated to be examined in any more detail. In any event, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's argument that Mr. Farooq should have raised any objections during the OC meeting on 26 October 2007 as regards the grounds invoked by Claimant as justification for applying for a second extension of EL-5. In particular, the Tribunal considers that, contrary to Respondent's position, the change in focus of the exploration works to the Western Porphyries, which required additional time before being able to apply for a mining lease, appears to be a reasonable justification for the application \u2013 and the Licensing Autority's decision to exercise its discretion in favor of granting this application.\n\n**(c) The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 30,000 to 40,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Ahmed**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1089.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Col. Khan did not make any reference to a payment that he allegedly gave to Mr. Ahmed, in connection with the second extension of EL-5 or otherwise. In his second witness statement, Col. Khan then stated that he \"*specifically recall*[ed] *paying* [Mr. Ahmed] *around PAK Rs. 30,000-40,000 before the Chile trip in connection with certain exploration licenses*.\"1378 During the hearing, Col. Khan confirmed his testimony that he had made a payment of \"*between 30,000 or 40,000 rupees*\" to the Secretary of Mines and Minerals in 2006.1379\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 34.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 843 line 16 to p. 845 line 6.\n\n1090.\n\nAs noted above, Mr. James denied having had any knowledge that payments were made in connection with the second renewal of EL-5 and added that he did not believe that such bribes were in fact paid.1380\n\nJames II, \u00b6 17.\n\n1091.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Col. Khan did not state that the payment he allegedly made to Mr. Ahmed specifically related to the second renewal of EL-5 but rather more vaguely that it was made \"*in connection with certain exploration licenses*.\" In addition, it is noteworthy that Col. Khan did not mention any payment to Mr. Ahmed in his first witness statement but then testified that he \"*specifically recall*[ed]\" this payment in his second witness statement and referred to it during the hearing as one of the two first payments that he recalled having made on Claimant's behalf.\n\n1092.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that Col. Khan stated that he made the payment before the Chile trip, which took place in December 2006. As the second renewal was granted on 1 December 2007, the payment would thus have taken place at least one year before the event to which it allegedly related. The Tribunal therefore considers that even if a payment in late 2006 were to be considered proven, this would not suffice to establish that this contributed to obtaining the second renewal from the Licensing Authority more than a year later.\n\n1093.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether a payment from Col. Khan made to obtain a right or benefit for Claimant would have been attributable to Claimant.\n\n**(d) Alleged Payments Made by \"*****Other Individuals*****\" at TCC, Including Mr. Arndt, to Mr. Ahmed**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1094.\n\nFinally, Mr. Farooq stated in his second witness statement that he was sure that \"*Mr. Arndt, Col. Sher Khan and others knew about these payments* [Mr. Farooq allegedly made to Mr. Ahmed] *and were paying to Mr. Maqbool directly, as he told* [Mr. Farooq] *that he was getting money from TCC*.\"1381\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 52.\n\n1095.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, even on Mr. Farooq's testimony, he did not witness or know about any payments being made by Mr. Arndt \"*and others*\" but only presumed that this was the case because Mr. Ahmed had told him that he was receiving money from Claimant, without specifying any amounts or payors. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that this allegation has not been sufficiently substantiated to be examined in any more detail.\n\n1096.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to establish that any improper payments were made by Claimant or with Claimant's knowledge in connection with the second extension of Exploration License EL-5.\n\n**d. Additional Allegation Relating to the Time Period of 2007**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1097.\n\nBefore turning to Respondent's fourth allegation raised in connection with the performance of Claimant's investment, the Tribunal briefly turns to an additional allegation raised in relation to the time period of 2007, *i.e*., that Mr. Masood Malik who worked at the BDA, received a payment of PAK Rs. 300,000 from Mr. Dad in early 2007 in return for providing Claimant with information from BDA files and facilitate security clearances.1382\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30 lit. f.\n\n1098.\n\nMr. Malik testified in his witness statement that after he had witnessed \"*a large packet of Rupee notes*\" being delivered by Mr. Dad to Mr. Farooq \"*in February or March 2007*,\" he complained to Col. Khan that he should be receiving money too. According to Mr. Malik, \"[a] *few days later, Bari Daad visited* [his] *house and gave* [him] *PAK Rs 300,000*,\" telling him that the money came from Col. Khan. Mr. Malik further stated that after he had provided \"*some documents from old files at the BDA relating to the Reko Diq project*\" to Col. Khan, he started to receive gifts from him such as ties, perfumes and diaries.1383\n\nMalik, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.\n\n1099.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Malik confirmed that he received a payment of PAK Rs. 300,000, stating that Col. Khan had asked him in 2006 when the Novation Agreement was signed to provide him with information, \"*especially for* [the BDA's] *internal meetings or the secret things that TCC does not come to know about*.\" Mr. Malik confirmed that he was aware of the contractual arrangement between Claimant and the GOB, including the responsibilities of the BDA to represent the GOB as a partner in the Joint Venture. He added that \"*being partner didn't mean that they could ask* [him] *to be a mole on behalf of TCC and ask* [him] *for secret documents*.\"1384\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1172 line 18 to p. 1175 line 1.\n\n1100.\n\nIn response to the question why Col. Khan would consider it necessary to pay him PAK Rs. 300,000 if he was meeting with the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Farooq, at the same time, Mr. Malik stated: \"*I was a custodian for the files. I was in charge of all Reko Diq files. So, obviously, if any secret paper needed to be taken out of the file, any document which had to be written or any attempt \u2026 if it was needed \u2026 it had to go through me*.\" Mr. Malik confirmed that Mr. Farooq as his boss had access to the files but maintained that he had been paid to provide documents and information to which Mr. Farooq also had access.1385 In response to the question from a member of the Tribunal which was the most important secret document he gave to Col. Khan from his files, Mr. Malik answered that could not remember any specific document but that Col. Khan asked for \"*this document and that document*\" and \"*some letters to Mines and Mineral Department*,\" which included the BDA's observations that they had not communicated to Claimant. Mr. Malik also referred to \"*some paper*\" out of the \"*some old files*\" from the 1990s but again could not remember any specific secret paper.1386\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1177 line 15 to p. 1180 line 19.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1186 line 18 to p. 1187 line 12.\n\n1101.\n\nMr. Dad confirmed in his first witness statement that after delivery of a package to Mr. Farooq in early 2007, he \"*delivered a similar package to Masood Malik a few days after*,\" adding that he remembered this clearly because it was only a few days after he had seen Mr. Malik in Mr. Farooq's office. Mr. Dad testified that Mr. Malik did not open the package in front of him but that he \"*strongly suspected*\" that it contained bundles of Rupees.1387 During the hearing, Mr. Dad stated that after the NAB had asked him a direct question whether he had paid PAK Rs. 300,000 to Mr. Malik, he knew that there was money in the money in the package he had delivered.1388\n\nDad I, \u00b6 10.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1289 line 22 to p. 1290 line 6.\n\n1102.\n\nCol. Khan did not make reference to any payment he allegedly made (through Mr. Dad) to Mr. Malik in his witness statements.\n\n1103.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that even if it were correct that Mr. Malik received a payment of PAK Rs. 300,000 by Mr. Dad, it remains unclear for which purpose such payment would have been made. In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Malik's testimony that he provided internal and secret documents from the BDA to Col. Khan. Apart from the fact that the BDA had certain responsibilities and obligations to cooperate with Claimant as the GOB's Joint Venture partner under the CHEJVA, Mr. Malik himself testified that Mr. Farooq also received payments from Claimant in return for his co-operation on the Reko Diq project. According to Mr. Malik, Mr. Farooq as his boss further had access to all the files that he, Mr. Malik, had in his custody. In addition, Mr. Malik could not identify a single specific document that he allegedly provided to Col. Khan.\n\n1104.\n\nConsequently, on Mr. Malik's own testimony, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Col. Khan paid him in return for access to information and documents or for being Claimant's \"*mole*\" within the BDA. In any event, in the absence of any specific document identified as being illegitimately provided to Claimant, Respondent has also failed to substantiate a causal link between the alleged act of corruption and any right of benefit obtained by Claimant in relation to its investment.\n\n**e. Allegations Relating to the 2008 Surface Rights Lease**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1105.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal will address Respondent's allegations raised in connection with the two Surface Rights Lease orders granted to the Joint Venture in May and September 2008, respectively.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1106.\n\nRespondent alleges that the following payments were made in an attempt to circumvent the Balochistan mining leasing regime and secure extensive surface rights over 585 sq. km of land \u2013\n\na) Col. Khan and Mr. Dad made two separate payments totaling PAK Rs. 1,400,000 to Mr. Farooq in April 2008 to orchestrate the grant of the surface rights over 147 sq. km. in May 2008 and subsequently over 585 sq. km. in September 2008.1389\n\nb) Mr. Aziz paid PAK Rs. 200,000 to Mr. Asmatullah (of the PAK Rs. 1,400,000 paid to Mr Farooq) in April 2008 in return for Mr. Asmatullah's assistance with obtaining surface rights.1390\n\nc) Col. Khan paid Mr. Mandokhail PAK Rs. 400,000 in late September 2008 and gave him an Umrah trip to amend the Surface Rights Lease Order.1391\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 297(a).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143-146.\n\n**(a) Col. Khan and Mr. Dad's Payments to Mr. Farooq**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1107.\n\nRespondent relies on the respective testimonies of Col. Khan, Mr. Dad, Mr. Aziz and Mr. Farooq as well as Mr. Aziz's diaries to support the allegation that these payments were made to Mr. Farooq in order to orchestrate obtaining surface rights for TCC \"*subvert[ing] the proper process for the granting of* [the Surface Rights Lease].\"1392\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 44.\n\n1108.\n\nAs will be addressed in more detail below, Respondent maintains that Mr. Aziz's diaries record: (i) a payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 received from \"*Bari Dad of TCC*\" on 14 April 2008; and (ii) a payment of PAK Rs. 800,000 received in \"*cash from Col. Khan.*\"1393 Although this second entry is undated, Respondent notes that Mr. Aziz clearly recollected on cross-examination that the date of this transaction was on 10 or 11 April 2008.1394\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139 *referring to* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1629 line 10 to p. 1630 line 15, **Exhibit AA-1 / RE-228**, p. 12, Transcript (Day 7), p. 1658 lines 5-19 *and* **Exhibit AA-2 / RE-229**, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139(b) *referring to* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1658 lines 5-19.\n\n1109.\n\nAs a result, Respondent submits that Mr. Farooq orchestrated the grant by:\n\na) manipulating the Summary for the Chief Minister to refer to an area of 147 sq. km (not the full 585 sq. km) and avoiding potential objection to this by ensuring that the Board of Revenue only received this summary after it had received Chief Minister Bhotani's sign off (due to the close relationship between Chief Minister Bhotani and Claimant)1395; and\n\nb) colluding with Mr. Asmatullah, Secretary Revenue at the Board of Revenue (who was indebted to him for securing his promotion and \"*in TCC's pocket, assisting it with other matters in exchange for small monthly payments*\") to generate an order over the 147 sq. km, but which referred to the amount of acres equivalent to the exploration area of 585 sq. km that Claimant wanted (144, 568 acres).1396 The intention was that once generated, Claimant would pay the acreage amount for the full exploration area (*i.e*., 585 sq. km) before requesting that the order be corrected (shortly after Mr. Mandokhail was reappointed as Senior BoR Member) to read 585 sq. km given that TCC had paid such amount.1397\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140 and Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 300(c), 307 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48 *and* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47 and Asmatullah, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 9-12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 47, Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41 *and* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1368 lines 2-22.\n\n**(b) Mr Aziz's Payment to Mr. Asmatullah**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1110.\n\nSecondly, Respondent alleges that PAK Rs. 200,000 (from the money paid by Mr. Dad to Mr. Farooq) was paid to Mr. Asmatullah by Mr. Aziz (on Mr. Farooq's behalf) on 14 April 2008 in return for Mr. Asmatullah's involvement in ensuring that Claimant was granted surface rights over the full 585 sq. km. and for not raising any objection in relation to Mr. Farooq's circumventing proper procedures.1398\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 297.\n\n1111.\n\nRespondent maintains that Mr. Aziz made the payment in the evening of 14 April 2008 and recorded this in his diary the following day.1399 In return for this bribe, Respondent submits that Mr. Asmatullah refrained from raising objections to Mr. Farooq's disregard for the mining license regime.1400 In this regard, Respondent refers to Mr. Mandokhail (Senior BoR Member) amending the First Order without the necessary Chief Minister approval, following a threat of redundancy and a payment from Col. Khan.1401 Respondent rejects the claim that Mr. Asmatullah expanded his role in cross-examination compared to his witness statement, arguing that he explained his role fully in his Affidavit.1402\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 141 *referring to* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1665 lines 9-18 and p. 1691 line 13 to p. 1692 line 19, Aziz, \u00b6 18 *and* **Exhibit AA-1 / RE-228**, p. 13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 21, *citing* Aziz, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, Farooq I, \u00b6 18 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 47; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 297(b), 310 *referring to* Khan I, \u00b6 33, Asmatullah, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, Transcript (Day 5), p. 1372 line 3 to p. 1373 line 2, Transcript (Day 7), p. 1693 lines 5-17 *and* Transcript (Day 2), p. 576 lines 5-15, p. 577 line 19 to p. 578 line 6 *and* p. 580 lines 2-7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144 *referring to* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1446 line 21 to p. 1447 line 13 *and* p.1454 line 9 to p.1455 line 3; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 300(e) *referring to* **Exhibit CE-66**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 142 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-438**, \u00b6\u00b6 2-7.\n\n**(c) Col. Khan's Payment to Mr. Mandokhail**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1112.\n\nThirdly, Respondent submits that PAK Rs. 400,000 were paid by Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokhail in late September 2008, and an Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail's family paid for in full by Claimant (through Mr. Farooq) in 2009, in return for Mr. Mandokhail's assistance in issuing the order amending the area of the Surface Rights Lease.1403 In addition to these bribes, Respondent submits that Mr. Farooq threatened that Mr. Mandokhail would lose his job and official residence in Quetta if he did not issue the amended order avoiding the necessary Chief Minister approval.1404\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 297.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 144 *referring to* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1446 line 21 to p. 1447 line 13 *and* p. 1454 line 9 to p. 1455 line 3.\n\n1113.\n\nRespondent relies on the testimony of Col. Khan, Mr. Mandokhail and Mr. Farooq to corroborate this payment.1405 Respondent denies that inaccuracies in Mr. Mandokhail's testimony demonstrate the falsity of his evidence, highlighting that many of Claimant's own witnesses also amended their testimonies \u2013 without the courtesy of submitting a revised statement in advance.1406\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143-146 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 24, *citing* Corrected Mandokhail, \u00b6 23, Khan I, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 and 33, Farooq I, \u00b6 16, 18 *and* Farooq II, \u00b6 50; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 297(b), 311(f) *referring to* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1447 lines 3-5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 145.\n\n1114.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that Claimant misstates Pakistan's case when it labels Mr. Mandokhail's correction of his appointment as Senior Member of BoR as leading to the \"*disintegrat* [ion]\" of Respondent's surface rights case.1407 Respondent maintains that the scheme turned on Mr. Mandokhail being appointed before Claimant sought the order (which is what happened \u2013 he was appointed in June and the order sought on 1 September 2008).1408\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146 *referring to* LaPorte Response, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146 *referring to* LaPorte Response, \u00b6 9, Khan II, \u00b6 41, Transcript (Day 5), p. 1376 lines 1-16, Farooq II, \u00b6 49 *and* Corrected Mandokhail, \u00b6 22.\n\n**(d) Result**\n--------------\n\n1115.\n\nAs a result of such bribery, Respondent submits that Claimant was able to subvert the mining license regime to supplement and extend its rights under EL-5 and obtain rights of ownership over a vast area of land until at least 2038 \u2013 \"*a land grab in simple terms.*\"1409\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 304, 312; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 147.\n\n1116.\n\nRespondent emphasizes the inherent value of surface rights compared to the rights under an exploration license, as Mr. James admitted reluctantly at the Hearing.1410 Respondent submits that they have a longer duration and entitle the holder to full property use and ownership rights.1411\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 301; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 148-151 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2715 lines 11-18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 150.\n\n1117.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimant's case as to why it required these surface rights has shifted, since Mr. Livesey and Mr. James offered contrasting explanations.1412 Respondent claims that Claimant applied for such rights over the land it held under EL-5 as well as the additional 147 sq. km area in order to tie-up the whole area so that no other entity could access it without Claimant's consent, leaving it in a strong position if anyone else sought to pursue development of the area.1413 Respondent emphasizes that, Claimant, whom it considers not to have achieved anything significant in commercial development for nearly two decades, now had the ability to exclude all other exploration development for up to 60 years. Respondent perceives this, coupled with the inconsistent testimony of Mr. James, to justify careful scrutiny on the Tribunal's part.1414\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 152.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151.\n\n1118.\n\nRegardless of which explanation as to why the surface rights were sought is accepted, Respondent argues that the fact remains that the process of obtaining this lease circumvented due process.1415 Respondent submits that Claimant should not have been able to seek surface rights over the area covered by EL-5 since it already had exploration rights in relation to this and furthermore, by seeking surface rights over the additional area, Claimant unlawfully expanded the area of land that it had tied up.1416 Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that, because it paid the correct price, there was no corruption involved in the securing of the lease \u2013 Respondent emphasizes that it does not allege that the intention was to obtain land at an undervalue, but to circumvent due process.1417\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-320** *and* Transcript (Day 3), p. 849 lines 2-8.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 299 *referring to* Claimant's Opposition, \u00b6 183.\n\n1119.\n\nRespondent rebutted the following allegations made at the 2016 Hearing and in the La Porte Response.\n\n1120.\n\nFirstly, as to Claimant's argument that Mr. Asmatullah and Mr. Farooq's plan was \"*implausible,*\" Respondent questions the assumptions on which this implausibility is premised, relying on Mr. Mandokhail, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Asmatullah's respective evidence to show that these assumptions were \"*littered with errors and mischaracterisations.*\"1418 Respondent maintains that not only was it common knowledge that BoR Senior Member Mr. Kasi was going to retire, but Mr. Farooq spoke with Chief Secretary Rind (not Chief Minister Raisani as alleged) to procure Mr. Mandokhail's subsequent appointment and Claimant further mischaracterizes Mr. Asmatullah's evidence in an attempt to question the timing of his payment.1419\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 156-157.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156 *referring to* Haqqani Opening Slides, p. 35 (repeated in Claimant's Forensic Hearing Opening Slides at p. 10), Transcript (Day 5), p. 1480 line 13 to p. 1481 line 2, TCC's Haqqani Opening Slides at p. 35, Transcript (Day 8), p. 1823 line 16 to p. 1824 line 3, Transcript (Day 3), p. 899 lines 10-12, Farooq II, \u00b6 49, Transcript (Day 2), p. 551 lines 14-22, Haqqani Opening Slides at p. 36 *and* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1826 lines 4-18.\n\n1121.\n\nSecondly, Respondent maintains that the suggestion that the discrepancy between square kilometers and acres in the First Order was \"*simply a benign clerical error that was corrected as soon as it was discovered,*\" has been undermined by evidence from Mr. Farooq, Mr. Asmatullah and Col. Khan.1420 Moreover, Respondent submits that Mr. James confirmed that the so-called error was not corrected on discovery, revealing a casual approach to managing the application and a disregard for how it obtained the desired rights.1421\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 158 *referring to* Transcript (Day 3), p. 867 lines 18-22 *and* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1314 line 12 to p. 1370 line 6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160.\n\n**(e) Mr. Aziz's Diaries**\n--------------------------\n\n1122.\n\nAs discussed in Section VII.C above in relation to the Standard and Burden of Proof, Pakistan submits that Mr. Aziz's diaries corroborate witness evidence demonstrating Claimant's improper surface rights payments and also provide evidence that bribes were paid in respect of other events, ultimately serving as authentic documentary evidence, debunking TCC's \"*grand conspiracy*\" theory.1422\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 233-253.\n\n1123.\n\nThe Parties' dispute relates to the three specific aforementioned entries:\n\na) The entry on page 12, under the heading \"*RECEIPTS*\": \"*14/4 Cash received from Bari Dad of TCC 600,000*\" (\"**First Entry\"**);\n\nb) The entry on page 14, under the heading \"*Distributions*\": \"*15/4* [Paid to] *Sh. Asmatullah BoR. 200,000*\" (\"**Second Entry\"**); and\n\nc) The entry on a standalone two-sided piece of paper (the \"**Q2B Document**\"), under the heading \"*RECEIPT*\": \"*5.* [Cash from] *Col. Sher Khan 800,000 -*\" (\"**Third Entry\"**).1423\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 233.\n\n1124.\n\nRespondent contends that since it has successfully discharged its initial burden of establishing *prima facie* authenticity of the diaries, the burden shifts to Claimant to make good its fabrication claim. At the February 2017 Hearing, Respondent directed the Tribunal to consider a number of hypothetic questions that point to the inherent implausibility of fabrication and maintains that it has disproved the following issues raised by Claimant as purported evidence of fabrication.1424\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 252 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p.16 line 15 to p. 19 line 2.\n\n1125.\n\nFirstly, Respondent maintains that it has gone beyond establishing *prima facie* authenticity by putting forward Mr. LaPorte's expert evidence which found no indication that the diaries were fabricated.1425 Respondent rejects Mr. Radley's challenge to the ESDA analysis, including his attack on the poor test strip quality, the 'blotting'/'tad' method and Mr. LaPorte's failure to conduct a sequencing analysis. Respondent maintains that Mr. LaPorte justified these decisions on his \"*professional opinion*\" and Mr. Radley later acknowledged the appropriateness of Mr. LaPorte's approach.1426 Mr. Radley later accepted that: (i) sequencing of pages 12 and 14 was not possible due to the missing page 13 and blank page 15; (ii) sequencing is not helpful where the writer might have been flipping from one page to another (as may be the case here where there are receipts on one page and distributions on another); and (iii) ESDA testing does not work well for non-ballpoint inks (*i.e*., the Q2B Document).1427\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 240.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 249-250 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 139 lines 5-7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 247.\n\n1126.\n\nRespondent notes that Mr. LaPorte confirmed that the missing page 13 was not a \"*red flag*\" as alleged by Mr. Radley; it was not the only page missing and it would be \"*irresponsible*\" to conclude that this is proof of fabrication as alleged by Claimant because there could have been many reasons for its removal.1428 Moreover, Respondent refers to Mr. LaPorte's testimony that there were multiple pages missing from the journal, meaning that the individual who authored it \"*obviously had a habit of tearing pages out of a book,*\" showing that page 13 was not an isolated incident.1429\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 248 *referring to* Radley Report, \u00b6 40 *and* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 23 lines 11-12 *and* p. 183 line 21 to p. 186 line 10.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 248 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 49 lines 1-4.\n\n1127.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that the ink analysis revealed no signs of fabrication. Respondent argues that the fact that pages 12 and 14 contained two distinct ink types that could not be distinguished, one of which was used for the first four entries on page 12 (Ink Type 1) and the second of which (Ink Type 2) was used for the First and Second Entries, is not evidence of fabrication.1430 Contrary to Claimant's suggestion that the use of Ink Type 2 for the First and Second Entries is strong evidence of fabrication, Respondent submits that the same ink type does not decisively mean the same pen, or even the same ink \u2013 there is no way of knowing whether the two entries were made in one sitting years after they were alleged to have been made.1431 Respondent also maintains that there was no evidence of fabrication with regard to the Q2B Document, contrary to Mr. Radley's conclusion that there is \"*no evidence whatsoever to shed light on the crucial point of when the writing of the entire \"Receipt\" portion of Q2B was written.*\"1432 Respondent maintains that the difficulty in analyzing the Q2B Document and the Third Entry is that it is written in non-ballpoint ink and it is again not possible to know whether these entries were written with the same ink and pen.1433\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 249 *referring to* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 40 *and* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 204 lines 1-5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 249 *referring to* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 40, 43, Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 32 line 13 to p. 33 line 7 *and* p. 49 lines 15-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 250 *referring to* Radley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 48-52.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 249 *referring to* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 54, 56.\n\n1128.\n\nThirdly, Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Radley, as a self-proclaimed \"*handwriting and document expert,*\" has confirmed that there was \"*nothing untoward*\" in respect of the diaries, whilst Mr. LaPorte has confirmed that the physical condition of the diaries and the paper therein is consistent with them being at least seven years old.1434 Respondent maintains that Mr. Radley's lack of balance is evident from his Report where he only refers to handwriting consistencies, without referring to the many inconsistencies.1435 Respondent maintains that the reason for this is that consistency throughout a document may suggest it was fabricated and written in one go; therefore, the presence of inconsistencies can denote authenticity.1436\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 251 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 161 lines 19-22 and p. 182 lines 9-14 *and* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 36, 59.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 251 *referring to* Radley Report, \u00b6 86 *and* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 172 line 3 to p. 180 line 18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 251.\n\n1129.\n\nRespondent also emphasizes that despite being prevented from performing an ink-dating analysis, Mr. LaPorte explained that it would have been \"*highly unlikely*\" to have assisted in determining the entry dates due to ink exposure to certain Pakistani climatic conditions and the type of ink used.1437 Respondent submits that Claimant opportunistically changes its opinion \u2013 from firstly seeing the analysis of little importance, to seeing it as \"*critical\u2026to properly assess the authenticity of the documents.*\"1438\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 242-245 *referring to* LaPorte Report, \u00b6 6, Mr LaPorte's Opening Presentation at Side 6, Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 42 line 14 to p. 45 line 20 *and* p. 121 line 17 to p. 124 line 25.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 245 *referring to* LaPorte Response, \u00b6 22.\n\n1130.\n\nRespondent further maintains that the strength of Mr. Aziz's testimony supports its argument that Mr. Aziz's diaries are not a product of fabrication. Firstly, in respect of the Third Entry, Claimant suggests that Mr. Aziz could not \"*credibly explain how a document on its face indicates that* [it dates] *from 2009 and 2010 when the payment is from 2008.*\"1439 However, Mr. Aziz has confirmed the payment recorded in the Third Entry was made on 10 or 11 April 2008, and that the reason the remainder of the document relates to payments from 2009/2010 is because Mr. Farooq told him not to write in the diary following his suspension in April 2008 and only instructed Mr Aziz to resume in October 2009 when he (Mr. Farooq) retired.1440 Moreover, Mr. Aziz explained that he presented records of the Second and Third Payments to the Local Expert Group but these were mistakenly not included as Annexures to the final Affidavit. Respondent maintains that the fact that they were not appended in June 2015 does not mean that they did not exist at the time.1441\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 236 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), pp. 18-20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 236 *referring to* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1643 lines 17-18, p. 1658 lines 8-9, 16-19 and lines 16-17, p. 1659 lines 19-20, p. 1630 lines 14-18, p. 1670 lines 18-22, p. 1695 lines 4-6 and lines 11-15, p. 1707 lines 7-9 and lines 14-16 *and* p. 1708 lines 9-15.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 237 *referring to* Transcript (Day 7), p. 1621 line 18 to p. 1639 line 20.\n\n1131.\n\nUltimately, Respondent emphasizes that even if the Tribunal does not accept Pakistan's position with regard to surface rights, it should nevertheless find that Mr. Aziz's diaries are evidence of Claimant's corruption. Respondent argues that if these three payments were not bribes in respect of surface rights, they must have been paid for some other reason, a reason for which TCC has never advanced an explanation.1442\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253.\n\n**(f) Attributability of Col. Khan's Conduct**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1132.\n\nRespondent submits that Col. Khan's (as well as Mr. Dad's and Mr. Farooq's) bribes in respect of the Surface Rights Lease were paid for and on behalf of Claimant and that Claimant, through its CEOs and management, participated in or had knowledge of those corrupt acts.1443\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 356-371.\n\n1133.\n\nRespondent highlighted in its Application that in the circumstances it is clear that the acts of Mr. Dad, someone Claimant acknowledged as a \"*longtime TCC employee who has worked in recent years as an administrative officer in TCC's Quetta office,*\" should also be taken as the acts of TCC.1444\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 58-62 *referring to* Claimant's letter to the Respondent dated 25 August 2015.\n\n1134.\n\nAs to the attributability of Col. Khan's conduct, Respondent argues that while he may have done the bribing, it was Claimant that undoubtedly benefited from this and as such, Respondent maintains that Claimant must be held responsible for his conduct.1445\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 370.\n\n1135.\n\nFirstly, Respondent submits that by its own admission, Col. Khan was a representative of TCC, acting as a government liaison with the official title of Director of Public Affairs and Security.1446 Moreover, Respondent notes that the witness statements submitted by Respondent's witnesses clearly implicate him as the key conduit between TCC and the GOB officials for corrupt payments.1447\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 57 *referring to* Transcript Day 5/1350/10-20, **Exhibits CE-90** and **Ex CE-91** *and* **Ex RE-175**.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 57.\n\n1136.\n\nRespondent claims that Col. Khan was instructed by various TCC CEOs and Managers, including Mr. Flores, Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. James and Mr. Arndt, to make such bribes. Although denied by these witnesses, Respondent emphasizes the consistency of Col. Khan's testimony and the lack of credibility of Claimant's witnesses (specifically referring to Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Flores' involvement in the Chile trip, which self-evidently breached law and policy).1448\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 356-360 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, Transcript (Day 4), p. 957 lines 17-20 *and* p. 960 lines 1-4.\n\n1137.\n\nBesides what it considers to be convincing evidence that TCC officials knew of Col. Khan's corruption, Respondent argues that whether or not Claimant had direct knowledge, it is in any event responsible for it.1449 Respondent urges the Tribunal to determine this responsibility as a matter of civil law according to the doctrine of vicarious liability and not, as Claimant suggests, on the basis of corporate criminal liability.1450\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 361.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 362-366.\n\n1138.\n\nRespondent argues that in its Rejoinder, Claimant misrepresented Pakistan's explanation of the applicable test (submitted in the Reply).1451 Respondent explains that it applied the test for vicarious liability from *Mohamud v. WM Morrison Supermarkets plc* and concluded that: (i) there was a clear employment relationship between the wrongdoer and the company; and (ii) Col. Khan's wrongdoing was so closely connected with his employment (given that he was the key interface between Claimant and Government officials) that it would be just to hold Claimant liable.1452\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 362 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 207 *and* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\n1139.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's dismissal of the vicarious liability test by downplaying Col. Khan's role at TCC, saying that \"[h]*e bore no responsibility for TCC's mining activities, played no substantive role in the negotiation of the main agreements for the project, and was not tasked with obtaining any of the rights or approvals which Pakistan claims TCC obtained through bribery.*\" Respondent submits that he was in fact Claimant's most senior and highly paid employee in Pakistan, was responsible for working with Mr. Farooq on day-to-day matters such as permits and approvals and played a key role in securing the Surface Rights Lease.1453\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 365 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 208.\n\n1140.\n\nMoreover, relying on *Meridan Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission*, Respondent argues that Claimant's reliance on the \"*directing mind and will*\" standard is misplaced since the Tribunal must consider the purpose of Pakistan's anti-corruption legislation in order to determine whose acts, knowledge or state of mind can be attributed to the company. Ultimately, Respondent argues that if Col. Khan's knowledge does not count as knowledge of Claimant, the policy behind these laws would be defeated and companies like TCC would be able to avoid responsibility for corrupt acts simply by delegating the activity to a company not at such a senior level and not technically \"*directing the mind and will*\" of the company.1454\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 367-370 *citing to Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission* [1995] 2 A.C. 500 [**CA-298**].\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1141.\n\nClaimant relies on Mr. Livesey and Mr. James' testimonies to demonstrate that TCC had perfectly legitimate reasons to request the surface rights and such rights were obtained in compliance with a routine bureaucratic process (despite a minor clerical error which had no effect on the outcome).1455\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 417 *referring to* Livesey VII, \u00b6 29, James I, \u00b6 24 *and* James II, \u00b6 11; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 176-179.\n\n1142.\n\nClaimant submits that the application was in anticipation of a future mining venture and following an assessment of the future project's needs, Claimant's technical team concluded that this land was necessary for the successful mine operation.1456 Consequently, Claimant maintains that the decision to request surface rights over an area extending over the entire mine footprint ensured that structures would not be built in the way, impacting mine development. Claimant submits that the lease was to benefit the project; it was not a \"*land grab*\" as Respondent suggests.1457\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 416 *referring to* Livesey VI, \u00b6 31.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 417 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 304.\n\n1143.\n\nClaimant notes that there is no dispute that it paid the full price for the lease and that Claimant's original letter to the BDA contained a map showing the exact boundaries of the land and listed the correct area in both acres and square kilometers, both of which were attached to the Summary for the Chief Minister.1458 Claimant asserts that the only factual dispute is whether the error in the kilometer equivalent of the acreage amount was intentional. Claimant submits that Mr. Farooq's Summary referred to only \"*the surface right for additional area falling outside the granted area*\" (*i.e.,* the 147 sq. km outside EL-5) because this mirrored the MMDD Secretary's advice, who had ultimately misunderstood TCC's desire to obtain surface rights over the full 585 sq. km area \u2013 despite the enclosed map showing the actual area requested.1459 Claimant maintains that Ms. Boggs confirmed to the Tribunal that this was merely \"*one of those administrative corrections*\" which was made on 27 September 2008.1460\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 418.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 418 *referring to* James, \u00b6 26; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 179 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-320** *and* **RE-322**, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 179 *referring to* Transcript (Day 11), p. 2955 lines 18-19.\n\n1144.\n\nClaimant further disputes that Chief Minister Bhotani approved the lease due to his \"*close relationship with TCC*\" or that he was influenced by a gift. Claimant notes that Mr. James, who is alleged to have given him this gift, does not recall ever meeting Chief Minister Bhotani.1461\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 420 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 307, Farooq II, \u00b6 46 *and* James II, \u00b6 14.\n\n1145.\n\nClaimant considers that Respondent's witnesses fell apart on cross-examination, leaving no credible testimony that there were improper payments, and further questions Respondent's \"*convoluted conspiracy theories*\" as follows.1462\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 321(a), 180.\n\n1146.\n\nFirstly, Claimant questions why, if TCC's management were willing to offer bribes, they would not have secured the correct order from the outset rather than pursuing a complex plan requiring a variety of factors to successfully fall into place.1463 Such factors included Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan accurately predicting the death of Mr. Kasi, Mr. Farooq somehow convincing Chief Minister Raisani to replace Mr. Kasi with Mr. Mandokhail (despite Mr. Farooq having fallen out of Chief Minister Raisani's favor) and the payment of extensive bribes, only to end up paying the full amount for the lease.1464\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 181.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 181-183 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 41, Transcript (Day 3), p. 898 lines 13\u201315, Farooq II, \u00b6 48 and Transcript (Day 3), p. 898 line 16 to p. 899 line 3.\n\n1147.\n\nSecondly, Claimant questions Col. Khan's shifting testimony as to the source of the funds behind the bribes and the lack of evidence to substantiate his claim that they were paid from his own pocket.1465 Claimant submits that Col. Khan was in fact not at all involved in technical or commercial discussions surrounding the lease and thus perceives his testimony to be entirely unsupported.1466\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 181 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 17, 41-42, Transcript (Day 3), p. 893 line 15 to p. 897 line 7, p. 902 lines 9-13, p. 905 lines 1-20, p. 896 lines 14-21, p. 888 lines 14-22, Transcript (Day 4), p. 925 line 8 to p. 927 line 7, *and* p. 941 line 8 to p. 943 line 10.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 421 *referring to* James II, \u00b6 12 *and* Boggs IV, \u00b6 18.\n\n1148.\n\nClaimant argues that the central premise of Respondent's theory, *i.e*., that TCC had to wait until Mr. Mandokhail was appointed in September 2008 to correct the order, was proven to be false at the Paris Hearing.1467 In his original statement, Mr. Mandokhail testified that he was appointed in September 2008 but then \"*corrected*\" this to admit that he took over from Mr. Kasi in June 2008 (attributing the former date to a typing error).1468 Claimant notes that other witnesses then followed suit, amending their recollection of the date;1469 Col. Khan, however, had already given evidence stating that Claimant waited to request the amendment in September, \"*purposefully delaying until Mandokhail took office.*\"1470 In Claimant's view, this further strengthens the conclusion that Respondent's witnesses' early testimony on this point had been fabricated to connect the timing of TCC's September 2008 letter and Respondent's plot.1471\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 185 *referring to* Mandokhail, \u00b6 22, Mandokhail Corrected, \u00b6 8, 22 *and* Transcript (Day 5), p. 1450 lines 18\u201320.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 186 *referring to* Transcript (Day 3), p. 789 lines 1\u20133, p. 790 line 2 to p. 791 line 5.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 186 *referring to* Transcript (Day 3), p. 897 lines 16\u201319.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 186.\n\n1149.\n\nClaimant further dismisses Respondent's remaining surface rights allegations on the basis of a variety of witness testimony, which confirmed: (i) that the Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail was paid for using Mr. Farooq's share from the BDA kickback scheme and had nothing to do with TCC; (ii) the questionable existence of the alleged regular payments to Mr. Asmatullah, which if they did exist, had nothing to do with the surface rights application; and (iii) fabrication of the payment to Mr. Mandokhail for correcting the discrepancy in the First Order.1472\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 209-212 *referring to* Transcript (Day 3), p. 614 lines 1-3, p. 615 line 18 to p. 616 line 2, Transcript (Day 4), p. 1161 lines 6-15, Transcript (Day 5), p. 1351 lines 20-21, Transcript (Day 2), p. 564 lines 3-7, p. 576 lines 16-20, p. 581 lines 7-9, Transcript (Day 5), p. 1353 lines 5-16, **Exhibit RE-456**, p. 3, Khan II, \u00b6 42, Transcript (Day 3), p. 887 line 22 to p. 888 line 6.\n\n**(a) Mr. Aziz's Diaries**\n--------------------------\n\n1150.\n\nAs discussed in Section VII.C above in relation to the Standard and Burden of Proof, Claimant asserts that the Tribunal should draw inferences and make a positive finding of fabrication.1473\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 187.\n\n1151.\n\nFirstly, Claimant submits that Respondent failed to produce originals as requested and the copies that were produced showed various anomalies \u2013 they were incomplete, blurry and even indicated that the disputed entries could have been tacked on in an attempt to support Respondent's claims.1474\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 *referring to* Ruling on Claimant's Redfern Requests Nos. 20, 21, Claimant's Letter to the Tribunal dated 2 November 2016, at 1-8, Claimant's Letter to the Respondent dated 9 September 2016, at 1, Respondent's Letter to Claimant dated 14 September 2016, at 1, Claimant's Letter to the Respondent dated 23 September 2016, at 1 *and* **Exhibit CE-816.**\n\n1152.\n\nSecondly, Claimant submits that the failure to disclose that page 13 had been removed until: (i) eighteen months after it originally exhibited them; (ii) after representing that the copies produced were complete; and (iii) after Mr. Aziz's testimony (denying Claimant the ability to cross-examine him), casts further suspicion on the authenticity of the diaries.1475 Moreover, Claimant dismisses Mr. LaPorte's guesses as to the reasons for the page removal, arguing that the distinguishing features about the page suggest that it was originally the last page which was removed and recreated on page 14 with the concocted Asmatullah entry.1476 Ultimately, Claimant argues that far from explaining away the significance of page 13, the pattern of page removal strongly suggests that this page was removed \"*to ensure that* [its] *contents* [we] *re not disclosed.*\"1477\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 193-194.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 196 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), pp. 22-23.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 196 *referring to* Radley, \u00b6 40.\n\n1153.\n\nThirdly, Claimant submits that the use of different inks on page 12 for the First Entry suggests that Mr. Aziz added this later in support of Respondent's claims.1478 Additionally, Claimant argues that Respondent's attempt to explain why the Third Entry was recorded on a loose sheet of paper which otherwise reflected transactions from 2009-2010 (a year and a half after Mr. Aziz claims this bribe was paid) is unconvincing. Claimant submits that the suggestion that Mr. Farooq told Mr. Aziz to record this separately after his removal from office, is unconvincing given the timing of the firing and the alleged payments; if the Dad and Asmatullah entries were genuine, they should also have been recorded separately.1479\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 197.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 199-200, 321(b) *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 48, **Exhibits RE-229** *and* **RE-228**, pp. 12 and 13.\n\n1154.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that the record suggests that the pages purporting to document the Asmatullah and Khan transactions were not created in April 2008, but instead sometime in June 2015.1480 Claimant argues that not only were there inconsistencies between Mr. Aziz's testimony, other evidence on the record and the diaries itself, but Mr. Aziz's failure to append the corresponding pages with his affidavit before the Local Expert Group and the way in which he described the Asmatullah payment further suggests that the page did not exist at the time it was allegedly executed.1481\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206.\n\n1155.\n\nAccording to Claimant, these aforementioned issues demonstrate the fictional nature of the surface rights tale. In addition, it claims that inferences must be drawn from Respondent's intentional obstruction of any meaningful forensic examination.1482 Claimant submits that the expert testimony confirms that three types of examination could have proven fabrication, all of which Respondent refused to allow.1483 Accordingly, Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw the \"*strong inference*\" that this was because the documents \"*would not withstand forensic scrutiny*\" which would have demonstrated that they were fabricated in support of Respondent's bribery allegations in respect of the surface rights.1484\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 326.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 327-387.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 388-390 *citing to* *Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, dated 13 August 2009 [**RLA-228**], \u00b6 152 *and* IBA Rules, Art. 9(5).\n\n1156.\n\nClaimant submits that the purpose of the first of these three examination types, *i.e*., the ESDA indentation examination, is to detect the presence of impressions of writings from pages \"*superimposed over the ques***t***ioned material.*\"1485 Claimant maintains that Mr. Radley confirmed that if performed properly, it had the potential to reveal that extracts of the diaries submitted as AA-1 were fabricated;1486 however, the examination was executed far below professionally accepted standards.1487 Claimant submits that the quality of the test strips was so poor that Mr. LaPorte could not have confidence that the machine was at optimal functionality, and it used the 'TAD' method to take impressions leading to \"*a messy result*\"; Mr. LaPorte later admitted that another method may well have given better impressions.1488\n\nClaimant's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 328 *referring to* LaPorte, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 334.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 365.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 365-375 *referring to* Radley, \u00b6 64, Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 139 line 8 to p. 140 line 6, p. 104 lines 14-20, p. 145 line 9 *and* p. 147 lines 3-6.\n\n1157.\n\nClaimant also submits that Mr. LaPorte failed: (i) to take ESDA lifts on every page; (ii) to rerun any of the ESDA lifts despite raising weak impressions and the \"*red flag*\" that indicated that page 13 had been removed and its entries re-written onto page 14; and (iii) to take impressions on the reverse side of the questioned pages as well as taking digital photographs of the impressions.1489 Claimant alleges that these numerous failures demonstrate that Mr. LaPorte lacked the requisite qualification to carry out this examination.1490\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 365-375 *referring to* LaPorte, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 130 line 19 to p. 133 line 18, p. 141 lines 7-11, p. 150 lines 5-12, p. 148 line 7 to p. 149 line 1, p. 195 line 23, p. 146 lines 8-16 *and* p. 149 lines 10-19.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 374-375.\n\n1158.\n\nAs for the second examination type, *i.e*., the ESDA sequencing examination, Claimant submits, the examiner obtains lifts of all of the pages in question and determines the sequence of the writings. Claimant relies on Mr. Radley's testimony to explain that this could have challenged Mr. Aziz's testimony as to the order of these recordings in the diaries and the loose sheets submitted as AA-2;1491 however, the examination was not even attempted due to the poor clarity of the impressions obtained. Claimant suggests that this is unsurprising given the aforementioned inadequacies in the ESDA indentation examination.1492\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 335-338 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 133 lines 19-24, p. 134 lines 16-20 *and* p. 112 lines 15-20.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 376-377 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 51 lines 6-25, p. 155 lines 11-20 *and* p. 200 lines 10-14.\n\n1159.\n\nFinally, as regards the third examination type, *i.e.*, the ink-dating analysis, Claimant notes that Respondent consistently represented that this test could show whether a document \"*was written in the last 24 months.*\"1493 Claimant submits that Mr. LaPorte's trip to Lahore in December 2016 was within 20 months of when Claimant alleges the diaries to have been fabricated *i.e*., between April and June 2015. Thus, Claimant argues that such testing could have proven the falsity of Pakistan's allegations;1494 however, Mr. LaPorte states that he \"*was not granted permission*\" to perform this examination.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 340 *referring to* Respondent's 19 September 2016 Letter, p. 3, **Exhibit CE-880**, p. 9 *and* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 118 line 22 to p. 119 line 1.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 341.\n\n1160.\n\nGiven Mr. LaPorte's suggestion that this did not hinder his conclusions, Claimant considers that he attempted to whitewash the consequences of the NAB's refusal to allow him to conduct this examination. Claimant suggests that Mr. LaPorte incorrectly stated to the NAB that ink dating was a destructive technique possibly resulting in spoliation of the diaries, which it considers entirely belied by the evidence, (including the examination protocol describing it as \"*minimally invasive*\").1495\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 380 *referring to* Transcript (21 February 2017), p. 42 line 14 to p. 43 line 10, LaPorte, \u00b6 6 *and* **Ex. CE-889**, \u00b6 11, 13.\n\n1161.\n\nClaimant further questions why a \"*constitutionally independent public body*\" with \"*a duty to investigate potential breaches of Pakistani anti-corruption laws*\" would not use this examination to determine whether this evidence had been fabricated as alleged.1496\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 386 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 45 *and* Respondent's Application, \u00b6 74.\n\n**(b) Attributability of Col. Khan's Conduct**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1162.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's allegations would in any event fail because the alleged corrupt acts of Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan and Mr. Dad cannot be attributed to Claimant.1497 Claimant submits that far from \"*directing mind and will\"* of the company, Mr. Dad was a low-level TCC employee, who on Respondent's own case acted only at the behest of Mr. Farooq or Col. Khan.1498\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 213-222.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 222 *referring to* Dad I, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 *and* Farooq I, \u00b6 19.\n\n1163.\n\nAs to Col. Khan, Claimant firstly argues that contrary to Respondent's allegations, Claimant's CEOs have testified that they did not know of the bribes which Col. Khan described (and in fact repeatedly told him that he was not permitted to pay such bribes). Col. Khan expressly acknowledged in Paris that \"*Ms. Boggs, Peter Jezek, Tim Livesey, and David Moore\u2026wouldn't have known*\" about the payments he had previously claimed he was \"*open and transparent*\" with the CEOs about.1499\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 219-220 *referring to* Khan I, \u00b6 17, Khan II, \u00b6 4 *and* Transcript (Day 4), p. 960 lines 5-14.\n\n1164.\n\nClaimant perceives Respondent's argument to be as follows: Col. Khan's conduct must be attributable to Claimant and render it criminally liable under Pakistani law because TCC would necessarily be \"*vicariously liable in tort*\" for his actions.1500 Claimant argues that Respondent misrepresents the authorities it cites to support this argument.1501 Claimant asserts that as Respondent itself notes, the *mens rea* for the offence of corruption is intention, therefore contrary to Respondent's assertions, attribution cannot be established through applying principles of vicarious liability.1502\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 207-208 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 207.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 207-208 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 28 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 508-510.\n\n1165.\n\nMoreover, Claimant argues that even if Col. Khan's actions could be attributed to TCC for the purposes of criminal liability, Col. Khan would have to be the \"*directing mind and will*\" of the company.1503 Claimant maintains that Col. Khan participated in training about anti-bribery and corruption and admitted that his alleged acts of corruption were undertaken with full knowledge that he was acting contrary to company policy.1504 Claimant therefore urges the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that he cannot be considered as \"*directing mind and will*\" of TCC.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 208 *citing to Tesco Supermarkets v. Nattrass* [1972] A.C. 153 [**CA 299**], p. 180 (Lord Morris) *and Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission* [1995] 2 A.C. 500 [**CA 298**], p. 511 (Lord Hoffmann); Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 25-29.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216 *referring to* Transcript (Day 11), p. 2797 line 17 to p. 2798 line 1, p. 2799 lines 10\u201322, Transcript (Day 3), p. 827 lines 3\u201319, p. 828 lines 12\u201315, p. 829 lines 3\u20136 *and* p. 839 lines 10\u201317.\n\n1166.\n\nClaimant further maintains that even if the test for vicarious liability were at all relevant, it would still not be responsible for Col. Khan's conduct since he was not the person \"*upon whom TCC depended to drive the project forward*\" with no responsibility for mining activities or obtaining the rights and approvals which Respondent claims were obtained through bribery.1505\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 208 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 69.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n1167.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that in respect of the Surface Rights Lease, two orders were issued by the respective Senior Member of the Board of Revenue: (i) a first order dated 22 May 2008, signed by Mr. Muhammad Irfan Kasi, by which Claimant was granted \"*surface right of state land measuring (147 Sq. Kilometers) which comes 144568-0-0 acres*\";1506 and (ii) a second order dated 27 September 2008, signed by Mr. Mandokhail, by which a \"*partial modification/elaboration*\" was granted: \"*The measurement of land in Sq. Kilometers may be read as (585.05 Sq. Kilometers) instead of (147 Sq. Kilometers)*.\"1507 The Parties are in dispute as to whether the second order corrected an inadvertent mistake made in the first order, as alleged by Claimant, or whether both orders were part of a deliberate scheme made possible by several acts of correuption to obtain surface rights over the entire area in breach of the mining licensing regime, as claimed by Respondent.\n\n**Exhibit CE-43**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-66**.\n\n1168.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record shows that by letters of 4 and 21 February 2008, Claimant wrote to Mr. Farooq as Chairman of the BDA, asking him to request on behalf of the Joint Venture that surface rights be granted for a 99-year term over an area of 582,108 square kilometers or 143,841 acres as detailed in a map that was attached to both letters.1508 In its letter of 21 February 2008, Claimant stated that this land would be required \"*to develop infrastructure in and around the mine site for carrying out mining operations*\" and explained what kind of infrastructure it was referring to.1509\n\n**Exhibits CE-220** and **CE-221**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-221**.\n\n1169.\n\nIn response to a letter from Mr. Farooq dated 9 February 2008, which is not in the record, Mr. Ahmed, acting as Secretary of the MMDD, made reference in his letter of 16 February 2008 to the rights granted to exploration license holders under Rule 23(1)(b) and to mining lease holders under Rule 45(1)(b)(ii) of the 2002 BM Rules and added:\n\n\"*In this case, the surface right for an area of 582,106 Sq Km has been* [illegible] *mentioned in the map enclosed, the exploration area granted to TCC under* [illegible] *435.02 Sq Km thereby exceeding 147 Sq Km the surface right for additional area* [illegible] *Sq km falling outside the granted area needs to be acquired through the reveneue department as was done in case of Airstrip*.\"1510\n\n**Exhibit RE-320**.\n\n1170.\n\nIn a summary to the Chief Minister dated 6 March 2008, Mr. Farooq informed that Claimant required surface rights \"*to enable them to proceed further in the matter*\" and had therefore requested that the BDA approach the authorities concerned for the grant of such rights to the Joint Venture \"*for the subject area*.\" Mr. Farooq further reported that he had requested the surface rights from the MMDD but was infomed that the requested area exceeded the exploration area granted to Claimant by 147 square kilometers and that the surface rights for this additional area had to be acquired from the Revenue Department. Mr. Farooq therefore requested approval from the Chief Minister \"*for the grant of surface right for additional area of 147 Sq. km, as shown in the map attached with TCC's letter placed at (F/A) to the above Joint Venture*.\"1511 In an addition to the summary, Mr. Ahmed confirmed that the MMDD endorsed the proposal of Mr. Farooq. The summary was approved by the Chief Minister on 11 March 2008.1512\n\n**Exhibit RE-322**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit RE-322**, p. 2.\n\n1171.\n\nBy letter of 17 April 2008, Mr. Asmatullah, in his function as Secretary (Revenue) to the Board of Revenue, forwarded to the Executive District Officer (EDO) a copy of Claimant's letter of 4 February 2008 and the enclosed map and asked him to \"*please go through the contents of the letter and submit detailed report in the matter*.\"1513 On 9 May 2008, the EDO responded by sending his report along with enclosures from the Assistant Collector, who had reported, *inter alia*, that \"[t]*he measurement of proposed land was carried out by the revenue staff as per sketch/map, and its total area came to 144568 Acres*.\" On that basis, the EDO \"*recommended that the proposed land may kindly be allotted in favour of Reko-Dig* [sic] *Project under the land lease policy 2000. The price of land according to provailing* [sic] *market Rs: 5000/- Per Acre*.\"1514\n\n**Exhibit RE-323**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-326**, pp. 1, 7.\n\n1172.\n\nIn a notesheet of 15 May 2008, Mr. Asmatullah reported that the report from the EDO in response to his request had been received and that the \"*EDO (R) Chagai has stated that 144568 acres is available for Surface Right of Reko Diq Project at a rate of RS 5000,-per acre*.\" Mr. Asmatullah submitted the note \"*for perusal and order please*.\" On 22 May 2008, after the note had been signed by various officials, among them the \"*SMBR*\" with the instruction \"*Process*,\" Mr. Asmatullah added on a separate sheet: \"*Draft lease order is prepared and placed below for approval please*.\"1515\n\n**Exhibit RE-438**, pp. 35-36.\n\n1173.\n\nOn 22 May 2008, the Board of Revenue, acting through its Senior Member Mr. Kasi, issued a first order granting to Claimant surface rights over an area \"*measuring (147 Sq. Kilometers) which comes 144568-0-0 acres*\" at a rate of PAK 5,000 per acre. The surface rights were granted for a term of 30 years and on the condition that Claimant would pay the entire amount pertaining to the surface rights to the indicated bank account.1516\n\n**Exhibit CE-43**, p. 1.\n\n1174.\n\nBy letter of 28 May 2008, Claimant wrote to Mr. Asmatullah that it had deposited a first installment of PAK Rs. 272,000,000 in the designated bank account and would deposit the outstanding balance of PAK Rs. 450,840,000 \"*as per the agreement between the Board of Revenue and the Company.*\"1517 According to the receipts stamped by the National Bank of Pakistan, the two payments were made on 30 May and 4 June 2008, respectively.1518 Claimant thus made a total payment of PAK Rs. 722,840,000 in respect of its surface rights, equaling a rate of PAK Rs. 5,000 per acre for 144,568 acres. According to the Parties, the amount paid equalled USD 10-11 million.1519\n\n**Exhibit CE-469**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-43**, pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b6 185; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 311 lit. c.\n\n1175.\n\nIn a Joint Steering Committee meeting of 10 July 2008, which was chaired by Mr. Livesey, it was reported, *inter alia* : \"*Surface Rights to 147km\u00b2 awarded ($10.3m).*\"1520\n\n**Exhibit RE-331**, p. 2.\n\n1176.\n\nBy letter of 1 September 2008 addressed to Mr. Ahmed as Secretary of the MMDD, Claimant requested that Mr. Ahmed instruct the Board of Revenue to amend the order issued on 22 May 2008, stating that it contained a correct acreage figure but an incorrect conversion into square kilometers, which should have been 585.05 square kilometers. Claimant noted that \"*TCCP has paid for 144568-0-0 acres and therefore TCCP wants the Order to reflect the correct conversion of this acreage into sq. km*.\"1521\n\n**Exhibit CE-471**.\n\n1177.\n\nBy letter of 4 September 2008, Mr. Ahmed wrote to the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue and requested that a correction letter amending the square kilometers figure be issued to Claimant.1522\n\n**Exhibit CE-229**.\n\n1178.\n\nOn 27 September 2008, the Board of Revenue, acting through Mr. Mandokhail, who had taken office as Senior Member in June 2008, issued a second order \"[i]*n partial modification/elaboration*\" of the previous order by which surface rights had been granted over an area measuring 147 square kilometers. The second order provided for the following change: \"*The measurement of land in Sq. Kilometers may be read as (585.05 Sq. Kilometers) instead of (147 Sq. Kilometers).*\"1523\n\n**Exhibit CE-66**.\n\n1179.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to how it came about that Claimant ultimately obtained surface rights over the entire area sought, *i.e*., the exploration area and the additional area. According to Claimant, Claimant did so \"*through a straightforward process, in which an initial mistake by the Balochistan bureaucracy had no effect on the outcome*\" as Claimant was granted and paid for the correct amount of acres assessed by Balochistan's surveyors.1524 Respondent claims, on the other hand, that Claimant obtained the surface rights by a plan orchestrated by Mr. Farooq pursuant to which a first order would be issued granting the 147 square kilometers approved by the Chief Minister and, after having paid the amount for the full area it had sought, Claimant would request a correction of the order to reflect the 585 square kilometers on the basis that it had paid for them. Respondent claims that this was made possible through various acts of corruption intended \"*to circumvent the Balochistan mining licensing regime and secure far-reaching and unprecedented surface rights*\" over a vast area of land.1525\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 176.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 138-140.\n\n1180.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent claims that the following bribes were paid in connection with the Surface Rights Lease:1526\n\ni. PAK Rs. 800,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq on 10 or 11 April 2008 \"*to orchestrate obtaining surface rights for TCC in breach of the Balochistan mining licensing regime,*\" *i.e.*, \"*over 147 sq. km. in May 2008 and subsequently over 585 sq. km. in September 2008*\";\n\nii. PAK Rs. 600,000 by Mr. Bari Dad to Mr. Farooq on 14 April 2008 for the same purpose;\n\niii. PAK 200,000 by Mr. Aziz (on behalf of Mr. Farooq) to Mr. Asmatullah \u2013 out of the amount paid to Mr. Farooq by Mr. Dad \u2013 in the evening of 14 April 2008 in return for \"*refrain*[ing] *from raising any objections to Mr. Farooq's disregard for the Balochistan mining licensing regime, despite it being his duty to do so*\" and \"*assist*[ing] *Mr. Farooq with the plan to obtain surface rights over 585 sq. km. despite only having the CM approval for 147 sq. km.*\";\n\niv. PAK 400,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokhail in late September 2008, and an Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail's family \"*paid for in full by TCC (through Mr Farooq)*\" in return for his \"*assistance in issuing the order amending the area of the Surface Rights Lease*\";\n\nv. PAK 4,000 to 5,000 per month by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah for a period of six to seven months starting in December 2007 in return for \"*endorsing all decisions relating to TCC and refraining from raising objections*\" in relation to the airstrip lease and the Surface Rights Lease.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 139, 141-143; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 297; Asmatullah, \u00b6 7.\n\n1181.\n\nIn support of these allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Col. Khan, Mr. Dad, Mr. Farooq, Mr. Asmatullah and Mr. Aziz, which will be addressed in detail below. In addition, as regards the first three alleged payments, Respondent relies on the entries that Mr Aziz purportedly made into a diary he kept of payments made to and by Mr. Farooq. The evidentiary value of Mr. Aziz's diaries will also be discussed in detail below.\n\n1182.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, in addition to the five allegations summarized above, Respondent further considers that the Summary initiated by Mr. Farooq on 6 March 2008 was approved by Chief Minister Saleh Bhotani \"*at lightning speed*\" on 11 March 2008 and, according to Respondent, in contravention to the 1976 Business Ruless because the Board of Revenue received the Summary only after it had already been approved by the Chief Minister.1527 Respondent claims that this was due to \"*the close relationship between CM Bhotani and TCC (in particular Mr Luksic)*,\" which, according to Col. Khan, resulted from a hunting trip hosted by Mr. Bhotani in Jaunary 2007 before he became caretaker Chief Minister in November 2007.1528 Col. Khan described this trip as \"*one example of the culture of lavish gift buying for senior officials.*\" He also testified that soon after Mr. Bhotani's appointment, Mr. James provided him with a gift on behalf of Mr. Luksic and noted that Claimant would soon be requesting surface rights requiring his approval, in response to which Mr. Bhotani allegedly said that they did not need to worry and that he would see to it.1529\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140 lit. a; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 307.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 307; Khan II, \u00b6 37.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 38.\n\n1183.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Hargreaves, who participated in the hunting trip, denied in his second witness statement that any lavish gifts were given during the trip. He further stated that, contrary to Col. Khan's suggestion, this trip had not been arranged by Claimant or Antofagasta but rather arose out of a personal invitation of the then-Chief Minister Yousaf in December 2006 for Mr. Luksic and a number of Antofagasta and TCC representatives.1530\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50.\n\n1184.\n\nAs Respondent does not explicitly raise any allegation of corruption in connection with Chief Minister Bhotani's involvement, which was limited to the approval of surface rights over the additional area of 147 square kilometers, or the hunting trip in January 2007, the Tribunal will not address this aspect any further in the following assessment of the events surrounding the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n1185.\n\nRespondent claims that, as a result of the acts of corruption it does allege, Claimant \"*was able to subvert the mining licence regime \u2026, both to supplement and extend its rights under EL-5 to obtain what were essentially rights of ownership, to the exclusion of anyone else, over a vast area of prospective mining land until at least 2038*.\"1531 Specifically, Respondent argues that Claimant circumvented the 2002 BM Rules because under Pakistani law, the exploration license and surface rights are subject to different regimes and grant different rights to their holders, with the surface rights granted by the BOR lasting longer and granting more valuable rights than the exploration license granted by the MMDD, entitling its holder to full property use and owernship rights for a period of 30 years.1532\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 147.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 148-150.\n\n1186.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the added value of holding surface rights over the exploration area \u2013 in addition to the rights granted to an exploration license holder under the 2002 BM Rules \u2013 is undisputed between the Parties and was in fact one of the reasons for Claimant to apply for the Surface Rights Lease over the entire area instead of only the additional area not covered by Exploration License EL-5.\n\n1187.\n\nMr. Livesey explained in his fourth witness statement, which was submitted in the previous phase of this arbitration, that the Surface Rights Lease was needed for a larger area than the anticipated Mining Area because \"*the proposed project would require a number of civil constructions, including large waste rock dumps, tailings and freshwater dams, a power plant, and an accommodation village. The area necessary to accommodate these facilities exceeds the 100-square-kilometer maximum area permitted for a Mining Lease. Furthermore, certain of these facilities must be strategically placed to account for physical and environmental factors such as wind direction and topography, and must also lie outside a 500-meter buffer zone around the mine pit. As a result, TCC planned to construct a significant part of the infrastructure outside of the contemplated Mining Area, on non-mineralized land covered by the proposed surface lease area*.\"1533\n\nLivesey IV, \u00b6 43. *See also* Livesey II, \u00b6 13.\n\n1188.\n\nIn his seventh witness statement, which was submitted in the present phase of the arbitration, Mr. Livesey further stated that they \"*understood that, as in a number of other jurisdictions, surface rights in Balochistan were separate from the rights granted by the Mining Lease. TCC's application therefore requested surface rights that overlapped with the mining license area. This was not unusual. It is common practice in mining projects, where local laws allow, to apply for a land lease over the entire footprint of a mine. This ensures that other structures will not be built within the mine area in a way that could potentially delay or impact mine development*.\"1534\n\nLivesey VII, \u00b6 30.\n\n1189.\n\nMr. James also testified in his first witness statement on the reasons why Claimant requested surface rights over the entire area of land:\n\n\"*TCC had the choice of keeping the existing allocation of land, which would be costly and wasteful because TCC would have to build over the areas proposed for future mineral exploration and extraction and then have to tear down infrastructure and rebuild elsewhere, or it could seek to obtain surface rights for a greater area, so that facilities and infrastructure needed for mining operations could be constructed away from the planned mine pits. From the perspective of operational planning and avoiding unnecessary costs, it made sense to seek additional surface rights*.\"1535\n\nJames I, \u00b6 24.\n\n1190.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. James confirmed that it was decided based on a review of the site development plan and a discussion on the impact of seeking surface rights over a smaller area that the application should be filed for the entire area, *i.e*., including the Mining Lease Area.1536 As pointed out by Mr. James, this conclusion is reflected in the letters and enclosed map sent by Claimant to the BDA in February 2008.1537\n\nJames II, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibits CE-220** and **CE-221.**\n\n1191.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. James confirmed his understanding that Claimant needed surface rights over the entire area \"*in order to be able to have everything for unobstructed mining and a need not to reconstruct things throughout the life of the mine.*\"1538 Specifically in response to the suggestion that the right to build on the land within the exploration area was already within the scope of rights granted to an exploration license holder under Rule 23(1)(b) of the 2002 BM Rules, Mr. James testified:\n\n\"*We had two groups\u2014Colt, an Australian company; another group, Bintech\u2014who were endeavouring to expand into our area and be disruptive, and you have here* 'subject to the rights of the surface-holder,' *with the surface-holder, who is the Government of Pakistan at that point.*\n\n*These companies were approaching that government for various Surface Rights of their own and various other rights because they had adjacent ELs to our EL. So, in order to have the continuity of our property, we would have to have those Surface Rights secure. Otherwise, somebody, at some time, could come along and essentially acquire those Surface Rights over our area*.\"1539\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2715 line 19 to p. 2716 line 1.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2720 line 19 to p. 2721 line 10.\n\n1192.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his second witness statement that in meetings with Mr. Flores, Mr. Ahmed and Col. Khan, he expressed the view that \"*there was no need to obtain surface rights for such a huge area of land and* [he] *was unclear why they wanted to pay so much money for these rights* [and] *that it would be difficult to obtain such rights.*\"1540 Col. Khan confirmed in his second witness statement that he and Mr. Flores had met with Mr. Farooq and Mr. Ahmed \"*at least twice to gauge the possibility of obtaining*\" a surface rights lease over an area of almost 600 square kilometers. He stated that while \"*Mr Farooq's initial reaction was that it would not be possible to procure surface rights over such a huge area*,\" he and Mr. Flores were able to convince him that it could be done.1541 Mr. Mandokhail stated in his witness statement that while he was not involved in the early events regarding the surface rights, he understood from his discussions with Mr. Farooq at the time that \"*TCC wanted to secure the surface rights to the whole area (582 square kilometres) in order to prevent any other developers gaining access of being granted rights*.\"1542\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 44.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 36.\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6 19.\n\n1193.\n\nMr. Farooq further testified that when he received Claimant's request in February 2008, he \"*was unclear how to process this request.*\" Following his exchange with Mr. Ahmed, he initiated a summary to the Chief Minister even though, according to Mr. Farooq, this would have been for the Board of Revenue to do, but he \"*knew that TCC had no right to ask for surface rights over auch a large area of land, particularly as exploration work was still going on*,\" as a result of which he \"*purposefully referred to the area outside of TCC's exploration license*.\"1543 Mr. Asmatullah confirmed in his witness statement that the summary for the Chief Minister should have been issued by the BOR and stated that he refrained from raising any objection at the time.1544\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 12.\n\n1194.\n\nMr. Farooq also stated that Col. Khan told him shortly after the Chief Minister's approval that Claimant actually needed to obtain surface rights over the full area, as a result of which he \"*discussed with Mr Asmatullah that we would first get an order passed mentioning the 147 sq. km. that had been approved, as well as the correct acreage figure. After payment was made for the full area, we would then get an amendment to the order for the full 585 sq.km*.\"1545 Col. Khan confirmed that after the approval of the smaller area, he discussed the need for obtaining surface rights over the entire area with Mr. Farooq and that \"*provided that it got done* \u2026 [he] *didn't mind what it cost*.\"1546\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 47.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 40.\n\n1195.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Asmatullah confirmed that he was consulted by Mr. Farooq after the approval in March and stated that he \"*advised him what we could do is if we write the correct kilometers, and we put down the incorrect acreage, of 585, and make an order, if we get stuck anywhere of if there's an issue, and we would say that that this has been a miscalculation. It's a mistake. And if not, then tell Sher Khan to have this contact the office after three or four months to correct this, so the issue gets cooled down by then, and it disappears from people's minds*.\"1547 When asked whether he was suggesting that he had actually come up with the idea of the discrepancy, which he had not mentioned in his witness statement, Mr. Asmatullah stated that he \"*was the revenue expert, Farooq did not know what to make make or what to do, and* [he] *was a partner of Farooq in this plan*.\" He added that \"[f]*rom the beginning until the end,* [he had] *been involved in this*.\"1548\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1368 lines 9-17.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1371 line 18 to p. 1372 line 9.\n\n1196.\n\nMr. Farooq stated that while he was temporarily suspended from the office by the new Chief Minister on 16 April 2008 until his re-appointment as Chairman of the BDA on 16 December 2008, he \"*stayed informed of on-going matters and in contact with Mr Asmatullah*\" and was aware that \"*TCC managed to get a Board of Revenue order passed on 22 May 2008*\" and that he saw that order before it was circulated.1549 Mr. Asmatullah testified that this order had been drafted by Mr. Farooq, although being signed by Mr. Kasi, and that Mr. Farooq \"*was deliberately trying to create this discrepancy* [between square kilometers and acres] *to be used in TCC's favour down the line,*\" which he, Mr. Asmatullah, was aware of but did not object to at the time.1550 Mr. Mandokhail also confirmed that he understood \"*based on* [his] *discussions with Mr. Farooq at the time, that this discrepancy was deliberate and that Mr Farooq ultimately intended to secure for TCC surface rights for the full 585 sq. km*.\"1551 Col. Khan testified that he was advised by Mr. Farooq at the time that Claimant \"*should immediately pay the required surface rights fees as per the acres stated in the Order (and that TCC could then have the Order amended to correct the sq. km. figure)*.\" Col. Khan added that Mr. James quickly approved this payment and knew that they would later apply for an amendment of the order.1552 Mr. Asmatullah that \"[t]*his was preplanne* d\" and added that, \"[i]*f this was done with clean hands they would have clarified this ambiguity before depositing the money*.\"1553\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 48.\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 12.\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6 21.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 40.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1369 lines 2-5.\n\n1197.\n\nAccording to Mr. Farooq, when the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue had to be replaced, he requested with the Chief Secretary that Mr. Mandokhail be appointed and when that had occurred in August 2008, he \"*told him that TCC had helped him with his appointment and the he needed to their job of amending the surface rights order*,\" which he did following a discussion of Claimant's amendment request with Mr. Farooq and Mr. Asmatullah.1554 Mr. Mandokhail confirmed that Mr. Farooq spoke to him before his appointment \"[i]*n September 2008, when Mr Kasi retired*,\" telling him that he would be asked to issue an amended order and that Claimant had already paid for the full 585 square kilometers. Mr. Mandokhail further testified that Mr. Farooq threatened him that he would lose his job and be transferred out of Quetta and lose his official residence, which Mr. Mandokhail described as \"*extremely important*\" to him and led him to sign the amended order.1555 Col. Khan stated that \"[a]*lthough Mr Farooq had been temporarily removed as Chairman of the BDA, he continued to manage the amendment process through his contacts at the Board of Revenue (Sheikh Asmatullah) and kept me informed by phone*.\" He added that \"*Mr Farooq suggested waiting until Mr Mandokhail took office as the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue before seeking the amendment*.\"1556\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6 22.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 41.\n\n1198.\n\nDuring the hearing, Col. Khan confirmed that the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue is appointed by the Chief Minister, *i.e*., in that case by Chief Minister Raisani, who had suspended Mr. Farooq from the office in April 2008. Col. Khan also confirmed that the plan to have the order amended depended on Mr. Mandokhail taking office, which in turn depended on Mr. Kasi, who held the office of Senior Member at the time of the original order, retiring or dying or otherwise leaving office.1557\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 898 line 5 to p. 899 line 14.\n\n1199.\n\nIn a corrigendum to Mr. Mandokhail's witness statement, which was submitted by Respondent shortly before he gave oral testimony to the Tribunal, Mr. Mandokhail corrected that he was appointed as Senior Member of the Board of Revenue not in September 2008 but already in June 2008.1558 During the hearing, Mr. Mandokhail stated that this was a \"*typing error*\" but did not provide a clear answer to the question as to when he had come to realize this mistake.1559 He confirmed having had a conversation with Mr. Farooq about the amendment of the surface rights order and that he could do so only once he was appointed Senior Member of the Board of Revenue but could not provide any clarification as to when this conversation had taken place.1560\n\nCorrected Mandokhail, \u00b6 22.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1450 lines 18-20 and p. 1456 line 21 to p. 1460 line 6.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 141450 line 21 to p. 1456 line 20.\n\n1200.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Farooq also testified that he remembered having recommended Mr. Mandokhail in June 2008 but confirmed that at the time he submitted his second witness statement, he thought it was in August.1561 Mr. Farooq denied having any knowledge about the corrigendum submitted by Mr. Mandokhail.1562 When asked at what point he had recalled that the appointment was in June, he answered: \"*Some days back, I was recalling, maybe June. It was not August. It was June because I am a retired man. I don't know the exact dates. I come to know when I made recommendations for him. But the dates may be different. Because I was not in \u2026 the office, I don't have the exact dates with me*.\"1563\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 789 line 19 to p. 790 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 790 lines 6-9.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 790 lines 13-18.\n\n1201.\n\nWhen Mr. James was confronted with the testimony of Respondent's witnesses during the hearing, in particular the evidence of Col. Khan that he had been told by Mr. James that the first order was not sufficient and that he should ensure that they would get surface rights over the entire area, Mr. James stated that \"*that's not what happened at all*.\" According to Mr. James, the events following the issuance of the first order were as follows:\n\n\"*I had Asad Rehman call the Mines Department. Asad Rehman came back and said, Boss, we got everything that we asked for, the whole 585,000, whatever the number is, of acres.*\n\n*And the only thing that counts in terms of payment of the fee to the Government of Balochistan is acres. There is no such thing as a Surface Rights payment based on square kilometers. They still use acres. And I invite you to talk to the Project team about that because I think Balochistan, when it writes these things, was getting a lot of clerical errors trying to keep track because they were going between units. And it makes no sense in a country on metric to be doing things in both sets of units.*\"1564\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2746 line 14 to p. 2747 line 6.\n\n1202.\n\nMr. James confirmed that when he received the order of 22 May 2008, he noticed a discrepancy between the two figures and therefore instructed his engineer to put the question to the MMDD: \"*There's an inconsistency here. What were we granted?*\" and received the answer that \"*Well, the acres, is the controlling number. The acres is what you pay,*\" which is why the engineer came back to him saying that \"*They have made a clerical error or something over there. It makes no sense. We have to pay the acres*.\" Mr. James agreed that this happened within \"*an incredibly short time*\" due to an upcoming Board meeting at which he would have to explain \"*if it was a bigger error or a bigger problem*.\"1565 He also confirmed that he decided to proceed with the payment based on the acreage figure based on \"*a verbal conversation with the MMDD, and a verbal conversation with* [his] *engineer*\" because he considered that \"*that was the expectation of the Department of Revenue. It was time to pay the bill*.\"1566 When asked whether he intended to have the error clarified, Mr. James testified that it was his intention \"*to have that done*\" upon his return from the Board meeting but that he would not have done so himself because it was \"*a minor thing*\" and he would have asked \"*the same engineer draft up and do it*.\" He added that he never did return to Pakistan in his role as CEO after that Board meeting.1567\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2750 line 12 to p. 2751 line 13.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2754 lines 1-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2754 lines 12-21.\n\n1203.\n\nIn response to a question from the President of the Tribunal whether, after having personally filed an application in February 2008 for 585 square kilometers and then receiving an order over 147 square kilometers, one could be surprised that he did not react to the first order *vis-\u00e0-vis* the authority that issued the order, Mr. James answered:\n\n\"*I did react to it. I had the engineer call to find out what we had actually been awarded. If he had come back and he had said we had only been awarded 147 square kilometers, obviously, I would have had a lot of reaction. The fact that he came back with a number that the technical people said--because it is slightly less than what was requested, the fact that he came back with that number and that's the only number that counts in terms of making payments to the Government of Balochistan and the Government of Balochistan confirmed that, and then the Revenue Department took that money, which was sent into tranches, that, in itself, was a confirmation of it.*\n\n*So, I felt comfortable with it. And I would not have done much. I certainly would not have gotten myself involved in trying to negotiate a correction on it because the process that we were putting in place was to have the technical people who were responsible for things to deal with the technical people who were responsible for things. We were moving to a full company with people who had expertise*.\"1568\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2756 line 3 to p. 2757 line 3.\n\n1204.\n\nWhen Ms. Boggs, who took office as Claimant's CEO in June 2008, was asked about the discrepancy and her request in September 2008 to correct it, she answered that \"*it would have been one of those administrative corrections that needed to get done*.\" She did not recall why it had taken three months to file the request for correction but nevertheless considered it a \"*routine question*.\"1569 In response to the question, whether she recalled having spoken to Mr. James on this issue, she answered:\n\n\"*I don't recall if we--if I had a specific discussion with him about the discrepancy. I'm sure that I would have had discussions with Mr. Livesey around the difference. And I would have--I would have said, look, we need to get it corrected. Even though the acreage was correct and the amount paid--that we paid for the surface lease was--reflected that acreage, we needed to get the Order corrected just so there wouldn't be any confusion going forward*.\"1570\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2955 line 17 to p. 2956 line 4.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2956 lines 9-17.\n\n1205.\n\nMr. Livesey also confirmed that he stood by his previous testimony that \"*the alleged discrepancy in the surface rights lease \u2026 was merely an error the Board of Revenue corrected in September 2008*,\" which he considered confirmed by the amount paid by Claimant calculated based on the acreage figure.1571 He further confirmed that this \"*was consistent with* [his] *understanding of how the BOR calculated its assessments, in which the default unit of measurement was acreage*,\" which meant that the reference to 147 square kilometers was a \"*clerical or conversion error*.\"1572\n\nLivesey VI, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\nLivesey VII, \u00b6 27.\n\n1206.\n\nOn the basis of both the documentary evidence and the witness testimony, the Tribunal considers it clear that Claimant was seeking surface rights over the entire area of 582 square kilometers and openly communicated this request to the BDA and the MMDD both in meetings and its written correspondence of 4 and 21 February 2008. While it appears that both Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Farooq initially took the position that surface rights should be granted only over the additional area that was not covered by Exploration License EL-5 and on that basis prepared the summary for the Chief Minister in early March 2008 in which Mr. Farooq requested approval for the additional area, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Claimant had any involvement in this development. To the contrary, it appears undisputed that once the Chief Minister had approved the additional area, Claimant made clear to Mr. Farooq as representative of the BDA that it was in fact seeking surface rights over the entire area.\n\n1207.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not entirely clear from the record whether in his order of 22 May 2008, the then-Senior Member of the Board of Revenue, Mr. Kasi, who was not involved in the alleged plan, actually intended to grant surface rights over: (i) the additional area of 147 square kilometers as approved by the Chief Minister in March 2008; or (ii) the entire area of 144,568 acres as it had been measured and determined in the report sent by the EDO in April 2008. As confirmed by Mr. Asmatullah during the hearing, Mr. Kasi signed both the Summary approved by the Chief Minister in March and a note sheet prepared by Mr. Asmatullah in which he reported about the result of the EDO's assessment and requested that \"*Draft Lease Order is prepared and placed below for approval, please.*\"1573\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1364 line 18 to p. 1367 line 3.\n\n1208.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Mr. Farooq \"*orchestrated*\" an elaborate plan to deliberately have a first order granting surface rights over the additional area in square kilometers (but providing for the correct figure in acres) and then later ask for a correction to obtain the entire area in square kilometers after having paid the full lease fee. Apart from the fact that Mr. Farooq and Mr. Asmatullah gave deviating testimony as to who came up with this alleged plan, there is also a discrepancy as to Mr. Farooq's involvement after he became suspended in April 2008. In particular, Mr. Asmatullah testified that the first order was actually drafted by Mr. Farooq, while Mr. Farooq himself stated that he only saw the order before it was being circulated and that it was TCC that \"*managed*\" to obtain this order.\n\n1209.\n\nCol. Khan further testified that an essential step of the plan was for Mr. Mandokhail to become Senior Member of the Board of Revenue before a correction request could be filed. Apart from the remarkable fact that the alleged plan involved that Mr. Kasi would retire or die shortly after issuing the first order, the Tribunal takes note of the inconsistencies in the testimony of Respondent's witnesses concerning the timing of Mr. Mandokhail's taking office. While Mr. Farooq initially testified that he recommended Mr. Mandokhail in August 2008 and Mr. Mandokhail stated that he took office in September 2008, this testimony was corrected shortly before and during the hearing where both witnesses emphasized that they now remembered that Mr. Mandokhail had actually taken office already in June 2008. Neither witness provided a convincing explanation as to why and how they realized in preparation for the hearing that the alleged discussion between them had actually taken place in June, *i.e*., three months before Claimant filed its correction request.\n\n1210.\n\nAs to the decision taken by Mr. James to pay the full amount based on the (correct) acreage figure in the first order, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by Mr. James' explanation that he considered the arguable ambiguity of the order fully clarified based on a verbal confirmation received by one of his engineers that the acreage figure was the relevant one \u2013 something that he remembered only during the hearing. The Tribunal recognizes that the applicable lease rate was to be determined at PAK Rs. 5,000 per acre, *i.e*., the lease fee was to be calculated based on the acreage figure. Nevertheless, taking into account that the order also referred to the square kilometers figure approved by the Chief Minister, which was limited to the additional area, the Tribunal considers that there would have been reason to obtain a written clarification on the scope of the order before actually making the payment.\n\n1211.\n\nThis does not establish, however, that Claimant had been involved in a plan orchestrated by Mr. Farooq and Mr. Asmatullah in order to circumvent the MMDD's authority in respect of the rights over the exploration area. In any event, the Tribunal also notes Mr. James' explanation that the reason for making the payment quickly, and without obtaining a written clarification first, was an upcoming Board meeting at which he was to report about the project. As Mr. James ceased to be CEO very shortly after this Board meeting, this may also be the reason why it took three months before the new incoming CEO, Ms. Boggs, filed a request for correction on 1 September 2008. Respondent explicitly accepts that Ms. Boggs, who considered this an \"*administrative correction*\" that needed to be made, was not involved in the alleged plan regarding the Surface Rights Lease.1574\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146.\n\n1212.\n\nAs to Respondent's argument that Claimant intended to circumvent the mining licensing regime and the jurisdiction of the MMDD by applying for surface rights over the entire area, *i.e*., including the area covered by Exploration License EL-5, the Tribunal notes that Claimant's correction request of 1 September 2008 was actually addressed to Mr. Ahmed, the Secretary of the MMDD, who then approached the Board of Revenue and asked for the correction to be made. In the Tribunal's view, it it is not entirely clear from Mr. Ahmed's 16 February 2008 letter, in which he advised that surface rights should be sought only over the additional area, whether at the time time he considered it impermissible or simply unnecessary to obtain surface rights over the area covered by EL-5. However, there is in any event no indication that Mr. Ahmed had any objections to the correction requested by Claimant in September 2008 and he actually endorsed it *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Board of Revenue. Consequently, it does not appear as if there was any intention to circumvent the competence of the MMDD.\n\n1213.\n\nIn addition, the reasons explained by Mr. Livesey and Mr. James for requesting surface rights over the entire area appear plausible and legitimate to the Tribunal. In particular, the rights granted to an exploration license holder under Rule 23(1)(b) of the 2002 BM Rules are expressly \"*subject to the rights of the surface holder*,\" which according to Mr. James were with the Government of Pakistan at the time but which could have been granted to a third company at any time. In light of the considerable amounts that Claimant was planning to invest into the mine development at Reko Diq, the Tribunal considers it legitimate and in fact prudent for Claimant to ensure that no third party could intervene and jeopardize the project by acquiring surface rights over the exploration area and, more importantly, what was to become the Mining Lease Area \u2013 regardless of whether there was a concrete indication of any third company intending to do so at the time.\n\n1214.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent has therefore failed to establish that Claimant was involved in a plan to obtain the Surface Rights Lease over the full area of 582 square kilometers via a deliberately incorrect first order and in contravention of the applicable law. Taking into account its findings above, the Tribunal will now turn to the examination of the individual allegations of improper payments made in the context of the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n**(a) The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 800,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1215.\n\nIn support of its first allegation raised in this regard, *i.e*., a payment of PAK Rs. 800,000 allegedly made by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq on 10 or 11 April 2008, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Col. Khan, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Aziz as well as on an entry in Mr. Aziz's diary that allegedly records the making of this payment.\n\n1216.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his first witness statement that he \"*began paying Mr Farooq to get things done*\" following a discussion he had had with Mr. Flores \"*in 2006 or 2007*\" in which Mr. Flores had told him that he \"*needed to manage things on* [his] *own without implicating TCC*\" and that he was being paid \"*handsomely*.\" Col. Khan stated that Mr. Farooq used the money he paid to him \"*to pay off other department officials, particularly the Board of Revenue (BOR) from whom* [TCC was] *seeking different leases and concessions (in contradiction to Balochistan rules and legislation)*.\"1575 While making particular reference to cash payments made to Mr. Mandokhail in connection with the Surface Rights,1576 Col. Khan did not mention any individual payments or specific amounts that he paid to Mr. Farooq.\n\nKhan I, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n*Cf*. Khan I, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 33.\n\n1217.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Col. Khan testified in considerably more detail about the Surface Rights Lease and stated in that context that he \"*remember*[ed] *making a large payment (PAK Rs. 800,000) to Mr Farooq in his office in April 2008 after the Surface Rights Lease had been obtained. This was to thank him for his efforts and to cover his expenses incurred in connection with the surface rights (such as bribes he himself had paid to get things done)*.\"1577\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 42.\n\n1218.\n\nDuring the hearing, Col. Khan was pointed to the statement he had made under oath before the magistrate on 4 February 2016.1578 He confirmed that he had not withheld any information at that time but had told the magistrate \"[e]*verything that* [he] *remembered*\"; he further confirmed that the statement did not make any reference to a payment being made in connection with surface rights.1579 Col. Khan also confirmed that the payment of PAK 800,000 he was referring to in his second witness statement was \"*the single largest payment that* [he had] *claimed in any of* [his] *Witness Statements*\" but that this specific payment was not mentioned in any of his three previous statements, *i.e*., his first witness statement, the Section 161 statement before the NAB and the Section 164 statement before the magistrate. Col. Khan made reference to his Section 161 statement and recalled to have stated there that he had paid \"*more than 2 million Pakistani rupees and bribes to all these people*\" but acknowledged that he had not mentioned any specific payment made to Mr. Farooq.1580\n\n**Exhibit RE-468**.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 854 line 18 to p. 855 line 22.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 868 line 14 to p. 871 line 18. It appears from the Section 161 statement that Col. Khan in fact referred to payments made to Mr. Mandokhail in stating that \"[w]*hile I don't remember exact amounts and occasions and no record is held with me, I can confirm that somewhere around Rs. 2 Millions were paid by me to him as bribe through cash*.\" **Exhibit RE-456**, p. 3. During the hearing, Col. Khan stated, however, that \"*what* [he] *meant was here that 2 million rupees were the money that* [he] *paid to these bureaucrats,*\" *i.e*., including to Mr. Farooq. Transcript (Day 3), p. 884 line 12 to p. 886 line 20.\n\n1219.\n\nIn response to the question at what point the had remembered that he had paid precisely PAK Rs. 800,000 to Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan testified that he \"*deliberately started looking for things*\" and that \"*slowly, slowly, slowly, it came to* [him]\" and he \"*checked up as to how much* [he] *had paid*.\" He confirmed that he did not have any records of the payments to Mr. Farooq and Mr. Mandokhail but was referring to a search of his own memory and \"*small chits*\" that he had. Col. Khan further stated that he also reviewed his own bank statements and \"*from all the information* [he] *gathered \u2026 made a rough estimate as to how much money* [he] *had spent*.\"1581\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 887 line 16 to p. 889 line 21.\n\n1220.\n\nWhen pointed to his written testimony that he had made the payment to Mr. Farooq in April 2008 \"*after the Surface Rights Lease had been obtained*\" and the fact that the first order was issued only on 22 May 2008, Col. Khan answered that \"*these dates will confuse you. But we had one subject, and the subject was Surface Rights. And for the Surface Rights, I had paid this money to Mr. Farooq.*\" He added that \"*the Surface Rights \u2026 were not done in one goal. It was \u2026 in bits and pieces, and we had problems \u2026 in many places. So, it took a long time for the Surface Righs to be finally approved*.\"1582 Col. Khan confirmed his testimony that he had made the payment to Mr. Farooq to correct the erroneous order providing for 147 square kilometers but added that \"[i]*t was not only correction. There was so many other things. Mr. Farooq had told me that he had to pay so many people in the process. \u2026 He was naming so many people. And I said \u2026 I fully understand this was very, very important. It has to be done. And it has to be corrected all for \u2026 this lump-sum money was paid to Mr. Farooq by me*.\"1583 Col. Khan maintained that this was \"*all deliberate by Mr. Farooq*\" and when again pointed to the timing of the alleged payment and the order containing the error that needed to be corrected, considered that \"[t]*here is no need for the counsel to get involved in the dates. It is one subject, Surface Rights. The Surface Rights order \u2026 has just come out. And when it's come out, it has come out wrong. And for that---my CEO was not very happy. He said:* 'It has to be corrected.'\"1584\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 872 lines 18-21 and p. 873 lines 14-18.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 876 line 9 to p. 877 line 20.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 880 line 3 to p. 882 line 2\n\n1221.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that he helped Claimant to obtain, *inter alia*, \"[t]*he grant of a surface rights lease in violation of the Balochistan land lease policy and laid down procedures*\" and specifically recalled having made payments and gifts to Mr. Mandokhail and Asmatullah in this context.1585 He further stated:\n\n\"*All payments made to me by TCC were made by Col. Khan or Bari Dad. I received numerous amounts of money from them, ranging from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 to larger payments of Rs. 600,000 to Rs. 800,000. These payments were always received in cash at my office at the BDA. I would often hand this money over to my personal secretary, to redistribute to other GOB officials for their assistance with TCC related tasks. Mr Aziz knew that I received illegal payments from TCC and he saw me receive such payments, and I was quite open with him about the fact that TCC were bribing me. I am aware that Mr Aziz kept a record of payments going and out.*\"1586\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 20. *See also* \u00b6 28.\n\n1222.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq stated that when Mr. Nawab Aslam Raisani became Chief Minister in April 2008, he knew that he would be removed from his post as Chairman of the BDA, as was in fact the case on 16 April 2008. Mr. Farooq further testified:\n\n\"*I remember asking Col. Sher Khan for money shortly before I was replaced, including for the work I was doing on surface rights, as I wanted to get as much money as I could before CM Raisani removed me from office, and I told him that I needed money to pay other people*.\"1587\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 48.\n\n1223.\n\nIn a footnote to this statement, Mr. Farooq further noted that the two payments of PAK Rs. 800,000 and 600,000 referred to by Mr. Aziz in his witness statement corresponded to the payments he had mentioned in his first witness statement and added: \"*I think they did relate to the surface rights issue.*\"1588\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 48 (note 51).\n\n1224.\n\nMr. Aziz testified in his witness statement that he had personally witnessed two payments made to Mr. Farooq by representatives of Claimant in April 2008, both of which he recorded in his diary.1589 As to the first payment allegedly made by Col Khan, he stated:\n\n\"*The first was made by Col. Sher Khan on 10 or 11 April 2008. On that day, I recall Col. Sher Khan coming to my office and asking whether Mr Farooq was available. I said he was, and Col. Sher Khan went into his office. A few minutes later, Mr Farooq called me and asked me to step into his office. Col. Sher Khan was still sitting in there. Mr Farooq handed me PAK Rs 800,000 and said this had been given to him by Col. Sher Khan on behalf of TCC. The money was in a white envelope with TCC printed on the front*.\"1590\n\nAziz, \u00b6 15.\n\nAziz, \u00b6 16.\n\n1225.\n\nAccording to Mr. Aziz, he recorded this payment in his diary, which was appended to his witness statement.1591 In fact, as clarified by Mr. Aziz during the hearing,1592 the alleged payment from Col Khan is not recorded in his bound diary but on a loose sheet of paper bearing the title \"*RECEIPT*,\" in which the fifth entry records a cash payment from Col. Sher Khan of PAK Rs. 800,000. The entries on this paper, which was also appended to Mr. Aziz's witness statement, bear no date; the entries on the opposite page bearing the title \"*DISTRIBUTION*\" date from November and December 2009 as well as January 2010.1593\n\nAziz, \u00b6 19, *referring to* **Exhibit AA-1**.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1608 line 11 and p. 1649 line 12-13 to p. 2650 line 20.\n\n**Exhibit AA-2**.\n\n1226.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Aziz was confronted with his affidavit of 3 June 2015, which recorded his statement before the Group of Experts in which he also referred to a payment of \"*Rs. 8 lacs (Rs. 8,00,000)*\" received by Mr. Farooq from Col. Khan with the relevant extract of his diary attached as Annexure A.1594 When pointed to the fact that Annexure A was the bound diary that did not record any payment from Col. Khan, Mr. Aziz confirmed that the alleged payment from Col. Khan was recorded \"*on a separate sheet*\" that he had shown and provided to the Group of Experts and, while not being able to find it within the annexures, maintained that this sheet had been attached when he signed the affidavit.1595 When asked about further details provided in his witness statement such as the date and circumstances of the payment that were not recorded in his affidavit, Mr. Aziz answered that he \"*did tell them the details*\" but that \"[t]*hey didn't mention it*.\"1596\n\n**Exhibit RE-441**, \u00b6 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), pp. 1630-1635.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1646 line 1 to p. 1648 line 9.\n\n1227.\n\nMr. Aziz confirmed that the dates recorded on the \"*DISTRIBUTION*\" page of the loose sheet of paper were all in the range from 5 November 2009 to 20 January 2010 but maintained with regard to the entries on the \"*RECEIPT*\" page that, albeit undated, \"[a]*ll these payments are 10th and 11th April* [2008]*, those two days*.\" Mr. Aziz added that he remembered this \"*because after that Mr. Farooq was suspended, and he told me write this on a loose paper, and to write nothing in the diary from now onwards*.\"1597 He maintained that the payment \"*was made in those days*\" and that he was told to keep the money with him but that \"*the date* [he] *forgot to write it at the time*.\"1598\n\nTranscript (Day 7), pp. 1653-1658.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1659 lines 14-22.\n\n1228.\n\nBased on the evidence above, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Col. Khan made a payment of PAK Rs. 800,000 to Mr. Farooq in connection with the Surface Rights Lease. First of all, the Tribunal notes that neither Col. Khan nor Mr. Farooq referred to this specific payment in their first witness statements even though particularly Col. Khan recognized that this was the single largest payment he claims to have made on Claimant's behalf. The Tribunal also does not consider it plausible that while Col. Khan stated before the NAB that he did not remember any specific amounts or occasions, he came to realize at some point before his second witness statement, without any written records that would have been provided to the Tribunal, that he made this specific payment to Mr. Farooq.\n\n1229.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that Col. Khan's testimony regarding the timing of the payment also raises doubts when considering the purpose for which it was allegedly made. Apart from the fact that Col. Khan initially testified that he made the payment after the Surface Rights Lease had been obtained to thank Mr. Farooq for his efforts, Col. Khan repeatedly stated throughout his cross-examination that the dominant purpose of the payment was to have the erroneous reference to 147 square kilometers in the first order corrected. While it appears that Col. Khan took the stance that that this error was known before the order was even issued because this was all part of a deliberate plan made by Mr. Farooq, the Tribunal already found above that the existence of a plan to first obtain an erroneous order and then have it corrected has not been established.\n\n1230.\n\nAs for Mr. Aziz's testimony, the Tribunal notes that his oral testimony is closely related to the entry on the loose sheet of paper that he allegedly made of the payment. In this regard, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that the relevant entry, as well as the other entries on the \"*RECEIPT*\" page, are all undated, with the entries of the opposite page bearing dates from one and a half years later. The Tribunal is also not convinced by Mr. Aziz's explanation that he was told to make this entry on a loose sheet of paper and to not record anything further for the time period until November 2009 because Mr. Farooq was suspended from the office a few days later. If Mr. Aziz's recollection that the payment was made on 10 or 11 April 2008 were correct, the payment would have been made and recorded before Mr. Farooq was suspended on 16 April 2008. On his own testimony, Mr. Aziz further continued to make entries into his bound diary until 14 April 2008, as will be discussed in the context of the alleged payment made by Mr. Dad below. The Tribunal also agrees with Claimant that it does not appear plausible to the Tribunal that Mr. Farooq asked Mr. Aziz to hold on to the amount of money recorded on the \"*RECEIPT*\" page, *i.e*., a total of PAK Rs. 3,430,000, for one and a half years before distributing it to the recipients recorded on the \"*DISTRIBUTION*\" page.1599 Such distributions would then also be entirely unrelated to the surface rights, which contradicts Col. Khan's testimony that Mr. Farooq was naming many people to him who had requested to be paid in connection with the surface rights. Finally, it is undisputed that Mr. Farooq was suspended from the office only until December 2008, which does not accord with Mr. Aziz's testimony that the absence of any further entries until November 2009 is explained by Mr. Farooq's suspension. By contrast, it has to be noted that, as pointed out by Claimant and confirmed by Mr. Farooq, he retired from his post as Chairman of the BDA in 2009 and had already left Pakistan and moved to Saudi Arabia by the time the dated entries on the \"*DISTRIBUTION*\" page were made.1600\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's LaPorte Response, \u00b6 16.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's LaPorte Response, \u00b6 16; Farooq II, \u00b6 8.\n\n1231.\n\nIn light of the inconsistencies identified above, the Tribunal considers that the undated entry on the loose sheet of paper cannot establish Respondent's allegation that a payment was made by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq on 10 or 11 April 2008. This conclusion is reinforced by the unexplained absence of the sheet of paper from the annexures to the affidavit recording Mr. Aziz's testimony before the Group of Experts in early June 2015.\n\n1232.\n\nAs to the entry itself, the Tribunal notes that there has been considerable debate between the Parties, and forensic experts were consulted to examine and evaluate the authenticity of the relevant entries both in the bound diary and on the loose sheet of paper. Respondent's forensic expert Mr. Gerald M. LaPorte examined, *inter alia*, the sheet of paper recording the alleged payment by Col. Khan to Farooq, which he labelled \"**Q2B**\".1601 With regard to this document, Mr. LaPorte stated in his Conclusions:\n\n\"*The forensic examination of Q2B did not reveal any evidence of alteration, insertion, obliteration, or other irregularities that may be present when documents are altered or fraudulently produced. The general condition of the paper is consistent with a piece of paper that is at least seven years old \u2013 and not something that was created in the last 1-2 years. The questioned entry reflecting a payment from Col. Sher Khan in the amount of 800,000 is positioned in the middle of several other entries and there are no scientific findings from the examinations in this case to suggest that the entry was inserted at a much later date. The results from the microscopic and VSC 6000 examination indicate the presence of a single black non-ballpoint ink (e.g., fiber tip type pen) that was used for all of the entries on the same side of the page. An additional blue ballpoint ink was used in the margin.*\"1602\n\nAppendix 4 to LaPorte Report; **Exhibit RE-537**.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 59.\n\n1233.\n\nBased on his examination, Mr. LaPorte concluded that \"*there is no evidence to indicate that the Aziz Journal or Q2B, including the three questioned entries, were created at any other time than on or around their purported dates.*\"1603 Respondent concludes from Mr. LaPorte's findings on Q2B and the bound diary that \"*there is no basis to question the authenticity of the Aziz Diaries*.\"1604\n\nLa Porte Report, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondent's LaPorte Submission, \u00b6 32.\n\n1234.\n\nClaimant's expert Mr. Robert Radley, who for reasons discussed in detail above, did not examine the bound diary or the loose sheet of paper himself but commented on the examination by Mr. LaPorte, stated that \"*when Mr LaPorte's evidence is assessed in an objective fashion, it can be seen that there is no demonstrable evidence available to show whether the documents in question are genuinely dated or whether they have been created at a later time.*\"1605 As for the conclusion drawn by Mr. LaPorte, Mr. Radley stated:\n\n\"*In my opinion, from the work that Mr LaPorte has conducted, it is **equally** accurate to conclude that there is no evidence that the entries **were** created on or around their purported dates. The fact is, in my opinion, that either of these contrasting statements is equally likely. Consequently, overall, the evidence derived from Mr LaPorte's examination has to be regarded as inconclusive*.\"1606\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6 2.\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6 4 (emphasis in original).\n\n1235.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Mr. LaPorte's examination of Q2B, Mr. Radley opined that \"[t]*here is no evidence whatsoever to shed light on the crucial point of when the writing of the entire* 'Receipt' *portion of Q2B was written*.\" While identifying certain points that, in Mr. Radley's view, Mr. LaPorte failed to address in his report, Mr. Radley concluded that \"[t]*he truth of the matter, with respect to this document, could only be established by dating the ink but as the ink is from a fibre tip pen, there is no scientific technique available which will facilitate this and consequently, clearly identify the documents as being genuine or fraudulently produced*.\"1607 Claimant further contends that Mr. LaPorte's findings \"*are consistent with fabrication*,\" arguing that he considered it possible that only one pen was used, *i.e*., \"*precisely what one would expect if the entire page was written fraudulently*,\" but also that more than one ink was used, which Claimant considers \"*consistent with the theory that AA-2 was altered to add the Col. Khan entry using a different ink*.\"1608\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.\n\nClaimant's LaPorte Response, \u00b6 35.\n\n1236.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal recalls that it does not need to make a positive finding of fabrication in relation to the questioned entries or Mr. Aziz's diaries as a whole. For the reasons set out in detail in the context of the applicable standard and burden of proof above, the Tribunal cannot draw an inference from the absence of evidence of forgery that the relevant entries must be authentic. Therefore, and while the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant's submission that Mr. LaPorte's findings are consistent with or even indicate that the sheet of paper recording the alleged payment made by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq was prepared or altered in a fraudulent manner, it cannot be inferred from the absence of such indication that it has positive evidentiary value supporting Respondent's allegation. In particular, as has become clear from the Parties' experts' reports, Mr. LaPorte's examination established neither that the entries were created on or around their purported dates nor that that they were created on any other dates. In addition, and by contrast to the entries in the bound diary that will be discussed further below, the entries on Q2B were written using a fibre tip pen, as a result of which an ink dating analysis would not have been able to yield a conclusive result that the page or at least the relevant entry was written within the last two years.\n\n1237.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's findings regarding the witness evidence presented by Respondent, in particular the testimony of Mr. Aziz as regards the circumstances in which the loose sheet of paper was allegedly created, the Tribunal considers that the evidentiary value of the undated entry is very limited and, in any event, does not suffice to consider it established that a payment was made by Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq in connection with the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n1238.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether such payment would have been attributable to Claimant even though Col. Khan claims to have made improper payments out of his own pocket and to have been asked to manage things on his own \"*without implicating TCC*.\"1609 In this regard, it suffices to note that in his written testimony, Col. Khan stated that he was reimbursed by Claimant for this and other improper payments via salary increases and regular bonuses, in particular the bonus of close to PAK Rs. 1 million that he was granted by Ms. Boggs in December 2008 after having informed her of the developments regarding the Surface Rights Lease.1610 During the hearing, however, Col. Khan stated that he \"*did not talk to Cassie Boggs*\" about the \"*Surface Right thing*.\"1611 Respondent also \"*accepts that the evidence does not indicate that Ms Boggs, who requested the correction in September 2008, was involved in the Surface Rights scheme*.\"1612\n\n*Cf*.

In support of this allegation, Respondent relies on the witness evidence of Mr. Dad, Col. Khan, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Aziz as well as on a further entry in Mr. Aziz's diary that allegedly records the making of this payment.\n\n1240.\n\nMr. Dad testified in his first witness statement that \"[b]*eginning in early 2007, Col. Sher Khan asked* [him] *to deliver certain packages*\" to, *inter alia*, Mr. Farooq, which he received personally from Col. Khan. Mr. Dad stated that he remembered delivering \"*three or four of these packages directly to Mr Farooq on the instructions of Col. Sher Khan*,\" the first one \"*in early 2007*\" and the final one \"*in early 2008*.\" As regards the latter, Mr. Dad testified that he went to Mr. Farooq's office at the BDA and that \"*Mr Farooq called in Abdul Aziz \u2013 his personal secretary \u2013 and handed him the package* [Mr. Dad] *had just delivered and told him to note it down*.\"1613\n\nDad I, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\n1241.\n\nMr. Dad added that Mr. Farooq did not open the packages he delivered in front of him, but he \"*strongly suspected that they contained bundles of Rupees, and* [that his] *deliveries were the means of TCC making cash payments to Mr Farooq*.\" Mr. Dad stated that \"[e]*ach of the envelopes Col. Sher Khan gave* [him] *had a number on the front (for example, 3, 4, and 6) and the contents were approximately the size of a corresponding bundle of Rupees for 3, 4 and 6 lac (PAK Rs. 100,000)*.\" In response to his question what he was delivering and why, Col. Khan told him \"*not to ask more questions*.\"1614\n\nDad I, \u00b6 11.\n\n1242.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Dad confirmed that the final delivery he made to Mr. Farooq was in March or April 2008.1615 When asked how he remembered the timing of his deliveries to Mr. Farooq, Mr. Dad confirmed that he \"*did not write any dates on any calendar*\" but stated that \"*these things were not that* [he] *could forget, and these were the special packages that* [Col. Khan] *had given to* [him]\" and that he \"*was a bit worried about them later on*.\"1616 Mr. Dad further confirmed that when he asked Col. Khan about the packages, he was told not to ask questions and just do what he was asked to do. At the same time, Mr. Dad testified that Col. Khan also told him that he was the \"*most trusted and trustworthy person*\" in Quetta, which is why there was \"*no reason for* [him] *to forget these*.\"1617\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1201 lines 2-14.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1203 lines 8-16.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1203 line 17 to p. 1204 line 11.\n\n1243.\n\nIn response to the question whether he rememberd any other significant events in his work life during 2007, Mr. Dad stated that he remembered \"*a lot of things*\" but could not identify any specific event. He maintained that he remembered the packages he delivered on behalf of Col. Khan \"*very well*\" but confirmed that he did not know why or for which purpose they were delivered.1618\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1204 line 12 to p. 1206 line 1.\n\n1244.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Dad further testified: \"*I definitely knew that there used to be cash money in that, and through me, this cash money was being delivered to government officials.*\" When confronted with his written testimony that Col. Khan had not told him what was in the package, he stated: \"*He did not tell me verbally, but I felt it myself, and I judged myself that there was money in it*.\"1619 Mr. Dad added that he judged this from the different sizes of the packages, which in his view corresponded to the numbers on the \"*brown colored envelopes*\" indicating how many \"*lacs*\" each package contained.1620 He further confirmed that none of the envelopes he delivered in 2007 or 2008 was opened in front of him and that he never saw their contents but only judged that they must have contained money \"[b]*ecause of the size of them*.\"1621\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1206 line 18 to p. 1208 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1208 line 7 to p. 1209 line 19.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1213 line 20 to p. 1214 line 9.\n\n1245.\n\nCol. Khan confirmed in his first witness statement that he \"*used Bari Dad to make some of these payments* [to Mr. Farooq] *as, where possible,* [he] *didn't like to personally hand over bribes.*\"1622 He did not make reference to any specific payments that he allegedly made via Mr. Dad. In his second witness statement, Col. Khan referred to a payment that he claimed to have personally made to Mr. Farooq,1623 but did not mention any payment made through Mr. Dad.\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 14.\n\n*Cf*. Khan II, \u00b6 42.\n\n1246.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that he received \"*numerous amounts of money*\" from Col. Khan and Mr. Dad, \"*ranging from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 to larger payments of Rs. 600,000 to Rs. 800,000*,\" which he \"*always received in cash at* [his] *office at the BDA.*\" Mr. Farooq added that he often handed these amounts to Mr. Aziz \"*to redistribute to other GOB officials for their assistance with TCC related tasks.*\" Mr. Farooq further stated that he was \"*aware that Mr Aziz kept a record payments going in and out.*\"1624\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 20.\n\n1247.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq testified that he remembered asking Col. Khan for money shortly before he was suspended from the office on 16 April 2008, but did not specifically refer to Mr. Dad or a payment delivered by him. In a footnote, he made reference to two payments referred to by Mr. Aziz, including the relevant payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 by Mr. Dad, and confirmed that he was referring to these payments in his first witness statement. He added: \"*I think they did relate to the surface rights issue.*\"1625\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 48 (with note 51).\n\n1248.\n\nMr. Aziz testified that he \"*personally witnessed two particular payments made to Mr Farooq by representatives of TCC*,\" both of which were made in April 2008 and recorded in his diary.1626 As to the second payment, he stated:\n\n\"*The second payment was made to Mr Farooq by Bari Daad of TCC on 14 April* [2008]1627. *I was in my office and Mr Daad came to see me. He asked for Mr Farooq but I told him he was in a meeting. Mr Daad waited for him to finish. Roughly 15 minutes later, Mr Farooq finished his meeting and called Mr Daad and I into his office. Mr Bari Daad then gave Mr Farooq PAK Rs 600,000. This money was also in a white envelope with TCC printed on the front. Mr Farooq gave me the envelope*.\"1628\n\nAziz, \u00b6 15.\n\nIn his witness statement, it is stated that the payment was made on 14 April 2014. During the hearing, Mr. Aziz corrected that it should read 14 April 2008. Transcript (Day 7), p. 1608 lines 9-10. There was no dispute with regard to this correction.\n\nAziz, \u00b6 17.\n\n1249.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Aziz was pointed to his affidavit of 3 June 2015, recording his testimony before the Group of Experts, in which reference was made to a payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 from Mr. Dad but no further detail was given.1629 Mr. Aziz stated that he \"*had told them the detail, the manner in which the payment was made*\" but could not explain why only the amount was recorded in the affidavit.1630\n\n**Exhibit RE-441**.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1626 lines 12-21 and p. 1661 line 20 to p. 1662 line 21.\n\n1250.\n\nMr. Aziz further confirmed that he had recorded the payment he was testifying about in his diary. The relevant entry bears the date of 14 April 2008 and records a payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 in \"*Cash received from Bari Dad of TCC*.\"1631 When pointed to the fact that, except for this entry, he had not recorded the affiliation of any payor, Mr. Aziz explained that the other payors on this page were \"*all contractors, except for Bari Dad*\" and confirmed that his intention had been to ensure that Mr. Dad's affiliation was clear to any reader.1632\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1662 line 22 to p. 1663 line 13, *reading from* **Exhibit AA-1**, p. 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1663 line 14 to p. 1665 line 18.\n\n1251.\n\nMr. Aziz further stated that, contrary to the other pages of the diary, the page recording Mr. Dad's payment (as well as a second page recording a payment to Mr. Asmatullah, which will be discussed further below) did not contain any cross-outs because he had first written the entries on rough paper and then entered them into the diary. Mr. Aziz also confirmed that there was no balance as on other pages of the diary and explained that this was because \"*after this, Mr. Farooq was suspended. So, I gave him this account statement, and whatever money was left, I gave that to him as well, so the matter ended.*\"1633 Mr. Aziz testified that he showed the diary to Mr. Farooq at the time but did not have the time to balance the figures but just gave to him \"*whatever money is left*.\"1634\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1668 line 11 to p. 1669 line 18.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1671 lines 1-12.\n\n1252.\n\nBased on the witness evidence presented by Respondent, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Mr. Dad delivered a payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 on behalf of Col. Khan to Mr. Farooq. Mr. Dad confirmed that he had never seen the contents of any of the packages that he allegedly delivered for Col. Khan but simply judged for himself that the packages contained bundles of Rupees. In addition, the Tribunal is not convinced by his explanation as to how he remembered specifically when he delivered the packages and in particular the final one he claimed to have made \"*in early 2008*.\" Col. Khan, who testified in detail about a payment he claims to have made himself to Mr. Farooq on 10 or 11 April 2008, did not mention any additional payment made for the same purposes via Mr. Dad only a few days later. Mr. Farooq himself appeared not to remember any specific payments and only vaguely confirmed Mr. Aziz's testimony regarding the payment from Mr. Dad, stating that he thought that it related to the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n1253.\n\nFinally, Mr. Aziz could not explain why the details about the payment recorded in his witness statement that he allegedly provided to the Group of Experts were not recorded in his affidavit. In addition, the Tribunal notes that while both Mr. Dad and Mr. Aziz claim to remember remarkable details about an event that occurred several years ago, these details do not fully accord with one another. While Mr. Dad testified during the hearing that the packages he delivered were in regular brown, legal size envelopes, Mr. Aziz stated in his witness statement that the money was contained in a white envelope with TCC printed on the front. Mr. Dad further stated that Mr. Aziz was called into the office after he had delivered the package to Mr. Farooq; Mr. Aziz, on the other hand, stated that they were called in together and that Mr. Dad gave the envelope to Mr. Farooq in his presence.\n\n1254.\n\nAs for Mr. Aziz's testimony regarding the entry into his diary, the Tribunal again considers that his evidence is closely related to the debate between the Parties and the forensic experts regarding the authenticity of the relevant entry into the bound diary. Respondent's expert Mr. LaPorte, who also examined the bound diary to which he referred as the \"**Aziz Journal**,\" concluded with regard to the Aziz Journal:\n\n\"*Based on my professional experience, established scientific principles, and full consideration of the findings from the forensic examination, there is no evidence to indicate that the Aziz Journal or the two questioned entries were created at any time other than on or around their purported dates. I did not find any inconsistencies in the Aziz Journal to indicate there was any evidence of alteration, insertion, obliteration, or other irregularities that may be present when documents are altered or fraudulently produced. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that the questioned entries were created at a much later date than April 2008*.\"1635\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 58.\n\n1255.\n\nMr. LaPorte reached this conclusion despite detecting certain peculiarities that the Tribunal considers noteworthy in this context. First, Mr. LaPorte's examination showed that at least two different ballpoint inks were used to write the entries on page 12 recording the payment made by Mr. Dad and, remarkably, that the questioned entry was the first one on the page for which the second type of ink had been used. This second type of ink was further the same ink used for the entries on page 14, including the second questioned entry in the diary regarding a payment made to Mr. Asmatullah, which will be discussed further below.1636 Mr. LaPorte nevertheless concluded that \"*there is no evidence to indicate that the questioned entry was placed in the Aziz Journal on any date other than 14 April 2008.*\"1637\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 40 with Table 2.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 43.\n\n1256.\n\nSecond, Mr. LaPorte's examination revealed that the diary originally contained a page 13 between page 12 recording the payment made by Mr. Dad and page 14 recording the payment made to Mr. Asmatullah but that page 13 had been removed at some point in time.1638 Moreover, Mr. LaPorte reported that an ESDA examination of page 14 revealed that it \"*did bear portions of written entries that did not originate from any of the previous pages*\" and concluded that \"*it appear*[ed] *that the* 'unsourced' *entries originated from the page 13 that was removed.*\" Mr. LaPorte further noted that some of these \"*unsourced*\" entries were consistent with the entries on page 14 and assumed that the entries were originally written on page 13, which \"*was then removed, and the writer re-wrote the entries onto page 14*.\"1639 Mr. LaPorte noted that \"*there can be various reasons for certain actions and habits when people create diaries or record a series of written transactions, including to make corrections*,\" and concluded that \"*it would be mere speculation for* [him] *to offer a reasons for why and when page 13 was removed*.\"1640\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 37 with Table 1.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 48.\n\nLaPorte Report, \u00b6 50.\n\n1257.\n\nAs noted above, Respondent concludes from Mr. LaPorte's findings that \"*there is no basis to question the authenticity of the Aziz Diaries*\" and that the Tribunal \"*should place due weight on them when considering the merits of Pakistan's case of corruption.*\"1641\n\nRespondent's LaPorte Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n1258.\n\nAs also noted above, Claimant's expert Mr. Radley questioned Mr. LaPorte's conclusion, arguing that it was \"***equally** accurate to conclude that there is no evidence that the entries **were** created on or around their purported dates*\" and that Mr. LaPorte's examination thus had resulted in evidence that had to be considered inconclusive.1642 In respect of the entries into the Aziz Journal, Mr. Radley further opined that Mr. LaPorte could have performed additional examinations that \"*may have shed light on the way in which these documents have been created*.\"1643\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6 4 (emphasis in original).\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6 5.\n\n1259.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the missing page 13, Mr. Radley noted that Mr. LaPorte had presented \"*no facts one way or the other about the reasons why the page was removed and* [did] *not mention having taken any steps to investigate that question*.\" Mr. Radley stated that, in his view, the removal \"*could potentially be highly significant*\" and, in his experience, raised a \"*red flag*\" warranting \"*detailed examination and consideration*.\" In particular, Mr. Radley raised the question why the page had been removed as opposed to crossing out and re-writing entries as it had been done on other pages of the diary. He added that the impressions from this torn out page on page 14 should have been scrutinized carefully as they might have indicated the reason of why the page was removed.1644 In this regard, Mr. Radley considered the two ESDA runs performed by Mr. LaPorte under the same conditions \"*far from exhaustive testing*.\" He also noted that from the photographs presented by Mr. LaPorte of the impressions he found on page 14, he, Mr. Radley, was not able to decipher any significant details of the impressions, which Mr. LaPorte had not described in his report.1645\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 79.\n\n1260.\n\nAs for the use of two different inks on page 12 and the use of the same ink for both questioned entries on page 12 and page 14, respectively, Mr. Radley noted that he had \"*no way of assessing the truth of the matter*,\" but considered that the use of the same ink \"*for a series of entries with different dates, including all of the questioned entries which appear on two different pages could also suggest that those entries were created at a later point in time and therefore not on the purported date*.\"1646\n\nRadley Report, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\n1261.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the missing page 13 \"*suggests a series of fabrication hypotheses*\" and the use of two different inks on pages 12 and 14 \"*is consistent with the possibility that the Dad entry and all of the entries that follow it were not written on their purported dates.*\" In Claimant's view, Mr. LaPorte's evidence thus \"*actually impeaches the relevant pages of the Aziz Diaries and would support a decision that they be disregarded as evidence*.\"1647\n\nClaimant's LaPorte Response, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 36.\n\n1262.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal again recalls that it does not need to make a positive finding of fabrication and that the Tribunal cannot draw an inference from the absence of evidence of forgery that the relevant entries must be authentic. In the Tribunal's view, the peculiarities detected by Mr. LaPorte are remarkable, in particular that: (i) page 13 was removed between the two pages 12 and 14 containing the relevant entries and some of the entries that now also appear on page 14 to have been initially written on page 13; and (ii) two different inks were used on page 12, with the relevant entry recording the alleged payment by Mr. Dad being the first entry for which a different ink was used, and the second ink was also used for the entries on page 14, including the second relevant entry, even though a page was removed in between and some of the entries bear a different date.\n\n1263.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that Mr. Radley has raised various other criticisms of Mr. LaPorte's report, the Tribunal considers the above sufficient to conclude that the evidentiary value of the Aziz Journal is again very limited. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, as discussed above, the entries into the Aziz Journal were made with a type of ink on which an ink-dating analysis could have been performed but was ultimately prevented by the NAB even though: (i) Mr. LaPorte was originally retained by Respondent for this precise purpose; (i) an ink-dating analysis could have yielded a positive result of fabrication, *i.e*., that the entries were created in 2015 rather than in 2008.\n\n1264.\n\nThe Tribunal does not wish to go as far as making a finding that the the entry on page 12 of the Aziz Journal of an alleged cash payment of PAK Rs. 600,000 made by Mr. Dad to Mr. Farooq on 14 April 2008 was fabricated. However, in the circumstances, the entry also cannot serve to establish Respondent's allegation that this payment was actually made. Taking into account both the inconsistencies identified in the witness evidence and the peculiarities detected in connection with the relevant entry in the Aziz Journal, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has failed to establish that the alleged act of corruption occurred.\n\n**(c) The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 200,000 by Mr. Aziz to Mr. Asmatullah**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1265.\n\nRespondent's third allegation concerns an alleged payment of PAK Rs. 200,000 by Mr. Aziz on behalf of Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah on 14 April 2008 in return for his assistance with obtaining the surface rights for Claimant and for not objecting to Farooq's disregard for the Balochistan mining regime. This payment was allegedly made out of the amount received by Mr. Farooq from Mr. Dad on the same day. The Tribunal concluded in the previous section that Respondent has failed to establish that this payment by Mr. Dad was actually made. While this may indicate a similar finding with regard to the alleged passing on of part of the paid amount to Mr. Asmatullah, the Tribunal will nevertheless consider the evidence presented by Respondent in this regard, *i.e*., the witness evidence of Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan, Mr. Asmatullah and Mr. Aziz as well as the entry recording the alleged payment in the diary kept by Mr. Aziz. As for the latter, the Tribunal will again take into account the findings it has made regarding the evidentiary value of the Aziz Journal above.\n\n1266.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that he \"*specifically recall*[ed] *paying money on behalf of TCC to Mr Mandokhail and Sheikh Asmatullah at the Board of Revenue to secure approval of TCC's surface rights lease*.\"1648 In his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq added that he contacted Mr. Asmatullah after Col. Khan had told him that TCC needed surface rights over the entire area rather than the 147 square kilometers approved by the Chief Minister on 11 March 2008 and that he discussed with Mr. Asmatullah the plan to secure a first order granting the approved 147 square kilometers and the correct acreage figure and later get an amendment for the full 585 square kilometers once payment for the full area had been made. Mr. Farooq specified that \"[f]*or his efforts, Mr Asmatullah was paid Rs. 200,000*.\"1649 He did not specifically mention any involvement of Mr. Aziz.\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6 18, *confirmed in* Farooq II, \u00b6 43.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 47.\n\n1267.\n\nCol. Khan confirmed in his first witness statement that he \"*was aware that Mr Farooq made payments to Sheikh Asmatullah for his assistance with the project, including in relation to the airstrip and aurface rights*.\"1650 During the hearing, he confirmed that Mr. Farooq had told him about paying money to Mr. Asmatullah and that such money had come from him, Col. Khan.1651 When confronted with the fact that, while referring to this payment in his witness statement of 30 September 2015, he had not told the NAB about it in his statement of 21 September 2015, Col. Khan stated that \"[m]*ost probably it slipped \u2026 out of my mind, but definitely Farooq had told me that he had made some money.*\"1652\n\nKhan I, \u00b6 33.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 850 line 9 to p. 852 line 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 853 line 8 to p. 854 line 4.\n\n1268.\n\nMr. Asmatullah testified in his witness statement that he refrained from raising any objection to the Summary for the Chief Minister issued by Mr. Farooq or to the first order, despite being aware of the discrepancy between the square kilometers and acreage figures and Mr. Farooq's plan to use this discrepancy \"*in TCC's favour further down the line*.\"1653 Mr. Asmatullah further stated:\n\n\"*For this, I was paid PAK Rs 200,000. I was given the money directly by Mr Abdul Aziz who was the personal assistant to Mr Farooq. He told me that the money was from Col. Sher Khan (TCC), via Mr Farooq*.\"1654\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 12.\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 13.\n\n1269.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Asmatullah stated that he was aware of a record of payments being kept by Mr. Aziz but maintained that he had not been shown such record by the Group of Experts. He added that he had decided to confess about taking the payment before finding out that Mr. Aziz \"*had already told everything.*\"1655 Mr. Asmatullah further confirmed that while Mr. Farooq \"*prepared the summary and got approval for it*\" with what Mr. Asmatullah considered \"*speed* [that] *needs to be noted*,\" he, Mr. Asmatullah, \"*got the money for the Order*\" that Mr. Kasi had kept on hold \"*for up to two months*.\"1656 In response to the question whether he was paid around the time the order was issued, Mr. Asmatullah stated: \"*No. I asked him for the money in April. I said that it was my son's birthday; I said I need some money. He said he'd ask Sher Khan for money. His PS brought the money, and he said Sher Khan has sent it*.\"1657\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1331 line 17 to p. 1333 line 1.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1360 line 10 to p. 1362 line 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1372 line 18 to p. 1373 line 2.\n\n1270.\n\nMr. Aziz testified in his witness statement that he made the payment to Mr. Asmatullah out of the amount received from Mr. Dad on 14 April 2008. He stated:\n\n\"*When Mr Daad left, Mr Farooq asked me to give PAK Rs 200,000 of that money just received from TCC to Sheikh Asmatullah. He told me that this payment was in return for Sheikh Asmatullah's help in getting land allotted to TCC. I went to Sheikh Asmatullah's house the same day to give him this money, and told him that it was from Mr Farooq on behalf of TCC*.\"1658\n\nAziz, \u00b6 18.\n\n1271.\n\nIn the very last entry of his bound diary, Mr. Aziz recorded a payment of PAK Rs. 200,000 to Sheikh Asmatullah BoR on 15 April 2008.1659 During the hearing, Mr. Aziz stated that he made the payment on the evening of the days on which it was given to Mr. Farooq but entered it into his diary on the next day.1660\n\n**Exhibit AA-1**, p. 13.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1665 lines 6-12 and p. 1674 lines 1-19.\n\n1272.\n\nMr. Aziz further stated that while he did not have his diary with him when he first met with the Group of Experts, he told them about the payment he made to Mr. Asmatullah because he \"*still remember*[ed] *whatever payment* [he] *had made approximately*.\" Mr. Aziz confirmed that he kept track of a lot of payments to and from Mr. Farooq but maintained that he remembered this specific payment made to Mr. Asmatullah seven years earlier.1661 He further stated that he provided the diary, including the page recording the alleged payment to Mr. Asmatullah, to the Group of Experts, but could not explain why it was not included in the annexures to his statement before the Group of Experts.1662\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1616 line 14 to p. 1617 line 14.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1636 line 16 to p. 1639 line 12.\n\n1273.\n\nBased on the witness evidence presented by Respondent, the Tribunal does not consider it established that a payment was made by Mr. Farooq (via Mr. Aziz) on behalf of TCC to Mr. Asmatullah in connection with the Surface Rights Lease. As noted above, Mr. Aziz testified that the payment was made out of the amount that Mr. Farooq received from Mr. Dad \u2013 a payment that has not been proven. The Tribunal also does not consider it plausible that Mr. Farooq, while not mentioning any specific amount in his first witness statement, recalled in his second witness statement that he had paid the precise amount of PAK Rs. 200,000. Col. Khan also could not explain how he came to remember a payment to Mr. Asmatullah in his first witness statement despite not having made any reference to any such payment in his statement before the NAB, which he had signed only nine days earlier. In addition, the alleged purpose of the payment remained unclear. According to Mr. Aziz, it was made on 14 April 2008, *i.e*., a month after the Summary had been approved by the Chief Minister and more than a month before the first order was issued. While Mr. Asmatullah initially stated in his written testimony that he was paid so that he would refrain from raising any objections to the Summary and the discrepancy in the first order, he stated during the hearing that he \"*got the money for the Order*\" and did not confirm any involvement in the preparation or approval of the Summary.\n\n1274.\n\nAs for the entry in the Aziz Journal recording the alleged payment, the Tribunal refers to its summary and evaluation of the evidence presented by the Parties and their forensic experts set out above in connection with the alleged payment from Mr. Dad. For the same reasons, the relevant entry recording the payment to Mr. Asmatullah cannot serve to establish that the payment was actually made.\n\n1275.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers that even if it were established that a payment was made by Mr. Aziz on behalf of Mr. Farooq and that the money originated from funds provided by Mr. Dad on behalf of Col. Khan, it would still be doubtful whether such payment could be attributed to Claimant. In this regard, the Tribunal refers to its considerations above that, on his own testimony, Col. Khan made payments out of his own pocket and did not tell Ms. Boggs, who allegedly reimbursed him for his expenses in connection with the Surface Rights Lease via a bonus in December 2008, about the alleged plan and improper payments.\n\n**(d) The Alleged Payment of PAK Rs. 400,000 by Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokhail**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1276.\n\nRespondent's fourth allegation concerns a payment of PAK Rs. 400,000 by Col. Khan Khan to Mr. Mandokhail in late September 2008 and the payment for an Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail and his family by Mr. Farooq \"*on behalf of TCC*\" in 2009 in return for signing the second order. In support of this allegation, Respondent relies on the testimony of Col. Khan, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Mandokhail.\n\n1277.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his first witness statement that he paid Mr. Farooq \"*to get things done*\" and was told by Mr. Farooq that he was passing on the money particularly to the Board of Revenue from whom Claimant was seeking various leases and concessions \"*in contradiction to Balochistan rules and legislation*.\" Col. Khan further stated that while he did not like to personally hand over bribes, he \"*did have to deal directly with Mr Mandokhail (senior Member of the Board of Revenue) since he was a senior Bureaucrat and an ex-Chairman of the BDA*\" and confirmed that he \"*personally made cash payments to Mr Mandohail for securing for TCC an airstrip and later for the grant of surface rights*.\" He added that \"[t]*he payments to Mr Mandokhail and others allowed us to achieve many things which would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for the Reko Diq project*,\" including \"*acquiring surface rights over approximately 600 square kilometres*.\"1663\n\nKhan I, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 33.\n\n1278.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Col. Khan confirmed that he made \"*cash payments to Mr Mandokhail for his assistance in obtaining surface rights for TCC*\" and added that these were made \"*on the advice of Mr Farooq*.\" Col. Khan stated that he \"*remember*[ed] *paying Mr Mandokhail PAK Rs. 4 lakh (PAK Rs. 400,000).*\"1664\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 42.\n\n1279.\n\nDuring the hearing, Col. Khan was pointed to his Section 161 statement before the NAB dated 21 September 2015 and his Section 164 statement before the magistrate dated 4 February 2016.1665 In these statements, Col. Khan also stated that he had had to \"*deal directly*\" with Mr. Mandokhail because of his status and that the practice of making payments to him had continued from 2007 until 2009 or 2010. In his Section 161 statement, Col. Khan further stated: \"*While I don't remember exact amounts and occasions and no record is held with me, I can confirm that somewhere around Rs. 2 Millions were paid by me to him as bribe through cash*.\"1666 In his Section 164 statement, Col. Khan similarly stated: \"*There is no record of such events in my possession. I cannot recall accurate estimate of the money. I may have spent 2 million rupees in such matters*.\"1667\n\n**Exhibits RE-456** and **RE-468**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-456**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-468**, \u00b6 7.\n\n1280.\n\nAs described above in the context of the alleged payment to Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan was asked at what point the had remembered that he had also paid PAK Rs. 400,000 to Mr. Mandokhail. Col. Khan answered that he \"*deliberately started looking for things*\" and that \"*slowly, slowly, slowly, it came to* [him]\" and he \"*checked up as to how much* [he] *had paid*.\" He confirmed that he did not have any records of the payments to Mr. Farooq and Mr. Mandokhail but was referring to a search of his own memory and \"*small chits*\" that he had. Col. Khan further stated that he also reviewed his own bank statements and \"*from all the information* [he] *gathered \u2026 made a rough estimate as to how much money* [he] *had spent*.\"1668\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 887 line 16 to p. 889 line 21.\n\n1281.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that he helped Claimant to obtain \"*numerous improper advantages that it should not have otherwise obtained*,\" including the grant of surface rights by \"*making payment and providing gifts to Mr Mandokhail in return for assisting TCC to secure surface rights to 585 square kilometres*.\" Mr. Farooq added that he \"*specifically recall*[ed] *paying money on behalf of TCC to Mr Mandokhail and Sheikh Asmatullah at the Board of Revenue to secure approval of TCC's surface rights lease*\" and \"*providing Mr Mandokhail with Rolex watches and sending him on Umrah to Saudi Arabia in return for his assistance to TCC*.\"1669\n\nFarooq I, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.\n\n1282.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq confirmed that he had paid Mr. Mandokhail in connection with the approval of the surface Rights Lease. He specified that after Mr. Mandokhail had agreed to issue the revised order on 27 September 2008, he, Mr. Farooq, \"*discussed Mr Mandokhail's payment of Rs. 400,000 with Col. Sher Khan, who made the payment to Mr Mandokhail*.\"1670\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 50.\n\n1283.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Farooq was pointed to his Section 161 statement before the NAB dated 28 September 2015 in which he had also testified about making payments on behalf of Claimant to Mr. Mandokhail and about providing Rolex watches to him as a gift. He further stated: \"*I also remember financing Hajj/Umrah trip to Saudia Arabia of Mr. Mandokhel. This was part of my yearly package in which I used to send number of persons every year on Hajj/Umrah at my own expenses*.\"1671 When asked whether this final statement was true, Mr. Farooq stated: \"*I didn't have any package as such. I would send them on my own expense, from kickback. Sometimes four. Sometimes five\u2014there were different people there, politicians, Ministers, officials as well*.\"1672 Mr. Farooq confirmed that he paid for these trips out of the funds he had earned through kickback arrangements at the BDA.1673\n\n**Exhibit RE-457**, p. 7.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 613 lines 13-22.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 615 line 18 to p. 616 line 2.\n\n1284.\n\nMr. Mandokhail testified in his witness statement that when Mr. Farooq told him in September 2008 that he would be asked to issue a revised order, Mr. Farooq also threatened him that he would lose his job and be transferred out of Quetta and lose his residence, whch was \"*extremely important*\" to Mr. Mandokhail. He stated that he \"*therefore signed an order dated 27 September 2008*.\" Mr. Mandokhail added:\n\n\"*A few days after this, Col. Sher Khan came to my office and thanked me personally for issuing the Order. In return for my efforts for TCC, he gave me PAK Rs. 400,000 in cash. The money was in a brown envelope. He told me that TCC, through the CM, would look after me. And they did. In 2009, I was sent with my family on Umrah, paid for by TCC through Mr Farooq*.\"1674\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n1285.\n\nMr. Mandokhail further testified that he \"*received a sum of PAK Rs 200,000 on two occasions at Eid through Mr Farooq*\" and \"*two Rolex watches (on two separate occasions)*,\" both in return for his \"*services to TCC*.\"1675\n\nMandokhail, \u00b6 24.\n\n1286.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Mandokhail acknowledged that he had never seen Col. Khan giving any money to Mr. Farooq but relied on statements from Col. Khan that he would look after Mr. Farooq and accommodate him in the same way as Mr. Mandokhail.1676 He maintained that the money and gifts he received from Mr. Farooq came from Claimant rather than from the BDA contractors or Mr. Farooq himself, stating that Mr. Farooq \"*very clearly*\" told him that \"[t]*his money is from TCC, and you get this money on behalf of TCC for the jobs, the work you do for them*.\"1677\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1412 lines 4-20.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1413 line 5 to p. 1415 line 2 and p. 1420 line 2 to p. 1423 line 17.\n\n1287.\n\nMr. Aziz confirmed in his witness statement that Mr. Farooq arranged for an Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail and his family \"*in return for his assistance in allotting land to TCC*\" and stated more generally that Mr. Farooq \"*used the money he received from TCC and others to arrange Hajj and Umrah trips for politicians, bureaucrats and government officials*.\"1678\n\nAziz, \u00b6 25.\n\n1288.\n\nOn the basis of the witness evidence presented by Respondent, the Tribunal does not consider it established that a payment was made by Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokhail or that Mr. Mandokhail was provided with gifts or an Umrah trip with his family out of funds provided by Claimant.\n\n1289.\n\nAs to the alleged payment of PAK Rs. 400,000 by Col. Khan, the Tribunal notes that Col. Khan did not mention any specific amount paid to Mr. Mandokhail in relation to the Surface Rights Lease in his first witness statement. As with the alleged payment made to Mr. Farooq, the Tribunal is further not convinced by Col. Khan's explanation as to how he came to remember such specific amount in his second witness statement. Similarly, Mr. Farooq did not make reference to a direct payment from Col. Khan to Mr. Mandokail in his first witness statement but then testified in his second witness statement that he specifically recalled having discussed such a direct payment, including the specific amount, with Col. Khan.\n\n1290.\n\nAs regards the witness testimony of Mr. Mandokhail, the Tribunal recalls the inconsistencies already discussed above with regard to both the timing of his re-appointment as Senior Member of the Board of Revenue in 2008 as well as to the amount he claimed to have received in connection with the airstrip lease in 2007. In addition, the Tribunal notes that while acknowledging during the hearing that he had no records of the payments allegedly made to him and testifying that \"[m]*oney is a thing, which you don't forget about*,\" Mr. Mandokhail did not mention a specific amount paid to him by Col. Khan in respect of the Surface Rights Lease in his statement before the Group of Experts, which he provided shortly before his witness statement in this arbitration.1679\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit RE-440**, \u00b6 8.\n\n1291.\n\nAs for the Umrah trip that Mr. Mandokhail took with his family in 2009, it may be true that this trip was financed by Mr. Farooq. Mr. Farooq testified in his first witness statement that he had arranged the trip for Mr. Mandokhail \"*in return for his assistance to TCC*\"; he did not, however, state that the money he used had come from Claimant. During the hearing, he confirmed Mr. Aziz's testimony that he had paid for Hajj/Umrah trips of several officials and politicians per year and further stated that he had funded these trips out of the kickback arrangements he had made with BDA contractors. While Mr. Mandokhail maintained during the hearing that the money for this trip had come from TCC, he acknowledged that he had never seen Col. Khan giving any money to Mr. Farooq but only concluded this from statements made by Col. Khan and Mr. Farooq. Consequently, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that the Umrah trip for Mr. Mandokhail and his family was paid for by Claimant. In addition, the Tribunal notes that neither Mr. Farooq nor Mr. Mandokhail specifically stated that the trip, which occurred in 2009, was financed in return for the surface rights order he had issued in September 2008 but rather more vaguely for \"*services to TCC*.\"\n\n1292.\n\nThe same applies to the alleged gifts and further money allegedly given to Mr. Mandokhail by Mr. Farooq. Again, Respondent has failed to establish that any of these benefits, even if they were given, were provided out of funds received from Claimant or that they were granted in return for issuing the second order regarding the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n**(e) The Alleged Payments of PAK Rs. 4,000 to 5,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1293.\n\nRespondent's fifth and final allegation concerns allegedly monthly payments of PAK Rs. 4,000-5,000 by Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah starting in December 2007 in return for not objecting to Mr. Farooq's plan regarding the Surface Rights Lease. In support of this allegation, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Asmatullah.\n\n1294.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Asmatullah testified that he was promoted to the position of Secretary of the Board of Revenue at Mr. Farooq's request in December 2007. According to Mr. Asmatullah, Mr. Farooq told him that Col. Khan would \"l *ook after* [Mr. Asmatullah]\" if he helped him \"*in relation to all of TCC's dealings with the Government of Balochistan*.\"1680 Mr. Asmatullah added:\n\n\"*In addition to my salary, therefore, I received PAK Rs 4,000 to 5,000 per month in cash for a period of 6-7 months from December 2007. This was delivered to me by Mr Farooq. I always understood that this money came from Col. Sher Khan (TCC). This was in return for me endorsing all decisions relating to TCC and refraining from raising any objections*.\"1681\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6 7.\n\n1295.\n\nMr. Asmatullah referred to \"*two specific examples*,\" *i.e*., the land for the airstrip and the Surface Rights Lease in the context of which he refrained from raising objections to the Summary for the Chief Minister initiated by Mr. Farooq in March 2008 and the first order issued in May 2008 despite his awareness of the discrepancy between the square kilometers and acreage figures.1682\n\nAsmatullah, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11-12.\n\n1296.\n\nMr. Farooq did not mention any monthly payments to Mr. Asmatullah in his written testimony. During the hearing, Mr. Farooq first stated that \"*Asmatullah was only paid once for 2 lakh rupees*\"; he then clarified that he \"*did not pay any big amounts*\" except for the PAK Rs. 200,000 discussed above but that he had been \"*paying 5,000 and 10,000 rupees for small jobs.*\" He also stated that \"[h]*e wasn't a regular recipient\u2014whatever the job for TCC, we would pay him and we would have our jobs done*.\"1683\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 578 lne 13 to p. 580 line 4.\n\n1297.\n\nMr. Asmatullah confirmed during the hearing that he received regular payments starting in January 2008 and specified that he did not receive them directly from Mr. Farooq but rather \"*through his men*\" who said that it came from Mr. Farooq. He confirmed that \"*nobody from TCC would directly come and pay* [him].\"1684 When confronted with Mr. Farooq's testimony that he had been paid on a per-job basis but not on a monthly basis, Mr. Asmatullah maintained that \"[f]*ive, six, seven months, he had been sending me money. It's not like wages that I would get it on that same day every time. Sometimes it would come after 15 days; sometimes it would come after 45 days*.\"1685 Mr. Asmatullah added that Mr. Farooq \"*would not remember when he paid 4,000 or 5,000*\" but he, Mr. Asmatuallah, \"*would remember how every 2 rupees and other small amount came into* [his] *budget*.\"1686 Mr. Asmatullah further stated that \"*this was TCC's work*\" because the payments finished \"*when TCC's business finished*\" even though he remained in the same position for three years.1687 At the same time, Mr. Asmatullah confirmed in response to the question whether these payments had anything to do with the Surface Rights Application that this was not the case.1688\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1343 line 9 to p. 1344 line 20.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1348 line 16 to p. 1350 line 18.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1351 lines 16-19.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1351 line 21 to p. 1352 line 2.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1353 lines 13-16.\n\n1298.\n\nIn light of the testimony given by Respondent's witnesses, the Tribunal considers that, even though small payments may have been made by Mr. Farooq through subordinates he sent to Mr. Asmatullah, it has not been established that the money for these payments came from or was paid with the knowledge of TCC. While Mr. Asmatullah stated in his witness statement that he understood the payments to come from Col. Khan, he did not confirm this testimony during the hearing but clarified that the payments had come from subordinates of Mr. Farooq who told him that it came from Mr. Farooq. In addition, Mr. Farooq, who had not mentioned these payments at all in his witness statement, made reference to \"*small jobs*\" for TCC but did not state that he made the payments out of funds received from TCC or that anyone from TCC was aware of such payments.\n\n1299.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that even if payments of PAK Rs. 4,000 to 5,000 were by or on behalf of Mr. Farooq to Mr. Asmatullah, there would be no basis for attributing them to Claimant. In addition, Mr. Asmatullah clarified during the hearing that these payments were not related to the Surface Rights Lease.\n\n**(f) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1300.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the alleged payments of benefits that Respondent claims to have been given by or on behalf of representatives from TCC in relation to the Surface Rights Lease has been established by Respondent. The Tribunal also does not accept Respondent's submission that Mr. Farooq orchestrated a plan to first obtain an ambiguous order providing for a discrepancy between the square kilometers and acreage figures and later have this order corrected by Mr. Mandokhail following the death of Mr. Kasi.\n\n1301.\n\nIn light of its findings above, the Tribunal does not need to express an opinion on whether any acts of corruption committed by or on behalf of Col. Khan would be attributable to Claimant on the basis of either of the theories advanced by the Parties. In any event, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has failed to establish that any act of corruption attributable to Claimant contributed to Claimant's obtaining the Surface Rights Lease over an area of 585 square kilometers.\n\n**f. Allegations Relating to the Visa Applications**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1302.\n\nA further allegation raised by Respondent concerns certain irregularities in the visa application process for Claimant's expatriate employees that were discovered in 2009.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1303.\n\nRespondent submits that the following actions further undermine Claimant's purported corporate compliance culture;\n\na) the submission of fraudulent visa applications for expatriate employees;\n\nb) the payment of bribes by TCC's staff for expatriate work visas; and\n\nc) the failure to hold senior management accountable for such actions.1689\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 320.\n\n1304.\n\nRespondent contends that the documentary record shows that every expatriate work visa application submitted prior to September 2009 was fraudulent, with applications containing fictitious employment contracts (presumably substituting for the salary, overseas allowance and fringe benefits information required) and forged signatures.1690 Respondent refers to Col. Khan's testimony that each CEO from Mr. Hargreaves onwards was aware of the falsity of this process.1691\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 84 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-367**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 86 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6 47.\n\n1305.\n\nRespondent further submits that the documentary evidence shows three instances where Claimant resorted to corruption in order to obtain the necessary approvals for its employees.1692 Firstly, Respondent relies on e-mail records and Col. Khan's testimony to submit that Claimant's Chief Financial Officer (Ms. Sharp) approved payment of USD 700 to a contact at the passport office in Karachi to issue a visa in less than a day (a process which normally took 1-3 months) for Trevor Whisken (TCC's Logistics and Support Manager).1693 Secondly, Respondent submits that Mr. Flew approved the payment of PAK Rs. 50,000 in order to expedite the approval process and obtain a visa in September 2008.1694 Lastly, Respondent submits that Mr. Stone obtained a visa in May 2008 through a payment of PAK Rs. 30,000 (again approved by Mr. Flew) to the local passport and visa office.1695 Respondent considers that Mr. Flew has been unable to provide adequate answers as to why he provided such approvals and is thus directly implicated in corrupt and fraudulent conduct.1696\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 87.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 88-90 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-344**, pp. 4-6, **RE-343**, p. 2, **RE-357**, p. 2 *and* Khan II, \u00b6 45, 49.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-357**, p. 2, **RE-349**, pp. 3-4 *and* **RE-347**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 97.\n\n1306.\n\nRespondent further suggests that TCC's response to these incidents was prompted by fear that the illegally obtained visas were easily discoverable and could negatively affect its project, rather than a desire to uphold the company's corporate compliance regime.1697 Respondent highlights that senior staff including Mr. Hargreaves, Ms. Boggs, Mr. Flew and Ms. Sharp, whom it considers to have been aware and/or complicit in this wrongdoing, were not held to account.1698 Respondent specifically questions Ms. Boggs' justification as to why Mr. Flew and Mr. Stone both retained their positions in contrast to Mr. Whisken, submitting that contrary to her suggestion that Mr. Flew took steps to ensure the legality of his actions, he actually showed total disregard for the proper legal process.1699\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 83.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 83, 102.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 101 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-352** *and* **Ex RE-348**.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1307.\n\nClaimant submits that its self-reported deficiencies in its procedures for applying for expatriate work visas provide no basis to dismiss its Treaty claims, but confirm its commitment to ethical business practice.1700\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 260; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 264.\n\n1308.\n\nFirstly, Claimant considers it uncontested that TCC acted appropriately to respond to the visa issues and that Respondent, thus unable to refute the steps which Claimant took, instead contends that Claimant should have gone further in finding more employees responsible.1701 Claimant notes that following Col. Khan's reporting of the irregular process, an internal investigation was conducted from which Ms. Boggs determined that certain individuals were complicit of wrongdoing and thus lost their jobs, while Mr. Stone and Mr. Flew had been misled as to the legality of the proposed steps and therefore maintained their positions.1702\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266 *referring to* **Exhibits RE-357** *and* **RE-347**.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 263 *referring to* Boggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, Flew, \u00b6\u00b6 39\u201340, **Exhibits RE-347**, **RE-349, RE-352, RE-344**, **RE-350**, **RE-353**, **RE-354**, **RE-355**, **RE-356** *and* Livesey VII, \u00b6 16.\n\n1309.\n\nSecondly, Claimant maintains that Dr. Jezek's identification, investigation (with the help of local counsel) and subsequent reform of the application process further reflects the realty of Claimant's anti-corruption policies. Claimant refutes Respondent's suggestion that this was done out of fear that the irregular process would be discovered and maintains that the documentary record clearly shows that it was done to ensure maintenance with TCC's ethical standards and that the corporate compliance culture was sufficiently robust that even minor irregularities were taken seriously.1703\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 265-268 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 83.\n\n1310.\n\nClaimant further argues that following its voluntary reporting of the matter to the relevant authorities, the matter was deemed unworthy of further inquiry which demonstrates that this issue is not serious enough to affect Claimant's Treaty rights.1704\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 263-264 *referring to* Boggs IV, \u00b6 23 *and* **Exhibit RE-357**.\n\n1311.\n\nMoreover, Claimant submits that Col. Khan's assistance in reporting the irregularities contradicts his claims that he facilitated a system of bribery over the years with the knowledge and support of Claimant's CEOs, something which Respondent has been unable to explain.1705 Claimant argues that certain 'versions' of Col. Khan occasionally slipped through in his testimony where he made clear that Claimant did not engage in corruption, which cannot be squared with his other allegations.1706\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 264 *referring to* Khan I, \u00b6 17 *and* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 6-12; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 268.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 268-270 *referring to* Transcript (Day 4), p. 951 lines 15\u201320, p. 948 lines 9\u201310 *and* p. 947 lines 21\u201322.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n1312.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that with regard to the visa applications concerning Claimant's expatriate employees, Respondent's allegations relate to two separate issues: (i) the making of improper payments to procure work visas for three TCC employees as discovered by Ms. Boggs and Col. Khan in early 2009; and (ii) irregularities in all work visa applications for TCC's expatriate employees as discovered by Dr. Jezek in late 2009. The Tribunal will address these allegations in turn.\n\n**(a) Improper Payments Made to Procure Work Visas for Three Employees in 2008 and Early 2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1313.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant resorted to corruption to obtain work visas for at least three of its employees, making reference to the following payments:1707\n\ni. USD 700 paid by or on behalf of Mr. Trevor Whisken, Claimant's Logistics and Support Manager at the time, and approved by Ms. Madeline Sharp, Claimant's CFO at the time, to a contact of Mr. Rahil Khan, an administrative officer in TCC's Karachi office, at the passport office in Karachi in January 2009 in return for immediately processing and issuing an authentic visa for Mr. Whisken;\n\nii. PAK Rs. 50,000 paid by Mr. Rahil Khan, and approved by Mr. Barry Flew, to the passport office in September 2008 in return for issuing a letter from the Ministry of Interior, which would normally authorize the passport office to stamp a visa, and securing itself a work visa for Mr. Flew;\n\niii. PAK Rs. 30,000 paid by Mr. Rahil Khan, and approved by Mr. Flew, to the local passport and visa office in May 2008 in return for obtaining a work visa for Mr. Clive Stone, an IT specialist at TCC.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 87-94.\n\n1314.\n\nClaimant does not dispute that these payments were made or that they were improper. It emphasizes, however, that once these \"*irregularities*\" were identified pursuant to an investigation conducted by Ms. Boggs with the assistance of Col. Khan, Claimant self-reported them to the Board of Investment and terminated the employees responsible for this wrongdoing, *i.e*., Mr. Whisken and Mr. Rahil Khan, while concluding that Mr. Stone, Mr. Flew and Ms. Sharp had not been complicit in the improper process.1708 According to Respondent, on the other hand, the evidence shows that in particular Mr. Flew was guilty of wrongdoing as well and the fact that he remained at TCC \"*suggests that they were concerned with this issue being discovered by people outside of TCC, rather than a broader desire to uphold the company's corporate compliance regime*.\"1709\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 261-264.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 95-98.\n\n1315.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that Claimant reported two of the incidents referred to above, *i.e*., those involving Mr. Whisken and Mr. Flew, to the Board of Investment.1710 Pursuant to the revised draft letter sent by Ms. Boggs to Col. Khan on 22 April 2009, Claimant intended to report the two incidents as follows:\n\n\"*Application for work visa for Mr. Trevor John Whisken was submitted to your office on 5 Dec 2008. At the same time an application for Security Clearance for the individual was submitted to Director General Mineral (DGM), MP&NR.*\n\n*We subsequently discovered that Mr. Trevor John Whisken managed to get his passport stamped on 15 Jan from Regional Passport Office Karachi (copy attached), after paying 700US$ to Passport authorities without waiting for his security clearance from DGM and without approval of your office. The individual then proceeded on leave and left the country on 19 Jan 2009 and returned two weeks later. When we discovered that Mr. Whisken did not have a proper visa, we had him leave the country immediately on February [] 2009. We subsequently determined that Mr. Whisken's visa was invalid and not properly issued. The activities with the Passport Office were conducted by a Tethyan employee, Rahil Khan, who claimed that he used the services of an agent to pay the fees to the Passport authorities.*\n\n*In investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Whisken's visa, we also discovered that Mr. Khan had also facilitated an improper visa for Mr. Barry Flew in [September 2008]. Mr. Khan advised Mr. Flew that by paying [] he could obtain a work visa on an expedited basis. Mr. Khan never made application through your office or otherwise and simply paid the Passport authorities who issued fraudulent paperwork and a fraudulent visa. Mr. Flew had no knowledge of these activities and was not aware that the visa issued to him was invalid.*\n\n*After a thorough investigation of these matters, TCC concluded that Mr. Khan and Mr. Whisken had acted not in accordance with the Company's policies and procedures and they were immediately terminated. Mr. Whisken was not allowed to return to the country. Mr. Flew is entitled to remain ni* [sic] *Pakistan as the holder of POC, and application has been made for a work permit for him. The application is currently pending*.\"1711\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 100; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 263, *both referring to* **Exhibit RE-357**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-559** and **RE-357**, pp. 2-3.\n\n1316.\n\nThe final version of this letter as it was sent to the Board of Investment is not in the record. There is no indication that the third incident involving Mr. Stone was made part of the self-report.\n\n1317.\n\nAs regards the investigation conducted by Ms. Boggs, the record shows the following. On 18 February 2009, Mr. Khurram Shahzad, an employee of TCC based in Islamabad, informed Ms. Boggs about the process and status of Mr. Whisken's work visa. He stated that an application for renewal of Mr. Whisken's work visa, which expired on 9 January 2009, had been filed with the Board of Investment on 6 December 2008. While the application process should usually be completed within four weeks, it was delayed in that case because of a pending security clearance; requests from him and Col. Khan for urgent processing were not successful. Mr. Shahzad further reported that on the day of the expiry, he was visiting some of his personal contacts but still \"*failed to process legally on an urgent basis*.\" He added that \"[a]*t that time, Mr. Rahil advised that he has his contact in Passport Office \u2013 Karachi, from whom he can process that immediately and that will authentic visa but we have to pay $ 700 to them. Trevor was in tension so Mrs. Madeline, after confirmation from my side regarding the delay of process from here in Islamabad, approved that payment and Trevor got the visa*.\"1712\n\n**Exhibit RE-343**.\n\n1318.\n\nAn e-mail exchange that Ms. Sharp forwarded to Ms. Boggs on 19 February 2009 shows that on 9 and 10 January 2009, when it became clear that Mr. Shahzad would not be able to obtain the work visa from the Board of Investment in time, Col. Khan informed Mr. Whisken that he would receive an acknowledgment letter that would allow him to stay in the country. This did not, however, solve Mr. Whisken's concerns about being able to leave and re-enter the country on the occasion of his next leave scheduled for 19 January 2009, as a result of which Mr. Whisken asked Mr. Rahil Khan to take his passport to the passport office in Karachi to \"*get it done same day*.\" On 10 January 2009, Mr. Whisken also informed Ms. Sharp about the ongoing issue and they exchanged various e-mails about whether Mr. Shahzad or Mr. Rahil Khan, who were acting in parallel at the same time, should proceed. Finally, Ms. Sharp stated that \"*Khurram is looking after the new visa; what a Rahil would be getting is an extension*.\"1713\n\n**Exhibit RE-344**.\n\n1319.\n\nOn 4 March 2009, Col. Khan informed Ms. Boggs that he had spoken with an official at the Federal Investigation Agency who advised him that Claimant should report the case as soon as possible. He added that they would at least be \"*saved from embarrassment, later if found out and reported by the ministry of Interior*\" and attached a first draft of the reporting letter, which at that time referred only to the incident involving Mr. Whisken.1714\n\n**Exhibits CE-555** and **RE-345**.\n\n1320.\n\nAn e-mail exchange between Mr. Livesey and Ms. Boggs of the same days confirms that they had asked Mr. Whisken to fly out of the country as soon as possible, which he did on the same day. Ms. Boggs emphasized that \"*it is important that we demonstrate that we have taken this seriously, both at the TCC and the Barrick level*\" and added that she had spoken to Col. Khan \"*for a very long time about this issue*.\" Ms. Boggs also indicated that concerns had been raised regarding Mr. Flew's visa but that they did not yet have the paperwork to determine whether he also had to leave the country until they could regularize his status.1715\n\n**Exhibit RE-346**.\n\n1321.\n\nOn 5 March 2009, Col. Khan informed Ms. Boggs that, having reviewed the documentary evidence and spoken with the people responsible for obtaining work visas, both Mr. Flew's and Mr. Whisken's visas were \"*bogus*.\" He added that in the case of Mr. Flew, not even an application had been filed. Col Khan further reported that he had spoken with Mr. Rahil Khan who \"*was not sure what he was talking about. He has produced a letter of Ministry of Interior that authorizes passport office to stamp a visa, is fake. I have the evidence from the ministry today*.\" Col. Khan concluded that they now had to report these incidents to the authorities.1716\n\n**Exhibits CE-557** and **RE-347**.\n\n1322.\n\nOn the same day, Ms. Sharp wrote to Ms. Boggs, informing her that contrary to Mr. Whisken, Mr. Flew had permission to stay in the country due to a POC card he possessed but that it was still unclear whether this card also allowed him to work while applications for new work permits were still pending. Ms. Sharpe further stated that \"[i]*t appears that sometimes Khurram processed visas, sometimes Rahil and Barry said that he had evidence that he asked Rahil whether this was on the up and up. He is personally very offended that he might be considered knowingly part of a fraud*.\"1717\n\n**Exhibit RE-348**.\n\n1323.\n\nStill on the same day, Ms. Boggs wrote to Mr. Livesey and Col. Khan that she would like to \"*discuss the issues relating to Trevor's and Barry's visas,*\" confirming the facts as known to them and agreeing on an action plan and possible disciplinary actions.1718\n\n**Exhibit CE-556**.\n\n1324.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, Mr. Flew forwarded to Ms. Boggs two e-mail exchanges, one concerning his own visa and one concerning the visa of Mr. Stone. As for his own visa, Mr. Flew added that \"*Rahil confirmed to Khurram the option to expedite was legal. I now recall delay was caused by Rahil being sick. Though re-reading this I should have been more suspicious about issue a without documentation but was probably thinking about the process with Clive above*.\"1719\n\n**Exhibits CE-558** and **RE-349**, p. 1.\n\n1325.\n\nThe first e-mail exchange forwarded by Mr. Flew shows that on 26 August 2008, Mr. Shahzad apologized for a delay in processing Mr. Flew's visa application, which had not been forwarded to him by Mr. Rahil Khan because the latter had been sick, and informed Mr. Flew that there were two ways in which they could proceed: (i) follow normal procedures, pay a penalty on the official processing fee and have the visa extended within one month; or (ii) \"*process it immediately*\" through a source of Mr. Rahil Khan who would \"*get VISA stamped on passport without documentation and penalty charge Rs. 50,000 to be paid additionally with Official Fee Rs 8,058*.\" Mr. Flew responded on the same day, noting that he had started the process a month ago and considered this delay unacceptable. He added that, as he was leaving on 19 September and his visa would expire on 2 September, he could not wait for a month for his visa and therefore stated: \"*Please expedite on an urgent basis*.\"1720\n\n**Exhibit RE-349**, pp. 3-4.\n\n1326.\n\nThe second e-mail exchange forwarded by Mr. Flew shows that Mr. Stone inquired about the issuance of a new visa for the first time on 24 April 2008, with his current visa expiring on 20 May 2008. Following various e-mails exchanged with Mr. Flew and Mr. Rahil Khan, the latter informed Mr. Flew on 8 May 2008 that there were two options for issuing a multi entry business visa for Mr. Stone: (i) file an application with the local passport & visa office who would send it to the Ministry of Interior for security clearances and approval, which \"*would take at least 45 days and no guarantee for approval by Ministry*\"; or (ii) pay \"*Rs. 5,400 fee against receipt and Rs. 30,000 \u2026 over and above legal fee \u2026 to wave* [sic] *all legal obligation and passport will be return* [sic] *back after 2 days with one year multiple entry business visa*.\" Mr. Rahil Khan further stated that Mr. Shahzad had advised him that the charges for a multiple entry business visa filed through Islamabad would be higher than those of the passport & visa office in Karachi. Mr. Flew responded on the same day that he \"*now underst* [ood] *the Rs 30,000 is a facilitation payment to expedite the visa process which is ok if this is the only alternative, and we are not get* [sic] *the visa illegally*.\" Mr. Rahil Khan answered still on the same days that \"[v]*isa will not be illegal; the passport & visa office have their relation with ministries and wave* [sic] *all the time space required for security clearance against facilitation payment*.\" Still on the same day, Mr. Flew wrote: \"*Additional visa amounts approved as requested*.\"1721\n\n**Exhibit RE-349**, pp. 6-11.\n\n1327.\n\nOn 10 March 2009, Ms. Boggs wrote to Col. Khan, informing him that she had spoken to Mr. Livesey \"*about the issue regarding Rahil and Trevor*\" and suggested that the three of them \"*go through the paperwork and investigation,* [redacted] *and agree the plan*.\"1722\n\n**Exhibit RE-350**.\n\n1328.\n\nAn e-mail exchange of 18 March 2009 between Ms. Boggs, Mr. Livesey and Mr. Maurice Harapiak from Toronto confirms that by that time, it had been decided that Mr. Whisken would be terminated but he had not yet been informed of this decision because they intended to terminate Mr. Rahil Khan at the same time, expecting that the latter might \"*cause more internal damage*\" than Mr. Whisken.1723\n\n**Exhibit RE-351**.\n\n1329.\n\nOn 24 March 2009, Mr. Harapiak followed up on Mr. Whisken, who had also mentioned to him that \"*Barry Flew had obtained his work visa by the same means*.\" Ms. Boogs responded on the same day that she was planning to speak with Mr. Whisken on the following day, adding that \"*as we have discussed, we determined that we cannot terminate Rahil, but then not terminate the expatriate for whom he worked. That sends a very bad message.*\" As regards Mr. Flew, she stated that \"[w]*e are aware of the incident with Barry and have investigated the same. The facts are different and although they confirm Rahil's complicity in both events, Barry did take steps to try and ensure what was being proposed was legal. Trevor took none of those actions*. [redacted]\"1724\n\n**Exhibit RE-352**.\n\n1330.\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Ms. Boggs informed Mr. Livesey that she had spoken with Mr. Rahil Khan to whom she had explained that it would not be possible for him to get a different job at TCC as such jobs did not exist and \"*it isn't fair to people who are doing their job correctly*.\" She added towards Mr. Rahil Khan that they would be \"*as generous as* [they] *could in determining his entitlement benefits*\" and that they \"*could stretch a little here.*\"1725\n\n**Exhibit RE-353**.\n\n1331.\n\nA further e-mail exchange between Ms. Boggs, Mr. Livesey and Mr. Harapiak of 27 March 2009 shows that it was indicated to both Mr. Whisken and Mr. Rahil Khan on the previous days that they would be terminated \"*as a result of the events surrounding Trevor's work visa*.\" Ms. Boggs reported that while Mr. Whisken had acknowledged the facts and apologized at that point, he now stated that his actions had been \"*approved*\" by Col. Khan and Ms. Sharp. Ms. Boggs added: \"*I told him that this was not the conclusion reached by any of us who have investigated the matter*.\" Later on the same day, she informed Mr. Harapiak that both Mr. Whisken and Mr. Rahil Khan had agreed to resign.1726\n\n**Exhibit RE-354**.\n\n1332.\n\nOn the same day, Ms. Boggs indicated to Mr. Livesey and Col. Khan that she would send a message to all employees of TCC informing them that the two employees had resigned, without saying anything about the circumstances.1727 On 29 March 2009, Ms. Boggs announced to Claimant's employees that Mr. Rahil Khan and Mr. Whisken had resigned effective as of 27 March 2009 and thanked them for their services. She then informed about the resulting shift of responsibilities for administrative and visa-related issues.1728\n\n**Exhibit RE-355**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-356**.\n\n1333.\n\nAs noted above, at some point after 22 April 2009, Claimant self-reported the incidents regarding the work visas of Mr. Whisken and Mr. Flew to the Board of Investment. It is undisputed between the Parties that no further inquiry was made and no further action was taken by the Board of Investment or any other Government authority in this regard.1729\n\n*Cf.* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 100; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 264.\n\n1334.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his second witness statement that when he spoke to Mr. Rahil Khan about Mr. Whisken's visa, Mr. Rahil Khan \"*admitted that he had bribed the Passport Office to issue and stamp a visa despite one not having been approved by the relevant government departments. He said that Mr Whisken knew he was doing so*.\" Col. Khan added that he understood that Ms. Sharp \"*also instructed Rahil to do so*.\" As for Mr. Flew's visa, Col. Khan stated that Mr. Rahil Khan admitted having \"*forged a letter from the MOI authorizing the Passport Office to issue a visa stamp for Mr Flew*.\" According to Col. Khan, Mr. Flew confirmed that \"*money has been paid for this visa and that he knew that it was a bribe since he had not even applied with proper visa papers through the BOI.*\"1730 Col. Khan further stated that Mr. Rahil Khan admitted to him that \"*he was operating in a racket in which TCC was paying him to bribe passport officials in Karachi to get illegal work visas issued*\" and that he done that \"*for dozens of expats in Karachi over the course of many years*\" with the \"*money for the bribes* [being] *paid by TCC with the approval of the CFO, Ms Sharp*.\" Col. Khan noted that while Mr. Rahil Khan and Mr. Whisken were fired following an investigation of this wrongdoing \"[f]*or reasons unknown to* [him]*, Mr Flew was not fired despite being involved in the same conduct. Nor was any action taken against Ms Sharp*.\"1731 As for the letter sent to the Board of Investment, Col. Khan stated that he first \"*gauge*[d] *whether it was in TCC's best interests to self-report and show we were being proactive about changing (and, importantly, that it would not lead to any sanction against TCC)*.\" He testified that when he informed his contact about the incident and that two employees had alrady been terminated, he was told \"*not to worry*,\" and informed Ms. Boggs accordingly.1732\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 51.\n\n1335.\n\nMr. Flew testified in witness statement that when an expatriate employee sought to renew his work visa in 2008, Mr. Rahil Khan advised him, Mr. Flew, that there were two options, either the standard process, which would take at least 45 days, or \"*the applicant could pay a fee of Rs. 35,400 for a two day expedited process*.\" Mr. Flew emphasized that he asked Mr. Rahil Khan whether the second option was legitimate and, after receiving this confirmation, authorized the payment of \"*the small expediting fee*.\" Mr. Flew added: \"*While I was responsible for approving visa payments, I was not well versed in all of the procedures and steps involved in the visa process and I trusted Rahil's explanation*.\"1733 As regards his own visa, Mr. Flew stated when it was discovered that it was based on a non-authentic government authorization document and an investigation was prompted, he sent his correspondence with Mr. Rahil Khan to Ms. Boggs and Ms. Sharp and \"*acknowledged that, in hindsight,* [he] *should have been more skeptical of Rahil's explanation, but explained that* [he] *had understood that the expedited visa process had a valid legal basis.*\" Mr. Flew added that he was able to stay in Pakistan lawfully because he had a resident card and subsequently applied for and obtained \"*a new and completely authentic work visa*.\"1734\n\nFlew, \u00b6 39.\n\nFlew, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\n1336.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Flew confirmed that his understanding of a facilitation payment was \"*that it's a payment to acquire something that is nondiscretionary, i.e., something that one would be entitled to, but all you're paying for is it to be quicker than you would otherwise get it*.\" He further confirmed that this was how he understood the second option suggested by Mr. Rahil Khan regarding the visa of Mr. Stone, *i.e*., that it he did not understand it to be about guaranteeing the process but \"*more about speeding up the process*\" and to \"*facilitate the paperwork*.\"1735 As regards his own visa, Mr. Flew stated that he \"*understood it to be the similar process that we talked about before, Mr. Stone's visa issued*\" and that the \"*facilitation payment, or extra payment \u2026 would entitle you to get a legal visa.*\" Mr. Flew did not recall whether he had asked Mr. Rahil Khan to confirm the legality of his own visa but stated that on the basis of the information received from Mr. Rahil Khan, he had been \"*comfortable that \u2026 the second option to expedite the process was a legal process \u2026 to get the legal visa*.\"1736\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2967 line 2 to p. 2968 line 13.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2975 line 3 to p. 2979 line 3.\n\n1337.\n\nMs. Boggs testified in her fourth witness statement that the investigation she conducted with the help of Col. Khan revealed that \"[a]*t the time, Mr. Flew had questioned whether the process was legitimate, and Rahil Khan confirmed that the visa would be legal and that payment would expedite the process. We also learned that TCC's Chief Financial Officer, Madeline Sharp, understood that this payment was a legitimate fee to extend Mr. Whisken's visa*.\"1737 Ms. Boggs stated that as a result of this investigation, they immediately terminated the employment of Mr. Whisken and Mr. Rahil Khan, \"*who were responsible for the payments in question*.\" She explained that she did not fire Mr. Flew at the time because \"the evidence from Col. Khan's investigation did not support that Mr. Flew knew that the payments from Rahil Khan were improper.\" She added: \"*Nevertheless, since Mr. Flew was generally familiar with the visa process and did not exercise the care and diligence that I believed he should have exercised given his position, I determined that some disciplinary action was required. We issued him a formal reprimand, and he was counseled on the proper process going forward*.\" As for Ms. Sharp, Ms. Boggs stated that they \"*determined that Ms. Sharp, who was not familiar with the visa process, understood that the payment was for a legitimate fee and was not at fault*.\"1738 Finally, as to the report to the Board of Investment, Ms. Boggs testified that she understood at the time that \"*affirmatively reporting was an unusual step to take in Pakistan, but we believed that it would reaffirm TCC's commitment to anti-corruption specifically and an ethical approach more generally*.\"1739\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 21.\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 22.\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 23.\n\n1338.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Respondent takes the position that Claimant's response to the wrongdoing in connection with the work visas that was identified in early 2009 was not driven by a desire to uphold its corporate compliance regime but rather by the concern that the issue could be discovered by people outside of TCC.1740 Respondent further claims that \"*the proven bribes paid by members of TCC's staff for expatriate work visas and submission of fraudulent visa applications for expatriate employees is symptomatic of an investor displaying little or no diligence*.\"1741\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 98.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 320.\n\n1339.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the documentary record does not support Respondent's argument. In particular with regard to the incident involving Mr. Whisken, the evidence shows that Ms. Boggs conducted a thorough investigation into the matter, which resulted in serious consequences for Mr. Whisken and Mr. Rahil Khan as they were both terminated as a result of this incident. The Tribunal is aware that, neither Mr. Flew nor Mr. Stone faced comparable consequences for the incidents relating to their work visas. As for Mr. Stone, the Tribunal understands that he was not directly involved in the visa application process, including the decision to proceed on an expedited basis by paying an extra fee of PAK Rs. 30,000. As far as Mr. Flew is concerned, Ms. Boggs' contemporaneous e-mails indicate and her witness evidence confirms that she took a different view on his conduct because of his e-mail exchange with Mr. Rahil Khan in which the latter confirmed the legality of the visa and indicated that the fee had to be paid for the expedited process. Even if one might have taken a different view on Mr. Flew's conduct at the time, in particular regarding his acceptance of having to make a facilitation payment for Mr. Stone's visa, a process which he apparently considered to be repeated in relation to his own visa,1742 the Tribunal does not believe it to be its task to now re-consider Ms. Boggs' decisions regarding the appropriate disciplinary actions to be taken in the case of each individual employee involved. In addition, as Ms. Boggs testified, she did believe that the incident required some disciplinary action towards Mr. Flew. While Mr. Flew could not recall during the hearing whether he received a formal reprimand, he confirmed that he was \"*advised that this was not an appropriate process and to be more diligent*\" and recalled that his bonus that year had been lower than in other years.1743 Finally, Col. Khan confirmed in his second witness statement that the visa application process was reformed after the incident had been reported to the Board of Investment.1744\n\n*Cf*. Transcript (Day 11), pp. 2975-2978.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2979 line 18 to p. 2980 line 3.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 51.\n\n1340.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, an incident of improper payments being made, which, once it became known to Claimant's CEO, was investigated, followed by disciplinary actions against the employees responsible for the wrongdoing and a self-reporting letter to the competent authority as well as a reform of the relevant procedures, cannot be a ground for impugning the validity of Claimant's investment and its claims under the Treaty. This conclusion is reinforced by the absence of any evidence that these payments contributed to Claimant obtaining a right or benefit relating to his investment, given that Claimant made Mr. Whisken leave the country as soon as the issue surfaced and immediate action was taken within TCC to file the necessary applications to regularize the work status of Mr. Flew, who was permitted to stay within the country due to his resident card, by applying for a new authentic work visa soon thereafter.\n\n**(b) Irregularities in All Work Visa Applications Made for Expatriate Employees Until Late 2009**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1341.\n\nRespondent further alleges that the applications for all work visas for Claimant's expatriate employees filed until September 2009 were \"*fraudulent*,\" relying on a memorandum of Dr. Jezek dated 8 September 2009 in which he reported to Claimant's Board of Directors about \"*irregularities*\" in the visa application process, which he was told had been \"*put in place many years ago and may not have been reviewed by management*.\"1745 Specifically, Dr. Jezek reported the following \"[s]*pecific problems:*\n\n\u2022 *Fictitious employment contracts are attached to the applications, presumably to substitute for the salary, overseas allowance and fringe benefits required in the application*\n\n\u2022 *The fictitious employment contracts contain forged signatures in the purported CEO and employee signature areas*\n\n\u2022 *Applications have been signed by the Corporate Security and Public Affairs Manager (now Director) in the area requiring TCC CEO to sign.*\"1746\n\nRespondent's reply, \u00b6 84, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-367**. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 321.\n\n**Exhibit RE-367**.\n\n1342.\n\nDr. Jezek further stated that while he had been informed by the employees responsible for the visa application process that the contents of the application was not important, \"*because no one read them*,\" he considered this process \"*incompatible with business ethics of TCC and the JV partners*\" and added that it created risks and could give rise to \"*far reaching consequences*\" for the project, in particular when it reached the implementation stage. Dr. Jezek concluded that \"[t]*he process has now been stopped and we are working with our legal counsel to develop a new process and underlying procedure to assure that this problem does not reoccur*.\"1747\n\n**Exhibit RE-367**.\n\n1343.\n\nRespondent further relies on the witness evidence of Col. Khan who stated in his second witness statement that \"[o]*ne example of TCC's culture of toleration of corruption is that, at least between 2005* [when Col. Khan became responsible for supervising the visa application process] *and 2009, TCC obtained all of its work visas for non-Pakistani staff through fraud.*\" Col. Khan testified that from the outset and on instructions from the then-CEO Mr. Hargreaves he signed the applications on behalf of the CEO.1748\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n1344.\n\nCol. Khan further stated that while the application process would usually take between one and three months and there was no formal expedited process available in Islamabad or Karachi, his subordinate Mr. Shahzad \"*used sources*\" at the Passport Office in Islamabad, the MPNR and the MOI to expedite the process, including for obtaining security clearances, which \"*might have saved a couple of weeks*.\" Col. Khan testified that Mr. Shahzad \"*paid a few thousand rupees in bribes per visa which he was reimbursed for by way of petty cash*.\"1749\n\nKhan II, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\n1345.\n\nAs for the \"*specific problems*\" identified by Dr. Jezek in his memorandum, Col. Khan testified that he realized in 2005 that the applications were \"*fraudulent, in the sense that they attached fake or dummy contracts (they were not the actual contracts of employment between the employee and TCC)*\" and \"*immediately pointed this out to Mr. Hargreaves*.\" According to Col. Khan, Mr. Hargreaves told him that \"*this is how it would be done as the company was not prepared to disclose actual financial data and other details to the government.*\" Col. Khan added that \"[e]*ach CEO after Mr. Hargreaves also knew that all work visa details and attached documentation was false*.\"1750\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 47.\n\n1346.\n\nMr. Hargreaves testified in his second witness statement that he did not personally handle visa applications but delegated this \"*routine and administrative*\" task to someone on the ground in Pakistan. Mr. Hargreaves confirmed that Col. Khan was responsible for supervising the process and added that to his knowledge, they did provide the information required by the application. He further explained that \"[d]*ue to security concerns about the risk of kidnapping and ransom, we tended to be cautious in disclosing only the minimally required personal financial information of employees on applications but this does not mean that I ever approved attaching* 'fake or dummy contracts.'\"1751\n\nHargreaves II, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\n1347.\n\nMr. Flores also responded to Col. Khan's testimony in his second witness statement, stating that while not being directly involved in overseeing the application process, he had \"*no reason to believe that the bribes Col. Khan alleges were ever paid*\" and had no knowledge and \"*no reason to suspect*\" that Col. Khan would falsify documents for work visa applications.1752\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 45.\n\n1348.\n\nMr. James \"*categorically reject*[ed]\" in his second witness statement Col. Khan's allegation that he had been aware of false documentation to visa applications and added that during his tenure as CEO, he was \"*not aware of any irregularities concerning visas, and never heard any suggestion that the documentation included with these applications contained any false information about employees*.\"1753\n\nJames II. \u00b6 33.\n\n1349.\n\nMs. Boggs noted in her fourth witness statement that while Col. Khan now claimed that regular payments were made to Government officials to obtain visas, he reported \"*potentially suspicious payments involving TCC employees*\" while she was CEO. She referred to the payments discovered in early 2009, which were discussed in detail above, and emphasized that it was Col. Khan who brought the incident involving Mr. Whisken to her attention and helped her to conduct the factual investigation that revealed the additional incident involving Mr. Flew.1754\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n1350.\n\nWhen Col. Khan was asked about this incident during the hearing, he responded with regard to the \"*fake visas*\" he had discovered: \"*Can you imagine, sir? We are talking about Tethyan Copper Company, one of the biggest mining companies, coming into Pakistan, and these stupid people could bring out such a bad name to us for taking unnecessary risk, a total unnecessary risk. That is why I reported the matter to Madam Cassie Boggs.*\"1755 Col. Khan also confirmed that Ms. Boggs \"*took the matter seriously*\" and fully supported his efforts to investigate and voluntarily and transparently report the matter to the authorities.1756\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 951 lines 13-21.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 953 line 19 to p. 955 line 10.\n\n1351.\n\nDr. Jezek confirmed in his second witness statement that shortly after he started as CEO in the summer of 2009, he reviewed his own work visa application that had been submitted on his behalf prior to his arrival and discovered that Col. Khan had signed in the space provided for the signature of Claimant's CEO and that the application was accompanied by a fictitious employment contract bearing wrong signatures in the employee and CEO signature areas. Dr. Jezek further stated that upon further investigation with local counsel, they discovered that these \"*flaws*\" existed in the visa applications for all ten of Claimant's expatriate employees. Dr. Jezek added: \"*I felt that this issue was sufficiently important to raise with the Board, but I did not consider it to be a corruption issue because, to the best of my recollection, I did not find evidence of bribery in the visa application process.*\"1757\n\nJezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n1352.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jezek, Col. Khan told him that this practice was necessary to obtain the work visas in a timely manner and that \"*the irregularities were not important because nobody actually reads the applications. He also indicated that the fictitious employment contracts were designed to conceal expatriates' true salary information*.\" Dr. Jezek testified that he understood this concern but considered that it did not justify these \"*irregularities*\" and therefore instructed Col. Khan to cease these practices immediately. Dr. Jezek added that he remembered Col. Khan being upset during that conversation and seeming to resent his authority, which contributed to his \"*strained relationship*\" with Col. Khan.1758\n\nJezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n1353.\n\nDr. Jezek testified that he determined at the time that Col. Khan was responsible for these practices and \"*did not find any evidence that TCC's senior management or owners ever sanctioned the procedures*.\" He added that he decided against taking disciplinary actions at the time, considering that in the absence of any evidence of corruption in the visa application process, the employees responsible deserved \"*a second chance*.\" Dr. Jezek stated that with the assistance of local counsel, he reformed the procedure and made it \"*clear that the old practices would not be tolerated going forward*.\" According to Dr. Jezek, this was unanimously endorsed by the Board, which he had informed of this issue by the memorandum discussed above.1759\n\nJezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.\n\n1354.\n\nAs for Col. Khan's allegation that bribes were paid in order to expedite the process, Dr. Jezek stated that he considered this to be \"*highly dubious*\" given that once the matter came to his attention, he looked into it \"*thoroughly*\" and did not find any evidence of payments being made.1760\n\nJezek II, \u00b6 21.\n\n1355.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are two distinct issues in this regard: (i) the allegation that bribes were being paid on a regular basis to the authorities in Islamabad to expedite the visa application process; and (ii) the discovery made by Dr. Jezek in September 2009 with regard to the applications and attached employment contracts.\n\n1356.\n\nThe first allegation is supported only by Col. Khan's written witness testimony where he stated that for every visa, \"*a few thousand rupees*\" were paid by Mr. Shahzad for which he was reimbursed via petty cash. Apart from the fact that there is no documentary evidence supporting this allegation, the Tribunal does not consider Col. Khan's testimony plausible. As Ms. Boggs testified, when he discovered in early 2009 that payments had been made in connection with the visas of Mr. Whisken and Mr. Flew, he reported them to Ms. Boggs and assisted her in investigating who was responsible for this wrongdoing. In addition, his own reaction during the hearing regarding his discovery of payments being made in Karachi does not accord with his written testimony that he was at the same time aware of payments being made to expedite the process in Islamabad. Finally, Dr. Jezek testified that he did not find any evidence of bribes being paid even though he thoroughly investigated the matter after having found out about irregularities in the documentation of visa applications. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the allegation that Mr. Shahzad regularly paid bribes in connection with obtaining work visas has not been established.\n\n1357.\n\nAs to the second issue that was identified by Dr. Jezek and reported to Claimant's Board of Directors in September 2009, Respondent argues that the submission of \"*fraudulent*\" visa applications contributes to \"*undermin*[ing] *TCC's vaunted corporate compliance structure*.\"1761 According to Claimant, on the other hand, Dr. Jezek's dealing with the issue he had identified serves to confirm that \"*TCC's anti-corruption policies were real*.\"1762 In the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to express a general view on Claimant's \"*corporate compliance culture*.\" The evidence in the record shows that up to 2009, the applications were signed by Col. Khan instead of the respective CEO and the attached employment contracts did not reflect the actual employment relationship between the employee and the company but were rather fictitious documents used for all applications. Regardless of whether there were plausible concerns to disclose financial information concerning the employees, this process was, as Dr. Jezek reported to the Board, not in line with the company's business ethics and could give rise to \"*far reaching consequences*.\"\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 103.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 265.\n\n1358.\n\nCol. Khan testified that since he became responsible for supervising the visa application process in 2005, Mr. Hargreaves and each of his successors knew about these practices. In response to this testimony, each of them denied having had any knowledge about the practices. Dr. Jezek further confirmed that his investigation did not reveal any indication that they did but he rather determined at the time that Col. Khan had been responsible for these practices. While Respondent notes that the issue was easily identified by Dr. Jezek when he became CEO \"*simply by reviewing his own work visa application*,\" Dr. Jezek also noted that his application had already been filed on his behalf before his arrival in Pakistan. Assuming that the same would have applied to Claimant's previous CEOs, it cannot be presumed that each of them did the same review after arriving in Pakistan.\n\n1359.\n\nOn that basis, it cannot be considered established that Claimant's CEOs were aware of and endorsed the practices identified by Dr. Jezek. In the Tribunal's view, it therefore again has to be taken into account how the issue was addressed once it came to the attention of Claimant's CEO Dr. Jezek in September 2009. It is undisputed that Dr. Jezek investigated the matter, reported it to Claimant's Board of Directors and, most importantly, implemented a reform of the procedure, as demonstrated by the document entitled \"*Work Visa: Applicating Procedure*\" dating from 5 March 2010 in which expatriate employees were informed about the steps involved and the requirements to be met *vis-\u00e0-vis* the various authorities involved.1763\n\n**Exhibit RE-406**.\n\n1360.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that it remains unclear whether these practices, even if they were to be qualified as \"*fraudulent*\" as claimed by Respondent, had a relevant impact on Claimant's investment. In particular, there is no indication and it has not even been alleged that any of the visas that were granted on the basis of fictitious employment contracts would have been denied if the correct information had been attached and thus that any of Claimant's expatriate employees would not have been permitted to work in Pakistan.\n\n1361.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to establish that the irregularities in the visa application process for Claimant's expatriate employees that came to light in the course of 2009 reflected a general lack of diligence or respect for Pakistani laws on the part of Claimant's representatives. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether and, if so, to what extent such a finding would be relevant to Claimant's claims under the Treaty.\n\n**g. Allegations Relating to the Mineral Agreement and/or the Mining Lease**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1362.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address Respondent's allegation that between 2006 and 2010, Claimant \"*paid and offered numerous bribes to key Government decision-makers \u2026 in return for their assistance procuring a Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease*.\"1764\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 207.\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1363.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant made and offered four bribes to key Government officials between 2006 and 2010 in the aim to obtain the Mineral Agreement, which, as acknowledged by Claimant's witnesses, was necessary to secure financing for the project and the Mining Lease -\n\na) According to Mr. Farooq, the first of these payments was of USD 20,000 made by Mr. Flores to CS Rind in 2007 in return for his cooperation with the Mineral Agreement.1765 Respondent argues that although Mr. Flores denies having made this payment, inconsistencies between his evidence and Ms. Boggs' evidence as to his contact with Chief Secretary Rind suggest that Mr. Farooq's evidence is to be preferred.1766\n\nb) Secondly, USD 100,000 was allegedly offered by Mr. James to Mr. Farooq in 2008 for his assistance in obtaining a Mineral Agreement.1767 Despite Mr. James denying this offer, Respondent argues that his tendency to misremember and fabricate evidence supports Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan's turn of events.1768 Although Claimant criticized Col. Khan for not including this in his NAB section 161 statement or his section 164 statement, Col. Khan explained that this was because he only witnessed the offer and was unsure whether the money was paid to Mr. Farooq or not.1769\n\nc) Thirdly, according to Mr. Mustikhan, an offer of \"*millions,*\" of project contracts and of jobs was made by Dr. Jezek in September 2009 to two ministers in Chief Minister Raisani's Cabinet in return for them forming a pressure group in the provincial government aiming to secure the Mineral Agreement for Claimant.1770 Respondent maintains that Claimant has foregone two opportunities to defend itself against this allegation (Dr. Jezek did not mention this allegation in his witness statements, and Mr. Mustikhan was not challenged on this in cross-examination) and thus there is no reason not to accept Mr. Mustikhan's evidence at face value.1771\n\nd) Furthermore, Respondent alleges that a range of evidence before the Tribunal, spanning many years and witnesses, is remarkably consistent in demonstrating that Claimant also attempted to bribe Chief Minister Raisani with USD 1 million in or around 2009 in order to obtain his approval of the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease.1772\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 208 *referring to* Farooq II, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 208-210 *referring to* Flores II, \u00b6 39, Transcript (Day 10), p. 2573 line 17, Boggs I, \u00b6 25, Transcript (Day 10), p. 2576 lines 5-10 *and* p. 2508 lines 4-12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 211 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 19, *citing* Khan II, \u00b6 9 and Farooq II, \u00b6 17 *and* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1017 lines 10-18 and p. 1019 lines 1-5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 211.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 211 *referring to* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1019 lines 6-12 *and* p. 1024 lines 12-20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 212-213 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 26 *and* Mustikhan, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 213.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-74; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 214 *referring to* **Demonstrative RD-1**, item 27 *and* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 246.\n\n1364.\n\nIn relation to the bribe allegedly offered to Chief Minister Raisani, Respondent submits that following Mr. Farooq's assertion that \"*TCC needed to have CM Raisani in its pocket,*\" Col. Khan allegedly calculated that for less than USD 1 million, Claimant could purchase a house and car which would be a \"*reasonable price for obtaining the loyalty of the CM*\" with which Mr. Flores was allegedly in favor.1773 Although Mr. Flores denies agreeing to present this option to Claimant's Board of Directors, Respondent argues that Col. Khan's evidence is to be preferred for multiple reasons. Firstly, at the time Mr. Flores was still involved with Claimant as a Board Member and he admitted that Chief Minister Raisani was an important decision-maker with regard to the Mineral Agreement.1774 Secondly, Mr. Flew confirmed that key aspects of Col. Khan's evidence (such as the price of the plot of land and house in Islamabad) had been known to other TCC employees for years.1775 Thirdly, Col. Khan has shown consistency in his recollection of events, giving the same account to Mr. Flew and Claimant's counsel in mid-2015, then to the NAB and to this Tribunal.1776\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 215 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, Flores II, \u00b6 40 *and* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2617 lines 11-13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 216 *referring to* Transcript (Day 10), p. 2616 lines 9-17.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 217 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 219 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-459**, p.6, Khan I, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 *and* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\n1365.\n\nRespondent claims that this USD 1 million bribe was then offered to Chief Minister Raisani in 2009, as alleged by the Chief Minister in a January 2010 meeting as well as publicly in the Pakistani press.1777 Respondent submits that the timing of the documentary and witness evidence regarding this attempted bribe strongly supports the truth of it, raising concerns as to Claimant's failure to mention this to the Tribunal at an earlier stage of the proceedings.1778 Respondent argues that if Claimant truly believed that Chief Minister Raisani had wrongly accused TCC of corruption in order to extort it (as it now claims), this would presumably have been asserted in support of Claimant's argument that Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of protection.1779\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 222-228 *referring to* Jezek I, \u00b6 65, Boggs IV, \u00b6 38, **Exhibits RE-430 / AM-7A** and **RE-431 / AM-7B**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 73.\n\n1366.\n\nRespondent relies on the testimony of Dr. Jezek regarding the rumor of a USD 1 million bribe he had learned of in late 2009 and Mr. Mustikhan's admission of approaching Chief Minister Raisani in late November/early December on Dr. Jezek's instruction with Claimant's offer of a bribe and argues that Claimant misrepresents a number of contemporaneous documents in an attempt to counter such allegations.1780 Moreover, Respondent rejects the criticism of its reliance on statements made by Chief Minister Raisani to the press on the basis that if he were available, Respondent certainly would have spoken to him directly about the allegation. Respondent reiterates that Mr. Raisani left Pakistan years ago and is believed to be residing in Malta at present.1781\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 223-227; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 72.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 228 *referring to* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 256.\n\n1367.\n\nRespondent considers it higly relevant that Claimant was interested at the time in whether Chief Minister Raisani was amenable to taking bribes and that there was a focus on initiatives to increase the chances of successfully accessing the Chief Minister around the time of the meeting in which Chief Minister Raisani was offered the USD 1 million bribe.1782 Respondent maintains that this initiative included Claimant's donation of USD 100,000 to Chief Minister Raisani's relief fund for the earthquake in Ziarat given Col. Khan and Ms. Boggs belief that \"*there was a good chance the money would end up in CM Raisani's personal bank account.*\"1783\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 364.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 364 *referring to* Khan II*,* \u00b6 26.\n\n1368.\n\nRespondent maintains that the actions of Mr. Mustikhan and Dr. Jezek are attributable to Claimant. Not only was Dr. Jezek CEO of Claimant at the time, but witnesses have testified that he actively encouraged Mr. Mustikhan's attempts to bribe Chief Minister Raisani (and that he himself offered financial rewards to senior members of the Balochistan cabinet to support TCC in respect of the project).1784 Respondent thus maintains that Claimant is responsible for his actions carried out in its interests. Moreover, given that he explicitly endorsed Mr. Mustikhan's bribery efforts (who was also acting for and on behalf of TCC), Respondent maintains that Mr. Mustikhan's conduct is also legally attributable to Claimant.1785\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 60 *referring to* Mustikhan, \u00b6 11, 12, 18, Dad I, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\nRespondent's Application, \u00b6 60.\n\n1369.\n\nRespondent argues that despite Claimant not securing the Mineral Agreement or Mining Lease, the bribes were still improper under Pakistani law, the FCPA and the anti-bribery and corruption policies of TCC, Barrick Gold and Antofagasta.1786 Respondent also asks the Tribunal to draw the appropriate inferences from Claimant's reluctance to provide evidence and investigation documents in relation to Barrick Gold's investigation into Chief Minister Raisani's allegation of bribery in early 2010 under the pretext of privilege.1787\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 229; Respondent's Application, \u00b6\u00b6 80-87.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 229-232.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1370.\n\nAs an initial matter, Claimant asserts that Respondent's allegations regarding the Mineral Agreement are irrelevant given the undeniable fact that the agreement was never achieved.1788 Nonetheless, Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to prove its allegations since they are based on the testimony of Mr. Mustikhan and Mr. Dad who are discredited witnesses (the former for reasons elaborated on below and the latter in relation to Pakistan's other \"*scattershot allegations,*\" particularly his vague, unsubstantiated claims that Claimant paid journalists to report in its favor).1789\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 170.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 170, \u00b6\u00b6 234-238, 278-281.\n\n1371.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's claims are also allegedly contrary to the record and common sense.1790 Claimant firstly submits that Mr. Flores: (i) denied having a conversation with Mr. Farooq as to promised rewards and personal benefits; and (ii) explained that Mr. Farooq's allegation makes little sense given his lack of influence in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and lack of authority to grant a mining lease. Claimant argues that conflicting dates in his recollection of events also cast doubt on the credibility of his testimony.1791 Claimant secondly submits that Dr. Jezek has likewise denied offering any jobs, contracts or other improper benefits to Government officials. In addition, his efforts towards the strategy to increase local engagement in the project, undermine any suggestion that he was trying to achieve those goals through corruption.1792\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 169-175.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 171-173 *referring to* Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, Farooq I, \u00b6 15 *and* Flores II, \u00b6 25.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175.\n\n1372.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant perceives Respondent's attempts to resurrect Chief Minister Raisani's accusations that TCC tried to bribe him to be fatally deficient.1793 Firstly, Claimant argues that Respondent has never explained why Chief Minister Raisani has not appeared in these proceedings to make the accusations himself, rather than relying on \"*implausible testimony, uncorroborated and inconsistent rumours, and* [his] *unhinged rants in the local Pakistani press.*\"1794 Secondly, Claimant perceives these allegations to make no sense given that Chief Minister Raisani was looking to oust TCC so that Balochistan could take control of the project.1795 Claimant submits that the alleged offer, if it had indeed occurred, would have been sufficient reason to kick TCC out of the project, making it inconceivable that it was not used as a justification for taking over the project and denying the Mining Lease Application.1796 Claimant further criticizes Respondent's citation of only three documents as supposed proof of the bribe attempt, including Chief Minister Raisani's public statement in 2013, which it considers to prove nothing but his reputation for making exaggerated claims for political reasons.1797\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 232 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-73.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 233.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 234 *referring to* Transcript (Day 6), p. 1558 lines 3\u20137 *and* Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 248.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 234 *referring to* Transcript (Day 6), p. 1559 line 19 to p. 1560 line 1.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 248 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-73 *and* **Exhibit AM-7**.\n\n1373.\n\nClaimant further asks the Tribunal to reject Respondent's contentions in respect of Chief Minister Raisani based on the argument that the witness testimony at the hearings confirmed their falsity.1798\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 235.\n\n1374.\n\nClaimant rejects the first version of Respondent's allegation that in December 2009, Mr. Mustikhan offered Chief Minister Raisani the opportunity to name his price in exchange for the Mineral Agreement, after having received instructions from Dr. Jezek on 26 September 2009. Claimant argues that this claim is vague and unsubstantiated and deems it to be \"*highly implausible*\" that Mr. Mustikhan would have waited three months to act on Dr. Jezek's instructions.1799\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 236-238.\n\n1375.\n\nClaimant further rejects Respondent's allegation that a USD 1 million bribe was offered as alleged by Chief Minister Raisani during the January 2010 meeting, relying on the testimony of both Ms. Boggs and Dr. Jezek.1800 Claimant maintains that despite its repeated attempts, Respondent cannot impugn Claimant for its failure to investigate the allegation given Dr. Jezek and Ms. Boggs' agreement that the lack of details in this allegation made it incapable of investigation.1801 In any event, Claimant submits that as soon as the allegation was communicated to TCC, it inquired into the matter and could find no evidence in support of the claim.1802\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241 *referring to* Transcript (Day 12), p. 3127 line 15 to p. 3128 line 1 *and* Transcript (Day 11), p. 2895 lines 3\u20134 and 15\u201318.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 254 *referring to* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 73(d), Jezek I, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, Jezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64 and Boggs IV, \u00b6 41.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 254 *referring to* Jezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\n1376.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that Respondent's claim that TCC offered a car and a house to Chief Minister Raisani was disproven at the hearing by Mr. Flores, Mr. Flew and Ms. Boggs.1803\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 242 *referring to* Khan II, \u00b6\u00b6 24\u201325, Farooq II, \u00b6 60, Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71\u201374, Transcript (Day 10), p. 2619, lines 1\u201314, p. 2623 line 16 p. 2626 line 2, Transcript (Day 11), p. 3018 line 15 to p. 3019 line 2 *and* Boggs IV, \u00b6 9.\n\n1377.\n\nAdditionally, on any of these versions, Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to explain how the acts of an independent consultant like Mr. Mustikhan would even be attributable to Claimant.1804 Claimant argues that Mr. Mustikhan was not even an agent of TCC but a mere consultant who signed a consulting contract that contained clear anti-bribery policies and explicit restrictions on the scope of this authority to bind the company in violation of this agreement, which he admitted to understanding.1805\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 243.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 243 *referring to* **Exhibit RE-379**; Transcript (Day 6), pp. 1496\u20131504.\n\n1378.\n\nClaimant also asks the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent's separate allegation attacking TCC's efforts to support the local community by making a disaster relief donation in the wake of a 2008 earthquake. Claimant maintains that the public nature of the donation, contemporaneous e-mails and the testimony of Ms. Boggs all confirm that the fund was legitimate and not an attempt to divert the money into Chief Minister Raisani's personal bank account.1806\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 258; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 244-246.\n\n**iii. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n1379.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the rights or benefits to which these final allegations relate were ultimately never obtained, given that a Mineral Agreement that was being negotiated between the Parties starting in 2007 was never concluded and the Mining Lease that TCCP applied for in February 2011 was denied by the Licensing Authority on 15 November 2011. Nevertheless, the Tribunal also notes that Respondent raises serious allegations in this regard that would directly implicate Claimant's CEOs if they were proven. In addition, Respondent argues that the offer of a payment of a bribe is, in and of itself, illegal under Pakistani and US law and is thus \"*clearly relevant to the issue of whether TCC was a fit and proper person to hold a Mining Licence and the state of mind of the CM, a key decision-maker in the context of that Mining Licence decision process*.\"1807 In Respondent's view, the Tribunal has not yet made a finding on the effect of the corruption evidence on Claimant's ability to meet the test of \"*fit and proper person*\" and thus whether the alleged corrupt acts justified a denial of the Mining Lease Application.1808\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 229.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 433.\n\n1380.\n\nWithout expressing any opinion on the merits of Respondent's argument at the present stage, the Tribunal will carefully assess the evidence supporting each of these allegations. Should any of these allegations be proven, the Tribunal will turn to their relevance to Claimant's claims under the Treaty.\n\n1381.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent raises four allegations of actual or attempted corruption in this regard:1809\n\ni. Payment of USD 20,000 by Mr. Flores to Chief Secretary Rind in the presence of Mr. Farooq in 2007 \"*in return for his cooperation with the Mineral Agreement*\";\n\nii. Offer of a payment of USD 100,000 by Mr. James to Mr. Farooq in 2008 \"*to continue*[] *to support the Reko Diq project and help*[] *TCC to obtain the Mineral Agreement*\";\n\niii. Offer of \"*millions*,\" project contracts and jobs by Dr. Jezek to Mr. Marri and Mr. Buledi, two ministers in Chief Minister Raisani's cabinet, in September 2009 \"*to form a pressure group within the provincial government and Cabinet with the aim of securing the Mineral Agreement for TCC*\";\n\niv. Offer of a payment of USD 1 million by Mr. Mustikhan, on Dr. Jezek's instructions, to Chief Minister Raisani in late November / early December 2009 \"*to obtain a mineral agreement and mining lease*.\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 208-228; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.\n\n1382.\n\nIn support of these allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, Col. Khan and Mr. Mustikhan, which will be addressed in detail below. In the context of the attempted bribe of Chief Minister Raisani, Respondent also refers to contemporaneous documentary evidence pursuant to which Chief Minister Raisani raised the allegation of having received such an offer in early 2010.\n\n**(a) Payment of USD 20,000 by Mr. Flores to Chief Secretary Rind**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1383.\n\nRespondent claims that \"*to put the loyalty of CS Rind beyond doubt,*\" after he had already attended the trip to Toronto in March 2007, which was discussed in detail above, \"*TCC paid him a further bribe of US$ 20,000 soon after his return from Canada in 2007.*\"1810 In addition, Respondent alleges that Chief Secretary Rind received \"*expensive and imported wine and liquor*\" from TCC, which Respondent decribes as a \"*prize gift in Pakistan*\" because it is illegal for Muslims to buy.1811 In support of its allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony from Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 340.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 339 (note 1190).\n\n1384.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Farooq stated that having read Mr. Flores' testimony that he had had \"*only limited interactions with Mr. Farooq, and most of them were in connection with Operating Committee meetings*,\"1812 he, Mr. Farooq, had \"*remembered one particular incident involving* [Mr. Flores].\" Mr. Farooq then testified as follows:\n\n\"*There was a meeting between Mr K.B. Rind (the Provincial CS) and Mr Flores in CS Rind's house in Quetta in 2007. Mr Flores and CS Rind had a good relationship and Mr Flores used to supply liquor to him. I arranged the meeting and also attended, arriving before Mr Flores. The meeting was shortly after the trip to Toronto, Canada \u2026 and we discussed the trip and the Mineral Agreement. Mr Flores arrived at the meeting with a briefcase. At the end of the meeting, he told CS Rind that he had a gift for him and he handed over the briefcase to CS Rind, which he said contained US$ 20,000. CS Rind partly opened the briefcase and I saw that it contained US currency. CS Rind seemed to be expecting the money. CS Rind told Mr Flores that he should not worry,* 'the company will get my full co-operation'.\"1813\n\nFlores I, \u00b6 28.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 16.\n\n1385.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Farooq was pointed to the fact that he had not mentioned this incident in his first witness statement or his statement before the NAB in September 2015 but only raised it in response to the witness statements filed by Claimant together with its Opposition. Mr. Farooq responded:\n\n\"*Yes. There was two or three reasons for that. One is that I--whatever bribery case took place, which was directly linked with me, I explained--the money I took or gave I explained.*\n\n*And the other thing was Rind was a very influential person, tribal person. I could not talk against him, so I was worried that he might destroy me or take an action against me. So, I could not complain against the Chief Secretary about his secret, about his weaknesses. I could not open them. I did not have that courage.*\n\n*When they started refusing; the opposition then I said I will see and then I could explain. And then whatever points I had, I explained. And then there was a case about this Flores, and then I explained that as well*.\"1814\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 801 line 20 to p. 802 line 13.\n\n1386.\n\nIn response to the question when he had remembered this incident, Mr. Farooq stated:\n\n\"*I had already remembered. I remembered this earlier as well. I am telling you the reasons why did I not explain it beforehand; because I am a family person with children, and I was worried that they will harass me. And because he belonged to a big tribe and he was a very influential person and he would create problems for me if he knew about it, and I was worried about these things that's why I did not want to give statement against these higher-up people.*\n\n*And when the opposition increased, I thought I should also come out and tell the Government; so I told these things*.\"1815\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 803 line 16 to p. 804 line 5.\n\n1387.\n\nMr. Farooq confirmed that he had deliberately concealed the information from the NAB \"[b]*ecause I am not directly involved, so I don't need to tell about it. And because he was a higher-up officer at that time*.\" When asked why, despite the consequences he had described, he decided to make the allegation in the present arbitration, Mr. Farooq answered that he became upset when reading the denial of any bribery by Claimant's representatives and so \"*decided that whatever points I have, I would bring it up in the interest of the nation and tell that these are the incidents which took place, and these are the corruptions that happened*.\"1816\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 805 line 5 to p. 806 line 20. *See also* p. 809 line 14 to p. 810 line 4.\n\n1388.\n\nCol. Khan did not testify about the alleged payment of USD 20,000 but confirmed in his second witness statement that \"*Mr Flores used to provide expensive and imported wine and liquor to the Chief Secretary of Balochistan, Mr K.B. Rind*\" and added that he, Col. Khan, \"*also delivered liquor on behalf of Mr Flores to CS Rind on many occasions*.\" Col. Khan stated that he \"*spent hundreds of thousands of rupees on liquor for CS Rind on behalf of TCC*\" and that \"[i]*n addition to the expense, being illegal, these gifts created influence for TCC with CS Rind. When Mr Flores would visit CS Rind at his office in Quetta, CS Rind would call all of his key secretaries (e.g. Secretary of Finance, Secretary of Mines) and hold a* darbar *(court) where all secretaries were made answerable to Mr Flores on projet-related issues*.\" Col. Khan further testified that he and Mr. Flores also went to see the Chief Secretary \"*to seek a favourable verdict in the TCC case pending in the Balochistan High Court*\" and were told by the Chief Secretary that he had met with the Chief Justice and that \"*a favourable verdict would be delivered*\" as it indeed was later that year.1817\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 20.\n\n1389.\n\nIn response to this testimony, Mr. Flores testified in his second witness statement that besides \"*a single bottle of Chilean wine*\" that he gave to Chief Secretary Rind \"*as a business gift*\" during the trip to Toronto, he did \"*not recall giving Chief Secretary Rind wine or liquor on any other occasion*\" and never authorized Col. Khan to do so nor was he aware that Col. Khan ever did so. Mr. Flores also denied Col. Khan's allegation that the Chief Secretary would make his secretaries answerable to him at the meetings they had or that he received the Chief Secretary's assurance of a favorable ruling in the case pending before the Balochistan High Court.1818 Mr. Flores further strongly rejected Mr. Farooq's allegation that he had given a briefcase containing USD 20,000 to Chief Secretary at his house, stating:\n\n\"*I never made any such payment, at any time, to Chief Secretary Rind or any other other government officials, and am deeply disturbed to have these slanderous and fictitious allegations of such a serious nature made against me. The other facts in Mr. Farooq's allegation are also false. While I do recall having at least one meeting with Chief Secretary Rind in a guest house owned by the Government of Balochistan, I do not remember ever attending any meetings at Chief Secretary Rind's home. Nor do I recall any meeting attended by only Chief Secretary Rind, Mr. Farooq, and myself. As a general matter, in order to minimize the risk or appearance of impropriety, I would not attend meetings with government officials alone*.\"1819\n\nFlores II, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 39.\n\n1390.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Flores again denied both Col. Khan's testimony that he supplied exensive, imported liquor to Chrief Secretary Rind and Mr. Farooq's testimony that he gave him a briefcase containing USD 20,000. Mr. Flores confirmed that during the months from late 2006 until the time Mr. Rind left as Chief Secretary, he met with him \"*10 times, maybe less\"* but denied that he met him \"*off-line from formal meetings*\" with one exception at the hotel in Toronto.1820 When pointed to Ms. Boggs' testimony in the previous phase of this arbitration that he \"*forged a good relationship with the Chief Secretary of Balochistan, K.B. Rind, and ensured that Mr. Rind was constantly informed of developments*,\"1821 Mr. Flores confirmed that he \"*did have a good relationship with him*\" and \"*remembered to have had several meetings with him at his office at Quetta*\" but did not recall to have had \"*informal meetings with him*.\" Mr. Flores maintained that he did not remember \"*to have had any single meeting by* [him] *self with a government authority*,\" adding that this was not his way of conducting business or meetings with government officers.1822\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2570 line 21 to p. 2572 line 19.\n\nBoggs I, \u00b6 25.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2573 line 5 to p. 2575 line 19.\n\n1391.\n\nAs for the allegation raised by Mr. Farooq, Mr. Flores testified that \"[t]*hat is absolutely false and makes no sense*,\" explaining that \"*that was the very beginning of the conversation on the Mineral Agreement. There was nothing to agree at that time. We're talking about the first half of 2007, the discussion was not even started. And further, the discussion went for another year, maybe another year. So, there was \u2026 nothing to agree to discuss at that point*.\"1823\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2576 lines 4-15.\n\n1392.\n\nBased on the witness evidence presented by the Parties, it cannot be considered established that Mr. Flores made a payment of USD 20,000 to Chief Secretary Rind. In support of this allegation, Respondent relies exclusively on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq, who described this alleged payment for the first time in his second witness statement. In the Tribunal's view, Mr. Farooq's explanation during the hearing as to why he did not mention the alleged payment either in his first witness statement or in his statement before the NAB is not convincing. While he stated in his second witness statement that he remembered this incident after having read Mr. Flores' first witness statement, he testified during the hearing that he always remembered the incident but that he did not mention it before the NAB because he was testifying only about acts of bribery in which he was directly involved and because he was concerned about the consequences of accusing Mr. Rind whom he described as \"*a very influential person \u2026 that would create problems for* [him].\" While the Tribunal would not exclude that raising an accusation of corruption against a high-ranking Government officer could indeed give rise to consequences for the accusing individual, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Mr. Farooq simply changed his mind and decided to raise the allegation after Claimant's representatives had denied the allegations of corruption in their witness statements submitted together with Claimant's Opposition.\n\n1393.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal takes note of Mr. Flores' firm denial of this allegation in both his written and oral testimony as well as of his testimony that he did not recall to have ever had an informal meeting with Chief Secretary Rind. While Respondent placed much emphasis during the hearing on Ms. Boggs' previous testimony that Mr. Flores \"*forged a good relationship*\" with the Chief Secretary and kept him \"*constantly informed of developments*,\" the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that this testimony indicates that Mr. Flores met with him informally or without any other people being present. Finally, the Tribunal also notes Mr. Flores' testimony that it would not have made any sense to make a payment in early 2007, which was before the negotiations on the Mineral Agreement had started and the first draft had been exchanged.\n\n1394.\n\nConsequently, in the absence of any further evidence supporting Mr. Farooq's testimony, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that Mr. Flores made a payment of US 20,000 to Chief Secretary Rind \"*in return for his cooperation with the Mineral Agreement.*\"\n\n1395.\n\nAs for the additional allegation raised by Col. Khan, *i.e*., that he and Mr. Flores gave gifts in the form of expensive, imported liquor to Chief Secretary Rind on several occasions, the Tribunal again notes that this allegation is based exclusively on the witness testimony of Col. Khan and Mr. Farooq. Apart from the absence of any documentary evidence that Col. Khan indeed spent \"*hundreds of thousands of rupees*\" on liquor for the Chief Secretary, Col. Khan did not identify any specific incident on which Mr. Flores and he himself actually provided such a gift to the Chief Secretary. In addition, there is no evidence supporting Col. Khan's testimony that in return for this supply with liquor, the Chief Secretary always summoned his secretaries and made them answerable to Mr. Farooq whenever they had a meeting. In any event, the Tribunal notes that this alleged conduct would not qualify as a sufficiently concrete right or benefit that Claimant obtained in relation to its investment. Finally, there is no evidence supporting the allegation that Chief Secretary exercised influence on the Chief Justice in respect of the pending case in the Balochistan High Court to obtain a ruling favorable to Claimant.\n\n1396.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent's allegations regarding a payment of USD 20,000 and expensive gifts made to Chief Secretary Rind in 2007 have not been established.\n\n**(b) Offer by Mr. James to Pay USD 100,000 to Mr. Farooq**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1397.\n\nRespondent further claims that Mr. James promised Mr. Farooq in 2008 to pay him USD 100,000 if he \"*continued to favour TCC and ensured that the agreements TCC was requesting got through*.\"1824 In support of this allegation, Respondent again relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 340, *quoting from* Farooq II, \u00b6 17.\n\n1398.\n\nMr. Farooq testified in his second witness statement that having read Mr James' first witness statement that he \"*never saw or heard anything about bribes or illicit payments involving TCC*,\"1825 he recalled \"*one incident that shows otherwise*.\" Mr. Farooq then stated:\n\n\"*I once met* [Mr. James] *in Balochistan House with Col. Sher Khan to discuss the Mineral Agreement. It was in early 2008. Mr James promised that he would give me US$ 100,000 if I continued to favour TCC and ensured that the agreements TCC was requesting got through. I never actually received this money*.\"1826\n\nJames I, \u00b6 30.\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 17.\n\n1399.\n\nCol. Khan confirmed Mr. Farooq's testimony in his second witness statement, stating that he witnessed the offer being made by Mr. James to Mr. Farooq. He testified:\n\n\"*In early 2008, Mr James and I attended a meeting with Mr Farooq at Balochistan House in Islamabad. The meeting took place shortly before TCC moved its application for surface rights. At the meeting, Mr Farooq told Mr James how important he was for TCC's project. Mr James acknowledged this and thanked Mr Farooq for his support. However Mr Farooq pressed on, saying that he should be adequately compensated for his assistance. Mr Farooq asked Mr James for US$ 100,000 to be paid into one of his bank accounts in Dubai. Mr James said that if Mr Farooq continued to support the project and helped to get the mining agreement, he would indeed be paid US$ 100,000. He also told Mr Farooq that he would benefit through project contracts once the project development works began. Mr Farooq was very happy with Mr James' offer.*\"1827\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 9.\n\n1400.\n\nDuring the hearing, Col. Khan confirmed that this alleged offer was the largest bribe that he was aware of ever being offered by Claimant to a Government official but denied that this had been an \"*occasion* [he] *took note of*\" and described it as \"*absolutely normal dealing*.\"1828 When pointed to the fact that he had not included this incident in his statement before the NAB or in his Section 164 statement before the magistrate, Col. Khan testified that his interview with the NAB had been \"*question and answers, a lot of questions, and then, finally, the Statement came up.*\" He noted that this had been only a first statement and emphasized that \"*there were lot many things I didn't remember, and then there were things that I recollect afterwards, but, basically, when you say not included, I want to make it very, very clear here that, it all was in a question-and-answer forms.*\" Col. Khan confirmed that he had been asked by the NAB to confirm specific facts and added with regard to the USD 100,000 offer that \"*this did not come up in our discussion in the NAB*.\"1829\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1017 line 10 to p. 1018 line 17.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1019 line 6 to p. 1021 line 1.\n\n1401.\n\nCol. Khan was also pointed to the fact that he had not mentioned the alleged offer in his first witness statement in this arbitration. He answered that \"*again, there's so many things that I spoke were not included*\" and added: \"*You see, actually, what happened is that I was keeping the grace of my CEOs; right? I kept their grace until the end, but then when I read their testimonies, when I saw their papers, what they were talking, they were giving a picture that they were saints, they knew nothing, they had done no illegal, and then I said okay*.\"1830 Col. Khan further stated that he had remembered the offer at the time of his first witness statement but had not mentioned it because he was not aware that any money had actually been paid. When pointed to the alleged offer to Chief Minister Raisani that he did mention in his first witness statement, Col. Khan answered that he had been \"*very much involved in this case*\" and \"*saw what was happening*\"; he then confirmed that he had also witnessed the alleged offer made by Mr. James to Mr. Farooq.1831\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1021 line 3 to p. 1022 line 8.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1023 line 22 to p. 1026 line 14.\n\n1402.\n\nMr. James rejected the allegation that he promised to pay Mr. Farooq USD 100,000 in his second witness statement as \"*completely false, and offensive to* [him] *both personally and professionally*.\" He added that while he remembered the meeting at Balochistan House after having read the witness statements of Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan, his recollection was \"*vastly different from the accounts Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan have presented*.\"1832 Mr. James explained that at the time he had been trying to increase the frequency of, and set a more regular schedule for, Operating Committee meetings, which had been \"*impossible*\" so far \"*despite several attempts, because* [Mr. Farooq] *claimed that he was too busy*.\"1833 Mr. James then testified:\n\n\"*The meeting at Balochistan House came about on Col. Khan's suggestion that I use the occasion of an internal meeting of Balochistan Government officials in Islamabad to meet with Mr. Farooq, and express the importance of coordination for moving the project forward, and therefore of regularly scheduled Operating Committee meetings. I proposed to meet Mr. Farooq at TCC's office, but he informed us that he could only fit us into his schedule if we went to him at Balochistan House. Because Mr. Farooq had no other time available, I agreed to his request.*\n\n*Col. Khan accompanied me to this meeting. The meeting did not last for more than 30 minutes, because Mr. Farooq arrived late and then left early to return to his meetings with officials. After a few minutes of pleasantries, I explained the need to establish a more formal operation of the Joint Venture given the project's scale and complexity. At no point during this meeting\u2014or any other meeting with Mr. Farooq\u2014did I make the alleged promise to pay him any sum of money or give him anything of value, and I flatly reject any suggestion to that effect by Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan*.\"1834\n\nJames II, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\nJames II, \u00b6 5.\n\nJames II, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\n1403.\n\nMr. James further stated that he did not recall whether Mr. Farooq's support for the project was discussed at that meeting but considered it doubtful \"*because this meeting had a very specific objective of explaining the complexity of such a large project, and the importance of more formal operation of the Joint Venture*.\" He added that if there had been any discussion regarding support, it would have been \"*general comments about the overall benefits that a successful project would bring for everyone, including the local community and all stakeholders, and in no way specific to any benefit Mr. Farooq might personally receive*.\"1835\n\nJames II, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n1404.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. James was asked whether he was aware of the allegations raised by Mr. Farooq and Col. Khan and answered that he was \"*highly offended by them*\" because he had \"*never made any type of payment or any type of offer like that, and* [he] *did not do it at the time*.\" Mr. James added: \"*And Mr. Farooq in that came waltzing in, waving his hands, did not have enough time to even sit down as he walked around the room for a second and said,* 'I've really got to get back to this government meeting. I'm sorry,' *and he was out the door*.\"1836 Mr. James stated that he did not know whether Mr. Farooq would have been receptive to an offer of USD 100,000 but emphasized: \"*Mr. Farooq was having a big fantasy that day if he thought I had made any kind of an offer to him because there is no way that I would make an offer like that*.\"1837\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2764 lines 6-22.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2765 lines 9-16.\n\n1405.\n\nBased on the evidence above, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that Mr. James made an offer to Mr. Farooq to pay him USD 100,000 if he continued to support Claimant and the project and ensured that the Mineral Agreement would be concluded. In particular, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that neither Mr. Farooq nor Col. Khan mentioned this alleged incident in their first witness statements or in any of their statements provided to the Pakistani authorities. In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by Col. Khan's explanation that an offer of USD 100,000 made by CEO of Claimant \"*did not come up*\" during his interview with the NAB or that he did not refer to it in his first witness statement because it was not sufficiently specific or because he had not witnessed an actual payment being made. As for Col. Khan's testimony that he was \"*keeping the grace*\" of Claimant's CEOs and in particular Mr. James, Claimant pointed to various statements in his first witness statement in which he had stated that he \"*was always open and transparent*\" with various CEOs about payments he made to Mr. Farooq and others and that he gave them \"*the full picture*.\"1838\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1022 line 9 to p. 1023 line 19, *quoting from* Khan I, \u00b6 17.\n\n1406.\n\nAs for Mr. Farooq, the Tribunal notes that he did refer in both his statement before the NAB and his Section 164 statement before the magistrate to great benefits and handsome rewards he would receive if he helped Claimant to finalize the Mineral Agreement.1839 If a specific offer of USD 100,000 had been made in that very same context, it is simply not credible that he would not have mentioned it or that it would not have been recorded in either of those statements.\n\n**Exhibit RE-457**, p. 6; **Exhibit RE-467**, \u00b6 7.\n\n1407.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Mr. James strongly rejected this allegation and gave a detailed account of how the meeting at Balochistan House came about and what the intention and focus was on his side.\n\n1408.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the alleged payment offer cannot be considered established and that the allegation that Mr. James made an offer to Mr. Farooq to pay him USD 100,000 must therefore be rejected.\n\n**(c) Offer by Dr. Jezek to Pay \"*****Millions*****\" and Provide Project Contracts and Jobs for Mr. Marri and Mr. Buledi**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1409.\n\nRespondent's third allegation in this context is that Dr. Jezek, in the presence of Mr. Mustikhan, offered two ministers in Chief Minister Raisani's cabinet, Mr. Marri and Mr. Buledi, \"'millions' *as well as projects contracts and jobs for themselves and other officials who assisted TCC*\" if they agreed to form a pressure group within the Balochistan government with the aim to secure the Mineral Agreement.1840 In support of this allegation, Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Mustikhan.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 212.\n\n1410.\n\nMr. Mustikhan testified in his witness statement that in late 2009, he and Dr. Jezek attended a meeting with Chief Minister Raisani in the context of Claimant's aim to conclude a Mineral Agreement and obtain a Mining Lease. Mr. Mustikhan described this meeting as \"*inconclusive, with CM Raisani expressing his desire that TCCP should include an in-country smelter and do more to ensure local job creation*\" and stated that a separate meeting with the Chief Secretary was equally \"*inconclusive*.\"1841 According to Mr. Mustikhan, he then discussed TCCP's further strategy in private with Dr. Jezek and they decided: \"[I]*n light of the failre to win over CM Raisai in our meeting, we should look to pursue other* 'Influencers' *more vigorously to form and cultivate a* 'Pressure Group' *within the Balochistan Provincial Assembly. The aim of this bloc would be to work on CM Raisani to grant TCCP the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease as per TCCP's proposals*.\"1842 Mr. Mustikhan further testified:\n\n\"*Following this discussion, I arranged a meeting between Mr Jezek and two provincial ministries in CM Raisani's cabinet: Shahnawaz Marri and Zahoor Buledi. The meeting took place over dinner in the Chinese Restaurant at the Serena Hotel Quetta. As we had discussed, Mr Jezek asked these two gentlemen to form a pressure group within the Provincial Parliament and Cabinet with the aim of securing for TCCP the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease. They said they were happy to do so. In return for securing for these for TCCP, Mr Jezek said Mr Marri and Mr Buledi would be compensated with* 'millions'*, and that other officials who assisted with the project would be rewarded with project contracts and jobs once the project was operational*.\"1843\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6 11.\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6 12.\n\n1411.\n\nDr. Jezek confirmed in his first witness statement that Mr. Mustikhan accompanied him to a meeting with Chief Minister Raisani on 26 September 2009. Dr. Jezek described the meeting as having gone \"*poorly*\" with the Chief Minister being \"*openly hostile and \u2026 ill-informed about the Reko Diq project*.\" Dr. Jezek testified that he took away from the meeting \"*not that I had to resort to bribery, but rather that we had to learn more and redouble our efforts to better inform and educate political and business leaders across Balochistan and build more bottom-up support for the project in the province*.\"1844 In this regard, Dr. Jezek referred to a meeting with Chief Minister's Personal Secretary shortly afterwards, which he did not personally attend but learned about through notes that he recalled to have been written by Mr. Dad. Dr. Jezek, *inter alia*, recalled what he described as \"*an example of the infamous Pakistani rumour*\" of which the Personal Secretary had informed Mr. Dad. The notes record that \"*on Saturday 26 September to CM, one of the ministers verbally told to CM at CM House that TCC is demolishing the Raisani government by investing 10 millions dollars to get the favor of all minister by makig the favorable government to sign the project agreement*.\"1845 Dr. Jezek considered this allegation \"*ridiculous*\" and maintained that \"[c]*ontrary to Messrs. Mustikhan and Dad's allegations that I or others at TCC later made efforts to force CM Raisani from office, we never did anything of the kind*.\"1846\n\nJezek I, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, 57.\n\n**Exhibit CE-473**, \u00b6 5.\n\nJezek I, \u00b6 58.\n\n1412.\n\nDr. Jezek did not specifically refer to Mr. Mustikhan's testimony that he made an offer to Mr. Marri and Mr. Buledi but stated more generally:\n\n\"*It is certainly true that I and others at TCC often described how the project would create jobs for people in Balochistan and work for local contractors, suppliers, and construction companies through the daisy chain of projects. Indeed, one of our key messages to Baloch leaders was that we wanted to maximize the benefits derived from the project for Balochistan (although done in a manner that would not destroy the economic viability of the project for TCC and its owners, who supplied investment capital and technical knowledge and staff). We were trying to educate Baloch community and political leaders about the economic benefits the project would bring to the province. But we never offered anyone any kind of a bribe, including the ability to nominate people for jobs or to award or receive contracts outside normal competitive procedures. TCC hired employees and contractors solely on the basis of their qualifications and merit, and to the best of my knowledge we never hired anyone who was not qualified for his or her job*.\"1847\n\nJezek I, \u00b6 33.\n\n1413.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Dr. Jezek made this statement in the context of his testimony on the Umbrella Strategy, the legitimacy of which was subject to much debate between the Parties. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to express an opinion on the Umbrella Strategy as such. It also does not have to decide whether the statement made by Dr. Jezek that\"[p]*romising jobs or contracts to win favors, or any other kind of corruption was not a part of the Umbrella Strategy and any such manifestations would have seriously undermined it*\"1848 is generally accurate. The Tribunal is rather assessing whether any specific allegation of corruption raised by Respondent has been established and, if so, whether it has had an impact on Claimant's investment and its claims under the Treaty.\n\nJezek I, \u00b6 34.\n\n1414.\n\nAs for Respondent's allegation that, whether or not that was part of the Umbrella Strategy, Dr. Jezek offered \"*millions*\" as well as project contracts and jobs to two ministers and other Government officials, the Tribunal considers that Respondent has not sufficiently substantiated and certainly not established that this offer was actually made by Dr. Jezek. In any event, it would be doubtful whether a promise such as the one that Mr. Mustikhan testified about would be sufficiently specific to qualify as an offer of bribery made in relating to Claimant's investment. This allegation must therefore be rejected.\n\n**(d) Offer by Mr. Mustikhan, on Instructions of Dr. Jezek, to Pay USD 1 Million to Chief Minister Raisani**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1415.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that \"*TCC attempted to bribe CM Raisani in or around 2009*,\" alleging that a bribe in the amount of USD 1 million was first considered in 2008 by Mr. Flores and then actually offered to Chief Minister Raisani during the tenure of Dr. Jezek by Mr. Mustikhan in late November / early December 2009.1849 In the same context, Respondent also notes that Col. Khan and Ms. Boggs decided in late 2008 to donate PAK Rs. 10 million to the Chief Minister's earthquake relief fund and alleges that they considered there to be a \"*good chance that the money would end up in CM Raisani's personal bank account*.\"1850 In support of these allegations, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Col. Khan, Mr. Farooq and Mr. Mustikhan as well as on certain news articles reporting that Chief Minister Raisani raised an allegation that Claimant had attempted to bribe him in early 2010, which will be discussed in detail below.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 224.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 364 (with note 1250), *quoting from* Khan II, \u00b6 26.\n\n**(i) Evidence Concerning the Alleged Consideration of an Offer by Mr. Flores in 2008**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1416.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his second witness statement that when Mr. Raisani was elected as Chief Minister in April 2008, Mr. Farooq considered it necessary for protecting Claimant's interests and the Reko Diq project that Claimant \"*ha*[d] *CM Raisani in its pocket*\" and therefore suggested to him, Col. Khan, that \"*it may be possible to bribe the CM with a house in Islamabad and a car (a BMW)*\" and that they should find out what that would cost and whether Claimant would be interested in making such an offer.1851 Col. Khan further stated that he calculated the price for a house and car to be less than USD 1 million, which he considered \"*a reasonable price for obtaining the loyalty of the CM*.\" According to Col. Khan, he suggested this to Mr. Flores, who \"*enthusiastically agreed that this was a very* 'workable' *and affordable solution, which he would present to Claimant's Board of Directors*.\" Col. Khan added that Mr. Flores' proposal was, however, rejected by the Board who told him that he needed to work on \"*other options to appease CM Raisani and the government.*\"1852\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 24.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 25.\n\n1417.\n\nAccording to Col. Khan, he and Ms. Boggs then decided in late 2008 to donate PAK Rs. 10 million to the Chief Minister's relief fund for an earthquake in Ziarat \"*to appease CM Raisani*.\"1853 As this is in fact a separate allegation of a bribery payment that was actually made, the Tribunal will address the evidence presented by the Parties in this regard in a separate section below.\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 26.\n\n1418.\n\nDuring the hearing, Col. Khan confirmed that he had spoken about the incident with Mr. Flores to Mr. Flew during a conversation in June 2015, which Mr. Flew had recorded without his knowledge.1854 This part of the conversation is recorded as follows:\n\n\"*SHER KHAN: So Farooq and Raisani were good pals, you see. And the corruption, all corruption was put together. So he said,* 'I know what this man wants. He'll not ask for big money. He'll ask for very small money. All he requires is at the moment now, he wants [PH 00:28:08] to settle in Islamabad, a plot and a house. You buy, you get a plot and a house.' *So, you know, I calculated a plot and a house, it was coming under one million dollar, under one million. And all he desired, right, of the house, the car, okay. It was all under one million dollars. So I took Eduardo into confidence and I said,* 'Sir, this is a feeling that has come to me.'\n\n*BARRY FLEW: That was when Eduardo was there?*\n\n*SHER KHAN: Eduardo.*\n\n*BARRY FLEW: I see, okay.*\n\n*SHER KHAN: That was when Eduardo was there. And I told Eduardo that Farooq has given me this message, saying that this guy is a very greedy guy and he'll create problems, and the best option is, you know, this is it. Eduardo said,* 'Okay, I'll have to talk to the Board.' *S* [sic] *Eduardo talked to the Board, and the Board said,* 'Nothing doing,' *they said* 'no way' *to me, and I told Farooq that* 'no way.' *He said,* 'But this is the only way.'\"1855\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 961 line 21 to p. 966 line 8.\n\n**Exhibit CE-480B**, pp. 19-20.\n\n1419.\n\nCol. Khan was further pointed to his repeated statement *vis-\u00e0-vis* Mr. Flew that he was not aware of any corrupt payments having been made by TCC and that they had \"*never paid a penny*.\"1856 When asked whether it was now his testimony that he had lied to Mr. Flew in that regard, Col. Khan responded: \"*Absolutely*.\"1857 Col. Khan further testified: \"*I would not give much emphasis to this Transcript. Number 1, this was totally recorded without my permission. And I came to Barry Flew with a specific reason, and \u2026 he was not coming out with that information* [on the investigation by the NAB of which he had been informed shortly before].\"1858\n\n**Exhibit RE-480B**, pp. 13, 14, 27.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 976 lines 5-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 992 line 21 to p. 993 line 4.\n\n1420.\n\nMr. Flew was also pointed to the transcript of his conversation with Col. Khan during the hearing and confirmed that the story Col. Khan was telling him about a plot and a house in Islamabad was likely the same story he had been told a few years earlier.1859 As for the reference to the amount of USD 1 million, Mr. Flew stated that \"[i]*t was rumored before through Sher Khan about this house and a plot came up to one million*\" and added that the rumor was \"[t]*hat this was what Raisani was sort of offering or requesting*.\" Mr. Flew further stated that he had heard for the first time during his conversation with Col. Khan in 2015 that Col. Khan told Mr. Flores about this and was surprised \"[t]*hat he would actually take it Eduardo and take it to the Board. I hadn't heard that before.*\"1860 Mr. Flew testified that he believed Col. Khan at the time that he was telling the truth: \"*I didn't know that he did. But he was telling me this, so I believed him*.\"1861 During his re-direct examination, Mr. Flew was asked whether he he considered it likely that Mr. Flores had brought the proposal to Claimant's Board of Directors. He answered: \"*I don't think Eduardo would bring a proposal. He may have\u2014one, he would never believe that the Board would accept the proposal. He may have informed the Board that this was being offered or requested but I don't think he would bring it \u2026 as a proposal to pay that bribe*.\"1862\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 3001 lines 5-9.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 3003 line 5 to p. 3004 line 8.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 3005 lines 3-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 3017 line 22 to p. 3018 line 8.\n\n1421.\n\nMr. Farooq confirmed in his second witness statement that \"*in or around June or July 2008*,\" he had a discussion with Col. Khan regarding the payment of money to Chief Minister Raisani, who had removed him, Mr. Farooq, from his post as Chairman of the BDA shortly before. According to Mr. Farooq, a payment from Claimant would have directly benefitted him as the Chief Minister associated him with TCC. Mr. Farooq stated that he \"*remember*[ed] *telling Col. Sher Khan that one good house in Islamabad and a good luxury car would be the minimum required to appease him.*\"1863\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 60.\n\n1422.\n\nMr. Flores rejected Col. Khan's testimony that he approached Mr. Flores with a proposal to offer a bribe to Chief Minister Raisani and that he, Mr. Flores, \"*enthusiastically agreed that this a very* 'workable' *and affordable solution*\" and presented it to the Board. According to Mr. Flores, \"[t]*his entire story is a fantasy*.\" He added:\n\n\"*No such conversation ever occurred and if Col. Khan had ever brought such a proposition to me it would have led to his immediate termination. Similarly, I never presented any such idea to TCC's Board of Directors. If I had ever made such a proposition to the Board of TCC I know I would have been fired five minutes later, and my reputation in the industry would have been ruined. There is simply no way that I would ever have considered such a proposal, much less adopted it and brought it to the Board*.\"1864\n\nFlores II, \u00b6 40.\n\n1423.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Flores again rejected Col. Khan's testimony regarding the conversation they allegedly had about a house and car for Chief Minister Raisani and stated that they \"*never had that conversation at all*.\"1865 Mr. Flores further stated that he did not know why Mr. Flew had raised \"*something about a house*\" in his conversation with Col. Khan in June 2015 and maintained that \"*that conversation never happened*\" and that for him, Mr. Flores, to raise such a proposal with Claimant's Board of Directors \"*makes absolutely no sense*.\"1866 Similarly, when confronted with Col. Khan's account of the alleged conversation that he had given during two phone calls with Claimant's external counsel in this arbitration in late August and early September 2015, as recorded in a memorandum and notes prepared by counsel participating in the respective calls, Mr. Flores maintained his testimony that this was not true.1867\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2616 line 18 to p. 2617 line 13.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2618 line 11 to p. 2620 line 7, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-480B**, p. 18 line 23 to p. 20 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 10), p. 2620 line 8 to p. 2626 line 2, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-827** *and* **CE-832**.\n\n**(ii) Evidence Concerning the Alleged Appeasement of Chief Minister Raisani Through an Earthquake Relief Donation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1424.\n\nCol. Khan testified in his second witness statement that after Claimant's Board of Directors had rejected Mr. Flores' proposal to buy a house and a car for Chief Minister Raisani, he and Ms. Boggs then decided in late 2008 to donate PAK Rs. 10 million to the Chief Minister's relief fund for an earthquake in Ziarat \"*to appease CM Raisani*,\" having discussed that \"*there was a good chance that this money would end up in CM Raisani's personal bank account*.\" Col. Khan added that this \"*is a well-known method of corruption for officials to abuse these sorts of charitable structure in Pakistan.*\"1868\n\nKhan II, \u00b6 26.\n\n1425.\n\nMr. Farooq confirmed in his second witness statement that he \"*also advised Col. Sher Khan to pay money into the CM's relief fund related to the earthquake in Ziarat as he could spend that money at his discretion and there was a very good chance he would embezzle it*.\"1869\n\nFarooq II, \u00b6 60.\n\n1426.\n\nMs. Boggs confirmed in her fourth witness statement that in 2008, Claimant donated PAK Rs. 10 million in humanitarian aid for the victims of a severe earthquake that hit Balochistan in October 2008. She stated that as CEO of the TCC, she considered that the company had a responsibility towards the local community \"*as a good corporate citizen*\" and added that Col. Khan had recommended to donate the amount for humanitarian relief to a government controlled fund for which she requested approval from Claimant's Board of Directors. She noted that \"*TCC made donations to similar relief aids for flood and earthquake victims in subsequent years*.\"1870\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.\n\n1427.\n\nMs. Boggs added that by making the donation to that fund, she wanted to \"*ensure four factors: that the payment was by a traceable instrument; the payment went to a confirmed government account; the donation was made in an open and transparent fashion; and there was an accountability mechanism to provide assurances that the funds were used for the intended purpose*.\" According to Ms. Boggs, Col. Khan confirmed that the Chief Minister of Balochistan's Relief and Rehabilitation Fund was \"*a legitimate official government fund set up for the proper purposes*\" and Ms. Sharp was also asked to confirm the same.1871 Ms. Boggs further stated that the donation was made by Col. Khan, who presented Chief Minister Raisani with \"*a giant ceremonial check*\" addressed to the Chief Minister's Fund and was photographed and publicized by TCC. Ms. Boggs also noted that other donors to the same fund included \"*the federal government, provincial governments, other private companies, non-governmental organizations, and individuals*,\" who donated over PAK Rs. 2 billion in total.1872\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 35.\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n1428.\n\nIn a contemporaneous e-mail exchange dating from 31 October and 1 November 2008, Ms. Boggs informed Col. Khan that there was agreement to make a donation in the amount of PAK Rs. 10 million to the GOB as Col. Khan had suggested and asked him to \"*figure out the best way to do so\u2014do we give a cheque to a specific agency or aid group or just directly to the GOB? Is it better to send cheque or fly in supplies*.\" Col. Khan responded that \"*the best way to donate is to present a cheque to the CM in Quetta. I suggest you write a letter to the CM right away expressing your deep concern for the people of Balochistan, also announcing the donation*.\" Ms. Boggs agreed with this proposal and asked for a draft, which Col. Khan sent for her approval later on the same day. He also confirmed that he would be available to deliver the cheque on her behalf, as she was outside Pakistan at the time.1873\n\n**Exhibit CE-546**, pp. 2-4.\n\n1429.\n\nOn the next day, Ms. Boggs noted that Mr. Flores considered it \"*better to give supplies rather than cash like* [they] *did for the flood relief*\" and added that she \"[did] *n't really have a view which is better in this case other than cash is obviously easier to misuse or use for other purposes than quake aid. If you think cash is ok to give and there is a specific agency within the government where we know it will go that we have convidence* [sic] *will be used correctly, then let's go ahead and send the letter and perhaps you can follow with a visit*.\" In response, Col. Khan informed her that he spoken with Additional Chief Secretary Lehri who \"*was of the view that a donation was needed*\" and advised him to present a cheque to the Chief Minister as \"*donation in kind was coming from the government and now money was required for reheblition* [sic] *of the people*.\" Ms. Boggs responded that \"*based on this information* [they] *should go ahead with delivery of the cheque*.\"1874\n\n**Exhibit CE-546**, pp. 1-2.\n\n1430.\n\nIn a further e-mail exchange dating from 3 November 2008, Ms. Boggs informed Col. Khan that she had confirmed to Ms. Sharp that they were making a donation to the GOB for earthquake relief and asked him: \"*But is there any way we can confirm that this is a legitimate fund and set up for proper purposes?*\" In response, Col. Khan stated that \"[w]*e see every day in the news paper that a special account has been opened and all donations are to be sent to CM Balochistan, Relief and Rehabilitation Fund. I have spoken to the staff of the CM, they received our letter and arranged the presentation at 1200 hrs on 5 Nov*.\" Ms. Boggs responded by thanking Col. Khan and stating: \"*I just wanted to make sure that we had checked out where the money was going.*\"1875\n\n**Exhibit CE-548**.\n\n1431.\n\nIn an e-mail of the same day, Ms. Sharp confirmed \"*a cheque to be made out to:* 'Chief Minister Balochistan's Relief Fund' *in the amount of 10 million Pak rupee*.\" In response, Ms. Boggs confirmed that they were making a donation to the GOB for earthquake relief and asked Ms. Sharp: \"*Is there anyway to check this out to confirm it is established for this purpose?*\"1876 There appears to be no response from Ms. Sharp to this question in the record.\n\n**Exhibit CE-549**.\n\n1432.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, Ms. Boggs circulated pictures of the ceremony in which Col. Khan had handed over the cheque to the GOB among Claimant's Board of Directors as well as Antofagasta and Barrick.1877 According to a news article published by *Dawn* on 23 November 2008, \"[i]*ndividuals and public and private organisations entities have so far donated more than Rs. 2.35 billion in the Chief Minister's Relief and Rehabilitation Fund for people affected by the recent earthquake in Balochistan*.\" Claimant was mentioned as one of the international donors.1878\n\n**Exhibit CE-551**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-553**. According to the news article: \"*Donors include the federal government, provincial governments, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government, private companies, NGOs, philanthropists and the common man. Donations were also received from PIA, Wapda, PAF, Tethyan Copper Company, Qesco, MMC Duddar Mineral Development Corporation, Nepra and the Senate*.\"\n\n1433.\n\nDuring the hearing, Ms. Boggs again denied Col. Khan's testimony that they had both known that the money donated by Claimant would ultimately go into the pocket of the Chief Minister. She confirmed that they \"*undertook some steps, some diligence to ensure that it was a legitimate fund, and it was a legitimate contribution*.\"1879 Ms. Boggs agreed that \"[t]*here is potential for those kind of funds to be misappropriated*\" and further agreed that a cash payment could be misappropriated more easily than supplies, as she had \"*noted* [] *in an e-mail*.\" Ms. Boggs maintained, however, that they \"*didn't simply hand over a large sum of cash without due diligence*.\"1880 She stated that she had initially raised the possibility of making a charitable contribution with Col. Khan and asked him how to do it and to confirm the legitimacy of the fund. When asked whether she was relying on the e-mail exchange of 3 November 2008, she confirmed and added that her \"*experience \u2026 with Sher Khan, was that he had a number of sources that he would have contacted to ask about this fund, and then he would have had this independent newspaper account of the fund. So, I was not in Pakistan at the time, so he would have sent me this e-mail, and I would have, based on my knowledge of how he went about his job, thought that he had done diligence around the fund*.\"1881 Ms. Boggs denied that this e-mail chain had been meant to serve as a \"*paper trail to suggest anything*\" and noted that \"*Sher Khan was not somebody who would write lengthy e-mails, so* [she] *would not have expected him to detail it*.\"1882\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2841 lines 1-17.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2842 line 8 to p. 2844 line 18.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2845 line 8 to p. 2848 line 7.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2849 line 20 to p. 2850 line 12.\n\n1434.\n\nMs. Boggs further confirmed that upon her inquiry Col. Khan informed her that the donations were commingled, thus making it impossible to follow up on how the money was spent, and that she did not make any further inquiries in that regard. She added: \"*Sher Khan assured me\u2014and you could read about it in the papers\u2014that these contributions were being used for relief efforts. So, I had no reason to believe they were being used for anything else. There was no need to follow up because* [Col. Khan] *had confirmed that they were being used for relief efforts.*\"1883\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2851 line 17 to p. 2855 line 10.\n\n1435.\n\nCol. Khan confirmed during the hearing that he had spoken to Government officials about how to make a contribution and stated that Mr. Farooq considered this \"*a God-given opportunity*\" at the time and advised him to tell Mr. Boggs that they should \"[d]*onate handsomely so that, again, to have* [the Chief Minister] *on* [their] *side*.\" Col. Khan further stated that when Ms. Boggs asked him how the donation shoule be made, \"*everybody advised* [him] *it has to be cash, give cash. It is only if you give cash to this man that he will be little happy because, ultimately, this cash will go into his pocket*.\"1884 In response to the suggestion that this was the opposite of what he had told Ms. Boggs at the time, Col. Khan stated: \"*Well, this is what I told her*.\" Col. Khan acknowledged that in his contemporaneous e-mail correspondence with Ms. Boggs, which he described as a \"*paper trail*,\" he had not mentioned having taken advice from Mr. Farooq but stated that \"*Cassie Boggs knew very well that all\u2014these governmental affairs and decisions are all taken by Mr. Farooq*\" and added that he had separately told Ms. Boggs about Mr. Farooq's advice.1885\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1037 line 7 to p. 1039 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1039 line 6 to p. 1044 line 5.\n\n1436.\n\nWhen pointed to another e-mail exchange with Ms. Boggs in which she had specifically asked him to check whether the money was going, Col. Khan testified that \"*this is all set up. This is how it is done. This is how Balochistan works. Bank accounts are opened. Everybody is donating into the bank's account, and ultimately it's going into the pockets of the bureaucrats or the Cabinet of Balochistan*.\" Col. Khan added that he did not tell Ms. Boogs that \"*on paper*,\" but maintained that he \"*spoke to her very \u2026 confidentially on the phone*.\" In response to a question from the President of the Tribunal, Col. Khan stated that he spoke to her on the very day that Mr. Farooq had contacted him:\n\n\"*Exactly in these same words I spoke to her, and I spoke to her on the phone. She was not here in Pakistan, she was in Toronto. And I told her that this is what Farooq says. We have already missed one opportunity. And let's not miss this opportunity again, and please donate handsomely big money so that we can again start talking to him. This transpired between Cassie Boggs and myself on the first day*.\"1886\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1045 line 3 to p. 1049 line 10.\n\n1437.\n\nCol. Khan further testified that \"[v]*ery few donations came in from multi-national companies*\" and \"*nobody paid cash. Basically all cash had come from Pakistani companies*.\" When pointed to the list of donors recorded in a newspaper article and the fact that the fund ultimately raised over PAK RS. 2.3 billion, Col. Khan was confronted with the suggestion that \"*at least as Madeline Sharp and Cassie Boggs were concerned \u2026 this was a legitimate relief effort done for humanitarian purposes; correct?*\" Col. Khan answered: \"*Right. Absolutely. Yes*.\"1887\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1051 line 2 to p. 1052 line 12.\n\n**(iii) Evidence Concerning the Alleged Offer Made to Chief Minister Raisani by Mr. Mutikhan in Late 2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1438.\n\nFinally, as to Respondent's allegation that an offer of bribery was ultimately made by Claimant to Chief Minister Raisani in late 2009, Mr. Mustikhan testified in his witness statement that after the unsuccessful meeting that he and Dr. Jezek had with the Chief Minister \"*in late 2009*,\" he told Dr. Jezek during a private discussion that, in his opinion, \"*nothing was going to get done without monetary payments to the important decision-makers*.\" According to Mr. Mustikhan, Dr. Jezek responded that \"*provided* [Mr. Mustikhan] *didn't implicate TCCP directly in the process,* [he] *was free to inquire as to CM Raisan's personal demands*\" and they both agreed that \"*it was worth approaching CM Raisani in private to see whether TCCP could buy his agreement to the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease*.\"1888\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 18.\n\n1439.\n\nMr. Mustikhan then stated:\n\n\"*Accordingly, as per Mr Jezek's instructions I met CM Raisani in his office in Quetta in a one-to-one meeting in December 2009. During that meeting I said that if he approved the Mineral Agreement and Mining Lease, he would be rewarded with a huge array of financial benefits and that he could effectively name the price that he wanted in return*.\"1889\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6 18.\n\n1440.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mustikhan, his offer angered the Chief Minister, who stated that \"*he had nothing personal against TCCP or the project, but that he was looking at it with the best interests of the people of Balochistan, at heart*,\" referring in particularly to the need for a smelter \"*to ensure greater economic benefits for the community*.\"1890\n\nMustikhan, \u00b6 19.\n\n1441.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Mustikhan confirmed his testimony that during a private discussion following the meeting with the Chief Minister, which he now confirmed took place on 26 September 2009, Dr. Jezek had authorized him to inquire into the Chief Minister's personal demands. Mr. Mustikhan was then pointed to his statement before the NAB in which it is recorded that he \"*was asked by Mr. Peter Jezek to approach CM Raisani in* [his] *private capacity and inquire about his personal terms and conditions including any financial requirements*\"1891 but no further detail was given of the private conversation he now testified about. Mr. Mustikhan stated that he had \"*no idea*\" why this conversation was not included in his statement \"*because that's a Statement developed by NAB themselves*.\"1892\n\n**Exhibit RE-452**, p. 4.\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1531 line 2 to p. 1534 line 20.\n\n1442.\n\nAs to the meeting at which he alleged made the offer to Chief Minister Raisani, Mr. Mustikhan testified that it took place at the official office in the Chief Minister's house. In response to the question when the meeting took place, he stated that he could not recall the exact date but that it was \"*probably early December*\" and \"*probably a business day because* [he] *met him in his office*.\" Mr. Mustikhan confirmed that one needed to have an appointment to meet with the Chief Minister and stated that his appointment had been made \"*by* [his] *brother directly with the CM*\" and that his name had been at the gate when he entered.1893 He stated that he waited \"[n]*ot very long \u2026 10, 15 minutes*\" before the Personal Secretary let him in but did not recall whether he had seen anyone else on his way in or out. According to Mr. Mustikhan, the meeting lasted \"[n]*ot more than 30 minutes*\" and he confirmed that nobody else participated in it.1894\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1535 line 18 to p. 1539 line 17.\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1540 line 22 to p. 1542 line 4.\n\n1443.\n\nMr. Mustikhan testified that he reported to Dr Jezek that the meeting had been unsuccessful \"*on the same day of the meeting when* [he] *came out*\" by calling Dr. Jezek on his mobile phone and stating: \"*It didn't go successfully. I failed*.\" He stated that he did not know where Dr. Jezek was at the time but believed that he was in Pakistan. He further confirmed that he did not keep any record of his meetings or activities at the time but had been \"*very lazy*\" in recording where he had to be at a particular time.1895\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1543 line 8 to p. 1544 line 22.\n\n1444.\n\nWhen asked when his brother had made the appointment, he answered that \"[i]*t was in the end of November, early December, somewhere that time*\" and confirmed that he had waited three months to move on Dr. Jezek's instruction of 26 September, providing the following explanation: \"*So, there was a reason for that. Because I could see in the meeting that\u2014how Raisani was really annoyed, and I thought that to give him some time before I go and see him in this particular context*.\"1896 Mr. Mustikhan confirmed that between the authorization by Dr. Jezek and his meeting with Chief Minister Raisani, a considerable amount of work was going on in relation to the Umbrella Strategy, which would not have been necessary if the Chief Minister had accepted the offer. In response to the question whether he had had any conversation with Dr. Jezek on this matter in between, he said that they \"*discussed the subject off and on*.\"1897\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1545 line 12 to p. 1546 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1546 line 21 to p. 1549 line 13.\n\n1445.\n\nDuring his re-direct examination, Mr. Mustikhan was again pointed to his statement before the NAB in which he had also stated that \"*as per the instructions of Mr. Peter Jezek, I met CM Raisani in his office in Quetta in a one-to-one meeting in December 2009 during which I asked on behalf of Peter Jezek and TCCP about his personal requirements and desired financial benefits conveying him that TCCP was ready to address all such requirements*.\"1898 In response to the question when Dr. Jezek had given him the instructions he had mentioned, Mr. Mustikhan stated that it was \"*sometime in November or sometime when* [he] *talked to* [Dr. Jezek].\" He added: \"*I asked him that can I go now because the time has elapsed now, and it's about time that I should try or we should try to meet Raisani and go ahead with the offer that I had mentioned to him earlier*.\"1899 When pointed to his earlier testimony that he had received instructions during the 26 September 2009 meeting in the coffee room, Mr. Mustikhan added that \"[t]*here are two different aspects to it. One was that what was decided was in the coffee room, the meeting that did not go well with the Chief Minister and when we went to the coffee room and we principally agreed. Now, this was \u2026 something where when I decided that, yes, this was time to go and meet Mr. Raisani*.\"1900\n\n**Exhibit RE-452**, p. 4.\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1563 line 22 to p. 1565 line 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 6), p. 1573 lines 2-12.\n\n1446.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Dr. Jezek rejected Mr. Mustikhan's testimony that he had instructed or encourage him to offer a bribe to Chief Minister Raisani, stating that he \"*never did anything of the sort*.\" Dr. Jezek testified that after the first meeting with the Chief Minister in September 2009 had gone \"*poorly*,\" with the Chief Minister being \"*openly hostile*\" and \"*ill-informed about the Reko Diq project*,\" he tried to schedule another meeting with him to \"*fully explore and address the critical issues with him*.\" As direct requests for a meeting proved fruitless, Dr. Jezek stated, Claimant's staff and consultants \"*began exploring all available channels to arrange such a meeting*.\"1901 According to Dr. Jezek, Mr. Mustikhan was \"*a key participant in this effort, but his mandate never included attempting to buy the Chief Minister's support or to find out whether he had personal demands*.\" He noted that this would have been contrary to the commitment Mr. Mustikhan had made in his consulting contract not to engage in corruption and added that he, Dr. Jezek, \"*took those contractual obligations seriously and expected Mr. Mustikhan and all TCC consultants to follow them*.\"1902\n\nJezek I, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 59.\n\nJezek I, \u00b6 60.\n\n1447.\n\nDuring the hearing, Dr. Jezek confirmed that Mr. Mustikhan had started to work for Claimant on 1 September 2008 but signed his consulting contract only in November. According to Dr. Jezek, this was \"[b]*ecause the contractual document for consultants was not in shape to include all of the\u2014and particularly the anticorruption provisions that* [he] *wanted to make sure were included*\" for all of the consultants in a uniform contract. Dr. Jezek stated that \"*Mr. Mustikhan was fully aware of what the requirements were*\" and that he \"*made a call because of timing and related issues to proceed with deploying Abid Mustikhan in the research capacity*.\" He also confirmed that Mr. Mustikhan attended the 26 September 2009 meeting before having signed his contract with TCC.1903\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3111 line 7 to p. 3112 line 12.\n\n1448.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Dr. Jezek testified that one of the reasons for the September 2009 meeting not going well was that Mr. Mustikhan had openly challenged the Chief Minister based on his experience with the Saindak project. Dr. Jezek stated that he therefore \"*concluded that Mr. Mustikhan should not meet with the Chief Minister again*\" and referred to an e-mail from Mr. John Sharp dating from 22 November 2009 in which the latter noted \"*Abid's* [Mustikhan] *many connections*\" but added \"*I'm not so sure, however, that Abid meeting the CM directly would be a good idea*.\"1904\n\nJezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-383**, p. 2.\n\n1449.\n\nDuring the hearing, Dr. Jezek did not agree with the suggestion that Mr. Mustikhan \"*messed up*\" or \"*performed badly*\" at the meeting but maintained that with regard to a reference made by the Chief Minister to the Saindak project, \"*Mr. Mustikhan responded in a way that the Chief Minister did not appreciate*\" and that Mr. Mustikhan's performance \"*underscored* [Dr. Jezek's] *view, which* [he] *had heard from other people that Abid had the tendency to speak his mind, which rubbed people the wrong way.*\"1905 When pointed to his recommendation letter to Mr. Mustikhan after he had left TCC in which he had \"*recommend*[ed] *Mr. Mustikhan for any challenging position or assignment he may be considered for*,\"1906 Dr. Jezek explained that he had not employed Mr. Mustikhan to assist him in winning favor with the Chief Minister but to \"*educate* [Dr. Jezek] *and the company about Balochistan \u2026 and the people, the political structure, the tribal structure of Balochistan*.\" He did not consider the recommendation letter inconsistent with the performance of Mr. Mustikhan during the meeting, stating that he \"*would find it difficult to describe Mr. Mustikhan's response to the Chief Minister as destroying a relationship*.\"1907\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3114 line 3 to p. 3117 line 1.\n\n**Exhibit RE-408**.\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3117 line 2 to p. 3118 line 18.\n\n1450.\n\nWith regard to the private conversation that he allegedly had with Mr. Mustikhan after the meeting on 26 September 2009, Dr. Jezek confirmed that \"*the conversation took place, but not with this content*,\" adding that \"[a]*fter every meeting* [they] *would have a review, to draw conclusions from what transpired*.\"1908 When asked whether they had discussed of what Mr. Mustikhan's role could be, going forward, Dr. Jezek stated: \"*We've talked about issues, and again, I don't remember the details \u2026 But we've had a discussion about the outcome of the meeting and what should be done next.*\" According to Dr. Jezek, the outcome they agreed on was \"[t]*hat* [they] *have to redouble effort to actually have a chance for the Chief Minister to get a full understanding of the Project so that this issue of its simple truck-and-shovel project would not cloud his judgment, which in reality, since Government of Balochistan was the Joint Venture partner of Tethyan, should have been a relatively straightforward proposition to have this conversation and for both sides to raise issues and seek solutions to them*.\"1909 Dr. Jezek stated that he did not recall to have agreed on or discussed during that conversation any follow-up actions for Mr. Mustikhan to take.1910\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3119 line 10 to p. 3120 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3120 line 22 to p. 3121 line 17.\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3121 line 18 to p. 3122 line 20.\n\n1451.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Dr. Jezek testified that he learned at some point after his September 2009 meeting with Chief Minister Raisani that he had publicly raised the allegation of having been offered a bribe of USD 1 million by TCC; in addition, during a meeting with the Chief Minister that they were finally able to arrange in January 2010, in which he participated together with Mr. Luksic, Ms. Boggs, Mr. William Hayes and Ms. Smia Alia Shah, the Chief Minister \"[a]*t one point \u2026 also angrily raised the issue of a bribe having been offered to him. He provided no details, though, including who had made this alleged offer*.\" According to Dr. Jezek, Mr. Luksic told the Chief Minister \"*very plainly that neither he nor TCC or its management had any knowledge of any such offer*\" and that it would not have been approved or tolerated by TCC or its principals; the Chief Minister then \"*said nothing further about this allegation and the discussion moved on*.\"1911\n\nJezek I, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65.\n\n1452.\n\nDuring the hearing, Dr. Jezek testified that he \"*saw that as an opportunity for the Chief Minister, which is actually what* [they] *were seeking ever since the rumor first arose of the supposed bribe, to actually get specifics of what he has seen happen or what he believed has happened*\" but that \"*instead, he left it hanging, didn't take it any further*.\"1912 Dr. Jezek stated that he did not consider the allegation to be genuine \"*based on everything* [they]*'ve looked at and all the inquiries* [they] *'ve made*.\" Dr. Jezek added:\n\n\"*It was like chasing ghosts. We were not able to find anything specific that would add credence to it.*\n\n*In addition, I've been cautioned by a number of members of the Pakistani business community that \u2026 this was basically seeking political benefit and that it should not be taken seriously*.\n\n*I've taken it seriously because of TCC, as well as Barrick and Antofagasta Code of Conduct, as well as my personal views of corruption*.\"1913\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3126 lines 5-15.\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3126 line 18 to p. 3127 line 10.\n\n1453.\n\nDr. Jezek confirmed that he did not ask the Chief Minister about the allegation, stating that the meeting was conducted by Mr. Luksic on their side, who \"*made a very clear statement which allowed the Chief Minister to say* 'But this is what happened, and here are the specifics.'\"1914\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3127 line 13 to p. 3128 line 20.\n\n1454.\n\nAs for the rumor he had heard about a bribe of USD 1 million being offered, Dr. Jezek stated that it surfaced \"*probably November or December of 2009*\" and confirmed that it related to the same allegation raised by the Chief Minister in January 2010 although he did not recall that the Chief Minister had mentioned an amount of USD 1 million. Dr. Jezek also did not recall how he had learned of the public allegation but confirmed that it \"*had $1 million attached to it*.\"1915\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3129 line 17 to p. 3132 line 20.\n\n1455.\n\nIn her third witness statement, Ms. Boggs provided a similar description of the meeting with Chief Minister Raisani in January 2010 and added that she was \"*confident that TCC never offered a bribe to Chief Minister Raisani and that his allegation was either a misunderstanding or an outright lie*.\"1916 In her fourth witness statement, she clarified that by \"*misunderstanding*\" she was referring to the possibility that \"*someone outside of TCC may have approached Chief Minister Raisani to try to broker a deal without consulting TCC*\" but \"*any such offer would have been made without approval because TCC did not condone bribery*.\"1917\n\nBoggs III, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. *See also* Boggs IV, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40.\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 40.\n\n1456.\n\nDuring the hearing, Ms. Boggs was pointed to a summary prepared by Mr. Manzoor Shaikh that he sent to Mr. Sharp on 13 January 2010 in which he reported, *inter alia*, about the meeting with the Chief Minister that had been held on the same day, including that:\n\n\"*CM said:*\n\n\u2026\n\n*b. is angry because someone from TCCP offered bribe to him. It was totally denied by Jean Paul. Jean Paul said that they done due diligence of Pakistan before making decision to invest here. They came to the conclusion that business can be done in Pakistan without using underhand methods*.\"1918\n\n**Exhibit RE-392**, p. 5.\n\n1457.\n\nMs. Boggs confirmed that during the meeting on 13 January 2010, Chief Minister Raisani \"*claimed that someone had offered a bribe to him*\" and that \"*he was angry about a number of things, including the fact that he claimed somebody had offered a bribe*.\"1919\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2892 line 12 to p. 2893 line 12.\n\n1458.\n\nMs. Boggs was further pointed to an e-mail in which Mr. William Hayes also reported on the meeting with the Chief Minister and stated:\n\n\"*He raised the bribery issue which gave JPL the opportunity to clarify that we did not, nor would not ever, condone the practice. He made it clear that the only reason he received us was because Rodolfo, the Argentine Ambassador requested him to do so--they are close friends. He was sending a message that we were in the dog house but now had an opening*.\"1920\n\n**Exhibit RE-508**, p. 2.\n\n1459.\n\nIn response to the suggestion that the reason for Mr. Hayes's characterization of their situation as being \"*in the dog house*\" was because of the Chief Minister's anger at having been offered a bribe, Ms. Boggs stated:\n\n\"*I don't know that that was the only reason because he told us that someone had tried to bribe him; we said that that had not happened. And he didn't mention it ever again. He didn't tell us who supposedly tried to bribe him, what the amount was; as soon as we denied it, we moved on in the discussion*.\"1921\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2894 line 18 to p. 2895 line 6.\n\n1460.\n\nWhen asked whether they asked for any details of the Chief Minister's allegation, Ms. Boggs responded that \"*Mr. Luksic responded on behalf of all the Parties very forcefully that nobody at Barrick or Antofagasta or TCC had authorized any bribe, and the Chief Minister seemed to accept that and move on. He didn't offer any details and we didn't ask anymore*.\" Ms. Boggs confirmed that in light of the seriousness of the allegation, they \"*would have expected, if it had been, in fact, truthful, he would have given* [them] *some detail around who supposedly had been involved in the bribe and how much it was for*\"; she confirmed that they \"*didn't ask him point-blank who did this*\" but maintained that they \"*gave him the opportunity to give* [them] *the details, and he didn't provide the necessary details and very quickly moved on*.\"1922\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2896 line 5 to p. 2897 line 1.\n\n1461.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Dr. Jezek testified that, nevertheless, both TCC and Barrick investigated the allegation raised by Chief Minister Raisani at the time and \"*found no evidence to support it*.\"1923 He stated that Barrick's investigation began after Chief Minister Raisani had for the first time raised his allegation directly *vis-\u00e0-vis* TCC in the 13 January 2010 meeting but noted that in the absence of any specific information of when, where, why and by whom the bribe had been offered, \"*it was difficult what to make of the allegation, much less to investigate it.*\"1924\n\nJezek I, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nJezek II, \u00b6 61.\n\n1462.\n\nAs to TCC's investigation, Dr. Jezek stated:\n\n\"*While I believed the allegation to be false and even outlandish, I made inquiries with TCC staff, consultants, and numerous individuals outside of TCC as soon as I became aware of it. I wanted to see if I could identify the source of this rumor and try to determine if there was anything TCC might have done that could have been misinterpreted. I suspected that the allegation may have been generated by some enemy of the project that was trying to sabotage TCC and, if so, I wanted to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in my efforts. Moreover, I never came across any credible evidence to support the Chief Minister's claim.*\"1925\n\nJezek II, \u00b6 62. *See also* Jezek I, \u00b6 62.\n\n1463.\n\nDuring the hearing, Dr. Jezek confirmed that while he did not have any concerns that the allegation had something to do with Mr. Mustikhan, he spoke to him about the allegation after the January 2010 meeting and also when the rumor first surfaced: \"*I spoke to all of our consultants as well as employees, particularly employees in Quetta, to try to get any possible information that would put substance beyond that allegation*.\"1926\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3128 line 21 to p. 3129 line 16.\n\n1464.\n\nAs for the investigation conducted by Barrick, Dr. Jezek stated:\n\n\"*Barrick's investigation was overseen by Sybil Veenman. I was not directly involved in that investigation, but I am aware that over the course of it Ms. Veenman collected information from various people, including me*.\"1927\n\nJezek II, \u00b6 62.\n\n1465.\n\nMs. Boggs confirmed in her fourth witness statement that Barrick's internal investigation was conducted by Ms. Veenman whose involvement was, according to Ms. Boggs, \"*a sign that the company took any such allegation seriously*.\" Ms. Boggs added that while she was not directly involved, she understood that \"*the results did not substantiate the Chief Minister's allegation.*\"1928\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 39.\n\n1466.\n\nDuring the hearing, Ms. Boggs confirmed that the internal investigation was conducted by Ms. Veenman as someone who was independent from TCC. Ms. Boggs stated that she did not know any details of the investigation other than a discussion she had had with Ms. Veenman and specifically did not know who was contacted and interviewed in its course. As for her understanding that the results did not substantiate the allegation, Ms. Boggs stated she did not recall seeing an investigation report but that she had been told orally by Ms. Veenman. She also did not recall that a report was presented to Claimant's Board of Directors or that any e-mail, note or memorandum was sent to the members of the Board or Dr. Jezek. Ms. Boggs also confirmed in relation to how the investigation was conducted that she \"*never say anything formally written*\" but was advised by Ms. Veenman \"*that the results of the investigation showed that they could find no one or no evidence that this bribe had been made*.\"1929\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2902 line 10 to p. 2907 line 6.\n\n1467.\n\nDr. Jezek rejected the suggestion that his departure from TCC in early April 2010 was connected to the outcome of the investigation, stating that this was \"[a]*bsolutely not*\" the case.1930 This testimony was confirmed by Ms. Boggs who stated that the timing was coincidental.1931\n\nTranscript (Day 12), p. 3134 lines 10-12.\n\nTranscript (Day 11), p. 2907 line 21 to p. 2908 line 4.\n\n1468.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Dr. Jezek testified that he believed the Chief Minister's allegation to be \"*completely unfounded*\" and made to \"*suit his political needs*\" in light of the rising sentiments in Balochistan against the project that was viewed as a \"*symbol of federal oppression*.\" Dr. Jezek considered his view confirmed by the comments on the then-Canadian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Mr. Randolph Plank, who had met with the Chief Minister a few days earlier.1932 In his summary of that meeting, Mr. Plank reported that he had inquired whether the Chief Minister meant what he said in his public statements against the project or whether he was playing to audience to satisfy his constituents and that the answer had been:\n\n\"\u2022 *CM affirmed that he was playing to audience*\n\n\u2022 *Such statements were necessary to position him as the promoter of Balochistan's interest* 'demanding major benefits' *for Balochistan*.\"1933\n\nJezek II, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n**Exhibit CE-578**, p. 2. *See also* p. 3.\n\n1469.\n\nMs. Boggs stated that the Chief Minister's allegation was \"*more likely \u2026 just a negotiating tactic*\" given that he did not provide any further information as to when or by whom he had been offered a bribe or how he was contacted but rather continued with the meeting following Mr. Luksic's statement and asked TCC \"*to make him a better offer with a new, but still legitimate, business proposal*.\"1934\n\nBoggs IV, \u00b6 41.\n\n1470.\n\nRespondent further relied on two news articles published in January 2013 after Chief Minister Raisani and his government had been dismissed. In a news article published on *thenews.com.pk* on 14 January 2013, Mr. Raisani was reported to have said that his government was \"*ambushed as part of conspiracy which was at work for over three years*,\" having started \"*after he refused to be bribed over the issue of Reko Diq*.\" Mr. Raisani reportedly said: \"*I was being pressurised to start negotiating with the global copper companies over Reko Diq. They offered me money and tried to bribe me but I refused to be bought, I refused to meet or entertain them*.\" Mr. Raisani also referred to an \"*international conspiracy*\" involving \"*the Dutch, Germans, Chinese, Russians and Americans*\" as all of their diplomats were asking about Reko Diq whenever he met with one of them.1935\n\n**Exhibit RE-430 / AM-7A**.\n\n1471.\n\nIn a further news article published on *thenews.com.pk* on 19 January 2013, Mr. Raisani was again reported to have linked his dismissal to the Reko Diq project, arguing that his opponents attempted to \"*pressurize* [him] *not to take a strong stance against the Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) and to hand it over the Chilean and Canadian consortium which is Antofagasta and Barrick Gold of Canada*\" and then dismissed his government \"*in the hopes of getting a hold on the resources of Balochistan*.\" Mr. Raisani reportedly remained \"*adamant that he made enemies when he refused to be cornered into taking a decision in favour of TCC, Pakistan, and when he turned down offers of bribe by the TCC*.\"1936\n\n**Exhibit RE-431 / AM-7B**.\n\n**(iv) The Tribunal's Consideration on of the Evidentiary Record**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1472.\n\nBased on the evidence presented by the Parties, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that Chief Minister Raisani was offered a bribe of USD 1 million by Mr. Mustikhan on instructions of Dr. Jezek in late 2009.\n\n1473.\n\nFirst, as regards Respondent's submission that the offer was first considered by Mr. Flores after Mr. Raisani had become Chief Minister in April 2008, the Tribunal is not convinced by Col. Khan's testimony that Mr. Flores \"*enthusiastically agreed that this was a very* 'workable' *and affordable solution, which he would present to Claimant's Board of Directors*.\" Mr. Flores strongly rejected this allegation and apart from Col. Khan's testimony, there is no indication that this conversation took place.\n\n1474.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Col. Khan gave a similar account of his alleged conversation with Mr. Flores during a meeting he had with Mr. Flew in June 2015. However, Col. Khan openly admitted that he had lied to Mr. Flew at various points during that meeting and did not want to place much emphasis on what was recorded in the transcript of this conversation that Claimant submitted into the record of this arbitration. In addition, Mr. Flew testified that, by contrast to the subsequently surfaced rumor that an offer had been made to Chief Minister Raisani, he had never heard before of the alleged involvement of Mr. Flores in this matter. Dr. Jezek, who conducted an investigation of the allegation within TCC at the time, also stated that he did not recall having obtained such information before reading Col. Khan's witness statement in this arbitration.\n\n1475.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that even on Col. Khan's testimony, Claimant's Board of Directors rejected the proposal to offer a bribe to Chief Minister Raisani and thus did not sanction the alleged plan to improperly win favor with the Chief Minister by buying him a house in Islamabad and a BMW car. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that this incident cannot support Respondent's allegation that an offer was later made on behalf of TCC.\n\n1476.\n\nSecond, in relation to the donation of PAK Rs. 10 million that Claimant made in late 2008 to the Chief Minister of Balochistan's Relief and Rehabilitation Fund after an earthquake had occurred in Balochistan, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's allegation that Ms. Boggs agreed with Col. Khan at the time that \"*there was a good chance that this money would end up in CM Raisani's personal bank account*.\" The Tribunal notes that contemporaneous e-mails exchanged between Ms. Boggs and Col. Khan in relation to the donation show that Ms. Boggs was inquiring about the nature that their charitable contribution should take and the legitimacy of the fund that Col. Khan had identified. According to these e-mails, Col. Khan told her that his recommendation to make a cash donation was based on the advice of Additional Chief Secretary Lehri and that the fund had been opened for the special purpose of collecting donations for earthquake relief as reported in daily newspapers.\n\n1477.\n\nWhile Respondent claims that Col. Khan did not specifically confirm that the fund was legitimate, there is no indication in the documentary record that Ms. Boggs and Col. Khan were creating a \"*paper trail*\" to give the appearance of legitimacy but were in fact acting on the advice of Mr. Farooq pursuant to which a cash donation would likely end up in the pocket of the Chief Minister himself. The Tribunal considers its view reinforced by the fact that, as pointed out by Claimant, the donation was made in an open and ceremonial manner and various other donors, including international companies, contributed to the same fund, which raised a total of PAK Rs. 2.35 billion in the wake of the earthquake.\n\n1478.\n\nOn that basis, it cannot be considered established that Ms. Boggs and Col. Khan intended to, and much less did, provide personal benefits to the Chief Minister by making a donation to the relief fund opened in his name after the earthquake in Balochistan.\n\n1479.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address the allegation that an offer was finally made to Chief Minister Raisani by Mr. Mustikhan on instructions of Dr. Jezek in late 2009. In this regard, it is undisputed and has been confirmed both by Ms. Boggs and Dr. Jezek as well as by contemporaneous notes that, during a meeting on 13 January 2010, Chief Minister Raisani raised the allegation that he been offered a bribe by someone at TCC *vis-\u00e0-vis* several representatives from Claimant and its parent companies. As reported in two news articles dating from January 2013, Mr. Raisani then still maintained the allegation that he had been offered a bribe by TCC three years earlier and claimed that his resistance to this offer and the pressure he had faced gave rise to a conspiracy leading to his dismissal in January 2013.\n\n1480.\n\nDr. Jezek and Ms. Boggs testified that during the meeting on 13 January 2010, the Chief Minister did not provide any details regarding the alleged offer, in particular who had offered it and how much was offered on what occasion. While it became apparent during the hearing that neither of Claimant's representatives specifically asked for further details on the allegation, both witnesses maintained that their delegation gave the Chief Minister sufficient opportunity to provide them with further details but that he chose not to do so but to move on with the meeting.\n\n1481.\n\nDr. Jezek stated that he first learned of a rumor that someone from TCC had offered an amount of USD 1 million even before the meeting with the Chief Minister and that he made inquiries with \"*TCC staff, consultants, and numerous individuals outside of TCC*\" in order to identify the source of this rumor but was not successful. Moreover, both Dr. Jezek and Ms. Boggs testified about an internal investigation conducted after the 13 January 2010 meeting by Ms. Veenman of Barrick. The Tribunal takes note of the fact that neither of them could provide any further details about how this investigation was conducted or about a written report or formal information provided to Claimant's Board of Directors of its outcome. The Tribunal is also aware that Claimant refused to produce certain documents about the internal investigation on the basis that they are privileged.\n\n1482.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is indeed remarkable that Ms. Boggs could not recall that any written report or formal document was produced by Ms. Veenman and that Ms. Boggs had to rely on information on the outcome of the investigation that she had been given by Ms. Veenman during an oral conversation. However, the circumstances surrounding the contemporaneous investigation conducted into the allegation raised by Chief Minister Raisani cannot be sufficient in and of themselves to establish that an offer of bribery was made. Respondent has to establish that a specific offer was made by or on instructions of a person whose conduct would be attributable to Claimant. This applies in particular given Mr. Luksic's undisputed statement during the 13 January 2010 meeting with the Chief Minister, which he made on behalf of representatives from Claimant and its parent companies, that the offer had not been made on behalf of TCC and that TCC did not tolerate or approve bribery.\n\n1483.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent relies on the witness testimony of Mr. Mustikhan who stated that he was instructed by Dr. Jezek following an unsuccessful meeting with Chief Minister Raisani on 26 September 2009 that he should feel free to inquire about the \"*personal demands*\" of the Chief Minister and that, following further instructions in November 2009, he arranged a meeting with the Chief Minister through his brother in early December 2009 and at that occasion offered the bribe. The Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Mustikhan's testimony in this regard. Apart from the fact that Dr. Jezek denied that he gave any instruction to Mr. Mustikhan regarding follow-up actions during the discussion they had following the meeting with the Chief Minister, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Mr. Mustikhan decided to wait for more than two months after receiving the alleged instructions before arranging for a second meeting with the Chief Minister. During the hearing, Mr. Mustikhan mentioned for the first time that he received additional instructions from Dr. Jezek \"*sometime in November*\" but could not provide any details as to the alleged additional instructions or the discussions he allegedly had with Dr. Jezek \"*off and on*\" about the subject. While the Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that Dr. Jezek decided to employ Mr. Mustikhan despite reports about Mr. Mustikhan having been engaged in corrupt activities and that he decided to let Mr. Mustikhan start his work before having signed his consultancy agreement with TCC, the Tribunal does not consider this sufficient to establish that he gave him instructions to make an improper offer to the Chief Minister.\n\n1484.\n\nThe Tribunal is further not convinced by Mr. Mustikhan's account of the meeting at which he allegedly offered a bribe to the Chief Minister. Mr. Mustikhan stated that he did not keep any records of meetings or other activities but claimed to recall that the meeting took place in early December, without being able to identify a specific date or any other indication as to how he remembered this timing. Mr. Mustikhan also remained very vague as to when and how his brother allegedly managed to arrange the meeting. This is particularly noteworthy when taking into account Claimant's parallel and documented efforts to have a further meeting with the Chief Minister, with the 13 January 2010 meeting having been made only upon the intervention of the Argentine Ambassador to Pakistan. Mr. Mustikhan also could not identify any person that he would have seen on his way in or out of the meeting with the Chief Minister and could not remember which one of the Chief Minister's personal secretaries had let him into the office.\n\n1485.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal takes note of the fact that Mr. Mustikhan himself did not state that he offered an amount of USD 1 million to the Chief Minister but rather referred to an unquantified \"*huge array of financial benefits*.\" His testimony thus does not accord with the amount attached to the rumor that surfaced in late 2009 and, more importantly, the amount that Respondent alleges to have been offered to the Chief Minister.\n\n1486.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to make a finding as to whether the Chief Minister's allegation was prompted by political considerations \"*to play the audience*\" and, in particular, a desire to harm Claimant's reputation in order to be able to pursue the GOB's own project instead of continuing to cooperate with Claimant. It suffices to note that, as the Tribunal has found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the GOB decided around December 2009, *i.e*., the same time that the rumor regarding an alleged bribery offer by TCC surfaced, that it wanted to \"*take over*\" the Reko Diq project from Claimant.1937 The exact motive for Chief Minister Raisani raising the allegation of having been offered a bribe can be left open. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Mustikhan met with the Chief Minister in early December 2009 and offered him a bribe on the instruction of Claimant's CEO Dr. Jezek.\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1144-1160.\n\n**(e) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1487.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has not established any of the allegations of corruption that it has raised in connection with obtaining the Mineral Agreement and/or Mining Lease. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding as to whether any of the alleged acts of corruption contributed to obtaining a right or benefit for Claimant's investment despite the fact that neither the Mineral Agreement nor the Mining Lease were actually obtained. Similarly, the Tribunal does not have to address Respondent's argument that the alleged acts had an impact on whether Claimant was \"*a fit and proper person*\" to hold a mining lease and thus justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application in 2011 \u2013 given the Tribunal's findings that none of the alleged acts happened, none of them could have had an \"*impact*\" on whether Claimant was \"*a fit and proper person.*\"\n\n1488.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal wishes to confirm that it still considers it established that the GOB intended at least by the end of 2009 to take over the Reko Diq project and thus decided to cease its collaboration with Claimant on the Joint Venture under the CHEJVA. The Tribunal is further still convinced that this decision was the motive for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in 2011. As it has found in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, none of the reasons given by the Licensing Authority in the Notice of Intent to Reject dated 21 September 2011 justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application.1938 For the reasons set out in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal further found that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject.1939\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1226.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1232.\n\n1489.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this would also apply to the additional reason now invoked by Respondent that TCCP was not \"*a fit and proper proper person*\" to hold a mining lease as required by Rule 48(3)(a)(iv) of the 2002 BM Rules. Respondent now suggests that the alleged corruption was \"*clearly relevant to \u2026 the state of mind of the CM, a key decision-maker in the context of that Mining Licence decision process.*\"1940 The Tribunal notes, however, that Respondent has previously placed much emphasis on the fact that the decision was taken by the Licensing Authority, *i.e*., the Director General of the MMDD. Respondent does not allege that allegations of corruption played any role in the decision-making process of the Licensing Authority at the time and there is certainly no indication in the Notice of Intent to Reject that this would have been the case.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 229.\n\n**3. Conclusion on Factual Allegations**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1490.\n\nFor the reasons set out in detail above and based on its review and evaluation of the evidentiary record, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not established any of its individual allegation of corruption that would be attributable to Claimant. The Tribunal has found no proven incident of Claimant exercising, or attempting to exercise, improper influence on Government officials aimed at obtaining rights or benefits relating to Claimant's investment in Pakistan.\n\n1491.\n\nSpecifically as regards the Tribunal's findings on the stopovers made by Government officials at the expense of Claimant or its parent companies on the way back from trips to Chile in December 2006 and Toronto in March 2007, the Tribunal found that Respondent has failed to establish any causal link between the stopovers and any right or benefit that Claimant obtained or at least attempted to obtain in respect of its investment and that, consequently, any improper conduct in connection with these stopovers cannot be deemed to have affected or \"*tainted*\" the investment. In the absence of such any causal link between improper conduct and Claimant's investment, the Tribunal also found that Claimant's conduct cannot be deemed to amount to contributory fault or have any further impact on the quantum of its claim for damages under the Treaty.\n\n1492.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the context in which the testimony provided by Respondent's witnesses arose and was produced in this arbitration. By notification of 11 May 2015 but with effect from 23 April 2015, the GOB decided to form a \"*Local Expert Group for the Reko-Diq cases pending adjudication before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)*\" and instructed the Expert Group to, *inter alia*, \"*investigate acts of mala fide and corruption in Reko-diq case and conduct of Broken Hill Properties Minerals (BHPM) and Tethyan Copper Company (TCC)*\" and to \"[i]*dentify new evidence including mala fide and corruption which can be helpful to legal firm engaged in ongoing arbitrations or out of court negotiations, which ever path is resorted to*.\"1941 It is remarkable that while, on Respondent's submission, \"*Pakistan conducted investigations into corruption surrounding the Reko Diq project, albeit unsuccessfully, since at least 2011*,\"1942 the Local Expert Group then identified within a matter of weeks \"*seven former and serving Public servants/GoB officials/holders of public office* [that] *are directly involved in widespread corrupt and fraudulent practices in respect of the Reko Diq project*.\"1943\n\n**Exhibit RE-188**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 272.\n\n**Exhibit RE-190**, *referring to* Messrs. Muhammad Farooq, Shehbaz Khan Mandokhel, Sheikh Asmatullah, Masood Malik, Muhammad Tahir, Abdul Aziz, Habibullah Baloch and Sher Khan (noting that the latter was not a public servant).\n\n1493.\n\nIn addition, the the Tribunal notes that the Local Expert Group recommended in its Briefing Note of 4 June 2015 that the GOB should write to the NAB as the competent body \"*to initiate an inquiry into corruption and corrupt practices in respect of Reko Diq. Responsible governmental officials and TCC personal should be brought to justice*.\"1944 In line with this recommendation, the GOB requested the NAB to initiate an inquiry by letter of 22 June 2015, which the NAB did by authorization of its Chairman two days later.1945 Taking into account that the NAB started to interview the seven individuals identified by the Local Group of Experts as well as further individuals in July 2015 and obtained in the course of August and September 2015 so-called Section 161 statements from the individuals that Respondent presented as witnesses in this arbitration in which each of them confessed to having been directly involved in corruption,1946 it is indeed remarkable that as far as the Tribunal has been informed, the NAB has to date not initiated a prosecution against any of these individuals.1947 The Tribunal also feels the need to record its concern as regards the timing and context in which the evidence was produced, which serves to reinforce the conclusions it has reached above.\n\n**Exhibit RE-443**, p. 57.\n\n**Exhibits RE-190** and **CE-611**.\n\n*See* **Exhibits RE-447** to **RE-453** and **RE-456** to **RE-457**. The only exception is Mr. Iqbal whose witness statement was submitted in this arbitration together with Respondent's Reply on 15 July 2016. His Section 161 statement dates from 11 March 2016. **Exhibit RE-491**.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 77; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 294. Respondent has not corrected this statement in the further course of the proceedings.\n\n1494.\n\nFinally, as for the diary kept by Mr. Aziz, which is the only piece of documentary evidence presented by Respondent that would directly support certain of its corruption allegations, the Tribunal has noted above that the NAB did not allow for an inspection of the diary outside Pakistan and then refused Respondent's own expert Mr. LaPorte to perform the very analysis for which he had been retained, *i.e*., an ink-dating analysis, which could have positively proven that two of the relevant entries in the diary were made in 2015 rather than in 2008 and thus that the evidence would have been fabricated.\n\n**E. Legal Consequences Flowing from Proven Factual Allegations, If Any**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1495.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusion that Respondent has not proven any of its factual allegations of corruption, the Tribunal does not need to address the Parties' arguments regarding the legal consequences, if any, that would arise from such proven acts of corruption.\n\n1496.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore confirms, as it has found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability for the reasons set out therein, that: (i) it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and that the claims are admissible;1948 and (ii) by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent has breached its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.1949\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 688.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1373.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1497.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's invitation of 20 March 2017, both Parties submitted their statements of costs on 20 April 2017, reflecting the costs, fees and expenses they incurred in the present phase of the proceedings concerning Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims.\n\n1498.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision on the costs of the arbitration, *i.e.*, the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, shall form part of the award. In light of the Tribunal's finding that Respondent's Application is to be dismissed and its confirmation of the findings it has made in the Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, *i.e*., that Respondent has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty and is therefore liable for the losses that Claimant incurred as a result of these breaches, there is currently a further phase of the proceedings in which Claimant's losses are to be quantified. The present decision is therefore not an award within the meaning of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and in line with its considerations in the Draft Decision, the Tribunal has again decided to reserve its decision on the costs of this phase of the arbitration for its Award.\n\n**IX. DECISION BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n1499.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides as follows:\n\nI. The evidence submitted by Respondent as well as the counter-evidence submitted\n\nby Claimant in the present phase of the proceeding are admitted into the record.\n\nII. Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2 September 2015 is dismissed in its entirety.\n\nIII. Respondent has not established any of its individual allegations of corruption that would be attributable to Claimant and that could have become relevant as potential contributory fault in the quantum phase that is now to follow.\n\nIV. The Tribunal's decision on the costs of this phase of the proceeding is reserved for the Award."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date":

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Institution of These ICSID Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a legal dispute between TCCA and Pakistan arising out of TCCA's claimed investments in Pakistan. Claimant alleges that Pakistan violated the *Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investments*, which was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force on 14 October 1998 (the \" **Australia-Pakistan Treaty** \", the \" **Treaty** \" or the \" **BIT**\"),1 by its arbitrary and unlawful denial of a mining lease to Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Private) Limited (\"**TCCP**\"), TCCA's wholly-owned Pakistan subsidiary, and other actions attributable to Pakistan that, according to Claimant, deprived TCCA of the value of its investments. Such alleged actions include, in particular, developing and executing a scheme to take over TCCA's Reko Diq project, denying the Mining Lease Application in pursuit of that scheme and using TCCA's exploration and feasibility work product in its own project, which allegedly amounted to a breach of the fair and equal treatment obligation under Article 3(2), an expropriation of TCCA's investment without compensation in violation of Article 7(1) and an impairment of TCCA's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**.\n\n6.\n\nArticle 3 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n\"*1. Each Party shall encourage and promote investments in its territory by investors of the other Party and shall, in accordance with its laws and investment policies applicable from time to time, admit investments.*\n\n*2. Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own territory to Investments*.\"\n\n7.\n\nArticle 7(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"*Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as '* expropriation *') the investments of investors of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with: the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and under due process of law;*\n\n*the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation*.\"\n\n8.\n\nArticle 3(3) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"*Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory protection and security to investments and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments*.\"\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\").2 Article 36 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"*(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General who shall send a copy of the request to the other party.*\n\n*(2) The request shall contain information concerning the issues in dispute, the identity of the parties and their consent to arbitration in accordance with the rules of procedure for the institution of conciliation and arbitration proceedings.*\n\n*(3) The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of registration or refusal to register*.\"\n\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965.\n\n10.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Claimant referred to Article 13(3)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty pursuant to which Pakistan agreed to \"*consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days*\" of receiving the Request for Arbitration.3\n\nRfA, \u00b6 14.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID (\"**Secretary-General**\") registered Claimant's Request for Arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 11 April 2012, Claimant elected the formula for the constitution of the Tribunal provided under Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (*i.e.,* that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators: one arbitrator to be appointed by each Party, and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties).\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 18 May 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General that it appointed Mr. John Beechey, a British national, as an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Mr. Beechey accepted his appointment on 1 June 2012.\n\n14.\n\nOn 12 June 2012, Respondent appointed as arbitrator Rt. Hon. Lord Leonard Hoffmann, a British national, who accepted his appointment on the following day.\n\n15.\n\nIn separate letters dated 9 July 2012, the Parties expressed their agreement to the appointment of Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a German national, as the President of the Tribunal. Prof. Sachs accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator on 12 July 2012.\n\n16.\n\nOn 12 July 2012, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.4 Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\nRule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, Respondent filed a proposal for disqualification of Mr. Beechey as an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Disqualification Proposal**\"). On the same date, the ICSID Secretariat (the \"**Secretariat**\") informed the Parties that, pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), the proceeding was suspended until a decision on the Disqualification Proposal had been taken.\n\n18.\n\nAlso on 23 July 2012, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the \"**Provisional Measures Request**\"). The Secretariat informed the Parties that, in light of the suspension of the proceedings, Claimant's submission would be sent to the Tribunal once the proceedings resumed.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs and Lord Hoffmann fixed a procedural schedule concerning the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n20.\n\nOn 26 July 2012, Respondent supplemented its Disqualification Proposal.\n\n21.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, Claimant submitted a reply to the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n22.\n\nOn 3 August 2012, pursuant to Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Mr. Beechey furnished explanations in response to the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n23.\n\nFollowing consultation with the Parties, by letter of 7 August 2012, the Secretary of the Tribunal on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, confirmed that a hearing on the Disqualification Proposal would be held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre (the \"**IDRC**\") in London, on 8 September 2012.\n\n24.\n\nOn 31 August 2012, each Party filed observations to Mr. Beechey's explanations of 3 August 2012.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 6 September 2012, Claimant informed the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal that the Parties had jointly requested Mr. Beechey to resign from the Tribunal and that he had complied with this request. By letter of the same date, Respondent expressed its consent to Mr. Beechey's resignation from the Tribunal. Respondent stated that its consent was without prejudice to objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which it might raise at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nBy e-mail of the same date to the ICSID Secretariat copied to his co-arbitrators, Mr. Beechey confirmed his resignation from the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 7 September 2012, the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal informed the Secretary-General of their consent to Mr. Beechey's resignation. By letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed the Parties thereof and invited Claimant to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in order to fill the vacancy resulting from Mr. Beechey's resignation.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 7 September 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General that it appointed Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 11(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Attached to Claimant's letter was a letter from Respondent of 6 September 2012 providing its advance consent to Dr. Alexandrov's appointment, subject to Dr. Alexandrov's formal confirmation of the disclosure of his participation as counsel in two concluded cases.\n\n29.\n\nOn 10 September 2012, Dr. Alexandrov accepted his appointment and confirmed the disclosure which he had previously made to Claimant.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed the Parties of Dr. Alexandrov's acceptance, and that the proceeding would resume pursuant to Rule 12 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy on the Tribunal had occurred. The Secretariat provided the reconstituted Tribunal with Claimant's Provisional Measures Request dated 23 July 2012 (\"**Provisional Measures Request**\"), including supporting documents as well as the Witness Statements of Messrs. Timothy Livesey and Robert Krcmarov. In its Provisional Measures Request, Claimant requested that the *status quo* be preserved during the pendency of the arbitration. Specifically, it requested that Respondent and Balochistan refrain from (i) further developing; or (ii) disposing of, the Reko Diq Mining Area; (iii) breaching the confidentiality provisions of Claimant's Feasibility Study; and (iv) infringing Claimant's exclusive surface rights. In addition, Claimant requested that Respondent and Balochistan issue any authorization required to allow Claimant's expatriate staff to work in, and travel to Pakistan.\n\n31.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 11 September 2012, Claimant submitted corrected versions of Exhibits CE-99 and CE-128.\n\n**B. The Initiation of the ICC Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nPrior to the initiation of these proceedings, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration against the Province of Balochistan, Pakistan, with the International Chamber of Commerce, which was registered on 28 November 2011 and assigned the number ICC Case 18347/VRO/AGF (\"**ICC Proceedings**\"). Claimant's claims in the ICC Proceedings arise out of Claimant's alleged right to a mining lease under Article 11.8.2 of the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 29 July 1993 between the Balochistan Development Authority and BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. (\"**CHEJVA**\") and Rule 48(1)(b) of the 2002 Balochistan Mining Rules. Claimant claims Respondent has breached the CHEJVA and the 2002 Balochistan Mining Rules by denying its application for a mining lease.\n\n33.\n\nClaimant submitted the dispute to arbitration pursuant to Clause 15.4 of the CHEJVA which provided that \"*any dispute*\" which the parties failed to resolve amicably or through voluntary expert conciliation \"*shall be submitted*\" to international arbitration before ICSID or, in the event that ICSID does \"*not accept jurisdiction*\" or \"*reject*[s] *the arbitration request*,\" to arbitration under the ICC Rules.5\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 62. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 15.4.1, 15.4.8. On 28 November 2011, Claimant had also initiated arbitration proceedings against Pakistan and Balochistan before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to clause 15.4.8 of the CHEJVA. By notice dated 7 December 2011, the ICSID Secretary-General informed the Parties that ICSID lacked jurisdiction over the dispute with Balochistan because Pakistan had neither designated Balochistan as a constituent subdivision, nor approved Balochistan's consent to ICSID arbitration, nor informed ICSID that such approval was not required.\n\n34.\n\nOn 23 July 2013, the ICC Tribunal, in response to TCCA's request dated 10 May 2013, issued its ruling on bifurcation, ruling that the Government's objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility be joined to the merits and that the validity and binding nature of the CHEJVA should be decided in advance of the main allegations regarding breach of the CHEJVA. The ICC Tribunal issued its Rulings on Preliminary Issues on 23 October 2014 (\"**ICC Rulings on Preliminary Issues**\").6 These rulings will be referred to later in this Award.\n\nRuling on Preliminary Measures, \u00b6 47.\n\n35.\n\nThus, Claimant is currently conducting parallel and independent arbitration proceedings, with the ICC Tribunal deciding Claimant's contractual claims under the CHEJVA and this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal deciding Claimant's treaty claims under the Australia-Pakistan Treaty.\n\n**C. The ICSID Arbitral Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Pre-Hearing Phase**\n----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated 14 September 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, confirmed that the First Session pursuant to Rule 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (\"**First Session**\") and the hearing on the Provisional Measures Request (the \"**Provisional Measures Hearing**\") would be held at the IDRC in London on 6 November 2012.\n\n37.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 1 October 2012, Respondent submitted, without prejudice to its jurisdictional objections, its Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (\"**Provisional Measures Response**\") with supporting documents as well as the Witness Statement of Dr. Samar Mubarakmand and its annexes. In its Provisional Measures Response, Respondent informed the Tribunal about its plans to develop the deposit H4 (the \" **H4 Work Plan**\") and noted that the GOB had no present intention to exploit the area beyond H4. It therefore requested that the Provisional Measures Request be dismissed with costs awarded in Respondent's favor.\n\n38.\n\nOn 15 October 2012, Claimant submitted its Reply on Provisional Measures (\"**Provisional Measures Reply**\"), with supporting documents as well as the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey. In the Reply, Claimant renewed its request that, given the imminent nature of the harm anticipated by Claimant, the Tribunal immediately grant the requested provisional measures as a temporary restraint pending disposition of the Provisional Measures Request.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties of the Tribunal's decision that the Tribunal would not decide on the requested relief before having received Respondent's Provisional Measures Rejoinder and having heard both Parties' arguments at the oral hearing.\n\n40.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 29 October 2012, Respondent submitted the Rejoinder (titled \"*Respondent's Answer to the Claimant's Reply*\") (\"**Provisional Measures Rejoinder**\"), together with supporting documents.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter dated 31 October 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that Respondent inform the Tribunal and Counsel for Claimant whether Respondent intended to cross-examine Messrs. Livesey and Krcmarov during the Provisional Measures Hearing. By letter of the same date, Respondent confirmed that it did not intend to do so.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal held the First Session with the Parties on 6 November 2012. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed, *inter alia*, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. The Parties were unable to reach an agreement on the place of the proceedings. Having heard the Parties on this matter, the Tribunal decided that Washington, D.C. would be the place of the proceeding and that, unless otherwise agreed, the hearings would be held at the World Bank Conference Centre in Paris. During the First Session, the Parties and the Tribunal also discussed the other items on the Draft Agenda and Procedural Order previously circulated by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Parties' agreements and their respective positions regarding the items on which they did not agree and agreed on a procedural timetable. At the proposal of the Tribunal, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Dr. Tilman Niedermaier as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n43.\n\nThe Provisional Measures Hearing was held at the IDRC on 6 November 2012, following the First Session. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the Assistant and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were (i) For Claimant: Mr. Donald Francis Donovan, Dr. Dietmar W.

During this Hearing, the Tribunal heard oral arguments from each of the Parties on this matter and Respondent's witness Dr. Mubarakmand was cross-examined.\n\n44.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 13 November 2012, Claimant submitted the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey.\n\n45.\n\nOn 19 November 2012, Respondent submitted its comments on the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey.\n\n46.\n\nBy email of 27 November 2012, Respondent proposed to amend the procedural time table discussed during the First Session in view of an expected judgment of the Pakistani Supreme Court on the validity of the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 29 July 1993 between the Balochistan Development Authority and BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. (\"**CHEJVA** \", as further described at paragraphs 228 to 250 below) and provide for a separate hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n47.\n\nBy letter dated 28 November 2012, Claimant, upon direction by the Tribunal, stated its position on a cross-undertaking and security in the event that the Tribunal was inclined to grant Claimant's Provisional Measure Request.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated 30 November 2012, Respondent replied to Claimant's letter dated 28 November 2012.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Claimant responded to Respondent's email of 27 November 2012 and requested that the Tribunal should \"*decide in a first phase of the arbitral proceedings on (i) any jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent, (ii) the claim that Respondent breached the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; and (iii) Claimant's request for specific performance as a remedy to the breach of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, if any.*\"\n\n50.\n\nBy letter dated 1 December 2012, Respondent commented on Claimant's letter dated 30 November 2012.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter dated 3 December 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties that the Tribunal had noted the Parties' respective positions in respect of the timetable and, for the time being, did not consider a decision to be required.\n\n52.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Provisional Measures Request. In its Decision, the Tribunal ordered Respondent to \"*immediately inform the Tribunal and Claimant of any change of its intention (i) to implement the H4 Work Plan, (ii) not to expand its mining activities to H14 and/or H15 or to any other deposit within License EL-5 and (iii) not to give any rights in this regard to any third party*.\" The Tribunal further ordered Respondent to \"*inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular basis, about its specific plans and activities with respect to deposit H4*.\" Finally, the Tribunal stated that it remained seized of the matter and would consider further applications by Claimant if the situation materially changed.\n\n53.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 18 December 2012, the Secretariat provided the Parties with a letter of Co-Arbitrator Dr. Alexandrov of the same date, in which Dr. Alexandrov informed the Parties that the international arbitration practice of his firm Sidley Austin LLP had been asked to serve as counsel in an arbitration in which Mr. David A.R. Williams also served as counsel and that he was part of the counsel team. In a letter dated 20 April 2012, Respondent had raised concerns regarding the proposed nomination of Mr. Williams as an arbitrator in the instant case due to his role in said arbitration.\n\n54.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 21 December 2012, the Secretariat provided the Parties with Procedural Order No. 1 issued by the Tribunal on 3 December 2012. Procedural Order No. 1 had been prepared on the basis of the Parties' respective comments, reflects the Parties' agreements and the Tribunal's decision during the First Session and, *inter alia*, sets out the procedural timetable.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Claimant applied for an extension of time for the submission of its Memorial on the Merits from 25 January to 1 February 2013.\n\n56.\n\nUpon invitation by the Tribunal to comment on Claimant's application, Respondent informed the Tribunal by letter dated 27 December 2012 that the Pakistani Supreme Court had yet not rendered its decision on the validity of the CHEJVA and that Respondent therefore was not in a position to comment on Claimant's application. The Tribunal extended the time limit for comments on Claimant's application until 14 January 2013.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter dated 6 January 2013, Claimant renewed its application for a one-week extension of the time limit for the submission of its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n58.\n\nOn 7 January 2013, the Tribunal granted an extension of the time limit for the filing of Claimant's Memorial on the Merits from 25 January to 1 February 2013, noting that Respondent's right to submit a request for amendment of the procedural timetable, following the Pakistani Supreme Court's order/judgment, remained unaffected.\n\n59.\n\nUnder cover of a letter of the same date, Respondent filed a short order of the Pakistani Supreme Court, by which the Court had held the CHEJVA to be void, illegal and *non est*. In its letter, Respondent announced that it would submit a brief in respect of the Tribunal's jurisdiction within two weeks after the release of the detailed judgment of the Pakistani Supreme Court and made a proposal for a schedule for a one-day hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n60.\n\nBy letter dated 14 January 2013, Claimant commented on Respondent's letter dated 7 January 2013, objected to Respondent's proposal to hold a one-day hearing on jurisdiction and requested that the procedural calendar in place be confirmed.\n\n61.\n\nBy letter of 16 January 2013, the Tribunal noted that the procedural timetable in place did not provide for a separate hearing on jurisdiction. It indicated that, before Respondent filed any submissions on jurisdiction, which were not provided for in the procedural timetable, Respondent would be required to file a reasoned application for its amendment, Claimant would be afforded the opportunity to comment, and the Tribunal would then decide whether it would amend the procedural schedule. Until then, the agreed procedural schedule set out in Procedural Order No. 1 would remain the same.\n\n62.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits (the \" **Memorial**\"), together with supporting documents as well as the Witness Statement of Ms. Catherine Boggs and the Fourth Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey.\n\n63.\n\nBy letter dated 5 March 2013, Respondent informed the Tribunal that its lead counsel, Mr. Arthur Mariott QC, had fallen severely ill and therefore requested an extension of six weeks for submitting its Memorial on Defence and Counterclaim.\n\n64.\n\nUpon invitation by the Tribunal, Claimant commented by letter dated 11 March 2013 on Respondent's request for an extension of time. Claimant refused to agree to an extension of six weeks and instead invited Respondent to agree on a timetable which would allow the procedural timetable to be upheld.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter of 12 March 2013, enclosing a letter from the arbitral tribunal in the parallel ICC Proceedings, Respondent reiterated its request for a six-week extension.\n\n66.\n\nUpon invitation by the Tribunal to comment on Respondent's letter dated 12 March 2013, Claimant, by letter dated 18 March 2013, informed the Tribunal that it would agree to move the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability to the period between 20 January and 21 February 2014 and that, if the Hearing could not then be held, it would maintain its original position.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had appointed Mr. Mansoor H. Khan of Khan & Associates as co-counsel.\n\n68.\n\nBy letters of 28 March 2013 respectively, the Parties confirmed that they would be available for a hearing from 3 to 8 February 2014.\n\n69.\n\nOn 3 April 2013, the Tribunal decided that (i) the time limit for the submission of the Counter-Memorial was extended until 7 June 2013; (ii) the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability would be held from 3 to 8 February 2014 at the World Bank's Conference Center in Paris and (iii) the Parties were to liaise with each other and submit a joint proposal for the procedural schedule leading to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability by 3 May 2013, failing which agreement the Tribunal would itself fix the procedural schedule leading to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability on the basis of the proposal(s) submitted to it.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter dated 4 April 2013, Respondent informed the Tribunal that, due to his appointment as Federal Minister, its counsel Mr. Ahmer Soofi had ceased to represent Respondent in this case and that Mr. Kayzad Kaikobad of ABS & Co. would replace him.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter dated 3 May 2013, Claimant withdrew its request for specific performance and reserved its right to seek damages.\n\n72.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, Respondent filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and requested that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits and address the preliminary objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (\"**Request for Suspension and Trifurcation**\"). Enclosed with the letter was a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan of 7 January 2013, by which the Court had held the CHEJVA to be illegal and void *ab initio*.\n\n73.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Respondent requested that the Tribunal order Claimant to pay Respondent's costs related to the interim relief/provisional measures applications (\"**Request for Decision on Costs**\") and that it direct Claimant and its parent companies to disclose internal information that relates to the withdrawal or write down of its interest in the Reko Diq project (\"**Request for Document Production**\").\n\n74.\n\nBy letter dated 10 May 2013, Respondent submitted the full judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.7\n\n**Exhibit RE-58**.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter dated 20 May 2013, Claimant responded to the Request for Suspension and Trifurcation.\n\n76.\n\nBy letter dated 22 May 2013, Respondent responded to Claimant's letter dated 20 May 2013.\n\n77.\n\nBy letter dated 22 May 2013, Claimant responded to the Request for Decision on Costs and the Request for Document Production.\n\n78.\n\nBy letter dated 27 May 2013, Respondent commented on Claimant's letter dated 22 May 2013.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Claimant requested the Tribunal\n\n\"*(i) to confirm that, as ordered on 3 April 2013, Pakistan must submit its Counter-Memorial on Liability on 7 June 2013;*\n\n*(ii) to fix a revised schedule for submissions with the dates proposed in TCCA's 20 May letter;*\n\n*(iii) to reject Pakistan's request to vacate the current hearing dates;*\n\n*(iv) in light of Pakistan's confirmation of its sole Rule 41 objection, to fix a schedule for parallel briefing on that sole objection, Pakistan's assertion that this Tribunal must accept the ruling of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the validity of the CHEJVA and related agreements;*\n\n*(v) in the alternative to (iv), if Pakistan advises that it did not intend to provide the confirmation TCCA sought in our 20 May letter, to order in accordance with Rule 41(1) that Pakistan's Counter-Memorial include all objections that '* the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal*,' and that briefing on those objections and on liability proceed simultaneously*.\"\n\n80.\n\nBy letter dated 28 May 2013, Respondent commented on Claimant's letter dated 27 May 2013.\n\n81.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Claimant responded to Respondent's letter dated 28 May 2013.\n\n82.\n\nBy letter dated 29 May 2013, Respondent submitted further comments.\n\n83.\n\nOn 29 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 and\n\n(i) dismissed the Request for Suspension and Trifurcation and the Request for Document Production;\n\n(ii) ordered the Parties to include their arguments in respect of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in their respective written submissions as provided in Section 14 of Procedural Order No. 1;\n\n(iii) ordered Respondent to submit its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 7 June 2013;\n\n(iv) directed the Parties to liaise on a joint proposal for the procedural schedule leading to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability by 14 June 2013, failing which agreement the Tribunal would fix the procedural schedule leading to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability on the basis of the proposal(s) submitted to it; and\n\n(v) informed the Parties that it would decide on the costs to the interim relief/provisional measures applications at a later stage of the arbitral proceedings.

There will not be a second submission of rebuttal Post-Hearing Briefs;\n\n(ii) As suggested in its letter of 3 November 2014, Claimant shall clarify its position on its requested relief in writing, by 18 November 2014;\n\n(iii) Slide 94 of Respondent's Closing Presentation is admitted into the record;\n\n(iv) Respondent may submit the two additional legal authorities identified in its letter of 17 October 2014, and Claimant may submit the four additional legal authorities identified in its letter of 27 October 2014, both with their Post-Hearing Briefs; and\n\n(v) The three additional exhibits proposed by Respondent in its letter of 17 October 2014 and the three additional exhibits proposed by Claimant in its letter of 27 October 2014 are admitted into the record.\n\n174.\n\nIn response to a question from the Tribunal at the Hearing, by letter dated 18 November 2014, Claimant stated the relief it seeks for Respondent's breaches of the fair and equitable treatment obligation imposed by Article 3(2), as follows:\n\n*\"For purposes of the liability phase of the arbitration, TCCA seeks separate and independent declarations that:*\n\n*(i) the denial of the Mining Lease Application breached Article 3(2);*\n\n*(ii) the development and implementation of the plan to take over the Reko Diq project breached Article 3(2); and*\n\n*(iii) in addition to each constituting independent violations, the foregoing breaches, together and along with other Government conduct with respect to TCCA's investment\u2014 including, to the extent necessary to prove a composite breach, the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme Court proceedings\u2014constitute an overall course of action that is a composite breach of Article 3(2).*\n\n*(iv) TCCA does not seek a separate and independent declaration that Pakistan breached Article 3(2) through either the Governments' bad-faith conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations, or the conduct of the Governments and the Supreme Court in the domestic constitutional proceedings.*\n\n*This statement of the relief requested is subject to two reservations.*\n\n*First, while TCCA seeks separate and independent declarations only with respect to the breaches set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the Tribunal may consider any of the evidence presented by the Parties and adduced in the hearing in determining whether the conduct in question violated Pakistan's obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to TCCA's investment by way of the conduct set forth in those paragraphs.*\n\n*Second, should the Tribunal reach causation and damages, TCCA reserves the right to present any arguments, and to seek any rulings, with respect to the conduct of the Governments in the Mineral Agreement negotiations or the conduct of the Governments and the Supreme Court in the domestic constitutional proceedings to the extent relevant to causation and damages.\"*\n\n175.\n\nOn 15 January 2015, Claimant filed its Post-Hearing Brief, together with new Exhibits CE-417 to CE-419, new Legal Authorities CA-176 to CA-179 and updated indices of exhibits and authorities, and Respondent filed its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n176.\n\nOn 2 March 2015, in response to a request from the Tribunal, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs in connection with the proceedings as of such date.\n\n**4. Respondent's Request to Submit New Evidence and Application to Dismiss the Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the firm of Allen & Overy informed the Tribunal and ICSID that it had been appointed as counsel to act in the *quantum* phase of the proceedings and for all other matters going forwards and was in the process of finalizing the formal arrangements of its instruction by obtaining a power of attorney. It requested that the Tribunal and ICSID enter Allen & Overy LLP on the record as counsel for Pakistan in place of existing counsel.\n\n178.\n\nIn addition, Allen & Overy informed the Tribunal that \"*cogent new evidence of corruption on the part of TCC*\" had very recently been brought to their attention by Pakistan and it would shortly write to the Tribunal with further details, together with a proposed timetable for addressing this evidence.\n\n179.\n\nFinally, Allen & Overy requested that the Tribunal \"*cease all efforts towards finalising the award*.\"\n\n180.\n\nBy letter dated 23 June 2015, Claimant objected to Pakistan's attempt to introduce new evidence and objected even more strongly to Pakistan's request that the Tribunal depart from its mandate and cease its efforts towards finalizing the award. Claimant requested the Tribunal to reject Pakistan's request.\n\n181.\n\nBy e-mail of 26 June 2015, the Tribunal noted the Parties' positions and informed the Parties that \"[f]o *r the time being, the Tribunal sees no reason to discontinue its still ongoing deliberations on this case*.\"\n\n182.\n\nBy letter dated 21 July 2015, Allen & Overy submitted a power of attorney dated 6 July 2015 authorizing it to represent the Government of Pakistan and further submitted, on behalf of Respondent, five witness statements signed by Messrs. Shehbaz Mandokhail, Abdul Aziz, Muhammad Tahir and Masood Malik and Sheikh Asmatullah. Respondent requested the Tribunal to admit this new evidence into the record and to determine the effect of this evidence and any related further evidence in accordance with an enclosed procedural timetable.\n\n183.\n\nBy letter dated 29 July 2015, Respondent submitted the Urdu translations of the five English language witness statements provided under cover of its 21 July 2015 letter.\n\n184.\n\nBy letter dated 11 August 2015, at the Tribunal's invitation, Claimant objected to Respondent's request to admit new evidence as well as its request to initiate a new phase of the proceedings to determine the effect of this evidence, claiming that Respondent had not satisfied the requirements for the admission of late evidence, namely, that the proferred evidence was unavailable earlier and that it would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the case.\n\n185.\n\nBy letter dated 17 August 2015, Respondent commented on Claimant's objections and claimed that it was entitled to adduce the new evidence because the proceedings were not closed pursuant to Rule 38 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and even if the Rule 38 standard applied, the evidence satisfied it because the evidence was new and it was relevant and material to the outcome of the case. Respondent requested the Tribunal to adopt the timetable proposed in its 21 July 2015 letter and to consider the new evidence presented in that letter.\n\n186.\n\nBy e-mail of 19 August 2015, Claimant requested leave to respond to Respondent's letter of 17 August 2015.\n\n187.\n\nBy email dated 20 August 2015, the Tribunal granted Respondent leave to file a full submission in relation to its request by 2 September 2015 and granted Claimant the opportunity to reply to Respondent's submission and Respondent's 17 August 2015 letter, both by 7 October 2015.\n\n188.\n\nBy letter dated 25 August 2015, addressed to Respondent, with a copy to the Tribunal, Claimant requested that Respondent provide certain information as to the circumstances under which the witness statements that Respondent seeks to submit into evidence were obtained. In addition, in light of the on-going inquiry being conducted by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) under the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 in Pakistan, Claimant requested \"*unequivocal assurance that the confidentiality of its communications, in the form of emails, phone calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise between and among TCC's personnel and its lawyers, both within and without Pakistan has been strictly respected, and that those communications have not been and will not be interfered with, monitored, taped, or otherwise compromised*.\"\n\n189.\n\nBy letter dated 28 August 2015, addressed to the Claimant, with a copy to the Tribunal, Respondent stated that it would provide the relevant information together with its full submission on 2 September 2015. As to Claimant's second request, Respondent stated that in case Claimant should have an application to make in this regard, it should do so, absent such an application, its statement had no place in international arbitration proceedings.\n\n190.\n\nOn 31 August 2015, Claimant filed a request that the Tribunal:\n\n*\" 1. Direct Pakistan to provide unequivocal assurances that the confidentiality of its communications, in the form of emails, phone calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise between and among TCC's personnel and its lawyers, both within and without Pakistan, has been strictly respected, and that those communications have not been and will not be monitored, recorded, interfered with, or otherwise compromised; and*\n\n*2. If Pakistan continued to refuse such assurances, direct Pakistan to identify when, how, and which communications between and among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan, have been monitored, recorded, intercepted, or otherwise compromised.\"*\n\n191.\n\nOn 2 September 2015, Respondent filed an Application to Dismiss the Claims (\"**Respondent's Application**\"), together with supporting witness statements and expert opinions.\n\n192.\n\nBy letter dated 8 September 2015, upon invitation of the Tribunal, Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject TCC's application, and concluded by stating that \"*the NAB has requested counsel for Pakistan to convey to the Tribunal and to TCC that it has not and will continue not to monitor/intercept any form of privileged communication (oral or written) between TCC personnel and their legal counsel.\"* (emphasis in original)\n\n193.\n\nBy e-mail of 10 September 2015, the Tribunal noted Respondent's statement quoted in the previous paragraph and invited Claimant to clarify whether it wished to maintain its request as set out in its letter of 31 August 2015.\n\n194.\n\nBy letter dated 15 September 2015, Claimant responded that Respondent's statement \"*ha*[d] *no meaningful content*\" and requested that the Tribunal:\n\n\"*1. Order Pakistan to refrain from monitoring, recording, interfering with, or otherwise compromising the confidentiality of any communications, in the form of emails, phone calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise, between and among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan; and*\n\n*2. Direct Pakistan to identify when, how, and which communications between and among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan, have been monitored, recorded, intercepted, or otherwise compromised to date*.\"\n\n195.\n\nBy letter dated 18 September 2015, Respondent noted that Claimant, in its letter of 15 September 2015, had raised arguments in relation to Respondent's Application that should have been contained in its reply to this Application due on 7 October 2015. Therefore, Respondent sought guidance from the Tribunal as to the point in time at which it should address Claimant's arguments.\n\n196.\n\nBy email of the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not require any further submissions from the Parties on Claimant's request dated 31 August 2015, as amended on 15 September 2015. The Tribunal further stated that, in case it decided to grant the Parties a second round of submissions on Respondent's Application, Respondent could address any contention contained in Claimant's letter of 15 September 2015 that relate to said Application in its response submission to Claimant's reply due on 7 October 2015.\n\n197.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, ordering Respondent to:\n\n\"*I. Ensure that neither the NAB nor any other agency of the Federal or Provincial Governments monitor/intercept or record any privileged or potentially privileged communication (oral or written), between and among TCC's personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan; and*\n\n*II. Identify whether and if so, when, how and which privileged or potentially privileged communications (oral or written) between and among TCC's personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan, have been monitored/intercepted or recorded by the NAB or any other agency of the Federal or Provincial Governments to date.\"*\n\n198.\n\nBy letter dated 5 October 2015, Respondent submitted witness statements of Col. Sher Khan and Mr. Muhammad Farooq, together with an Urdu translation of Mr. Bari Dad's second witness statement.\n\n199.\n\nBy e-mail dated 6 October 2015, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan gave notice to the Tribunal that he had withdrawn as TCCA's counsel in this case and that his withdrawal \"*was not prompted by any doubts about TCCA's integrity*.\"\n\n200.\n\nOn 16 October 2015, Claimant filed Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application to Dismiss Claims (\"**Claimant's Opposition**\"), together with updated indices of Claimant's Exhibits and Authorities and a courtesy copy of its simultaneous filing in the ICC arbitration.\n\n201.\n\nBy e-mail of 20 October 2015, Respondent requested that it be granted an opportunity to respond to Claimant's Opposition, in particular in respect of the alternative argument.\n\n202.\n\nBy letter dated 21 October 2015, Pakistan confirmed, after inquiry of potentially relevant agencies, that \"*it has not monitored, intercepted or recorded any of the type of communications referred to in paragraph 25 II of Procedural Order No. 5*.\"11\n\nParagraph 25 II of Procedural Order No. 5 refers to \"*privileged or potentially privileged communications (oral or written) between and among TCC's personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan*.\"\n\n203.\n\nOn 27 October 2015, the Tribunal (i) invited Respondent to comment on Claimant's alternative argument as set out in Claimant's Opposition; (ii) requested the Parties to agree on a time schedule to address the new issues raised in Respondent's Application; and (iii) informed the Parties:\n\n\"*The Tribunal would like to inform the Parties that it has almost concluded its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with, a draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues raised in Respondent's Application. The Tribunal notes that, while this approach is not provided for by ICSID, it is common practice in the WTO and also provided for in Article 10.20(9) lit. a of the CAFTA. By analogy to the latter provision, the Parties may submit their comments on the draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within 60 days of its transmission by the Tribunal. Any such comments will be duly considered by the Tribunal in its ultimate Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.*\"\n\n204.\n\nBy letter of 6 November 2015 to Respondent and copied to the Tribunal, Claimant referred to Respondent's declaration of 21 October 2015 and requested that Respondent:\n\n\"*1.

The Background of the CHEJVA**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a. The CHEJVA Was Originally Entered into by BHP and the BDA in July 1993**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAfter initial discussions with the BDA starting in May 1990, BHP submitted to the BDA a draft agreement for the proposed joint venture between BHP and the \"*Government of Baluchistan*\" on 8 May 1991.62 The BDA forwarded the draft to the Government of Balochistan, Secretary Industries, Commerce and Mineral Resources, for onward transmission to the Law Department for appraisement on 29 May 1991.63 On 1 June 1991, the Secretary consented, subject to concurrence by the Finance and Law Departments, that the BDA be authorized to discuss further details with the foreign sponsors.64\n\n**Exhibit CE-298**. The draft was prepared for signature by BHP Minerals Limited and The Government of Baluchistan, Province of Pakistan.\n\n**Exhibit CE-185**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-299**.\n\n252.\n\nThe draft joint venture agreement was reviewed by the law firm of Chima & Ibrahim, in July 1991, and their comments were communicated to the Chief Secretary of Balochistan.65 The law firm noted that the draft stipulated that \"*in the event of any inconsistency between the Agreement and any laws of Baluchistan, the terms of the Agreement shall prevail*.\"66 The law firm questioned whether the GOB, acting within the authority conferred on it by law, could enter into such an agreement.67 The firm further noted that \"*if GOB were to opt out, for any reason, during or after the exploration and feasibility stage, BHPM would still remain entitled to go through the various stages, including development, envisaged by the Agreement, and there would remain an implied undertaking on the part of GOB to render necessary approvals in this regard*.\"68 The law firm commented: \"*Indeed it is only reasonable that this should be so*.\"69\n\n**Exhibits CE-302** and **CE-304**, **CE-303**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-302**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-302**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-302**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-302**.\n\n253.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence, dated 29 September 1991, from Chima & Ibrahim to the BDA that neither the Government of Balochistan nor the BDA wanted to participate in the joint venture proposed by BHP. The letter stated that the Government and the BDA \"*would be content to receiv* [e] *royalties for discovered minerals; thereby obviating the need for contribution of funds to the project*.\"70 For this reason, the law firm enclosed a draft prospecting license but offered that if it was still desired that the GOB and/or BDA enter into a joint venture with BHP, they would provide a draft joint venture agreement as well or amend the draft provided by BHP.71\n\n**Exhibit CE-304**,p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-304**,p. 1.\n\n254.\n\nIn response to the BDA's comments of 16 October 1991 on the draft joint venture agreement, BHP explained that \"[i]*t was our original intention that the Agreement be entered into with the Government of Baluchistan. The purpose of such an arrangement was to ensure that the effect of those provisions of the Mining Concession Rules which cause BHP difficulty could be overridden. When we meet, perhaps we can discuss means by which those concerns which we have in relation to certain aspects of the Mining Concession Rules might be addressed.\"72* BHP's concerns were discussed in meetings with the BDA, and on 4 December 1991, BHP's attorney communicated with Chima and Ibrahim regarding the open issues and stated that it would re-draft the agreement once BDA's position on these issues had been confirmed. The main outstanding issues were the mining concession rules, taxation, area of interest, exploration programme, operating committee, royalty and arbitration. With respect to the mining concession rules, BHP commented that it *\"would expect that the Agreement will specifically address those rules which are problematic and be the subject of a Notified Order so as to overcome the Rules*.\"73\n\n**Exhibit RE-34**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-35**.\n\n255.\n\nOn 28 April 1992, the National Centre for Technology Transfer, Ministry of Science & Technology advised the Chairman of the BDA that approval of the Federal Government was not necessary and \"*it is the Government of Baluchistan and BDA to make decision at their own accord as far as* [the joint venture agreement] *is concerned*.\"74\n\n**Exhibit CE-305**.\n\n256.\n\nThe second draft was circulated on 3 August 1992.75 This draft had been amended to provide that the parties would be BHP Minerals Asia Pacific Limited and the Baluchistan Development Authority.\n\n**Exhibit CE-415**.\n\n257.\n\nIn the Summary for the Chief Minister, dated 11 November 1992, regarding the proposed joint venture agreement, the Additional Chief Secretary noted that:\n\n*\"5. In consonance with the Government's clear policy of a 'roll-back' of the Public Sector, we would have ordinarily opposed a Joint Venture involving BDA/Government of Balochistan. We of course wish to encourage foreign investment, particularly in the Mining Sector, but ideally Foreign Investors should come in on their own without expecting any equity participation from Government of Balochistan.*\n\n*6. In this particular case, however, BDA's negotiations with BHP have reached an advanced stage and BDA has already expended some money on technical advice etc. Withdrawal of BDA at this stage may convey the wrong signal to BHP.*\n\n*7. We may, therefore, allow BDA to continue their negotiations with BHP for a joint venture, subject to the following:-*\n\n*i) Agreement should be got vetted by the P\u2145, Finance Department, Law Department and ofcourse [sic] the administrative department i.e. Industries Department.*\n\n*ii) Agreement should provide for transfer of BDA share-holding to the domestic private sector/another department or agency of the Government of Balochistan. This is important as one day Government may decide to wind up BDA. (It also bears reiteration that dividends coming directly to the Government from this Joint Venture would help Provincial Revenue Generation; but if they go to BDA they will be used* [replacement for the word *\"asked\"* which is struck out by hand] *upto* [sic, words *\"up\"* and *\"to\"* separated by slash inserted by hand] *meet BDA's expenses.\"76*\n\n**Exhibit CE-306**.\n\n258.\n\nThe next draft was circulated on 22 March 1993, but neither Party has produced a copy of this draft.77\n\nRespondent's letter to the Tribunal dated 13 January 2015.\n\n259.\n\nIn the continuing negotiations, BHP noted in its cover letter dated 2 April 1993 to the Chairman of the BDA, enclosing draft no. 4, that BHP \"*holds to the view that for this project a Joint Venture Agreement (in conjunction with requisite Notified Orders and written assurances/rules from Government) will suffice*.\"78 BHP noted in the enclosed comments to those contained in correspondence from Chima & Ibrahim that the agreement was between the BDA and BHP only, and that the Government of Balochistan was not a party to the Agreement.79\n\n**Exhibit RE-36**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-36**, Attachment, Item 8.\n\n260.\n\nOn 13 July 1993, the final draft was submitted by Mr. Ata Mohammad Jafar, Chairman of the BDA, to the Chief Minister of Balochistan for his approval for signing.80 Mr. Jafar summarized briefly the background of the joint venture and the negotiation of the agreement, noting that the agreement was proposed to be signed by the parties on 29 July 1993. He explained that since the agreement was only conditional, the BDA would have six months' time, after signing, for obtaining consents and approvals from the Federal and Provincial Governments in respect with legal and fiscal parameters; if the conditions would not be acceptable within six months, the agreement would cease. Mr. Jafar also noted that this draft had been approved by the BDA Board of Directors in its meeting of 3 July 1993.81\n\n**Exhibits CE-186** and **RE-39**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-186**.\n\n261.\n\nThe CHEJVA had been vetted by the Law Department of Balochistan on 24 July 1993.82\n\n**Exhibit CE-309**.\n\n262.\n\nOn 27 July 1993, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan added his comment to the final draft, namely that the BDA should have moved the P&D and Finance Department in time to vet the agreement; this was not done. He noted that \"*P&D says it requires time to vet the same. However, as the agreement is to be signed on the 29th, it has been proposed to term it '* provisional *' so that amendments / modification, if any, could be made at a later stage.

The New Pakistan National Mineral Policy, 2013**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nIn February 2013, the Federal Government enacted the new National Mineral Policy (the \" **2013 NMP**\"). Its objective was to extend the drive to ensure the modernization of the mining sector regulatory instruments. This was to be done, *inter alia*, by:\n\n\" [p]*roviding for mineral titles to be granted or renewed for sufficient periods to allow for the full commercial exploration, development and exploitation of any mineral deposit by the mineral title holders;*  \n*Eliminating discretionary powers, provide time frames and ensuring simplicity of procedures and transparency of decisions; and   \nUpdating the mining laws to deal with international mining practices in Pakistan such as open pit mining and working practices.\"163*\n\n**Exhibit CE-416**, Article 7.1 (Objectives).\n\n325.\n\nArticle 7.8 of the 2013 NMP expanded on Article 8.12.1 of the 1995 NMP and provided for the mineral agreement to have priority over any inconsistent law or rules subsequently amended:\n\n*\"7.8.1 The Provincial Governments may enter into an agreement with an investor, within the framework of the law, to define the terms or to predetermine procedures with respect to certain matters relating to the carrying out of operations under license/lease, if government is satisfied that substantial foreign investment in exploration and mining operations is likely to be made and it is desirable in the interest of the development of mineral resources, to do so. The Federal Government may also become signatory to such an agreement, if so requested by a Provincial Government, after independently examining viability of the project and credit worthiness of the party. When the Federal Government is requested, the terms of such mineral agreement would be mutually agreed between the Federal Government, the respective Provincial Government and the mining company.*\n\n*7.8.2 In order to facilitate negotiations, the Federal Government will develop a model mineral agreement designed to provide additional comfort to a mining company and its lenders. The model mineral agreement will contain terms, including without limitation, with respect to the application, grant, duration, renewal, assignment and termination of mineral titles and the rights and obligations of mineral title holders that will protect the economic feasibility of the project and stabilize the legal and fiscal regimes (taxes, fees and royalties) which the mining company will be subject to over the life of the project with necessary protection to the mining company in the event of changes thereto. This will allow the mining company and its lenders to make the necessary investment decisions. The model mineral agreement shall form the basis of negotiations with a mining company for a mineral agreement and may be varied for project specific reasons on a case to case basis to deal with project specific issues. The Federal Government will stand as guarantor of the Provincial Government's obligations, if so requested by the latter.*\n\n*The existing Mineral Rules will be amended to remove any conflict/overlapping with or other effect on, and to give effect to, the rights and obligations of the mining company under the mineral agreement in line with best international practices and in the meantime, the respective Government shall pass an appropriate order through a notification under the applicable law exempting the class of minerals or the specific minerals covered by mineral agreements from the application of the relevant provisions of the Mineral Rules until the same are amended, such government will also give protection to the incentives and concessions given to mining companies under a mineral agreement through statutory amendments principally in line with those of the mineral sector.*\n\n*The mineral agreement would have an overriding effect in case anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules subsequently amended.\"164*\n\n**Exhibit CE-416**, Article 7.8.\n\n**C. Exploration Work at Reko Diq**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. BHP's Reconnaissance and Prospecting Work at Chagai**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nAfter the CHEJVA had entered into force, BHP undertook reconnaissance and exploration activities in the Chagai district in the context of the Joint Venture.\n\n327.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, based on satellite imaging and geochemical analysis, BHP identified 10 areas for further exploration, one of which included Reko Diq.165\n\n**Exhibit CE-271**, pp. 41, 42.\n\n328.\n\nOn 22 July 1996, the Joint Venture applied for 10 Prospecting Licenses, covering a total of 1,000 square kilometers, for these 10 areas.166 On 8 December 1996, the Licensing Authority granted the requested Prospecting Licenses, including PL-4 covering the Reko Diq, entitling the Joint Venture to conduct drilling and analysis work within the license areas.167\n\n**Exhibit CE-271**, p. 42.\n\n**Exhibits CE-271 and RE-2,** Rule 27(a).\n\n329.\n\nIn 1997, BHP completed its first-phase drilling at Reko Diq and at five other prospecting areas. Several early drill holes at Reko Diq indicated the presence of minerals.168\n\n**Exhibit CE-271**, p. 42.\n\n330.\n\nOn 19 November 1998, the Joint Venture sought the renewal of two Prospecting Licenses for the Reko Diq area (PL-4) and the Koh-i-Sultan area and abolished the remaining eight Prospecting Licenses.169 On 5 July 1999, the Joint Venture surrendered the Koh-i-Sultan Prospecting License.170\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 89. **Exhibit CE-271**, pp. 42-43.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 89. **Exhibit CE-271**, pp. 41, 43.\n\n331.\n\nOn 28 July 1999, the Joint Venture applied for a new, larger Prospecting License for Reko Diq covering an area of 973.75 square kilometers.171 On 21 February 2000, the Licensing Authority granted the new Prospecting License over the area requested and designated it \"*PL-14*.\" The Licensing Authority further approved the merger of the original Reko Diq Prospecting License PL-4 with the new Reko Diq Prospecting License PL-14.172\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 90.\n\n**Exhibit CE-271.**\n\n**2. TCC's Initial Exploration Work (2002-2005)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nAfter entering into the 2002 Alliance Agreement with BHP, TCC focused its exploration work in the context of the Joint Venture primarily on the copper deposit called Tanjeel, also known as H4, located approximately four kilometers east of the Western Porphyries.173 According to an Information Memorandum published by TCC in July 2005 (the \" **Information Memorandum**\"), TCC's objective was to become a major regional supplier of copper to the Asian market. Its strategy was first to develop the Tanjeel project, which contained copper, and later to develop the large Western Porphyries, which contained copper and gold.174\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 129, 37.\n\n**Exhibit CE-199**, p. 7.\n\n333.\n\nIn July 2001, TCC completed a scoping study on the Tanjeel project.175\n\n**Exhibit CE-199**, p. 10.\n\n334.\n\nOn 18 March 2002, the Government of Pakistan declared the H4 copper project an Export Processing Zone (\"**EPZ**\"), which allowed TCC to enjoy favorable tax treatment, relaxed import regulations and other benefits.176\n\nMemorial, \u00b6130. **Exhibit CE-196**.\n\n335.\n\nIn June 2003, the scoping study was updated on the basis of additional data obtained as a result of TCC's exploration work, and a valuation study in relation to the Reko Diq project was completed.177\n\n**Exhibit CE-199**, p. 11.\n\n336.\n\nIn the Information Memorandum, TCC reported that a bankable feasibility study was being prepared for the Tanjeel project, with a targeted completion date of December 2005.178\n\n**Exhibit CE-199**, p. 8.\n\n337.\n\nIn the Quarterly Report for the period ended 31 December 2005,179 TCCA reported that it continued the exploration of EL-5, including ground magnetic surveys and drilling, and progress of the Bankable Feasibility Study on Tanjeel (formerly known as H4), in particular,\n\n*\"[t]he initial results of the definitive engineering study on the Tanjeel Project have identified significant capital cost increases. These suggest that the development path for the project, on which the Feasibility Study is based, may no longer be optimal.*\n\n*TCC therefore decided to pause the definitive engineering study, while the essential parameters of the project to take account of the new cost structure were reviewed. This work should be completed by the end of January 2006, after which, and subject to its outcome, the engineering study would recommence. In the meantime, the other aspects of the Bankable Feasibility Study are continuing.\"180*\n\nEven though TCCA was not yet a party to the CHEJVA, the joint venture was controlled and funded by TCCA. *See* **Exhibit CE-204**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-204**, pp. 5, 7.\n\n338.\n\nTCCA also reported that the sample preparation and laboratory analysis of the Western Porphyries drilling program (H14 and H15) continued during the Quarter, and that a total of seven drill holes (comprising 2,016 meters RC181 and 2,174 meters diamond core) were sampled.182\n\nThe term \"*RC*\" refers to \"*reverse circulation*\" drilling.\n\n**Exhibit CE-204**, p. 8.\n\n339.\n\nFinally, TCCA reported its total expenditures (operating expenditures plus capital expenditures) incurred up to 31 December 2005 since the grant of the Exploration License EL-5, on 18 May 2002, as US$ 12,772 million, of which US$ 2,803 million had been expended during the last quarter.183\n\n**Exhibit CE-204**, p. 6.\n\n340.\n\nShortly before the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed on 1 April 2006, a meeting of the OC was held on 11 February 2006. It was attended by Mr. Arbab Muhummad Yousaf, Chairman, BDA; Mr. Muhammad Farooq, Director, BDA; Mr. Tim Hargreaves, CEO, TCCP; Mr. Chris Arndt, Operations Manager, TCCA; and Mr. Zafar Iqbal, Finance Manager TCCP.184\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**.\n\n341.\n\nAt this meeting, Mr. Hargreaves reported that, although the last meeting had been held more than a year ago, on 16 December 2004, there had been frequent contacts and dialogue within the joint venture, including key meetings on, *inter alia*, the proposed legal structure and project agreements for the H4 (now Tanjeel) project; the development concept, including necessary extension of the drilling program in light of recent expansion of the resource estimate; the draft Shareholders Agreement and principles of the 2006 Novation Agreement; and alternative commercial structures of the CHEJVA, such as a net profit interest for the BDA instead of direct equity.185\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**.\n\n342.\n\nMr. Arndt then reported on the joint venture activities of 2005, a copy of which was appended to the minutes of the meeting.186 In response to the request from the Chairman of BDA that for future meetings the reports be circulated in advance, Mr. Arndt agreed and added that \"*the information contained was a summary of that contained in the quarterly reports which had already been submitted*.\"187\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 2.\n\n343.\n\nMr. Arndt pointed out that 2005 had been the most active year of TCC's operations and had included an unprecedented exploration drilling program of over 23,000 meters and very extensive feasibility studies, demonstrating the potential of Reko Diq caldera with a global resource of over 2 billion tons.188\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 3.\n\n344.\n\nMr. Iqbal also pointed out that over 50% of the total investment during the past five years had been made during the year, reflected in the total expenditure for the year 2005 of US$ 8.04 million.189\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**.\n\n345.\n\nAt the same meeting, TCCA reported on the status of the feasibility study on the Tanjeel project. In response to a question from the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Hargreaves noted that at the previous OC meeting, it had been estimated that the feasibility study would be completed by July 2005. However, as discussed at the 25 July 2005 meeting, by mid-2005, it became clear that that schedule would not be met. He explained that the delay was due to a number of reasons, including growth of the overall resource, requiring additional drilling time; shortages of specialist engineering resources to complete the engineering study; global increases in the costs of materials, equipment, labor and specialist services, meaning that the overall project costs increased by more than 50% from pre-feasibility estimates and required re-working of parts of the study; and recognition of the need to broaden the original scope of the feasibility study to that of a bankable feasibility study which required commencement and advancement of negotiations with lenders for project financing, finalizing the structure for the mining venture (being an incorporated joint venture) and negotiation of agreements, including a Mineral Agreement, with the GOB and the Government of Pakistan (the \" **GOP**\") to provide fiscal stability satisfactory to lenders.190\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**.\n\n346.\n\nFurther, Mr. Hargreaves noted that the cost estimates derived in the Engineering Design and Cost Study were significantly higher than those anticipated in the earlier scoping studies. He concluded:\n\n*\"When these costs are considered in the context of the long term copper price forecast in the Marketing Study the project, in its current scope and form, is considered to be marginal. It is therefore appropriate to seek alternative solutions involving the identification of a project with more attractive economics.\"191*\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 4.\n\n347.\n\nMr. Hargreaves outlined potential alternative solutions, one of which was \"*consideration of undertaking the development of the Reko Diq project as a whole, following further exploration activity on Western Porphyries and completion of an appropriate bankable feasibility study*.\"192 These options were to be considered after completion of the Antofagasta transaction.193\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 5.\n\n348.\n\nAt this meeting, it was resolved that \"*the term for completion of the feasibility study be extended at least until the next Operating Committee to allow for a joint review of the results and costs to date*\" and that \"*the scope of the feasibility study includes finance and legal structures, including completion of the Shareholders Agreement and Mineral Agreement and that these aspects of the study are delayed pending the outcome of the Antofagasta transaction*.\"194\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 8.\n\n349.\n\nAs noted at paragraph 217 above, shortly before it was acquired by Atacama, TCCA entered into the 2006 Novation Agreement with the Governor of Balochistan and BHP on 1 April 2006.\n\n**3. TCC's Expanded Exploration Work (2006-2009)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Scoping Work and Study**\n---------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nIn May 2006, TCCA expanded the scope of its exploration program from Tanjeel to other ore deposits within Reko Diq, in particular the H13, H14 and H15 orebodies at the Western Porphyries. TCC also performed additional drilling at Tanjeel to explore the hypogene copper orebody below the supergene copper body on which TCC's exploration work had focused so far.\n\n351.\n\nIn the Quarterly Report for the period ended 30 June 2006, TCCA reported:\n\n*\"Work on the engineering aspects of the Tanjeel Bankable Feasibility Study has been suspended, pending the completion of the drill out of the Western Porphyries and further deeper drilling to test the hypogene resource beneath the chalcocite blanket, which has yet to be delineated.\"195*\n\n**Exhibit CE-56**, p. 8.\n\n352.\n\nTCCA listed the major milestones required to complete the Bankable Feasibility Study as including a Shareholders Agreement with the BDA, a Mineral Agreement with the GOB and GOP, obtaining required permits from the GOB and financing.\n\n353.\n\nAs for drilling, TCCA reported that the major drill out of the Western Porphyries (H-15) was in progress. During the second quarter 2006, a total of 5,075.8 meters drilled in 15 drill holes (comprising 1,419 meters of RC and 3,656.8 meters of diamond core drilling) was completed.196\n\n**Exhibit CE-56**, p. 10.\n\n354.\n\nTotal expenditures (operating expenditures and capital expenditures) by TCCA since the grant of the Exploration License EL-5 amounted to US$ 16.76 million, of which US$ 1,663 million had been expended during the quarter.197\n\n**Exhibit CE-56**, p. 4.\n\n355.\n\nAn OC meeting was held on 15 July 2006. It was attended by Mr. Muhammad Farooq, Chairman, BDA; Mr. Azim Nousherwani, General Manager Planning, BDA; Mr. Eduardo Flores, CEO, TCCA; Mr. Tim Hargreaves, CEO, TCCP; Mr. Chris Arndt, Operations Manager, TCCA; and Mr. Zafar Iqbal, Finance Manager, TCCP.198\n\n**Exhibit CE-57**.\n\n356.\n\nMr. Arndt presented a summary of joint venture activities during the first half of 2006, a copy of which was appended to the minutes of the meeting.199 He reported that a major drilling program had commenced during the past six months and that it was planned to drill approximately 70,000 meters in the Western Porphyries on H-13, H-14 and H-15 and, in addition, to drill approximately 20,000 meters for H-4, H-35, H-36, H-8, Bukit Bashir and possibly H-79. He reported, further, that in addition to the drillout of H-13, H-14 and H-15, other work on the pre-feasibility study on the Western Porphyries had commenced, or would commence shortly, including geotechnical studies, metallurgical studs, hydrological studies and infrastructures studies.200 Finally, Mr. Arndt reported on the status of the Bankable Feasibility Study on the Tanjeel orebody and stated that work had been suspended, pending the completion of the drill out of the Western Porphyries.201\n\n**Exhibit CE-57**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-58**, p. 11.\n\n**Exhibit CE-58**, p. 11.\n\n357.\n\nMr. Arndt reported that as a result of the drilling carried out at Reko Diq over the past year, the global resource for Reko Diq had been calculated as follows:202\n\nCURRENT MINERAL RESOURCES AT REKO DIQ\\*\n\n**Indicated Mineral Resources** (using a 0.3% copper or 0.3% copper-equivalent cut-off grade)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tanjeel Project | 152 million tonnes @ 0.7% copper |\n| Western Porphyries (H14/15) | 943 million tonnes @ 0.54% copper and 0.28g/t gold |\n| H8 Complex | 177 million tonnes @ 0.4% copper and 0.2g/t gold |\n| Total Indicated Mineral Resource | 1.27 billion tonnes @ 0.54% copper and 0.24g/t gold |\n\n**Inferred Mineral Resources** (using a 0.3% copper or 0.3% copper-equivalent cut-off)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tanjeel Project Tanjeel Hypogene Western Porphyries (H14/15) H13 Complex H8 Complex H35 Complex | 15 million tonnes @ 0.5% copper (0.3% copper cut-off) 47 million tonnes @ 0.4% copper (0.3% copper cut-off) 666 million tonnes @ 0.54% copper and 0.31g/t gold 213 million tonnes @ 0.4% copper and 0.4g/t gold 159 million tonnes @ 0.4% copper and 0.2g/t gold 45 million tonnes @ 0.3% copper and 0.6g/t gold |\n| Total Inferred Mineral Resource | 1.14 billion tonnes @ 0.48% copper and 0.31g/t gold |\n| **Total Indicated and Inferred:** | **2.42 billion tonnes @ 0.51% copper and 0.27g/t gold** |\n\nCURRENT ORE RESERVES AT REKO DIQ\\*\n\nThe Ore Reserve for the Tanjeel Project is a sub-set of the Mineral Resource for the Project:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Probable Ore Reserve (Tanjeel Project) | 128.8 million tonnes @ 0.7% copper (0.26% cyanide soluble Conner cut-off) |\n\n**Exhibit CE-58**, p. 12.\n\n358.\n\nAt this meeting, Mr. Flores also gave a review of the pre-feasibility study. He stated that:\n\n\"t*he company wished to evaluate the potential of the Reko Diq caldera as a whole rather than focus on individual ore bodies. In this context, the Western Porphyries appeared likely to be the largest ore body but the other ore bodies also needed additional drilling to confirm resources including the Tanjeel ore body in which the supergene deposit had been extensively drilled but the underlying hypogene ore body still required further appraisal. He stated that the proposed 18 month program included 94,000 meters of additional drilling of which 70,000 would focus on the Western Porphyries.\"203*\n\n**Exhibit CE-57**.\n\n359.\n\nAt this OC meeting, the Joint Venture partners resolved that \"*the pre-feasibility studies as outlined in the work program should commence immediately and that this program should include both the drill out of the Western Porphyries as well as drilling to upgrade the resources of the other significant ore bodies including the hypogene copper ore body below the Tanjeel supergene deposit.\"*204\n\n**Exhibit CE-57**.\n\n360.\n\nOn 18 July 2006, the Licensing Authority advised TCCA to apply for a mining lease of H-4 (Tanjeel), stating:\n\n*\"TCC in its progress reports and presentations had been informing of preparing feasibility studies to launch H-4 (Tanjeel) project on completion of ore reserves estimates. TCC has also reported to have further proven the reserves at H-4 thus increasing the ore reserves estimates. Consequent upon proving the reserves, no further exploration at H-4 is warranted and the deposit is deemed to the ready for commercial exploitation.*\n\n*In pursuance to the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules no Exploration Licence could be granted / renewed for more than 10 years. Whereas, at H-4 exploration is underway since 1993. You are, therefore, advised to apply for mining lease of H-4 deposits so that mining operation could be launched, as the GOB as well as Government of Pakistan is taking keen interest in this project.\"205*\n\n**Exhibit RE-66**.\n\n361.\n\nOn 12 September 2006, the Licensing Authority sent a reminder letter to TCCA, stating that \"[a]*fter lapse of 5-years, we believe TCC must have finalized the feasibility study on H4 prospect, incurring reported expenditure of US$ over 10 million*\" and requesting TCC to provide a copy of the feasibility study of the H-4 project, in accordance with the Balochistan Mineral Concession Rules, \"*on priority*.\"206\n\n**Exhibit RE-67**.\n\n362.\n\nOn 28 September 2006, TCCA responded to the Licensing Authority's request as follows:\n\n\" [P]*lease note that TCC-BDA had earlier this year decided to re-scope the feasibility study in order to include therein Western Porphyries and other parts of the Reko Diq area and are currently undertaking pre-feasibility work in respect of the Reko Diq area. As and when the Feasibility Study is completed we will attach it with our application for a mining lease for the area proposed to be mined.*\n\n*Please note, however, that all preliminary engineering reports have been provided to the Government of Balochistan and reports comprising more than 3,000 pages were also delivered to BDA in early 2006.

Mr. Livesey stated that \"*since the Tanjeel Feasibility Study was commenced in 2005 and its suspension in early 2006, there had been major changes to the project including the resource upgrade of the Western Porphyries as well as the increase in worldwide mining costs which had increased the Tanjeel project costs and made the economics less attractive*. *It was necessary to study a range of development options in light of the new information*.\"214 He explained that:\n\n*\"a new scoping study of the global resource at Reko Diq was required which would consider the early 2006 global resource upgrade to 2.4 billion tonnes and review a suite of options for development of a large scale mine but would also include the concept of a smaller start up project.\"215*\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**, p. 3.\n\n369.\n\nMr. Livesey stated that the object was to complete the study before the end of 2007.216\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**.\n\n370.\n\nMr. Livesey commented on what he called the \"*GOB's* [expression of] *concern at the lack of submission of reports for the previous Tanjeel Feasibility Study*.\"217 He stated that the engineering reports, all of which were in draft form at the point of suspension, had been delivered to the BDA in early 2006. He added that it could be misleading to submit these draft reports to the GOB since they would effectively become public documents containing outdated information, particularly on costs, and, given that they contained over 3,000 pages of information, there was a risk of extracts of information causing further confusion. He stated that \"*this created a difficult situation for GOB, particularly in light of the Constitutional Petition in which it was alleged that very little work had actually been undertaken*.\"218 It was resolved that the draft reports would remain in the custody of the BDA and not be formally released but that the GOB specialists would be welcome to review the reports in the GOB's office if required to verify the extent of work that had been done.219\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**, p. 4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**, p. 4.

They highlighted that work had been continued to determine the extent of reserves with the Western Porphyries as the \"*main prize*\" and, possibly, to develop other ore bodies on a smaller scale as a starter project. Following detailed mapping, the focus of the geological team had shifted primarily to the drill out of the resource at the Western Porphyries. In addition, the scoping study for the pre-feasibility and feasibility study had been carried out.233\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 166. **Exhibit CE-64**, pp. 2-3.\n\n379.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the meeting, the parties agreed that there was significant evidence that ore discovered in EL-5 could lead to a larger mining project than the one that was originally envisaged; however, the joint venture faced a number of technical and other challenges which would affect its ability to complete a full feasibility study during the first renewal period. These challenges included, *inter alia* :\n\n*\"- After new work and additional analysis the Tanjeel project found not to be economic on its own.*\n\n*- Only additional work outside the Tanjeel area by the JV developed a play for a larger scale project based on the newly discovered WP deposits, which discoveries also transformed the Tanjeel ore deposits to a potential economic and value adding activity.*\n\n*- Progress on some pre-feasibility work was made during the first renewal period but scoping study level analysis on WP could only be completed in the Q3 of 2007 thus positioning the JV to immediately proceed to the next step \u2013 commencement and completion of a full feasibility study.*\n\n*- Insufficient time available during the first renewal period for completion of elements of a feasibility study of this type \u2013 such as environmental impact assessments, sustainability of water resources, availability of power, transport and logistics.*\n\n*- Challenge to the JV's right to EL-5 which was subject to proceedings in the Balochistan High Court and which is now pending appeal in the Supreme Court.*\n\n*- Inability to make progress on the Mineral Agreement over the past four months.*\n\n*- Delay in obtaining Government approvals for TCC to open its branch office in Pakistan.\"234*\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3.\n\n380.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the meeting, \"[i]*n view of the potential for developing the project, TCC and BDA agreed that the JV through TCC as Manager should move immediately to commence and complete feasibility study. In this connection TCC presented a work plan and preliminary budget for full feasibility study on option 72 ktpd and parallel pre-feasibility study on expansion options. The parties agreed the conceptual preliminary budget of US$ 106.5 million TCC was authorized to make carry out the feasibility*.\"235\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 167; **Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3.\n\n381.\n\nAt the meeting, TCC pointed out that Exploration License EL-5 was to expire in February 2008 and that an application for renewal of the license had to be filed with the Government of Balochistan by 22 November 2007. TCC stated, *inter alia*, that \"*given the wide area over which discoveries had been made and the time that would be needed to carry out the feasibility study to tie all the deposits together, the ongoing challenges to EL 5 in the Courts of Pakistan and the expected additional delays in finalization of the Mineral Agreement*,\" it recommended that the request for renewal be over 90% of the existing EL-5 area and that the term of renewal be three years. According to the minutes, BDA endorsed the recommendation and TCC was given \"*full authority*\" to apply for such renewal. In addition, \"*BDA committed its full support to the JV's case before the Government of Balochistan*.\"236\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 4.\n\n382.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, TCCA, on behalf of the joint venture, applied to the Director General, Mines & Minerals, GOB for a renewal of Exploration License EL-5 for revised/ reduced plans of 435.02 square kilometers (107516.65 acres) for a further period of three years (20 February 2008 to 19 February 2011).237\n\n**Exhibit RE-15**.\n\n383.\n\nRule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules required that an application for the renewal of a license shall not be made:\n\n*\"in the case of a second renewal, unless the applicant can satisfy the authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits and that the proposed activities could not have been reasonably completed during the period of the first renewal.\"238*\n\n**Exhibit CE-05**.\n\n384.\n\nIn its application of 2 November 2007, TCCA enclosed a justification for its application, summarizing its activities carried out during the first renewal period and explaining a number of technical and other challenges which affected its ability to complete a full feasibility study during the first renewal period. TCCA explained its request for the extension as follows:\n\n*\"The Applicant at a Joint Operating Committee meeting held on October 26, 2007 approved the immediate commencement of the Feasibility Study and continued field work in the area and proposed a budget of over US$ 100 million in this regard.*  \n*With EL-5 to expire in February, 2008 the Applicant will be able to commence activities for drawing up the Feasibility Study in the first renewal period but will not be able to complete the same given the time that will be needed to carry out the Feasibility Study to tie the development of all the deposits, which are spread over a large area of EL-5 (some of which are still being reviewed through further drilling work) together into one mining project. Additional work is also need*[ed] *to better understand the deep structure as possible interconnection of deposits significantly increases the resource size. This taken together with the ongoing challenges to EL 5 in the courts of Pakistan and the expected additional delays in the finalization of the Mineral Agreement, the Applicant considers that it requires a renewal for the full three year period over 90% of the existing EL-5 area to be in a position to fully develop the discoveries.*\n\n*The Balochistan Development Authority is fully aware of the grounds and reasons on which the renewal is being sought and fully endorses the request.\"239*\n\n**Exhibit RE-15**, Exhibit 1, p.

The Provincial Government assured the High Court that Balochistan had not \"*committed any illegality or done anything in bad faith*\" and that Balochistan \"*acted in the best interest of the people of Balochistan and any suggestion to the contrary is false*.\"269 Pakistan likewise submitted that the petitioners' claims were \"*not maintainable*\" and should be \"*dismissed in the interest of justice*.\"270\n\n**Exhibit CE-208**, pp. 8, 13.\n\n**Exhibit CE-210**. pp. 2. 153.\n\n396.\n\nOn 26 June 2007, the Balochistan High Court issued a judgment upholding the validity of the CHEJVA and dismissing the petitioners' claims in their entirety.271 Specifically, the High Court rejected the petitioners' arguments, holding that:\n\n(i) (i) \" [the] *CHEJVA was rightly executed, as Article 173 of the Constitution empowers the Provincial Government to enter into such agreement and BDA has entered into the agreement as an Agent of the Government of Balochistan;\"272*\n\n(ii) in the Relaxations to the 1970 BM Rules granted by Balochistan, \"*the Government has exercised its powers strictly in accordance with the forecorner* [four corners] *of the Rules;\"273*\n\n(iii) *\"there is nothing on record to prove* [that the 2002 BM Rules were framed under the influence of TCC]; \" and the 2002 BM Rules *\"were framed, after promulgation of Mineral Policy of 1995, wherein the Mining Rules of all the Provinces were re-framed;\"274* and\n\n(iv) considering BHP's exploration operation by which Reko Diq was identified to have copper-gold deposits and license PL-4 covering this area was retained and TCC's huge investment and extensive drilling, *\"the question that no work was done is baseless.\"275*\n\n*See* **Exhibit CE-61**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-61**, p. 28.\n\n**Exhibit CE-61,** p. 29.\n\n**Exhibit CE-61,** p. 29.\n\n**Exhibit CE-61,** p. 32.\n\n397.\n\nFurther, with respect to the work carried out by BHP and TCC, the High Court observed that:\n\n\" [i]*t was due to the efforts of* [BHP] *that minerals were discovered, whereas the same would remain hidden for unknown time and the people of Balochistan would not be deriving any benefits.*\n\n\u2026\n\n[I]*t is but natural that* [TCC] *would be keen in doing the mining at the earliest. Since exploration is a time-consuming work, which involves drilling, collection of samples and tests,... thus it can be safely concluded that, lot has been done and efforts have been made to start the mining, which... is a slow and time consuming process*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Suffice it to say that mining areas are not put to auction.

The representative of the GOB, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Raisani, Secretary, MMDD, informed that the application of TCC for mining lease could not have been processed earlier because the apex court had issued a restraining order on 3 February 2011 which had been recalled on 25 May 2011. He declared that \"*the GOB will decide on the application of TCC for mining lease to the true spirit of BMR, 2002 and the direction of the honorable Supreme Court*.\"316\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**.\n\n423.\n\nAt this review meeting, on a query from the Chair regarding value addition up to final refining, TCC's CEO Mr. Livesey responded that TCC had ore processing capacity up to concentrate stage and processing beyond that stage was not financially viable to it. TCC mentioned that it would \"*provide financial assistance of US$ 1,000 million to carry out technical feasibility study on smelting and refining*.\"317\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**.\n\n424.\n\nWhen the Director General pointed out that Jinchuan Group China had offered to set up a full facility for processing of concentrate up to final refining of gold and copper based on the concentrate produced by TCC at Reko Diq, Mr. Livesey stated that \"*the company will have no objection to this proposal.

The paper explained, among other things, that smelting was a low-margin business that typically depended on massive volume from multiple sources.319 The paper concluded that:\n\n\"*Building a smelter and refinery as part of the Reko Diq Project (1) is not economically justified; (2) the additional capital costs would make the Reko Diq project unprofitable and therefore unviable; and (3) is not necessary in order to ensure that TCC and the GOB are properly paid for the metal content of the concentrate that is produced* [by TCC's planned mining operation].\n\n\u2026\n\n*We have discussed with the GOB and the GOP the concept of either the provincial or federal government constructing and operating a smelter and refinery of its own to process concentrate from Reko Diq.... if such a facility were built, TCC/GOB could sell a portion of its concentrate to an in-country smelter at best international, commercially negotiated prices*.\"320\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 202. **Exhibit CE-237**, pp. 3, 17; *see also* **Exhibit CE-83**, pp. 21\u201325, 37\u201344.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 202. **Exhibit CE-237**, p. 3.\n\n426.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, at a meeting of the Federal Board of Investment, the Director General (Minerals) of the Federal MPNR indicated that Pakistan and Balochistan were willing to negotiate the outstanding issues of the Mineral Agreement, including tax exemptions and incentives and \"[v]*alue addition up to final refinery stage*.\"321 TCCA reiterated its commitment to the Reko Diq project, but emphasized that a smelter/refinery at Reko Diq was not \"*financially viable*.\"322 TCC suggested that the \"*Government of Pakistan may buy the concentrate* [from the Joint Venture's mining operation] *and build their own smelter*.\"323\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203. **Exhibit CE-78**, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203. **Exhibit CE-78**, \u00b6 6.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203. **Exhibit CE-78**, \u00b6 6; *see also* **Exhibit CE-288** (ICC Tr.) 14:2\u201315:5, 16:12\u201317:19, 25:8\u201327:2; 41:11\u201323 (Livesey).\n\n427.\n\nOn 2 December 2009, TCCA wrote to the Balochistan Chief Secretary, Mr. Nasir Khosa, expressing concern that \"*it has been a number of months since TCCP received any formal communication from the GOB,*\" in particular regarding the smelter paper submitted to the GOB in August, and urged the Governments to resume the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement in preparation for project financing and implementation.324 Although the issue of agreeing the Mineral Agreement was subsequently discussed during meetings with various officials of the Pakistan and Balochistan Governments, negotiations were not resumed; the Mineral Agreement was never finalized.325\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203. **Exhibit CE-241**.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 204. **Exhibits CE-84 and CE-90** (Chief Secretary Lehri); **CE-85** (MPNR Secretary Lashari); **RE-143** (Prime Minister Gilani); and **RE-80** (MPNR Additional Secretary Chaudhry).\n\n**F. Starting in 2007, Claimant Attempted to Negotiate a Mining Venture Agreement**326 **with the Government of Balochistan in respect of Exploration License EL-5**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Mining Venture Agreement is sometimes also referred to as the \"*Shareholder Agreement*\" or the \"*Project Agreement*.\"\n\n428.\n\nUnder Clause 11.7 of the CHEJVA, the Participating Parties were obligated to segregate from the Exploration Area the Mining Area established by the Feasibility Study and establish a joint venture (Mining Venture) with respect to such area. Under Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA, the Joint Venture or a Participating Party was entitled to convert the Prospecting License into a Mining Lease, but under rule 47(1) of the BM Rules, an application for a mining lease could only be granted to a body corporate formed under the Companies Ordinance 1984 and other provisions of the laws of Pakistan. For these reasons, TCCA proposed using its wholly-owned subsidiary TCCP, which had been established in Pakistan, as the vehicle for the Mining Venture.\n\n429.\n\nAlthough TCCA had not yet delivered its Initial Mine Feasibility Study \u2013 and thus the GOB had not yet been required to elect whether to become a Participating Party, TCCA proposed to establish the new joint venture for Exploration License EL-5 by having the parties transfer their interests in Exploration License EL-5 to TCCP in exchange for shares of the corporation and enter into a project agreement to regulate their relationship as shareholders in TCCP during the Mining Venture, replacing the CHEJVA in this respect, in accordance with Article 12.7 of the CHEJVA.\n\n430.\n\nThus, for its part, TCCA would merge its branch office which held its 75% interest in Exploration License EL-5 and other assets and rights related to the exploration work undertaken pursuant to EL-5 to its subsidiary TCCP. On 16 January 2008, the TCCA Pakistan branch office and TCCP petitioned the Lahore High Court to sanction a Scheme of Arrangement for Amalgamation (\"**Amalgamation**\") by which the TCCA Pakistan branch office's entire business, together with all the property, assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of every description (including but not limited to the licenses) would be amalgamated with and transferred to TCCP.327\n\n**Exhibit CE-21**; **Exhibit RE-61**.\n\n431.\n\nIn connection with the Amalgamation, TCCA was required to obtain the consent of the Balochistan MMDD. The MMDD issued a \"*No Objection Certificate*\" dated 5 November 2007, subject to the following condition:\n\n*\"There is no objection to the transfer-assignment of the area covered by EL-5 by TCC to TCCP.

Reply, \u00b6 117.\n\n434.\n\nAs stated above, TCCA had proposed that the GOB transfer its 25% interest in Exploration License EL-5 to TCCP in exchange for a 25% share of TCCP and simultaneously enter into a shareholders/project agreement with TCCA. TCCA had delivered a draft shareholder/project agreement to the Secretary Law and Secretary Minerals, GOB on 17 April 2007.331 On 21 April 2008, TCC had sent the draft to Chief Secretary Nasir Mahmood Khosa, and requested his assistance in finalizing the document within a short time period.332\n\n**Exhibit CE-224**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-224.**\n\n435.\n\nOn 24 October 2008, TCCP received comments to the draft Project Agreement from the law firm of Hussain & Hussain on behalf of the GOB.333 The major issues for the GOB related to shareholder funding and equity debt: The GOB proposed that all shareholder funding would be provided by TCCA in the form of shareholder loans and that TCCA would fund the GOB's share of all costs to be incurred by TCCP until the initial commencement date (so-called equity debt amounts).334\n\n**Exhibit CE-231**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-231**. See draft Sections 5.2 and 5.4, as well as sections relating to default (Section 7.1) and remedies (Section 7.3).\n\n436.\n\nOn 23 May 2009, TCCP proposed alternative structures for the GOB's interest, whereby instead of making an equity contribution, the GOB would have a free carry, *i.e.*, it would be a shareholder of TCCP and be entitled to receive dividends in proportion to its (reduced) 6% interest and a 2% royalty, or, in the alternative, a net profit interest (NPI) in an incorporated joint venture, *i.e.*, it would not be required to make any contributions to investment; it would receive 25% of net profits after payback of investment and, prior to that date, if there were profits, it would receive advance minimum payments of PKR 800 million (then approximately US$ 10 million) per year credited against future payments or, if there were no profits, it would receive minimum guaranteed payments of PKR 400 million per year credited against future payments.335\n\n**Exhibit CE-236**.\n\n437.\n\nAs stated at paragraph 427 above, on 2 December 2009, TCCA wrote to the Balochistan Chief Secretary, Mr. Nasir Khosa, expressing concern that \"*it has been a number of months since TCCP received any formal communication from the GOB,*\" in particular regarding the proposals in June and again in August to change the 25% GOB equity to a 25% Net Profit Interest, and urged the Governments to resume the negotiations of the Project Agreement in preparation for project financing and implementation.336\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203. **Exhibit CE-241**.\n\n438.\n\nThe transaction was never consummated.337\n\nReply, \u00b6 121.\n\n**G.

According to TCC's contemporaneous notes of the meeting, the Chief Secretary assured TCC that there \"*has been some misunderstanding*.\" Mr. Lehri reportedly asserted that the first meeting of the Board of Governors - Reko Diq Refinery (\"**BOG**\") had been held to discuss the decision of the GOB to install a smelter/refinery which would be operated through its own resources and would buy concentrates ore from Tethyan and Saindak. He then exhorted TCC \"*to make efforts to satisfy the hostile cabinet and clarify their doubts on the project and the agreement*.\"358\n\n**Exhibit CE-90**.\n\n459.\n\nOn the same day, TCC also met with the Secretary of the Federal Board of Investment, who said that he had visited Balochistan a few weeks earlier and come back with the positive impression that there was general support of the project and Mr. Lehri was quite positive.359 In addition, TCC met with the Director General (Minerals) of the Federal MPNR, Mr. Irshad Khokhar, who also informed the Tethyan team of the meeting of the BOG for the Reko Diq Refinery. According to TCC's contemporaneous notes, Mr. Khokhar assured TCC that Balochistan's \"*refinery would get its concentrate / ore from Tethyan and Saindak*,\" and that TCC's application for a mining lease \"*would be approved*\" under the Balochistan Mining Rules.360\n\n**Exhibit CE-92**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-91**.\n\n460.\n\nOn 8 June 2010, the Federal MPNR denied TCC's pending applications for security clearances for its expatriate employees, which were required to obtain work visas.361 At the same time, Balochistan also began to deny TCC's requests for No-Objection Certificates (\"**NOCs**\"), which were required for expatriate workers to travel to the Reko Diq site.362\n\n**Exhibits CE-93 and CE-94**.\n\nLivesey IV, \u00b6 90.\n\n461.\n\nOn 2 July 2010, TCC met with Dr. Mubarakmand and Dr. Nadeem ul Haque, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission and a Minister of State in the Federal Government, and Dr. Pervez Butt, the member (Energy) of the Planning Commission, to explain its exploration work and plans to mine Reko Diq. According to TCC's contemporaneous notes of the meeting, the members of the Planning Commission did not disclose information about the scope of Balochistan's Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project at the meeting, but they did express reservations of the GOB toward the TCC Project. Dr. Mubarakmand commented as follows:\n\n\"*a. The Royalty of 2% which they consider very low.*\n\n*b. Why should Tethyan construct a pipeline to take the concentrate out of the country?*\n\n*c. Why should Tethyan spend so much money on the pipeline and road to Gwadar from the mine when this money should be spent to refine the copper and gold in the country?*\"\n\n462.\n\nMr. ul Haque said he understood that selling concentrate the seller gets the full price of the valuable metals contained and that smelters get only a fee. Dr. Butt asked if any representative of GOB was present when the drilling of core was in progress. At the end, \"*Dr. Nadeem asked the CEO* [of TCC] *how the P* [lanning] *C* [ommission] *could help the company in the progress of* [TCC's] *project*.\"363 TCC's CEO Mr. Von Borries responded by stating:\n\n\" - *Help in providing tech assistance to GOB to understand such a big and technical project.*\n\n- *Help to start a conversation with GOB/GOP.*\n\n*- The importance of the visit of CEO Barrick and his delegation to the Chief Minister and Prime Minister.\"364*\n\n**Exhibit CE-245**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-245**.\n\n463.\n\nOn 14 July 2010, executives from TCC and Barrick, including Barrick's CEO Mr. Aaron Regent, met with Chief Minister Raisani and Chief Secretary Lehri. According to Claimant's witness Ms. Catherine Boggs, the Chief Minister told the delegation that he wanted to develop Reko Diq exclusively with TCC, and not with any third parties; Mr. Lehri, in turn, reiterated that the Government's May 2010 press release, which described Balochistan's intention to take over the project from TCC, had been a \"*misunderstanding*\" and did not reflect the official position of the Provincial Government.365\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 237; Boggs, \u00b6\u00b6 85-87.\n\n464.\n\nOn 14 July 2010, the TCC and Barrick executives met with then Prime Minister Gilani. According to a press release issued on the same date by the Pakistan Government's Press Information Department:\n\n*\"The Prime Minister said that Pakistan really want[s] foreign investment and intends to encourage the best firms and companies which can give the best results.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The Prime Minister informed the delegation which intends to invest in exploration and development of Rekodiq Copper-Gold Mines Project in Balochistan, that the Federal Government has discussed and decided in principle to fully support the consortium and expects the project would be launched at the earliest.*\n\n*The Prime Minister directed the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources to hold further discussions with the consortium and to coordinate with the Government of Balochistan to finalize the details.\"366*\n\n**Exhibit CE-95**.\n\n465.\n\nThe same day, TCC and Barrick's delegation also met with the Federal Minister of Finance, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources, and Chairman of the Board of Investment. Following the meetings, the Pakistani newspaper the *Daily Times* reported:\n\n*\"Talking to media on the occasion Federal Minister for Finance said that such a huge investment in Pakistan's mining sector shows the interest of the world-class investors in Pakistan. He said that the government of Pakistan would provide maximum cooperation to the investors to make this project a success.*\n\n*Secretary Finance Salman Siddique expressed hope that the entry of the world's largest mining company in Pakistan's mining sector would help Pakistan attract more investment, transfer of technology and human resource development within the country. He also extended full assurance of cooperation to the investors for their success in Reko Diq Project.\"367*\n\n**Exhibit CE-246**.\n\n466.\n\nOn 15 July 2010, Pakistan's Planning Commission \u2013which was chaired by the Prime Minister \u2013 submitted Balochistan's Reko Diq Copper & Gold project for approval to the ECNEC \u2013 which was also chaired by the Prime Minister.368\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 240; Mubarakmand, \u00b6 10.\n\n467.\n\nOn 4 November 2010, the Pakistani daily newspaper *The Dawn* reported that \"[t]*he chief minister said the Rs1 billion PC-1* [for Reko Diq] *was likely to be approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council at its next meeting and after that the Balochistan government would start work on the project*.\" The Chief Minister further reportedly stated that \"*all agreements which undermined the rights and interests of the people of Balochistan would be scrapped*.\"369\n\n**Exhibit CE-260**, p. 5.\n\n468.\n\nThe same day, the Balochistan daily newspaper *Balochistan Express* reported that Chief Minister Raisani stated:\n\n*\"We, the government, are capable of exploring, exploiting and refining the mineral wealth (gold, silver and copper) to international standards. If Balochistan Government operates the Reko Dik project, it will benefit the people and it will leave a good impact on the Pakistani economy. \"370*\n\n**Exhibit CE-262,** p. 8.\n\n469.\n\nOn 9 November 2010, TCC wrote to Chief Secretary Lehri protesting these statements, pointing out that as the statements were made by the Chief Minister, they apparently represented the official position of the Government of Balochistan and could not only constitute a violation of Clause 24.6 of the CHEJVA but also harm the reputation of TCC and the Government of Balochistan. He requested that the Chief Secretary advise the company of his Government's official position.371 It appears that TCC did not receive any response.\n\n**Exhibit CE-260**, p. 1.\n\n470.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand discussed the gold and copper resources at Reko Diq in a talk show on the *Duniya* television network. He stated that Pakistan possessed the technical capability for the mining of copper and gold and it remained to be seen whether the government of Balochistan would sanction the mining contract to Pakistan or the foreign companies. In response to the interviewer's comment that the government of Balochistan should give the contract to the local companies rather than the outsiders so that the flow of the money remains in Pakistan rather than going to foreign companies, Dr. Mubarakmand said that this was \"*the reason why* [he] *had developed a technical project and presented it to the Chief Minister*\" and that \"*if the project* [was] *approved in the ACNEC meeting on December 9, 2010, the Baluchistan government* [had] *the funds for us to start work on this project*.\"372\n\n**Exhibit CE-105**.\n\n471.\n\nOn 9 December 2010, the ECNEC considered the Summary dated 15 July 2010, submitted by the Planning Commission on the Reko Diq Gold/Copper Project, approved the project at the revised cost of Rs 8812.22 million (approximately US$ 102.7 million) and \"*directed that if an agreement has not been signed with any firm for mining and refining, etc, then Govt. of Balochistan may decide as to whether the project is to be executed by them*.\"373\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 285. **Exhibit CE-106**. *See* Minutes at **Exhibits CE-352** and **RE-88.**\n\n472.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand gave a telephone interview on *Dawn* television about the project. The interviewer commented that \"*it is generally said that mining contracts are awarded to those companies who do the exploration work*\"374 and asked Dr. Mubarakmand what the best international practices were in this regard. Dr. Mubarakmand responded:\n\n*\"Under the international best practices it is not necessary that one who does exploration will also get the mining license. People initially enter into an exploration contract with the Government which owns the minerals. This contract contains terms and conditions whether or not the exploration license will convert into a mining license and upon which terms. So the exploration license which they* [Tethyan Copper Company] *obtained from the Balochistan Government must in my opinion contain such terms and conditions. The Balochistan Government and this company must be aware of such terms and conditions in accordance with which a mining license can or cannot be awarded. This condition must be there.\"375*\n\n**Exhibit CE-108**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-108**.\n\n**H.

The Application was supported by the Feasibility Study and other documents required under rule 47 of the 2002 BM Rules.426\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 307-309. **Exhibit CE-6**.\n\n507.\n\nOn 21 July 2011, the Federal Minister, MPNR, Dr. Asim Hussain, as Chairman of the Steering Committee on the Reko Diq project, held a meeting to review the status of the project and to formulate a joint strategy of the GOP and the GOB for the future course of action. The meeting was attended by representatives of the MPNR, the Secretary of the BOI, Mr. Mushtaq Raisani, Secretary, MMDD, on behalf of the GOB, representatives of TCC, including Mr. Livesey, CEO, and a Senior Trade Commissioner from the Government of Canada. Secretary Raisani informed those present that the Mining Lease Application could not be processed earlier because the Apex Court had issued a restraining order on 3 February 2011, which had been recalled on 25 May 2011. He stated that the \"*GOB will decide on the application of TCC for mining lease to the true spirit of BMR, 2002 and the direction of the honorable Supreme Court*.\"427\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**; **Exhibit RE-79**.\n\n508.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Chair regarding value addition up to final refining428 and the GOB share in the profit, Mr. Livesey responded that the GOB would get a 25% share in the profit over the life of the mine, provided that it invested as per its shareholding in accordance with the joint venture agreement. Further, TCC would assist the GOB in managing a loan from the financial institutions if the Government of Balochistan was unable to arrange funds investment as per share. In addition, TCC would evaluate alternate proposals to the current 25% equity and submit them to the GOB during the third quarter, 2011.429\n\nAs noted at paragraph 323 above, on 1 October 2010 \u2013 after TCCA delivered its Feasibility Study on 26 August 2010 and before TCCP filed the Mining Lease Application on 15 February 2011, Balochistan amended the 2002 BM Rules to require that a mining lease application include a proposal for value addition of the ore to be produced/exploited from the mining lease.\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**.\n\n509.\n\nAs for the value addition, Mr. Livesey stated that TCC had ore processing capacity up to the concentrate stage and processing beyond this stage was not financially viable to TCC; however, TCC would provide financial assistance of US$ 1 million to carry out a technical feasibility study on smelting and refining.430\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**. In fact, the minutes state that TCC would provide financial assistance to \"*US$ 1,000 million*\"; it is undisputed between the Parties, however, that the amount offered was US$ 1 million, rather than US$ 1 billion.\n\n510.\n\nMr. Khokar, Director General (Minerals), MPNR, pointed out that the Jinchuan Group China had offered the Ministry that they could set up a full facility for the processing of concentrate up to the final refining of gold and copper based on the concentrate produced by TCC at Reko Diq. Mr. Livesey responded that the company \"*will have no objection to this proposal. TCC are willing to negotiate an off take agreement for the sale of concentrate within Balochistan*.\"431\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**.\n\n511.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, it was decided that the GOB would complete its review of the Feasibility Study and decide the Mining Lease Application within a period of four months, as per directions of the Supreme Court judgment dated 25 May 2011. In addition, TCC would submit a detailed proposal regarding profit of the GOB over the life of the mine and investment facilitation options.432\n\n**Exhibit CE-118**.\n\n512.\n\nOn 12 September 2011, TCCA wrote to the Licensing Authority, offering to meet with them if they had any questions or concerns about the Mining Lease Application.433\n\n**Exhibit CE-120**.\n\n**2. Balochistan Rejected the Mining Lease Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nOn 21 September 2011, the Licensing Authority issued a notice of its intent to reject the Mining Lease Application (the \"**Notice of Intent to Reject**\") as \"*not* s *atisfactory,*\" stating that it was not in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the lease be granted on documents which were \"*incomplete*\" and \"*sketchy.*\"434 The Notice of Intent to Reject stated:\n\n\"*1. That from the record, it appears that the Balochistan Development Authority had signed a Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement with BHP, thereafter M/S Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for exploration, evaluation of Gold, Copper and Associated Minerals during the period Of license existing for exploration and prospecting of the area. The record reflects that neither any company was registered and incorporated under the Companies Act 1984 with the registrar of Firm's nor in any other law;*\n\n*2. That the company did not make proper feasibility or exploration of the discovered deposits and achieve the targets required under the rules.*\n\n*3. That the second renewal application submitted by the applicant, had given declaration that the applicant will submit the complete feasibility of the entire lease/exploration area. The applicant has utterly failed to submit the said feasibility report and meaning thereby that they have failed to conduct and complete exploration in the exploration license / granted area.*\n\n*4. That on account of non-exploration and failure to explore the area during the last 17 years, the Government of Balochistan and the local inhabitants of the area has been deprived of the fruitful results.*\n\n*5. That the present application has been filed on behalf of M/S Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd and not on behalf of co sharer, who was alleged to be co-associate in the working project under the Rule -48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule 2002. Since the applicant alone was not allottee of exploration licence and thus legally applicant is not competent to make application for grant of Mining lease.*\n\n*6. That the Mines Committee has noted the fact that the application was received on 18-02-2011 and the licence had expired on 19-02-2011 later on request was made to the Secretary, Mines & Mineral Department, Government of Balochistan on 03-03-2011 for participating in the mining lease. This fact indicates that the application was filed alone by the company and co sharer was not made party in it. In such circumstance, the application is incomplete and is in violation of rule 48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002.*\n\n*7. The relevant portion on the feasibility study report submitted by the expert committee was also examined by the Mines Committee and found following observation:*\n\n*(i) That the Company has failed to comment or dilate upon rest of discover deposits except H-14 and H-15;*\n\n*(ii) The proposed development, operation and scheme of the mines in programme of the mining operation for the 11 other potential resources is missing/omitted to be considered in feasibility report;*\n\n*(iii) That the information given by the company in all respect keeping in to consideration the Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002, the Company has further failed to identify all the resources and achievements of all the targets within stipulated time.*\n\n*(iv) Misrepresentation for obtaining exploration licenses EL-6, EL-8, EL-26 and EL-27 wherein there is no share of partner. Despite being a world class Exploration/ Mining Company so called partner has failed to submit the technical, financial, economical viability report of the entire resources of EL-5 enjoying with special relaxations in all respect allegedly granted by the Government of Balochistan for the last 17 years.*\n\n*(v) There is a default and violation committed under rule 29 (2) (c)*\n\n*(iii) of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002 as well as failure to provide the required information as contemplated under rule 47 of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002.*\n\n*8. That the submission of the application relating to H-4, H-8, H-13, H-35 and H-79 etc is in violation of rule-48 of Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002.*\n\n*9. That feasibility report is silent about the processing, smelting and refining of the metals / minerals to be extracted from the mining area.*\n\n*10. That in view of aforementioned reasons, the Committee found that the application submitted by the applicant is not satisfactory. It is also not in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the lease cannot be granted on a documents which is in complete and sketchy.*\n\n*Your reply to the aforementioned reasons / objections may be submitted within a period of 30 days.\"435*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 318. **Exhibit CE-7**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**.\n\n514.\n\nOn 30 September 2011, TCCP requested the Licensing Authority to grant it an extension of sixty days in addition to the thirty days to submit its representations and/ or proposals, in consonance with the requirement of \"*reasonable period*\" for response as laid down in rules 48(4) anf 48(5) of the 2002 BM Rules.436\n\n**Exhibit CE-27**.\n\n515.\n\nOn 7 October 2011, the Licensing Authority informed TCCP that the Mines Committee had turned down its request for extension and that its response was due by 20 October 2011.437\n\n**Exhibit CE-28**.\n\n516.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, TCCP informed the Licensing Authority that it considered its letter to be unreasonable, given that an extension would cause it no prejudice; the matters potentially in dispute were complex, of great value and highly important to the region; and an extension of time might help the parties to better understand each other's positions. TCCP suggested a meeting to discuss the issues and requested the Licensing Authority to suggest suitable potential dates.438\n\n**Exhibit CE-29**.\n\n517.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, TCCP filed a formal appeal against the denial of its request for an extension of time before the Secretary, MMDD.439\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 323.

The report was based on comments Balochistan Mines Secretary Mr. Mushtaq Raisani had made to a UK-based TV channel. He reportedly said that TCC had submitted the feasibility report of a limited area and did not include the whole area in its report and thus:\n\n\" [u]*nder the law, the provincial government can cancel the contract of a company that does not meet the criterion.\"444*\n\n**Exhibit CE-34**.\n\n523.\n\nSecretary Raisani reportedly added that the government had now decided to take forward this project utilizing its own resources.\"445\n\n**Exhibit CE-34**.\n\n524.\n\nOne week later, on 30 November 2011, Secretary Raisani issued an official denial, published in the *Intekhab-Urdu*, of this news item.446\n\n**Exhibit CE-123**.\n\n**3.

They rely on a finding that the conclusion of the CHEJVA by the BDA in 1993 was *ultra vires* and thus void and *non est*; it fell outside the powers granted to State authorities under, *inter alia*, the 1948 State Act and the 1970 BMC Rules which were promulgated pursuant to that statute. In addition, the Supreme Court held that the CHEJVA was invalid because it was opposed to public policy in terms of Section 23 of the Pakistani Contract Act, 1872. Similarly, the \"*relaxations*\" of the 1970 BMC Rules were not made in accordance with Pakistani law, which requires that such relaxations be granted only once \"*hardship*\" is established \u2013 which it had not been in the present circumstances. The Court found that, as a matter of Pakistani law, the CHEJVA did not confer any rights on BHP, Mincor, Claimant, TCCP, Antofagasta or Barrick. Further, each element of the contractual regime premised on the CHEJVA, including the 2000 Addendum, the 2000 Option Agreement, the 2000 Alliance Agreement and the 2006 Novation Agreement, was also void.484\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 119. **Exhibit RE-18**.\n\n**V.

CLAIMANT'S CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT ON CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nAs stated at paragraph 5 above, Claimant claims that Pakistan violated the Australia-Pakistan Treaty by its denial of a mining lease to TCCP, TCCA's wholly-owned Pakistan subsidiary, and other actions attributable to Pakistan that deprived TCCA of the value of its investments. Such alleged actions include, in particular, developing and executing a scheme to take over TCCA's Reko Diq project, denying the Mining Lease Application in pursuit of that scheme and using TCCA's exploration and feasibility work product in its own project, which allegedly amounted to a breach of the fair and equal treatment obligation under Article 3(2), an expropriation of TCCA's investment without compensation in violation of Article 7(1) and an impairment of TCCA's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n**2. Claimant's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant requests an award:493\n\n(i) dismissing all of Pakistan's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility;\n\n(ii) declaring that through the measures taken against TCCA's investments, including arbitrarily and unlawfully denying the Mining Lease Application, and developing and executing a plan to take over the Reko Diq project, Pakistan has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty;\n\n(iii) dismissing all of Pakistan's counterclaims;\n\n(iv) awarding TCCA full compensation for all damages and losses resulting from Pakistan's breaches of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, including future lost profits, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding;\n\n(v) awarding TCCA interest on all sums awarded, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding;\n\n(vi) awarding TCCA its costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys' fees, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding by such means as the Tribunal may direct; and\n\n(vii) ordering such other and further relief as may be just and appropriate in the circumstances\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 220, amending Memorial, \u00b6 559, Reply, \u00b6 505 and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Counterclaims, \u00b6 72.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT ON CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS AND RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIMS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent's Contentions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nApart from raising various jurisdictional and admissibility objections, Respondent submits that there were legitimate reasons for the Licensing Authority to reject the Mining Lease Application. In addition, Respondent claims that neither Pakistan nor Balochistan had a plan to \"*oust TCCA*\" from Reko Diq in order to implement Balochistan's project. Further, Respondent claims that TCCA did not have property rights under Pakistani law. The Supreme Court held that the CHEJVA was illegal, void and *non est*, and furthermore, that even if it were valid, neither the CHEJVA nor the 2002 BM Rules conferred a guaranteed \"*right to mine*\" Reko Diq on Claimant. Finally, Respondent claims that the information and data arising from the exploration of the area covered by Exploration License EL-5 is Joint Venture Property which is not subject to an exclusivity requirement. Respondent denies that it has taken any actions which constitute a breach of Article 3(2), Article 7(1) and or Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n559.\n\nIf and to the extent that the Tribunal finds that Claimant had a qualifying investment and upholds the relevant premises of jurisdiction for purposes of the Treaty, Respondent asserts the following counterclaims: (i) Claimant's alleged \"*investment*\" was not made \"*in accordance with* [Pakistan's] *laws and investment policies*\" as set out in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty; (ii) Claimant breached Clauses 11, 15 and 24.6 of the CHEJVA because it did not even attempt to comply with the contractual pre-conditions set out in the CHEJVA before filing its Mining Lease Application, and because it prepared a \"*secret*\" Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study; and (iii) Claimant violated rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules because it failed to complete \"*a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits*\" in the area covered by Exploration License EL-5, despite the fact that it had undertaken to do so in its application for a second renewal of EL-5.\n\n**2. Respondent's Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nIn its Post Hearing Brief,494 Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) decline jurisdiction or declare Claimant's claims inadmissible;\n\n(ii) alternatively, stay these proceedings pending resolution of the ICC arbitration;\n\n(iii) alternatively, to the extent that the Tribunal proceeds to examine the merits of the case, declare that Respondent has not breached the BIT and dismiss Claimant's claims in their entirety;\n\n(iv) alternatively, to the extent that the Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the BIT, dismiss Claimant's claims for failure to establish causation;\n\n(v) alternatively, uphold Respondent's counterclaims and award damages in a sum to be determined at a later stage in these proceedings; and\n\n(vi) order Clamant to pay the totality of Respondent's costs and expenses relating to these arbitration proceedings.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6192, maintaining the request for relief stated in the Rejoinder, \u00b6 574, amending Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 668.\n\n561.\n\nIn respect of its counterclaims, Respondent requests the Tribunal to order that:\n\n(i) Claimant's investment was unlawful and not admitted subject to the laws of Respondent;\n\n(ii) Claimant breached Articles 11, 15 and 24.6 of the CHEJVA;\n\n(iii) Claimant violated Article 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules; and\n\n(iv) Claimant must compensate Respondent for the loss suffered by the latter as a result of the former's breaches of Pakistani law, the CHEJVA and 2002 BM Rules on a basis and in a sum to be determined, together with interest, at a later phase of this arbitration.495\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 666.\n\n**C. CLAIMANT'S CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT ON RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIMS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nClaimant submits that the Treaty does not authorize Respondent to raise counterclaims in ICSID proceedings. In any event, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Respondent's non-Treaty counterclaims based on alleged violations of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules. Claimant notes that Balochistan has raised identical counterclaims in the ICC Proceedings, which Claimant considers to be proper forum for non-Treaty claims. As to Respondent's counterclaims based on the Treaty, Claimant argues that Article 1(1)(a) contains only a definition and does not give rise to any obligations of the investor. In Claimant's view, Respondent's counterclaims \"*represent the flipside of* [its] *defences to* [TCCA's] *claims in this arbitration*\"; therefore, Claimant will defeat the counterclaims if it succeeds in defeating those defenses.\n\n**2. Claimant's Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant requests the Tribunal to dismiss all of Respondent's counterclaims.496\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 220.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n--------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nBy way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the course of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning is structured as follows: As a first step, the Tribunal will assess whether the general jurisdictional requirements are met and decide on Respondent's further objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. In case the Tribunal's jurisdiction is established and Claimant's claims are admissible, the Tribunal will, as a second step, examine whether and to what extent the conduct that Claimant relies on is attributable to Respondent. As a third step, the Tribunal will analyze whether Respondent in fact breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n**A. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. General Jurisdictional Requirements**\n------------------------------------------\n\n566.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on Article 13 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.497\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 377; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 286. *Cf*. Rejoinder, \u00b6 354.\n\n567.\n\nArticle 13 of the Treaty provides in relevant part:\n\n*\"1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other Party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.*\n\n*2. If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through consultations and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:*\n\n*(b) if both Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States ('the Convention'), refer the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ('the Centre') for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or 36 of the Convention.\"498*\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 13.\n\n568.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n*(2)* 'National of another Contracting State' *means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph*\n\n*(3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and*\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.*\"\n\n569.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention sets out four requirements for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction: (a) the existence of a legal dispute; (b) a dispute arising directly out of an \"*investment*;\" (c) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State; and (d) the existence of the written consent of both Parties.\n\n**a. Existence of a Legal Dispute**\n-----------------------------------\n\n570.\n\nClaimant submits,499 and Respondent does not contest, that there is a legal dispute between the Parties relating to Claimant's alleged investment in Pakistan. The existence of a legal dispute within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is thus common ground.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 382.\n\n**b. Dispute Arising Directly Out of an Investment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"*investment*\"; however, it is undisputed between the Parties that the relevant definition can be found in Article 1(1) of the Treaty,500 which reads in relevant part:\n\n*\"1. For the purposes of this Agreement:*\n\n*(a)* 'investment' *means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Party and admitted by the other Party subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time and includes:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, liens and other pledges,*\n\n*(ii) shares, stocks, bonds and debentures and any other form of participation in a company,*\n\n*(iii) a loan or other claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value,*\n\n*(iv) intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with respect to copyright, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, trade secrets, knowhow and goodwill,*\n\n*(v) business concessions and any other rights required to conduct economic activity and having economic value conferred by law or under a contract, including rights to engage in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and animal husbandry, to search for, extract or exploit natural resources and to manufacture, use and sell products, and*\n\n*(vi) activities associated with investments, such as the organisation and operation of business facilities, the acquisition, exercise and disposition of property rights including intellectual property rights, the raising of funds and the purchase and sale of foreign exchange.\"501*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 379; Reply, \u00b6 250; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 286.\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 1(1)(a).\n\n572.\n\nArticle 1(3) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"*For the purposes of this Agreement, a natural person or company shall be regarded as controlling a company or an investment if the person or company has a substantial interest in the company or the investment.*\"\n\n573.\n\nIn addition, Article 2(3) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"*A company duly organised under the law of a Party shall not be treated as an investor of the other Party, but any investments in that company by investors of that other Party shall be protected by this Agreement.*\"502\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 2(3).\n\n574.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to whether TCCA had a qualifying investment under the Treaty, in particular: (i) whether TCCA had an \"*asset*\" in Pakistan; (ii) whether TCCA owned or controlled its investment; and (iii) whether the investment was \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies*.\"503 Respondent further contests that the dispute \"*relates to*\" an investment within the meaning of Article 13 of the Treaty.504\n\n*Cf*.

Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nClaimant claims that TCCA has made substantial \"*investments*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, which include, *inter alia*, capital investments for exploration and feasibility activities in the Reko Diq project in an amount that exceeded US$ 240 million. Claimant further states that the Government of Balochistan expressly agreed in Clause 15.4.7 of the CHEJVA that \"*the transactions to which this Agreement relates constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention*.\"505\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 381. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 15.4.7.\n\n**(a) TCCA Had \"*****Assets*****\" and Related \"*****Activities*****\" in Pakistan**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nClaimant submits that the Treaty defines the term \"*investment*\" to mean \"*every kind of asset*,\" which is recognized as \"*possibly the broadest*\" phrase used in treaties and includes \"*everything of economic value, virtually without limitation*.\"506 Claimant further argues that the term is not confined to the list of investments in Article 1(1)(a), which is \"*merely*\" illustrative of the kinds of investments that qualify for protection, as made clear by the Treaty's use of the word \"*including.*\"507\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 250, 252. *Cf*. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 250.\n\n577.\n\nClaimant submits that TCCA's investment was \"*the mining business it developed in Pakistan*,\" which business was comprised of a \"*bundle of other assets, including but by no means limited to TCCA's interest in the CHEJVA, TCCP, EL-5 and the right to convert EL-5 into a mining lease so as to mine Reko Diq*.\"508 Claimant claims that an investment in the development of a host State's natural resources is the \"*quintessential example*\" of an activity protected by the Treaty.509 Claimant also notes that the Federal Board of Investment repeatedly acknowledged in official communications that TCCA's efforts and expenditures were investments.510\n\nReply, \u00b6 251.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 251, 253.\n\nReply, \u00b6 260 referring to **Exhibits CE-394**, **CE-327**, **CE-389**, **CE-346** and **CE-351**. *Cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17.\n\n578.\n\nAccording to Claimant, TCCA's assets and activities in Pakistan included virtually all of the items enumerated on the list in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, *inter alia*, \"*shares*\" in TCCP; a \"*form of participation*\" in the Chagai Hills Joint Venture; a \"*claim to performance* [of the CHEJVA and other contracts] *having economic value*\"; \"*intellectual and industrial property rights*\" in the Feasibility Study and other work; \"*trade secrets, know-how and goodwill*\" acquired in the course of the business; \"*business concessions*\" including rights \"*to search for, extract or exploit natural resources*\" such as Exploration License EL-5; and many varied \"*activities associated with investments*,\" such as leasing office space, purchasing vehicles and equipment and hiring employees.511\n\nReply, \u00b6 255.\n\n579.\n\nReferring to Pakistan's argument that TCCA did not have any \"*assets*\" but only \"*purported rights, which do not even exist,*\" Claimant argues that Pakistan conflates the analysis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction with the decision on the merits, while in fact the Tribunal should determine its jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims \"*assuming* pro tem *that they may be sustained on the facts*.\"512 Claimant argues that Pakistan's merits arguments about the alleged invalidity of the CHEJVA, Exploration License EL-5 and other instruments are therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal's analysis of its jurisdiction.513\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 265, 266.\n\nReply, \u00b6 268.\n\n580.\n\nIn any event, Claimant submits that its investment included, but was not limited to, its rights under the CHEJVA, its ownership of TCCP and its investment of approximately US$ 264,578,000 in the Reko Diq Project, but also numerous tangible and intangible assets which it had acquired in order to be able to run a business with over 500 employees and independent contractors in Pakistan.514 In addition, Claimant argues that TCCP had a right to a mining lease even in the absence of the CHEJVA, *i.e.*, under the 2002 BM Rules.515\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 19-20.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 4.\n\n581.\n\nIn addition, Claimant asserts that the CHEJVA and related agreements are valid and binding and refers to the ICC Rulings in which the ICC Tribunal held that \"[t]*he CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement are valid*\" and binding on Balochistan.516\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 12 referring to ICC Rulings, \u00b6 429. **Exhibit RE-169**.\n\n582.\n\nClaimant further contends that, regardless of its validity under Pakistani law, the CHEJVA is in any event part of Claimant's investment as Balochistan's conduct over the years led TCCA to believe, and thereby created a legitimate expectation, that the CHEJVA was valid and would be followed.517 In Claimant's view, the fact that Balochistan and Pakistan subsequently reversed course and, following Balochistan's request, the Supreme Court ultimately declared the CHEJVA and related agreements void is relevant only insofar as this conduct in itself amounts to part of Pakistan's denial of fair and equitable treatment of Claimant's investment.518\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n583.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that the Supreme Court's decision cannot deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to determine the facts relevant to the Treaty claim, to interpret the Treaty provisions and to apply the Treaty to the facts found by the Tribunal, as the Constitutional questions before the Supreme Court were \"*fundamentally distinct*\" from the Treaty questions before this Tribunal and the Treaty was specifically designed to insulate investors from the jurisdiction of the courts of the host State.519\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42.\n\n**(b) TCCA Owned and Controlled Its Investment**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nClaimant argues that even if, as alleged by Respondent, all of TCCA's assets underlying its claims had been transferred to TCCP in the Amalgamation transaction in 2008, this would not have any effect on either TCCA's standing or this Tribunal's jurisdiction. Claimant asserts that it is immaterial whether the assets were held directly by TCCA or indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiary TCCP, given that Article 2(3) of the Treaty extends the protection of investments to those held indirectly through ownership of a locally incorporated company.520\n\nReply, \u00b6 270.\n\n585.\n\nClaimant further contests Pakistan's assertion that TCCA \"*transferred all rights, assets and obligations*,\" including the CHEJVA, to TCCP by means of the Amalgamation. Claimant submits that the Amalgamation was merely a merger of TCCA's Pakistan branch into TCCP and notes that the order by which the Islamabad High Court endorsed the Amalgamation defines the petitioners as TCCP and the Pakistan branch of TCCA.521 Claimant argues that, while the Amalgamation transferred all contracts \"*entered into by or subsisting in favour of*\" the Pakistan branch, this did not include the CHEJVA which was \"*entered into by and subsisted in favour of*\" TCCA.522\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 271-274; **Exhibit RE-61**.\n\nReply, \u00b6 275.\n\n586.\n\nAccording to Claimant, at the time of the Amalgamation, TCCP and Balochistan intended that Balochistan would acquire 25% of TCCP's shares, with TCCA owning the remaining 75%. Claimant argues that it would not have made any sense for TCCA to transfer its rights under the CHEJVA to a company in which its CHEJVA counterparty held 25% of the shares.523\n\nReply, \u00b6 277.\n\n**(c) TCCA's Investment Was Duly \"*****Admitted*****\" by Pakistan**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nClaimant submits that Article 1 of the Treaty does not require that investments be made \"*in accordance with*\" Pakistani law in general, but rather provides that to qualify for protection under the terms of the Treaty, an investment must have been \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time*.\"524\n\nReply, \u00b6 281; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 25.\n\n588.\n\nClaimant submits that the term \"*law*\" in admission clauses refers to the host State's investment laws in particular, rather than its general laws. Claimant quotes the tribunal's explanation in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* :\n\n\" [I]*t would run counter to the object and purpose of investment protection treaties to deny substantive protection to those investments that would violate domestic laws that are unrelated to the very nature of investment regulation...* [U]*nless specifically stated in the investment treaty under consideration, a host State should not be in a position to rely on its domestic legislation beyond the sphere of investment regime to escape its international undertakings vis-\u00e0-vis investments made in its territory.\"525*\n\nReply, \u00b6 284. *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award of 14 July 2010. (\"*Saba Fakes v. Turkey*\") [CA-122].\n\n589.\n\nClaimant notes that the Supreme Court decision did not consider Pakistan's investment regime.526\n\nReply, \u00b6 284.\n\n590.\n\nClaimant further claims that \"*the critical time period for determining an investment's legality*\" for the purposes of an admission clause is \"*the time the investment was made*\" and argues that the Supreme Court judgment of May 2013 could not have had any relevance to the legality of TCCA's investments in Pakistan at the time they were \"*admitted,*\" given that it was rendered 20 years after the CHEJVA was signed, 13 years after TCCA first began exploration work at Reko Diq, 7 years after TCCA became a party to the Joint Venture, and 3 years after the Feasibility Study was completed.527 In Claimant's view, Pakistan cannot retroactively deprive investors of their rights by declaring their contracts void *ab initio*.528\n\nReply, \u00b6 282.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 6; *cf*. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.\n\n591.\n\nClaimant further refers to the tribunal in *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen,* which observed that admission clauses are \"*intended to ensure the legality of the investment by excluding investments made in breach of fundamental principles of the host State's law, e.g., by fraudulent misrepresentations or the dissimulation of true ownership*.\"529 Claimant argues that the Supreme Court judgment does not establish a breach of any \"*fundamental principles*,\" as its grounds for voiding the CHEJVA do not meet this standard.530\n\nReply, \u00b6 283. *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award of 6 February 2008. (\"*Desert Line Projects v. Yemen*\") [CA-115].\n\nReply, \u00b6 283.\n\n592.\n\nClaimant contends that there is no requirement that investments be formally \"*admitted*,\" but even if this were the case, Claimant refers to numerous occasions on which the competent Pakistani officials \"*repeatedly granted TCCA permission to operate and invest in Pakistan.*\"531 In Claimant's view, despite its finding as regards the CHEJVA and related agreements, the Supreme Court never invalidated such permission or the investment as a whole.532 In particular, Claimant emphasizes that the Supreme Court did not find that the approvals were invalidated by fraud, corruption or other \"*fundamental misconduct*.\"533\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 27.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 5.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 29.\n\n593.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Tribunal is in any event not bound to accept the Supreme Court's conclusions on the legality of the CHEJVA and subsequent agreements because such an approach would give the State unilateral power to redefine the scope and content of, and even to withdraw, its consent, once a dispute arises out of an investment*.*534 Claimant emphasizes that it is not asking that the Tribunal act as a court of appeal, but rather to exercise its exclusive competence to rule on its own jurisdiction.535\n\nReply, \u00b6 285.\n\nReply, \u00b6 288.\n\n594.\n\nClaimant further argues that the Supreme Court's judgment would not even have *res judicata* effect in relation to any alleged breaches of the CHEJVA, as the judgment did not resolve a bilateral contractual dispute between the parties to the CHEJVA, but rather public interest petitions brought by third parties, under the Pakistan Constitution, seeking relief for alleged misconduct by the Government. According to Claimant, the judgment would therefore not have *res judicata* effect even in a commercial dispute under Pakistani law.536\n\nReply, \u00b6 289.\n\n595.\n\nClaimant also refers to the ICC Rulings in which the ICC Tribunal ruled that any authority of the Supreme Court judgment would be limited to \"*findings of law*,\" while \"[t]*he application of the law to the facts is for the Tribunal*.\"537 In Claimant's view, the judgment does not contain any rules of law that, when applied to the facts presented in this arbitration, establish the invalidity of the CHEJVA.538\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14 referring to ICC Rulings, \u00b6 181. **Exhibit RE-169**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14.\n\n596.\n\nIn addition, Claimant submits that Pakistan cannot be allowed to rely on its own breaches of Pakistani law, in particular taking into account that they are \"*technical missteps purportedly discovered twenty years later*.\"539 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* which held that admission clauses do \"*not allow a State to preclude an investor from seeking protection under the BIT on the ground that its* own actions *are illegal under its own laws.*\"540\n\nReply, \u00b6 290.\n\nReply, \u00b6 290; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 18. *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction on Jurisdiction of 6 July 2007, (\"*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia\"*) [CA-134], \u00b6 182 (emphasis in original).\n\n597.\n\nClaimant further contests Respondent's submission that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty provides for discretion of the State to admit investments, arguing that this interpretation is unsupported by the text of the Treaty provision and would exceed its scope.541\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 293-294.\n\n598.\n\nFinally, Claimant claims that Respondent cannot credibly argue that this dispute does not \"*relate to*\" an investment. Claimant refers in particular to its shareholding in TCCP and notes that TCCP was created specifically to carry out exploration and feasibility activities and, eventually, also mining operations at Reko Diq and it was TCCP's Mining Lease Application that was rejected by the Licensing Authority.542\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 13.\n\n**ii. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant is unable to show an \"*investment*\" that could meet the requirements of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, namely (a) an asset owned or controlled by an Australian investor; and (b) an asset admitted subject to Pakistani law and policies applicable from time to time.543 According to Respondent, it thus follows that the dispute submitted by Claimant does not \"*relate to*\" an \"*investment*,\" which also results in a lack of jurisdiction under Article 13 of the Treaty.544\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 294; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 275.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 276.\n\n600.\n\nRespondent contends that the question whether Claimant has an investment under the ICSID Convention therefore does not even arise, so Claimant's reliance on Article 15.4.7 of the CHEJVA, quoted at paragraph 575 above, is misplaced.545\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 354.\n\n**(a) Claimant Does Not Have an \"*****Asset*****\" within the Meaning of Article 1(1)(a)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nRespondent submits that the first limb of the definition of \"*investment*\" is that the purported rights must constitute an \"*asset*\"; in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \" **Vienna Convention**\"), both terms must be given their ordinary meaning read in their context.546\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 288. Vienna Convention [CA-141], Article 31(1).\n\n602.\n\nRespondent refers to the Oxford English Dictionary definition of an \"*asset*\" as:\n\n\"*A financial contract or physical object with value that is owned by an individual, company, or sovereign, which can be used to generate additional value or provide liquidity*.\"547\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 289.\n\n603.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the correctness of this ordinary meaning is confirmed by reading the term \"*asset*\" in the context of Article 1(1)(a) as a whole, as each of the enumerated examples of assets in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) relates to rights, entitlements or claims having an economic value.548 Respondent concludes that, by definition, rights that do not exist cannot have \"*economic value.*\"549\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 290.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 291.\n\n604.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal in *Nagel v. Czech Republic,* which held that the terms \"*asset*\" and \"*investment*\" refer to rights having a \"*financial value*\" to their holder and stated: \"*This creates a link with domestic law, since it is to a large extent the rules of domestic law that determine whether or not there is a financial value.*\" The tribunal therefore held that the terms under the treaty \"*cannot be understood independently of the rights that may exist under Czech law.*\"550 Respondent also refers to the tribunal's statement in *EnCana v. Ecuador* that \"*the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador*.\"551\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 293-294. *William Nagel v. Czech Republic*, SCC Case No.049/2002, Award of 9 September 2003 (\"*Nagel v. Czech Republic*\") [RLA-104].\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 295. *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case UN3481, Award of 3 February 2006 (\"*EnCana v. Ecuador*\") [RLA-71]*.*\n\n605.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the source of all the rights that Claimant purports to have \u2013 including those arising under the 2002 BM Rules, exploration licenses, the Surface Rights Lease and the comprehensive plan to mine Reko Diq \u2013 is the CHEJVA, and in particular its Article 11.8.2.552\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 299.\n\n606.\n\nRespondent argues that, regardless of whether the CHEJVA was valid, the right to a mining lease under Article 11.8.2 does not constitute an \"*investment*\" because this right was subject to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out in Articles 11.4.2 and 11.6, which Claimant failed to satisfy before Exploration License EL-5 expired on 19 February 2011. In Respondent's view, the right therefore never came into existence and thus cannot qualify as an investment under the Treaty.553\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 320.\n\n607.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's purported rights under the 2002 BM Rules, Respondent asserts that Claimant was not the holder of Exploration License EL-5 (and neither was TCCP) and thus had no standing to apply for a mining lease pursuant to rule 48; rather, the 2002 BM Rules only recognize the unincorporated Joint Venture as exploration license holder, as was made clear by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject.554\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 321-331.\n\n608.\n\nAs regards Claimant's plan to mine Reko Diq and the related expenditures, Respondent asserts that TCCA did not perform any of the activities on its own and claims that they were undertaken by the Joint Venture pursuant to the terms of the CHEJVA. Respondent further argues that Claimant's expenditures cannot qualify as an \"*asset,*\" as they were made on the express understanding that the BDA could withdraw from the Joint Venture; thus, they can only be categorized as pre-investment expenditure.555 Respondent also refers to Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty pursuant to which the right to explore must be distinguished from the right to extract or exploit. Respondent argues that there was no interference with the right to explore and Claimant never had a right to extract or exploit, but only a right to apply for a license subject to the \"*ordinary, regular and established procedures.*\"556\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 333-345.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 348, 351.\n\n609.\n\nRespondent claims that, in order to establish the economic value of its alleged contract-based rights, Claimant must therefore prove that they exist under Pakistani law as the governing law of both the 2006 Novation Agreement and the CHEJVA.557 Respondent submits that, similarly, Exploration License EL-5 can only have been created by Pakistani law, as confirmed by Clause 9 of the 2006 Novation Agreement pursuant to which the transfer of EL-5 was governed by Pakistani law.558 Respondent argues that Claimant disregards this fact when it claims that Pakistani law is irrelevant because \"*this is not a contract case.*\"559\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 296-298.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 299.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 301.\n\n610.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant's submission that the Tribunal should determine its jurisdiction \"*assuming* pro tem *that* [Claimant's account of the facts] *may be sustained*,\" but argues that the Tribunal, now having the benefit of the Parties' full pleadings, must make a dispositive ruling on the facts that are relevant to its jurisdiction.560\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 272.\n\n611.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal \"*need look no further*\" than the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which was seized under Clause 11 of the 2006 Novation Agreement and concluded that the 2006 Novation Agreement is void *ab initio*, as a consequence of which Claimant never became a party to the CHEJVA. Respondent further refers to the Supreme Court's finding that the CHEJVA Agreements were void and claims that, as a result, the Joint Venture ceased to exist and could not be the holder of any rights in Exploration License EL-5.561\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 305.\n\n612.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Supreme Court's judgment constitutes a binding statement of Pakistani law; Respondent refers to Article 198 of the Pakistani Constitution which provides:\n\n***\"Decisions of Supreme Court binding on other Courts***\n\n*Any decision of the Supreme Court shall, to the extent that it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all other courts in Pakistan.\"562*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 307, 309.\n\n613.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the Tribunal must defer to the conclusion of the Supreme Court that the CHEJVA Agreements and Exploration License EL-5 are invalid, void *ab initio* and illegal, as international arbitral tribunals lack competence to act as appellate bodies when it comes to the interpretation or application of domestic law.563 Given that Claimant's purported contractual rights as well as its alleged right under Exploration License EL-5 thus did not exist, none of them can constitute an \"*asset*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a).564\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 309, 311-312; *cf*. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 300-302.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 308.\n\n614.\n\nIn relation to the ICC Rulings, Respondent submits that the Tribunal is required to determine for itself whether Claimant has satisfied all of the jurisdictional conditions under the Treaty and argues that the ICC Rulings do not detract from Claimant's failure to meet those requirements. In addition, Respondent submits that the ICC Rulings do not bind this Tribunal or Respondent, as the latter was not party to the ICC Proceedings.565\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\n615.\n\nRespondent maintains that the relevant principles of Pakistani law are set out in the judgment of the Supreme Court as the final *arbiter* of Pakistani law and claims that, although the ICC Tribunal found that it must not second-guess the Supreme Court's findings of Pakistani law, it failed to adhere to its own statement of principle.566 To the extent that, contrary to Respondent's position, this Tribunal considers the ICC Rulings relevant, it should bear in mind that the ICC Tribunal failed to apply the Supreme Court's first critical ruling under section 23 of the Contract Act 1872, namely that the conclusion of contracts such as the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement must be transparent and competitive.567 Respondent contends that it is common ground that such transparency and competition were not observed when the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement were concluded; as the ICC Tribunal simply failed to address this issue, its conclusion that the contracts are valid is \"*unsound*\" and \"*incorrect*\" as a matter of Pakistani law.568\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 23-24.The ICC Tribunal had found that: \"*The real issue for this Tribunal to determine is what the applicable Pakistani law is. \u2026 **[I]f there is an issue of Pakistani law for determination in the arbitration, and there is a decision of the Supreme Court which is relevant, the Tribunal will treat that decision as an authoritative statement of the law**. But its authority only extends to findings which are necessary to the decision, and only to findings of law.*\" ICC Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181, **Exhibit RE-169** (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 35.\n\n**(b) The Alleged Assets Are Not Owned or Controlled by Claimant**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nRespondent claims that the alleged assets are not \"*owned or controlled*\" by Claimant, but rather belong to TCCP to whom Claimant transferred all of its rights, assets and obligations pursuant to the Amalgamation. Respondent asserts that in the order by which it approved the Scheme of Arrangement, the Islamabad High Court referred to TCCA and TCCP as the participants in the Amalgamation. In addition, Respondent notes that it was TCCP who filed the Mining Lease Application.569\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 406-408.\n\n617.\n\nRespondent refers to Article 13(3)(c) of the Treaty which provides that:\n\n*\"a company which is constituted or incorporated under the law in force in the territory of one Party and in which before the dispute arises the majority of the shares are owned by investors of the other Party shall, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Party.\"570*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 409. **Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 13(3)(c).\n\n618.\n\nRespondent claims that the Treaty \"*draws a bright line*\" between investors and locally incorporated companies in which they hold the majority of the shares and argues that Claimant thus has no standing to bring a claim that belongs to TCCP.571\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 410.\n\n**(c) The Alleged Assets Were Not Admitted \"*****Subject to*** **[the]** ***Laws and Investment Policies*****\" of Pakistan**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nRespondent submits that even if Claimant establishes the existence of an \"*asset*,\" the second limb of the definition of \"*investment*\" under Article 1(1)(a) requires that the asset be ***\"admitted by the other Party subject to its laws and investment policies** applicable from time to time.\"*572\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 320 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n620.\n\nRespondent submits that such clauses are commonly referred to as \"*legality requirements*\" and notes that, pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, Article 1(1)(a) must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning of the text in light of the BIT's object and purpose.573\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 321-323.\n\n621.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the legality requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT must be read as imposing an \"*absolute requirement*\" that Claimant's assets must have been legal at the time of their \"*admission*\" and must have been created or acquired in compliance with the entirety of the \"*laws*\" and the \"*investment policies*\" of Pakistan.574\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 325, 327-328.\n\n622.\n\nRespondent submits that the ordinary meaning of the term \"*laws*\" is confirmed by the BIT's object and purpose, as recognized in its Preamble:\n\n\"*RECOGNISING the importance of promoting the flow of capital for economic activity and development and aware of its role in expanding economic relations and technical co-operation between them, particularly with respect to investment by investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*ACKNOWLEDGING that investments of investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party would be made within the framework of the laws of that other Party.*\"575\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 330-331.\n\n623.\n\nRespondent claims that the object and purpose of the Treaty is not the promotion and protection of investments *per se*, but only within the framework of the host State's laws and investment policies, in order to aid the development of the domestic economy.576 Respondent argues that the contracting parties incorporated the legality requirement in the definition of \"*investment*\" in order to \"*allay the important public policy concern that investments be made within the confines of the host State's domestic legal framework.*\"577\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 332.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 333.\n\n624.\n\nRespondent argues that, in this case, the Supreme Court has already determined \u2013 binding as a matter of Pakistani law \u2013 that Claimant's alleged assets were illegal, void and *non est* from their inception and claims that the Tribunal must apply this judgment.578 In Respondent's view, the judgment amounted to a declaration of what had always been the position under Pakistani law at all relevant times; therefore, the judgment did not \"*retrospectively affect*\" the admission of the alleged investment.579\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 335; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 305.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n625.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's allegation that only \"*investment laws*\" are referred to in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, Respondent claims that the tribunal in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey,* which Claimant relies on, was considering a different treaty which did not reflect the legality requirement in its preamble. According to Respondent, the tribunal also held in that case that there had been no investment at all, so the question of legality did not arise and the section quoted by Claimant was only an *obiter* remark.580\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 341.\n\n626.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's position that only \"*fundamental principles*\" are relevant in the context of the admission requirement, Respondent refers to Claimant's reliance on the case of *Desert Line v. Yemen* and argues that the tribunal in that case had to consider a provision with different wording. In any event, Respondent submits that this limitation was explicitly rejected by the *Quiboras v. Bolivia* tribunal, stating: \"*The interpretation of the Claimants* [is] *too narrow* [and] *goes beyond the terms of the BIT, in an attempt to further the investor's protection without due regard for the State's interest.*\"581\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 343-344.\n\n627.\n\nRespondent notes that, even if there was a \"*fundamental principles*\" qualification, the Supreme Court found that the CHEJVA Agreements were unlawful and void *ab initio* because they were contrary to public policy; in Respondent's view, sections 20 and 23 of the Contract Act 1872 embody \"*fundamental principles*\" of Pakistani law.582\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 346.\n\n628.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's argument that a State may not rely upon its own wrongdoing, Respondent claims that there is no indication that the legality requirement applies only to the investor's own illegal conduct. Respondent notes that in the case of *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* the clause that Claimant relies on in this regard expressly refers to the investor's conduct, while Article 1(1)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not.583 Respondent argues that the tribunal in that case even stated that the ordinary meaning of the clause included a reference to Georgian contract law, but held that the particular object and purpose of the Greece-Georgia BIT, which the preamble set out to be broad protection for investors and investments,584 would be frustrated if the State were allowed to rely on the illegality of its own actions under its own laws. Respondent emphasizes that that the object and purpose of the Treaty in the present case is very different and expressly refers to the legality requirement.585\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 347-349. Article 12 of the Greece-Georgia BIT that Respondent refers to provides: \"*This Agreement shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, consistent with the latter's legislation.*\"*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* [CA-134].\n\nThe preamble of the Greece-Georgia BIT provides:  \n\"*HAVING as their objective to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party. RECOGNIZING that the promotion and protection of investments, on the basis of this Agreement, will stimulate the initiative in this field*.\"*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* [CA-134].\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 352.\n\n629.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant's attempt to narrow the scope of the legality requirement in Article 1(1)(a) is contrary to the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of the Treaty; thus, Claimant has not satisfied the legality requirement, with the result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.586\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 336.\n\n630.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that, due to fact that none of Claimant's alleged assets meet the definition of \"*investment*\" in Article 1(1)(a), Claimant also failed to show that the dispute \"*relates to*\" an \"*investment*.\" In addition, Respondent contends that, even if, contrary to the Respondent's case, Claimant did have an \"*investment,*\" it has failed to prove the necessary link between such investment and the dispute it has submitted to this Tribunal.587 Therefore, the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction under Article 13 of the Treaty.588\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 355.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 276.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the legal dispute \"*aris*[es] *directly out of an investment*.\" The disagreement between the Parties as to whether Claimant had an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is divided into three sub-questions: (i) whether Claimant had an \"*asset*\"; (ii) whether such asset was \"*owned or controlled*\" by TCCA; and (iii) whether the asset was \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time*.\" In addition, Respondent contests that the dispute \"*relates to*\" an investment under Article 13 of the Treaty.\n\n632.\n\nAs to the first question whether Claimant had an \"*asset*,\" the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's activities in Pakistan were primarily based on two pillars: (i) TCCA's own direct 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture that was thereby established; and (ii) its 100% interest in its Pakistani subsidiary TCCP, which was established for the exclusive purpose of carrying out Claimant's activities in Pakistan. Through TCCP, Claimant indirectly held all further rights in the Reko Diq Project that were not held by the Joint Venture.\n\n633.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that both pillars constitute \"*assets*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. While the enumeration in this provision is not exhaustive (\"*includes*\"), the Tribunal does not have to go beyond the list in the present case. Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA, the Joint Venture and its property qualifies as an asset because it includes, *inter alia*, \"*tangible and intangible property*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(i) of the Treaty); \"*intellectual and industrial property rights*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(iv) of the Treaty); \"*business concessions and other rights required to conduct economic activity and having economic value conferred by law or under a contract, including rights \u2026 to search for, extract or exploit natural resources*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty); and \"*activities associated with investments, such as the organisation and operation of business facilities*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(vi) of the Treaty).\n\n634.\n\nThe second pillar, *i.e.*, Claimant's interest in TCCP, likewise constitutes an asset, given that it qualifies as \"*shares \u2026 and any other form of participation in a company*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(ii) of the Treaty). In addition, Article 2(3) of the Treaty clarifies that, even though companies established under the law of the host State are not themselves treated as investors under the Treaty, investments in such companies made by an investor of the Contracting Party are protected by the Treaty. As a result, the Tribunal considers that Claimant had an \"*asset*\" within the meaning of the \"*investment*\" definition contained in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n635.\n\nAs to the second issue whether the assets were \"*owned or controlled*\" by TCCA, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(3) of the Treaty defines \"*controlling a company or an investment*\" for the purposes of the Treaty as having a \"*substantial interest in the company or the investment.*\"589 In the present case, Claimant was and remained party to the CHEJVA after the Amalgamation in 2008 because it is clear from the record that only TCCA's \"*PAKISTAN BRANCH*\" was amalgamated with TCCP, which resulted in the \"*consolidation of two wholly owned entities of TCCA,*\" and Claimant thus continued to hold (\"*owned*\") a direct interest in the CHEJVA and its related agreements and the Joint Venture.590 As to Claimant's interest in TCCP, it is undisputed that Claimant always held, and still holds, 100% of the shares and thus a \"*substantial interest*\" in TCCP. Consequently, it \"*controls*\" TCCP and its investment in that company within the meaning of Article 1(3) of the Treaty.\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 1(3).\n\n**Exhibit CE-21**, pp. 1 and 5; **Exhibit RE-61**.\n\n636.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address the third issue, *i.e.*, whether the assets that Claimant owned or controlled were \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time.*\" In accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, this phrase has to be interpreted \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\"591\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\") [CA-141], Article 31(1).\n\n637.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of the phrase does not impose a strict legality or a formal admission requirement upon the asset but rather implies that, at the time the investment is made, it must be accepted by the relevant authorities or officials representing the host State. If such an acceptance could later be revoked retroactively, the host State could unilaterally deprive an initially \"*admitted*\" investment of its protection under the Treaty.\n\n638.\n\nThis interpretation is also in conformity with the context as well as the object and purpose of the Treaty. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the Preamble to the Treaty is relevant in this regard, it cannot follow Respondent's argument that the recital \"*ACKNOWLEDGING that investments of investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party would be made within the framework of the laws of that other Party*\" implies the intent of the Contracting Parties to make the protection of investments subject to their strict compliance with all applicable laws of the host State. In the view of the Tribunal, it rather appears from the Preamble, which contains an aggregate of four recitals, that the Contracting Parties recognized the importance of foreign investments for the economic activity of the States and of providing a clear set of principles to protect such investments in order to promote them. In this context, the Contracting States then acknowledge that investments would be made \"*within the framework of the laws*\" of the host State.\n\n639.\n\nThe recital that Respondent relies on therefore underlines the requirements contained in various provisions of the Treaty, such as Article 1(1)(a) and Article 3(1), but it was not intended to raise the threshold for the recognition of investments that are protected under the Treaty. A different interpretation would be contrary to the Contracting Parties' intent \u2013 on which they put repeated emphasis \u2013 to foster such foreign investments in order to promote the economic development in their territory. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the admission requirement is met if the investment was accepted by the host State at the time it was made.\n\n640.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considers that the relevant point in time when TCCA made its investment was the conclusion of the Novation Agreement in 2006 because TCCA thereby became party to the CHEJVA and took over BHP's rights and obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* its Joint Venture partner. At that time, the record clearly establishes that TCCA's activities in Pakistan were not only accepted, but highly welcomed and encouraged on every level of the GOB and the GOP. Even if there was an internal issue within the GOB regarding the proper authorization for signing the CHEJVA, there is no evidence that any Government representative suggested at the time that the CHEJVA and its related agreements were null and void. To the contrary, it appears that such issues were first raised in the proceedings before the Balochistan High Court and then the Supreme Court, in which the GOB defended the validity of the CHEJVA until early 2011.\n\n641.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the reasons for which the Supreme Court ultimately declared the CHEJVA invalid \u2013 seven years after TCCA had replaced BHP as a party \u2013 did not concern any illegal conduct on the part of Claimant, but rather failures on the part of the GOB and the BDA to comply with their internal laws. Even though the Treaty does not link the admission requirement exclusively to the conduct of the investor, it is a general principle that the State cannot rely on its own failure to escape its liabilities under international law. Reasons that are not within the investor's sphere of responsibility therefore cannot deprive an investment of its protection under the Treaty.\n\n642.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that Claimant's investment was also \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies*\" applicable at the time the investment was made. In conclusion, the Tribunal therefore finds that Claimant had an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n643.\n\nFinally, the dispute between the Parties also \"*relates to*\" Claimant's investment within the meaning of Article 13 of the Treaty, given that Claimant's claims, which are based on the denial of the Mining Lease Application and the alleged takeover of the Reko Diq Project by the GOB, specifically relate to Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture as well as to TCCP, which was created exclusively to carry out the exploration, feasibility and eventual mining operations at Reko Diq.\n\n**c. Dispute between a Contracting State and a National of Another Contracting State**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the dispute is between a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and a national of another Contracting State. Pakistan is a Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(1) because Pakistan ratified the ICSID Convention on 15 September 1966 and the Convention entered into force for Pakistan on 15 October 1966. Australia ratified the ICSID Convention on 2 May 1991, and it came into force for Australia on 1 June 1991.\n\n645.\n\nThe Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investment was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force on 14 October 1998. TCCA is a \"*national of another Contracting State*\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and is an \"*investor*\" pursuant to Article 1(1)(c) and (d) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty because it is a company constituted under the laws of Australia.592\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 379. **Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 1(1)(c), (d).\n\n**d. Existence of Written Consent of Both Parties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nIn Article 13(2)(b) of the Treaty, Pakistan has given its consent to submit disputes relating to an investment to the jurisdiction of the Centre.593 As stated above, the present dispute relates to Claimant's alleged investment in Pakistan; thus, it is covered by Respondent's consent given in Article 13(2)(b).\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Art. 13.\n\n647.\n\nClaimant expressly consented to submit this dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre in its Request for Arbitration.594\n\nRfA, \u00b6 16.\n\n**e. Conclusion on General Jurisdictional Requirements**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the general jurisdictional requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are fulfilled.\n\n**2. Respondent's Further Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Are Claimant's Claims Contractual in Nature and Is Claimant Barred from Re-Litigating Contractual Issues?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nRespondent claims that \"*Claimant's vague articulation of its investment boils down to its alleged contract-based rights*\" under the CHEJVA Agreements and refers in particular to the purported *\"right to mine.\"* In Respondent's view, the Treaty breaches that Claimant alleges are based on a purported breach of contract, namely the rejection of the Mining Lease Application by the Licensing Authority; thus, Claimant's Treaty case in fact rests on a contractual foundation.595\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 273, 274.\n\n650.\n\nRespondent further submits that Exploration License EL-5 was granted to the Joint Venture \"*under the auspices of the CHEJVA agreements*\" and, in general, all of Claimant's purported rights have their source in the CHEJVA, via the gateway of the 2006 Novation Agreement.596 According to Respondent, Claimant's core claim is therefore a \"*claim to performance*\" of the CHEJVA and related agreements.597\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 279, 281.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 283.\n\n651.\n\nRespondent claims that this is a \"*classic*\" joint venture contract dispute between two joint venture partners, which is before the ICC Tribunal and is not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Respondent requests that the choice-of-forum clause in the CHEJVA be given effect and that the scope of Pakistan's consent to jurisdiction under the Treaty be respected.598 Respondent argues that, in the absence of a specific treaty provision, a State should not be presumed to have consented to submit purely contractual disputes to international jurisdiction.599\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 356-357.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 358.\n\n652.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a treaty claim must be \"*self-standing*\"; Respondent refers to Judge Georges Abi-Saab's Concurring Opinion in *TSA Spectrum v. Argentina* in which he held that this was not a case where alleged treaty breaches \"*necessarily pass by or posit a contract violation as a fundamental element of or premise of its cause of action*.\"600 Respondent argues that the entirety of Claimant's claims are premised on violations of the CHEJVA; thus, those claims are \"*no more than a contractual claim*... *dressed up as a Treaty case*.\"601\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 364-365. *TSA Spectrum de Argentina v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Concurring Opinion of Arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab of 19 December 2008 (\"*TSA Spectrum v. Argentina* Concurring Opinion\") [RLA-55].\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 366, quoting *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award of 10 December 2010 (\"*RSM v. Grenada*\") [RLA-56].\n\n653.\n\nRespondent submits that in a case where the basis of a claim is contractual, an exclusive choice-of-law clause in that contract must be honored in order to respect the original bargain between the parties and the principle of *pacta sunt servanda*.602 Respondent asserts that in light of the dispute resolution mechanism provided in Article 15.4, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Claimant's claims arising out of the CHEJVA, as Claimant has initiated the ICC arbitration prior to these ICSID proceedings.603\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 369, 371.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 374-376.\n\n654.\n\nIn Respondent's view, it is clear that in the context of Claimant's Treaty claims, the Tribunal is required to rule on the same contractual issues as the ICC Tribunal, including (a) whether the alleged \"*assets*\" exist and are lawful under Pakistani law; (b) whether any rights under the CHEJVA Agreements can be invoked against Respondent; and (c) whether Claimant has a right to a mining lease pursuant to the terms of the CHEJVA. Respondent argues that Claimant itself has elected to submit those issues to the ICC Tribunal and must be held to its choice.604\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 356-357.\n\n655.\n\nRespondent further submits that the well-established general principle of issue estoppel (also known as \"*collateral estoppel*\") precludes Claimant from re-litigating the contractual issues, which have already been determined by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.605\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 358-359.\n\n656.\n\nRespondent relies on the holding of the tribunal in *RSM v Grenada* :\n\n\"*The disputing parties... agree that a finding concerning a right, question or fact may not be relitigated (and, thus, is binding on a subsequent tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal.*\n\n*It is also not disputed that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now well established as a general principle of law applicable in international courts and tribunals such as this one.*\"606\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 360. *RSM v Grenada* [RLA-56].\n\n657.\n\nRespondent argues that the test for estoppel under international law is clearly met in this case, as Claimant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which determined the very same contractual issues that are now before this Tribunal.607\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 361.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nClaimant recognizes that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on contractual claims arising from the CHEJVA, emphasizing however that \"*this is not a contract case*\" and that TCCA's claims relate to breaches of the Treaty and general international law.608\n\nReply, \u00b6 232.\n\n659.\n\nClaimant argues that treaty claims are distinct from contractual claims and submits that in assessing Claimant's Treaty claims, the Tribunal will not determine whether under Pakistani law \"*the contractual rights or entitlements asserted by Claimant have been breached under the contract*,\" but it may rather consider, *inter alia*, the conduct of the organs and officials of both the GOP and the GOB in relation to the CHEJVA.609\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 233, 235\n\n660.\n\nClaimant refers to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* which held:\n\n\"*A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract; it may also breach a treaty at the same time it breaches a contract. And, in the latter case it is permissible for the Tribunal to consider such alleged contractual breaches, not for the purpose of determining whether a party has incurred liability under domestic law, but to the extent necessary to analyse and determine whether there has been a breach of the Treaty. In doing so, the Tribunal would in no way be exercising jurisdiction over the contract, it would simply be taking into account the parties behavior under and in relation to the terms of the contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.*\"610\n\nReply, \u00b6 235. *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007 (\"*Vivendi v. Argentina II*\") [CA-52], \u00b6 7.3.10.\n\n661.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent attempts to conflate the Treaty claims to be decided by this Tribunal with the contract claims that are at issue before the ICC Tribunal. Claimant recognizes that its Treaty claims derive in part from its rights under the CHEJVA, but submits that this cannot prevent this Tribunal from hearing those claims. Claimant again refers to the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* I which stated that:\n\n\"*it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction... and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.*\"611\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 240-241. *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002 (\"*Vivendi v. Argentina I Annulment Decision\"*) [CA-9], \u00b6 105.\n\n662.\n\nClaimant asserts that it is irrelevant that the dispute against Balochistan arising under the CHEJVA will be decided before a different forum.612 In Claimant's view, the fact that some of the acts to be assessed by this Tribunal may also be considered a breach of the CHEJVA by Balochistan does not deprive TCCA of its rights and remedies under the Treaty.613\n\nReply, 242.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 13.\n\n663.\n\nClaimant also emphasizes that apart from the fact that both arbitrations were filed simultaneously and only registered on different dates, TCCA tried to register the Balochistan arbitration with ICSID but was forced to resort to the ICC fallback mechanism because Pakistan failed to authorize the Province of Balochistan to participate in ICSID arbitration (despite a commitment to do so in the 2006 Novation Agreement).614\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n664.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on claims that are based on breaches of contract, but only on claims that are based on violations of the Treaty.615 However, this does not mean that the Tribunal may not take into account the terms of the CHEJVA in its analysis of whether Respondent in fact breached any of its obligations under the Treaty.\n\nThe separate question of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims insofar as they are not based on alleged Treaty violations but rather on alleged breaches of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, will be addressed at paragraph 1420 below.\n\n665.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* that \"*it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction \u2026 and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law*.\"616\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina I Annulment Decision* [CA-9], \u00b6 105.\n\n666.\n\nIt has to be emphasized that the Tribunal does not wish to interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal to decide on claims arising out of the CHEJVA and, therefore, it will not express an opinion on whether any provisions of the CHEJVA have been breached \u2013 which in any event would be something that Claimant has not asked this Tribunal to do. In the present proceedings, Claimant has not raised any such claims based on breaches of contract, but it has rather claimed that Respondent violated certain standards of protection under the Treaty. Given that Claimant's investment includes its interest in the Joint Venture that was established under the CHEJVA, the Tribunal necessarily has to look at the CHEJVA and its related agreements in order to be in a position to assess whether Respondent violated its obligations under the Treaty.\n\n667.\n\nThe question whether Respondent's conduct amounted to a violation of the Treaty has not, and will not, be decided by either the Supreme Court or the ICC Tribunal; therefore, there can be no \"*collateral estoppel*\" with regard to the Treaty claims that Claimant has raised in the present proceedings.\n\n**b. Are Claimant's Claims Inadmissible?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimant's Claims Are Inadmissible** ***Ratione Materiae***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's claims are inadmissible due to the fact that its purported right to mine Reko Diq pursuant to Article 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA never arose. It is Respondent's position that Article 11.8.2 did not bestow on Claimant any rights to mine, but only entitled it to convert a prospecting license into a mining lease \"*subject to routine Government requirements.*\" In addition, Respondent asserts that Articles 11.4.2 and 11.6 constitute conditions precedent to be fulfilled before any entitlement to undertake mine development could arise and claims that these conditions were never satisfied.617\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 377-379, 391.\n\n669.\n\nRespondent argues that it is clearly set out in the CHEJVA that the transfer of the Non-participating Party's interest in the Joint Venture Property, such as the Exploration License EL-5 and the Feasibility Study, necessarily had to occur before the Participating Party could assert a right over such Property.618 Respondent further claims that the procedure set out in the CHEJVA, which was to be followed for the acquisition of the interest, was \"*flagrant*[ly] *disregard*[ed]\" by Claimant when it denied the BDA an opportunity to decide whether it wished to develop the (at least) fourteen mineral deposits over which Claimant sought a lease in its Mining Lease Application.619\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 394.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 397-398.\n\n670.\n\nRespondent argues that a right that had not yet arisen at the date of the Mining Lease Application cannot be interfered with; thus, Claimant's claim is inadmissible.\n\n**(b) Claimant's Claims Are Inadmissible** ***Ratione Personae***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant's claims are inadmissible because Claimant comes to this Tribunal with \"*unclean hands*,\" referring to the doctrine of \"*clean hands*\" as a general principle regarding claims tainted by corruption.620\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 402, 405.\n\n672.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant's role in procuring the illegality of its investment is evident from the record.621 According to Respondent, the Supreme Court judgment reveals \"*very serious irregularities committed by TCC's predecessor*\" and further illustrates the role of Claimant, given that it was incorporated by Mincor, the company which \"*orchestrated*\" the 2000 Addendum and thus must have been aware that BHP's and BDA's counsel had considered the CHEJVA void for uncertainty.622\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 402.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 307.\n\n673.\n\nRespondent further asserts that Claimant was aware of the CHEJVA's illegality and knew that it would only be a matter of time before it became public, given that Mincor and BHP agreed in the Option Agreement that the existence of a binding Addendum to the CHEJVA would be one of the conditions precedent for the Mincor Option to become binding. In Respondent's view, Claimant was therefore not an unsuspecting or innocent party, but rather used the 2000 Addendum to \"*bolster*\" its case.623\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 308-309.\n\n674.\n\nIn addition, Respondent alleges that Claimant \"*sponsored numerous all-expenses-paid trips for various BDA and Government of Balochistan officials*.\"624 Respondent also refers to the Supreme Court's finding that officials involved in the conclusion of the CHEJVA violated their public duties under Pakistani law by offering advantages and benefits to Claimant's predecessor. Respondent refers to international law and policy on anti-corruption pursuant to which the prohibition of corruption forms part of public policy and submits that investments in violation of public policy are not accorded treaty protection.625\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 307.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 310, 312.\n\n**ii. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Respondent's** ***Ratione Materiae*** **Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n675.\n\nIn the context of jurisdiction, Claimant submits that Respondent conflates the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which should be determined \"*assuming* pro tem *that* [the claims] *may be sustained on the facts*,\" with the decision on the merits.626\n\nReply, \u00b6 266. See \u00b6 579 above.\n\n676.\n\nOn the merits, Claimant contends that the CHEJVA did not require the sole Participating Party to acquire the interest of the Non-participating Party before it could apply for a Mining Lease. Claimant notes that pursuant to rule 47(1), the unincorporated Joint Venture would not even have qualified to file the application; therefore, only TCCP could do so.627 In addition, Claimant submits that TCCP \"*repeatedly encouraged*\" Balochistan to join the mining venture in order to file a joint application and, when Balochistan failed to do so, it sought to buy out Balochistan's share pursuant to Clause 11.5 of the CHEJVA, but Balochistan refused to negotiate with TCCP.628\n\nReply, \u00b6 418.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87.\n\n**(b) Respondent's** ***Ratione Personae*** **Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n677.\n\nClaimant claims that Pakistan's contention that the Tribunal should dismiss TCCA's claims because \"*it comes to this Tribunal with* 'unclean hands',\" due to an alleged \"*role in procuring* [the] *illegality*\" of its investments, or because its claims are \"*tainted by corruption*\" is a \"*scandalous and false accusation*\" for which Pakistan does not offer any proof. Claimant asserts that Respondent's allegations are rather based on alleged \"*technical defects*\" in relation to the conclusion of the CHEJVA, or on \"*pure speculation*.\"629\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 296-297.\n\n678.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that, as the ICC Tribunal has observed in its decision on Respondent's document production requests,630 the Supreme Court does not make any findings of corruption in its judgment and did not invalidate the CHEJVA on that basis. Claimant submits that the Supreme Court only repeated, *verbatim*, Balochistan's submission that there were \"*shocking disclosures of extensive irregularities and corruption*\" in the record that the Provincial Government provided, but did not give any examples of such disclosures and did not draw any conclusions from this observation with regard to the validity or effectiveness of the CHEJVA and related agreements.631\n\n**Exhibit CE-386**, p. 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 299.\n\n679.\n\nClaimant further submits that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, the Supreme Court does not state in its judgment that any \"*officials involved in* [the] *conclusion*\" of the CHEJVA \"*violated their public duties under Pakistani law by offering advantages and benefits to the Claimant's predecessor related to the CHEJVA*.\" Claimant states that the paragraphs cited by Pakistan rather relate to (i) the validity of the 1994 Relaxations that Balochistan granted in 1994, and (ii) the fact that the Chairman of the BDA (at the time the CHEJVA was concluded) was convicted several years later of a corruption-related offence, which was, however, not related to the CHEJVA or the Joint Venture.632\n\nReply, \u00b6 300.\n\n680.\n\nClaimant concludes that Respondent did not present any evidence either in the Supreme Court proceeding or in this or the ICC arbitration that the CHEJVA was procured by corruption and that there is thus no factual support for Respondent's allegation.633\n\nReply, \u00b6 301.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n681.\n\nAs to Respondent's *ratione materiae* objection, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the arguments raised by Respondent in this regard relate to the merits of the claim. Even if the Tribunal were to find that the right that is claimed to have been violated does not exist, this would not, in itself, lead to the inadmissibility of the claim. While there may be an exception for a right that evidently, *i.e*., without the need for any analysis of the merits, does not exist and therefore cannot form the basis for the claim, the Tribunal considers that no such exception is applicable in the present case.\n\n682.\n\nFurther, contrary to Respondent's allegation, Claimant does not base its claims exclusively on Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA but also on rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules and the assurances that it claims to have received from Government officials. In addition, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that Claimant \"*flagrant* [ly] *disregard*[ed]\" the procedure set out in Clause 11 of the CHEJVA, given that Claimant attempted to acquire the 25% interest of its Joint Venture partner. The question whether such acquisition had to be completed before TCCP would be eligible to apply for a mining lease on its own, despite the fact that the Joint Venture itself was not eligible to do so under the 2002 BM Rules and the Expiration License EL-5 was about to expire in February 2011, does not yield the obvious result that Respondent alleges and therefore remains a question for the merits.\n\n683.\n\nRespondent's *ratione materiae* objection is therefore dismissed.\n\n684.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's *ratione personae* objection, the Tribunal notes that there is no evidence in the record that would support Respondent's allegations of corruption in connection with Claimant's investment at Reko Diq. This applies both to the conduct of TCCA or TCCP itself and to any conduct of BHP of which Claimant should have been aware.\n\n685.\n\nIn particular, the Supreme Court judgment on which Respondent relies does not include any finding on corruption; it further does not indicate that there is any evidence for the existence of corruption in connection with Claimant's investment. While the Supreme Court notes that the dual office held by Mr. Jaffar, Chairman of the BDA and Additional Chief Secretary at the time the CHEJVA was signed, presented a \"*clear conflict of interest*,\"634 it does not make a finding that Mr. Jaffar's conduct in connection with the CHEJVA constituted an act of corruption and it does not mention any corresponding conduct of the investor (then BHP). The Supreme Court further adopts the GOB's formulation that, in the course of reviewing the record to the CHEJVA, \"[i]*t made shocking disclosures of extensive irregularities and corruption*.\"635 However, the Supreme Court does not give any examples of such disclosures, nor does it specify what kind of disclosures were made. Therefore, the Tribunal does not have any evidence before it that would establish or even indicate any acts of corruption on the part of TCCA/TCCP or its predecessor BHP.\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 50.\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 63.\n\n686.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that Mincor/TCCA's insistence on the conclusion of the 2000 Addendum as a condition to taking over BHP's role as a party to the CHEJVA does not constitute evidence of Claimant's awareness of corruption, or in fact any illegal conduct, when the CHEJVA was concluded. This condition is rather a reaction to the uncertainties that had come up in 1999 as to whether the GOB had validly become a party to the CHEJVA pursuant to the applicable internal laws in 1993.\n\n687.\n\nAs a result, Respondent's *ratione personae* objection is likewise dismissed. As noted in the Tribunal's Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 3 February 2016, the findings above on Respondent's *ratione personae* objection are based upon the evidence as it stood before Respondent's Application and do not account for any of the developments set out in paragraphs 177 through 212 above. Before filing its Application, Respondent submitted, *inter alia*, that Claimant's claims were inadmissible because it had participated in administrative irregularities and acts of corruption in consequence of which it came to the Tribunal with 'unclean hands'. Claimant denied the allegation. At the time of the original hearing, there was nothing which could be described as evidence of any act of corruption. However, as the Tribunal has stated, it subsequently gave leave to Respondent to introduce new evidence of alleged acts of corruption in support of an application to dismiss the claims. The Tribunal has dismissed this application and deals with the allegations of corruption in its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons), which is issued together with the present Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (see paragraph 215 above).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Conclusion on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n688.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and that the claims are admissible.\n\n**B. ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent is liable for the alleged breaches of the Treaty not only on account of its own conduct, but also on account of the conduct of Balochistan and its organs, including the BDA, whose acts, Claimant claims, are fully attributable to Respondent.636\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 385; Reply, \u00b6 322.\n\n**a. The Conduct of the GOB Is Attributable to Respondent**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nClaimant refers to Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission (the \"**ILC Articles**\") which provides that:\n\n\"[t]*he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.*\"637\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 386.\n\n691.\n\nClaimant submits that it is recognized that, in Federal States like Pakistan, this rule applies to all organs \"*at provincial or even local level*,\" irrespective of whether the organ is under the control of the central government pursuant to the State's domestic laws.638 Claimant refers to the ILC Commentary to Article 4, which states that \"*the principle in article 4 applies equally to organs of the central government and to those of regional or local units*\" and further that \"*it does not matter for this purpose whether the territorial unit in question is a component unit of a Federal State or a specific autonomous area*.\"639\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 387.\n\nReply, \u00b6 307. ILC Articles [CA-1].\n\n692.\n\nClaimant also refers to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina I*, which observed that the \"*internal constitutional structure of a country*\" cannot be used to deny responsibility, nor can a federal state *\"rely on the federal or decentralized character of its constitution to limit the scope of its international responsibilities*.\"640\n\nReply, \u00b6 308. *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 21 November 2000 (\"*Vivendi v. Argentina I*\") [CA-8].\n\n693.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Pakistan is therefore fully liable for the conduct of the Licensing Authority, the Secretary of the MMDD and any other organ or official of the GOB.641\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 388; Reply, \u00b6 309.\n\n694.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's argument that the conduct on which TCCA bases its claims exceeded the authority of the State organ, Claimant refers to Article 7 of the ILC Articles which provides that:\n\n\"[t]*he conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\"*642\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 389 referring to *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award of 29 July 2008 (\"*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*\") [CA-40] and *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Award of 30 June 2009 (\"*Saipem v. Bangladesh*\") [CA-39].\n\n695.\n\nClaimant further submits that the State also bears responsibility for the conduct of its judiciary and claims that ICSID tribunals have recognized that an investor's treaty-protected rights can also be impaired or deprived by a judicial act.643\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 390.\n\n696.\n\nAs to Respondent's argument that the conduct of the Government of Balochistan is not attributable to Pakistan because Annex B of the Treaty provides for the application of domestic law, Claimant notes that Annex B applies only to an \"*Arbitral Tribunal referred to in paragraph 2(c) of Article 13*\" of the Treaty, *i.e.*, an *ad hoc* tribunal constituted in the event that Australia and Pakistan are not both ICSID Member States at the time an investor-state dispute is submitted to arbitration. Claimant argues that this dispute has been filed in accordance with paragraph 2(b) of Article 13 of the Treaty as both Australia and Pakistan were ICSID Member States at the time the Request for Arbitration was filed; thus, Annex B of the Treaty is inapplicable in this arbitration.644\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 305, 229.\n\n697.\n\nClaimant argues that, in the absence of a provision in the Treaty dealing with the question whether the acts of federal provinces can be attributed to the State, the rules of international law as reflected in Article 4 of the ILC Articles have to be applied.645\n\nReply, \u00b6 305.\n\n698.\n\nRegarding Respondent's further argument that Pakistan was not a party to the CHEJVA, Claimant emphasizes that TCCA's claims are not based on \"*a contractual breach of the CHEJVA*,\" but rather on violations of the Treaty by the conduct of high-ranking organs and officials of both the GOP and the GOB over a period of more than 20 years. Claimant refers to, *inter alia*, (i) their repeated representations and assurances that TCCA is entitled to a mining lease subject only to routine requirements; (ii) their ousting of TCCA from the project in order to replace it with the \"*Balochistan Copper Gold Project*\"; and (iii) the Supreme Court proceedings and judgment.646\n\nReply, \u00b6 311.\n\n699.\n\nClaimant asserts that the 1929 Harvard Draft Convention on State Responsibility (the \" **Harvard Articles**\") relied on by Respondent does not reflect international law because those Articles \"*contravene the international consensus that the conduct of even minor organs can be regarded as an act of State*.\"647 Claimant further argues that in any event, even under the Harvard Articles, Pakistan would be liable for the Supreme Court's judgment as it constitutes \"*a violation by the State of a treaty*\" pursuant to Article 12(4)(c) of the Harvard Articles.648\n\nReply, \u00b6 312.\n\nReply, \u00b6 313.\n\n700.\n\nWith respect to Respondent's argument that Balochistan acted in its commercial capacity, Claimant submits that, under international law, a State is responsible for the conduct of its organs, irrespective of whether they act in a governmental or a commercial function. Claimant again relies on the ILC Commentary to Article 4, which states that \"*it is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as* 'commercial' *or as* acta iure gestionis*,\"* and further that *\"the entry into or breach of a contract by a State organ is... an act of a State for the purposes of article 4*.\"649\n\nReply, \u00b6 315.\n\n701.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that the record clearly establishes that Balochistan acted in its official capacity when it engaged in the conduct described above.650\n\nReply, \u00b6 316.\n\n**b. The Conduct of the BDA Is Attributable to Respondent**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nIn relation to the attribution of the conduct of the BDA, Claimant first submits that the record shows that (i) the GOB was the original party to the CHEJVA and consistently represented itself as such \u2013 to TCCA, to the Pakistani courts and in internal communications; and (ii) the BDA acted under the instructions of the GOB until it was replaced by the MMDD in December 2009.651\n\nReply, \u00b6 318.\n\n703.\n\nClaimant further argues that in any event, the BDA is a State organ for purposes of State responsibility and cites the ILC Commentary to Article 4 pursuant to which the term \"*state organ*\" under international law encompasses \"*all the individual or collective entities which make up the organization of the State and act on its behalf*.\"652 In relation to Respondent's reliance on Article 4(2), Claimant again refers to the ILC Commentary stating that \"*it is not sufficient to refer to internal law for the status of State organs*\" and that \"*internal law will not itself perform the task of classification*.\"653\n\nReply, \u00b6 319.\n\nReply, \u00b6 319.\n\n704.\n\nClaimant also claims that, as the BDA Act clearly shows, the BDA exercises public authority and acts on behalf of the GOB, given that (i) the BDA's function is the \"*promotion of the economic and industrial development of Baluchistan*\"; (ii) almost all of its functions depend on previous approval or directions by the Government; (iii) all of its employees are deemed to be public servants; (iv) its Board members are appointed by the Government and may be removed for failure to comply with any direction received from the Government; and (v) its annual budget requires Government approval.654\n\nReply, \u00b6 320.\n\n705.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that, even if the BDA did not qualify as an organ under ILC Article 4, its conduct would still be attributable to Respondent under ILC Articles 5 and 8, given that Pakistani law \"*empowered*\" the BDA \"*to exercise elements of the governmental authority*\" and the BDA was acting \"*on the instructions of*\" and \"*under the direction or control of*\" the GOB.655 Claimant asserts that: (i) the Chief Minister authorized the BDA to sign the CHEJVA on behalf of Balochistan;656 (ii) during the negotiations of the CHEJVA and its related agreements, the BDA regularly sought and received guidance from the Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary, the Secretary Industries, Commerce and Mining, the Law Department and the Finance Department; and (iii) the GOB repeatedly represented that the BDA was acting on its behalf and, in December 2009, replaced the BDA with the MMDD as the responsible entity for Joint Venture operations, thus acknowledging that the Government was TCCA's true joint venture partner.657\n\nReply, \u00b6 321.\n\n**Exhibit RE-39**, pp. 5, 10.\n\nReply, \u00b6 321.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nRespondent asserts that there are two types of actions that form the basis of Claimant's claims: (a) a contractual breach of the CHEJVA, and (b) a breach of the 2002 BM Rules by the Licensing Authority. Respondent claims that it is not liable for either of them, noting that Claimant does not specify which Federal organ committed those actions.658\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 429-431.\n\n**a. The ILC Articles Do Not Apply to Claimant's Alleged Contract-Based Claims**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nRespondent contends that it is Claimant's case that the conduct of the GOB, or alternatively the BDA, in entering into the CHEJVA is attributable to Pakistan, which in turn creates contractual rights against Pakistan. Respondent argues that Claimant thereby seeks to inappropriately extend the scope of the ILC Articles to purely contractual issues.659 Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* which stated:\n\n\"*Much of Impregilo's argument on this issue rested upon international law principles of state responsibility and attribution. However, a clear distinction exists between the responsibility of a State for the conduct of an entity that violates international law (e.g. a breach of the BIT) and the responsibility of a State for the conduct of an entity that breaches a municipal law contract (i.e. Impregilo's Contract Claims).*\"660\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 375, 376.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 377. *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 April 2005 (\"*Impregilo v. Pakistan*\") [RLA-54], 210.\n\n708.\n\nRespondent notes that the tribunal in that case also referred to the following statement of the *ad hoc* Committee in the case of *Vivendi v. Argentina I Annulment Decision* :\n\n\"[I]*n the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucum\u00e1n, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.*\"661\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 378. *Vivendi v. Argentina I Annulment Decision* [RLA-57], \u00b6 96.\n\n709.\n\nRespondent argues that, for the same reasons, the ILC Articles do not apply to contractual issues arising in the context of treaty claims; in particular, they cannot be invoked to join a third party State to a contract. Respondent refers to the following statement of Professor Crawford:\n\n\"*It is often assumed that because a State organ has entered into a contract, the State is therefore responsible for compliance with the contract. This depends, however, on what is specified in the proper law of the contract. In most cases, it is the individual legal entity that has entered into the contract that is responsible for breach. The rules of attribution have nothing to do with questions of contractual responsibility*.\"662\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 379. J. Crawford, \"Investment Arbitration and the ILC Articles on State Responsibility\", (2010) 25(1) *ICSID Review* 127 (\"*Crawford*\") [RLA-176], p. 134.\n\n710.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant's investment relates to its alleged contract-based rights under the CHEJVA Agreements to which neither Pakistan nor Balochistan is a party; according to Respondent, Claimant cannot invoke such contract-based rights against Respondent as part of its Treaty claim.663\n\nRepondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 381, 383.\n\n**b. Even Under the ILC Articles, the Alleged Violations of the CHEJVA Are Not Attributable to the GOP**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nRespondent submits that the CHEJVA was concluded with the BDA, a statutory entity that is legally distinct from the GOB and the GOP and not a State organ of Balochistan under Pakistani law. Respondent claims that the BDA is not empowered to act, or to enter into agreements, on behalf of the GOB.664 Thus, according to Respondent, the question whether its acts are attributable to Pakistan does not arise.665\n\nRespondent submits that under Article 173 of the Pakistani Constitution, contracts on behalf of Balochistan shall be made in the name of the Governor by those expressly and properly authorized by him to execute them. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 44.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 432\n\n712.\n\nRespondent claims that the BDA is not a State organ under the law of Pakistan and argues that its acts therefore fall outside the scope of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.666 Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania,* which stated that Article 4 applies to acts of \"*de jure organs which have been expressly entitled to act for the State within the limits of their competence*\" and held that for \"*legal entities separate from the Respondent, it is not possible to regard them as de jure organs*.\"667\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 435.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 433. *Noble Ventures, Inc. v Romania*, Case No ARB/01/11, Award of 12 October 2005 (\"*Noble Ventures v. Romania*\") [RLA-75].\n\n713.\n\nRespondent submits that the BDA does not have legal capacity to act for the State of Pakistan, and refers to the Supreme Court judgment stating:\n\n*\"It is clear that CHEJVA was made between BDA and BHP alone for all practical purposes, and not between GOB through BDA and BHP.\"668*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 434.\n\n714.\n\nRespondent submits that, rather than Article 4, Article 5 of the ILC Articles is relevant in the present case as it sets out the circumstances in which the acts of State entities which are not State organs can be attributed to the State.669 Article 5 provides:\n\n*\"The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acing in that capacity in the particular instance.\"670*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 436.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 437.\n\n715.\n\nRespondent submits that the following two requirements have to be met in order for the BDA's acts to be attributable to the State of Pakistan: (i) the BDA must be empowered by Pakistani law to exercise elements of governmental authority; and (ii) the BDA must be acting in that capacity in the particular instance.671\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 438.\n\n716.\n\nRespondent argues that those requirements are not met because the BDA does not exercise governmental authority on behalf of either Pakistan or Balochistan as a matter of Pakistani law. In addition, Respondent claims that in this particular case, the BDA was a partner in a joint venture agreement, *i.e.*, a commercial transaction.672\n\nCounter-Memorial. \u00b6 440.\n\n717.\n\nRespondent further contends that, even if the GOB was a party to the CHEJVA, the GOP was not and Claimant has not shown how the acts of the GOP have interfered with the CHEJVA.673 Respondent quotes Professor Mayer, who states:\n\n\"*As regards contracts concluded by the sovereign State as such (State contracts in the strict sense) the applicable principles are those of contract or procedural law...; when the contract is concluded by a separate entity, the applicable principles are those for extra-contractual liability*.\"674\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 441, 442.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 442 [without citation].\n\n718.\n\nRespondent submits that Article 12 of the Harvard Articles, which it claims to be \"*the most comprehensive attempt at codifying this issue*,\" draws the same distinction and, in case of a contract with a State entity, provides for one of the following additional requirements: (i) \"*a clear and discriminatory departure from the proper law of the contract*\"; (ii) \"*an unreasonable departure from the principles recognized by the principal legal systems of the world as applicable to such contracts*\"; or (iii) \"*a violation by the State of a treaty*.\"675\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 443.\n\n719.\n\nRespondent claims that, in order for Pakistan to incur international responsibility in the present case where the contract was concluded with the BDA as a separate entity, the \"*traditional test*\" for internationally wrongful conduct set out in Article 12 must be applied.676\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 446.\n\n720.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that even if it were assumed that the GOB was a party to the CHEJVA, it would not have acted as a governmental authority but only in its commercial capacity; thus, any breach of contract could not amount to a Treaty violation.677\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 447.\n\n**c. The Alleged Breaches of the 2002 BM Rules Are Not Attributable to the GOP**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n721.\n\nIn relation to the acts of the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD, Respondent submits that, pursuant to Annex B of the Treaty, the attribution of acts to the GOP is governed by the provisions of the Treaty, the provisions of any agreement between the parties and Pakistani law. Respondent argues that, while the Treaty itself does not contain any provision on this issue, Pakistani law clearly provides that the GOP is not responsible for the conduct of its provinces, as Balochistan can sue and be sued in its own name.678\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 449-450.\n\n722.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant cannot escape the risk allocation provided for in the CHEJVA by laying blame on the Licensing Authority for \"*acts attributable to the Respondent State as a sovereign*\"; rather, it must establish that the conduct of its contracting partner and the Licensing Authority was in violation of both the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules and, in addition, that this amounted to a violation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty.679\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 451.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n723.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that it is not for this Tribunal to make a determination on whether Claimant has any contractual claims against Respondent, but the Tribunal's jurisdiction is rather limited to the assessment of whether the conduct of Respondent (or any conduct that is attributable to Respondent) amounts to a violation of its obligation under the Treaty and thus under international law. Even though some of these actions may well be relevant to both Claimant's contractual claims and its claims arising under the Treaty, this does not mean that, irrespective of the context in which the actions are analyzed, there is a uniform answer as to the applicable rules of attribution.\n\n724.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, because this Tribunal will assess whether any conduct of Respondent gives rise to liability under the Treaty and thus under international law, it is the customary international law of attribution, as reflected in the ILC Articles, that applies in determining which conduct is attributable to Respondent.\n\n**a. The Conduct of Government Officials**\n------------------------------------------\n\n725.\n\nFirst of all, it is undisputed that the conduct of Federal officials and of the Supreme Court is attributable to Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\n\n726.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the same must apply to the conduct of the GOB and its provincial officials because a Federal State may not use its internal organization to escape liability under international law. The Tribunal notes that this corresponds to what is expressed in the final part of Article 4(1) (\"*whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State*\") and in the Commentary to Article 4:\n\n\"[t]*he principle in article 4 applies equally to organs of the central government and those of regional or local units. This principle has long been recognized. \u2026 It does not matter for this purpose whether the territorial unit in question is a component unit of a federal State or a specific autonomous area, and it is equally irrelevant whether the internal law of the State in question gives the federal parliament power to compel the component unit to abide by the State's international obligations. \u2026 That rule has since been consistently applied.*\"680\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B. INT'L L. COMM'N (2001), VOL. II, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2); annex to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, as corrected by document A/56/49(Vol. I)/Corr.4, Article 4 (\"ILC Articles\") [CA-1], Commentary to Article 4, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n727.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the ILC Commentary that this principle is justified because, even if the component units, *i.e.*, in this case the provinces, have a separate legal personality under domestic law, they do not have a separate international legal personality and they do not have the power to enter into international treaties.681 If this principle were not applied, it would be impossible to make the conduct of provincial units subject to international obligations, which would in turn discourage investments in areas that are governed by provincial law and/or in which investors have to deal with provincial authorities. It is clear that this cannot have been the intent of either the Contracting Parties in concluding the Treaty or the authors of the ILC Articles.\n\nILC Articles [CA-1], Commentary to Article 4, \u00b6 10.\n\n728.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of the GOB and its officials is attributable to Respondent despite the fact that under Pakistani law, Balochistan can sue and be sued in its own name. As to Respondent's reference to Annex B of the Treaty, pursuant to which a tribunal shall apply the domestic law of the host State, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that this Annex applies only in case neither Contracting Party is party to the ICSID Convention at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration (Article 13(2)(c) of the Treaty) and therefore does not support Respondent's position in the present case.682\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 13 and Annex B.\n\n729.\n\nIn light of the fact that the Licensing Authority, the Secretary of the MMDD and further Government officials of the GOB on whose assurances Claimant relies in these proceedings thus qualify as State organs within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, their conduct is to be considered an act of Respondent. Pursuant to Article 7, this applies regardless of whether any of those State organs exceeded their authority or contravened instructions.683 Pursuant to the Commentary on Article 4, it is further \"*irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as* 'commercial' *or as* acta iure gestionis.\"684 Therefore, acts of the GOB and its officials are attributable to Respondent even if they were carried out in performance of the CHEJVA rather than in an executive function.\n\nILC Articles [CA-1], Article 7.\n\nILC Articles [CA-1], Commentary to Article 4, \u00b6 6.\n\n**b. The Conduct of the BDA**\n-----------------------------\n\n730.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has to determine whether the conduct of the BDA can be attributed to Respondent as well. In the Tribunal's view, there is no need to decide whether the BDA as an autonomous legal entity is a State organ under Article 4, if its conduct is in any event attributable to Respondent under Article 5 or Article 8.\n\n731.\n\nAccording to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the conduct of an entity that does not qualify as a State organ under Article 4 is nevertheless considered an act of the State, if (i) it is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority; and (ii) it is acting in that capacity in the particular instance. At this stage, the Tribunal considers it relevant whether the GOB was party to the CHEJVA because, if that were indeed the case, it would be clear that the BDA was empowered to exercise governmental authority and acted in that capacity in representing the GOB, in particular on the Joint Venture's Operating Committee, until December 2009.\n\n732.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the question whether the GOB or the BDA itself was party to the CHEJVA was analyzed by both the Supreme Court and the ICC Tribunal. In its 2013 judgment, the Supreme Court considered it \"*clear that CHEJVA was made between BDA and BHP alone for all practical purposes, and not between GOB through BDA and BHP*\" and stated that the BDA Act 1974 does not authorize the BDA to act as an agent of the GOB.685 The ICC Tribunal disagreed in its 2014 Preliminary Rulings with the view of the Supreme Court and, after having analyzed the relevant provisions of the Pakistani Constitution, the 1976 Rules of Business and the BDA Act 1974 as well as the language used in the CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement, concluded that the BDA was authorized to enter into the CHEJVA on behalf of the GOB, *i.e.*, with the result that the GOB became a party to the CHEJVA in 1993, as confirmed by the 2000 Addendum.686\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 73.\n\nICC Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 344-369.\n\n733.\n\nWhile this Tribunal will of course give due consideration to the findings of the Supreme Court, the Tribunal does not consider itself bound by them in the context of its analysis of whether the actions of the BDA can be attributed to Respondent under international law. The Tribunal will therefore give the same due consideration to the findings of the ICC Tribunal and will form its own judgment as to whether the GOB became a party to the CHEJVA in 1993 or by means of the 2000 Addendum.\n\n734.\n\nBoth the Supreme Court and the ICC Tribunal referred to Articles 173(3) and 139(2) of the Pakistani Constitution.687 Article 173(3) of the Constitution provides:\n\n\"*All contracts made in the exercise of the executive authority of the Federation or of a Province shall be expressed to be made in the name of the President or, as the case may be, the Governor of the Province, and all such contracts and all assurances of property made in the exercise of that authority shall be executed on behalf of the President or Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may direct or authorize.*\"688\n\nExhibit RE-18, \u00b6 69; ICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 347-349.\n\n**Exhibit RE-16**, Article 173(3).\n\n735.\n\nArticle 139(2) of the Constitution reads:\n\n\"*The* [Provincial Government] *shall by rules specify the manner in which orders and instruments made and executive actions* [in the name of the Governor] *shall be authenticated, and the validity of any order or instrument so authenticated shall not be questioned in any court on the ground that it was not made or executed by the Governor*.\"689\n\n**Exhibit RE-16**, Article 139(2). As of 2010, the words in brackets replaced the former words \"*Governor*\" and \"*in his name*.\" As of 2010, Article 139 further contains a third paragraph pursuant to which \"[t]*he Provincial Government shall also make rules for the allocation and transaction of its business.*\"*See* **Exhibit RE-16**, Article 139(3) notes 1, 2 and 3 on p. 73.\n\n736.\n\nThe ICC Tribunal further agreed with the Supreme Court that Balochistan implemented Article 139(2) of the Constitution by enacting the 1976 Rules of Business, of which rule 7 is of particular relevance in the present case. However, while the Supreme Court referred to the requirements of both rules 7(2) and 7(3),690 the ICC Tribunal distinguished between the requirements for orders and instruments in rule 7(2) and those for contracts in rule 7(3) and considered that only the latter had to be satisfied in the present case.691 Rule 7 is entitled \"*Orders and instruments, agreements and contracts*\" and provides:\n\n\"*(1) As provided for in the Constitution, all executive action of Government shall be expressed in the name of the Governor.*\n\n*(2) Save in cases where an officer has been specifically empowered to sign an order or instrument of Government, every such order or instrument shall be signed by the Secretary*[,] *the Additional Secretary, the Joint Secretary, the Deputy Secretary or the Section Officer to the Government in the department concerned and such signature shall be deemed to be the proper authentication of such order or instrument.*\n\n*(3) Instructions for the making of contracts on behalf of the Governor and the execution of such contracts and all assurances of property shall be issued by the Law Department.*\"692\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 69.\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 354-357. However, the ICC Tribunal further held that even if the requirements of rule 7(2) were applicable, they would be satisfied as well. ICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6 363.\n\n**Exhibit RE-20**, rule 7.\n\n737.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Supreme Court's judgment does not contain any reasoning as to the applicability of rules 7(2) and/or (3) of the 1976 Business Rules to the conclusion of the CHEJVA; the ICC Tribunal on the other hand held that rule 7(2) of the 1976 Business Rules applies only to instruments and orders and considered that, in the context of Article 139 of the Constitution, these terms refer to legislative and quasi legislative acts but not to contracts. As to rule 7(3), the ICC Tribunal noted that no specific instructions had been issued for the execution for the CHEJVA but considered it sufficient that it had been \"*vetted*\" by the Law Department.693\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 354-358.\n\n738.\n\nWith regard to the CHEJVA itself, the Supreme Court relied on the wording of the title page694 and in particular the reference to approvals from the GOP and/or GOB to be sought under Clause 2.1 of the CHEJVA,695 which, in its view, made clear that the GOB was an \"*entit* [y]*outside the ambit of* 'Part[y]'\" under the CHEJVA.696 The ICC Tribunal on the other hand referred to the wording on the opening page of the CHEJVA697 and the authorization of the Chairman by the Additional Chief Secretary, the Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister.698 In addition, the ICC Tribunal noted that the Law Department had vetted the CHEJVA before its execution and had further considered it unnecessary in 1999 to clarify the role of the BDA as agent of the GOB by an addendum.699\n\n\"*AGREEMENT FOR CHAGAI HILLS EXPLORATION JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND BHP MINERALS INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION INC*.\" **Exhibit CE-1**, p. 1..\n\n\"*This Agreement shall be conditional upon the Parties receiving from the Federal Government and/or the Provincial Government (as the case may be) within six (6) months of the date of this Agreement or such other period as the parties may agree: (i) all consents and approvals necessary under Pakistani law; and (ii) all assurances as to fiscal parameters for investments in any future Mining Venture which either of the Parties may have need for*.\" **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 2.1.\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 69.\n\n\"*THIS AGREEMENT is made the 29th day of July, 1993 between the GOVERNOR OF BALOCHISTAN, THROUGH THE CHAIRMAN, BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY a statutory corporation of Balochistan Province \u2026 AND BHP MINERALS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION INC. \u2026*.\" **Exhibit CE-1**, p. 4.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibits CE-308** and **RE-39**.\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 364-366. *Cf*. **Exhibits CE-309** and **RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 33.\n\n739.\n\nAs to the 2000 Addendum, the Supreme Court reasoned that the assumption of the parties involved that the GOB was made party to the CHEJVA was a mistake of fact because this would have required \"*an affirming signature under the hand of a duly authorized representative or agent of GOB in terms of Rule 7*.\"700 According to the Supreme Court, the signature of the Chairman of the BDA under the 2000 Addendum did not fulfill this requirement because the authorization letter from the Governor was \"*not printed on the Governor's letterhead, carrie*[d] *no date, notification number, nor* [was] *it addressed to any office or authority or even stamped. Neither* [was] *there any supporting documentation, nor* [did] *the letter provide a reference to a decision of the Cabinet on the matter*.\"701 The ICC Tribunal held that the 2000 Addendum confirmed that the GOB was party to the CHEJVA and referred to the authorization letter as having been sent by the Principal Secretary to the Chairman on 27 December 1999; in addition, the ICC Tribunal emphasized that the Law Department had returned the 2000 Addendum \"*duly vetted*.\"702\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 71.\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6 367. *Cf*. **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 52-55.\n\n740.\n\nThe Supreme Court further held that that GOB could not have validly appointed the BDA or its Chairman as its agent because rule 7 required that the agreement would be executed through the respective department and signed by the Secretary, Additional Secretary, etc. of that department, whereas the BDA was not a department but a separate legal entity.703 By contrast, the ICC Tribunal noted that the BDA was authorized under the BDA Act 1974 to enter into joint venture contracts (as recognized by the Supreme Court) and further that, while it was not expressly authorized to act as agent of the GOB, the BDA Act gave the BDA broad powers to carry out the purposes of the Act.704 Therefore, the ICC Tribunal considered that there was no legal basis for Balochistan's argument that the GOB could not authorize a legal person such as the BDA to act on its behalf. Finally, the ICC Tribunal held that even if rule 7(2) were to be applied, the Chairman of the BDA also qualified as an \"*officer*\" under the 1976 Business Rules.705\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6 88.\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 360-361. The ICC Tribunal referred to section 17(6) of the BDA Act 1974 pursuant to which the BDA \"*may participate in joint ventures with the private sector in regard to* [projects for mineral exploitation and development including establishment of mineral-based industries]\" and further to section 18(1) according to which the BDA \"*may take such measures and exercise such powers as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act*\" and section 16(2) providing that the BDA \"*shall perform such other duties and functions as Government may, from time to time, assign to it.*\" **Exhibit RE-42**, sections 17(6), 18(1) and 16(2).\n\nICC Preliminary Rulings, \u00b6 363. In this regard, the ICC Tribunal relied on Schedule IV of the 1976 Business Rules, which refers in item (iv) to \"*officers shown in Schedule III*,\" which in turn refers in item 14(i) to \"[a]*ll appointments under statutory bodies which are required to be made or approved by Government*,\" and section 5(3) of the BDA Act 1974 pursuant to which \"*Government shall appoint one of the Directors to be the Chairman of the Board, who shall be the chief executive of the Authority*.\" **Exhibits RE-20**, Schedules IV and III, and **RE-42**, section 5(3).\n\n741.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with the ICC Tribunal that there is no support in the BDA Act 1974 or the 1976 Business Rules for Respondent's argument that the GOB could not have validly authorized the BDA, *i.e.*, a separate legal entity rather than a department of the GOB itself, as its agent. In addition, the Tribunal considers it established that the GOB did in fact authorize the Chairman of the BDA in July 1993 to enter into the CHEJVA on its behalf.706 Given that the Law Department further vetted the CHEJVA before it was executed on 29 July 1993,707 the requirements under both rules 7(2) and (3) were fulfilled so that it is not necessary to decide on whether they both apply to the execution of contracts. In conclusion, this Tribunal therefore agrees with the conclusion of the ICC Tribunal that the BDA was authorized to sign the CHEJVA on behalf of the GOB and that, as a result, the GOB was a party to the CHEJVA as of 1993.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibits CE-308** and **RE-39**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-309**.\n\n742.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that, even if there had been an authorization issue that prevented the GOB from becoming a party in 1993, it would have become a party in any event by means of the 2000 Addendum, which was concluded to \"*clarify the role of the BDA under the JVA as agent of the GOB and the scope of its authority to act on behalf of the GOB*.\" In addition, the GOB confirmed and ratified \"*all past actions, matters and things done by the BDA in connection with the JVA.*\"708 Even though the 2000 Addendum was again signed by the Chairman of the BDA on behalf of the GOB, this time the Chairman was expressly authorized by the Governor to sign the Addendum on behalf of the GOB.709\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Recital B.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 53 (numbered as p. 38).\n\n743.\n\nWhile Respondent initially maintained the position of the Supreme Court that the authorization letter from the Governor was improper because it was unsigned and was not prepared on the Governor's letterhead, it was clarified during the Hearing that the letter was attached to an official communication, which has also been submitted to the Tribunal in the present proceedings.710 During the Hearing, Respondent rather argued that the Governor did not have the power to bind the GOB under the 1976 Rules of Business and claimed that \"[t]*hat's something which is in the hands of the Cabinet and the Chief Minister and authorized officials*.\"711 The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument because rule 7(1) expressly states that contracts shall be executed in the name of the Governor and there is no indication that the Governor himself did not have the power to authorize a third party to act on his behalf.\n\nThe accompanying communication, dated 23 December 1999, is prepared on the letterhead \"*GOVERNOR'S SECRETARIAT BALOCHISTAN*\" and references the Subject \"*ADDENDUM NO. 1 TO THE THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BDA AND BHP*.\" It is signed by the Principal Secretary and states: \"*The Governor Balochistan has been pleased to approve and sign the authorization letter allowing the Chairman, Balochistan Development Authority to sign the subject addendum on behalf of the Government of Balochistan. The original authorization letter along with the summary is returned for taking further necessary action please.*\" **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, p. 52 (numbered as p. 37). *See* Transcript (Day 8), p. 2098.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p 2419 lines 18-20.\n\n744.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that Respondent stated during the Hearing that from October 1999 through November 2002, the Governor of Balochistan ruled under martial law so that during the relevant time period in which the authorization letter and the 2000 Addendum were signed, \"*there was no Chief Minister and no Parliament. There was only a Governor.*\"712 Thus, if one were to follow Respondent's argument, there would have been no official at the time who could have validly bound the GOB.713 In light of these particular circumstances, the Tribunal considers it sufficient for the purposes of rule 7 of the 1976 Business Rules that the Governor himself signed the authorization letter and, apparently, authorized his Principal Secretary to deliver it to the Chairman of the BDA on his behalf.714\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 272 lines 6-14.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's further statement during the Hearing: \"*Now, there was a procedure under which the Governor can act, but it wasn't followed in this case, and he can only act where there has been a decision of the Cabinet or the Chief Minister and he's implementing that decision. And there was no Cabinet or Chief Minister for him to implement their decision.*\" Transcript (Day 2), p. 274 lines 14-19.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit RE-58(VI)(an)**, pp. 52-53 (numbered as pp. 37-38).\n\n745.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that contemporaneous documents establish that at the time the GOB itself considered that it was a party to the CHEJVA. In particular, the GOB decided to replace the BDA as representative on the Operating Committee by the MMDD on 12 December 2009.715 If the BDA itself had been party to the CHEJVA, the GOB would not have had any authority to replace it with the MMDD; therefore, this decision clearly demonstrates that the GOB considered the BDA to be an agent that could be replaced. The 24 December 2009 Working Paper prepared by the MMDD further expressly states that BHP entered into the CHEJVA with the GOB \"*through B.D.A.*\" and repeatedly refers to the GOB's 25% equity share in the Joint Venture.716 These documents strongly indicates that the GOB itself was of the view at the time that the BDA had acted as its representative under the CHEJVA until December 2009 when the BDA was replaced by the MMDD.\n\n**Exhibit CE-163**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-62**, pp. 2-3.\n\n746.\n\nIn light of the fact that the BDA acted as agent of the GOB in connection with the CHEJVA, it was clearly empowered to exercise governmental authority and also acted in that capacity, in particular when it represented the GOB on the Operating Committee. The conduct of the BDA is thus attributable to Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.\n\n747.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the actions of all provincial agencies and departments and in particular of the BDA can be attributed to Balochistan and in turn to Respondent. The Tribunal will rely on this finding in its further analysis and consider all of these actions as acts of Respondent.\n\n**C. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 3(2) OF THE TREATY?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nClaimant claims that the following conduct constitutes a violation of the fair and equitable treatment (sometimes referred to as \" **FET**\") obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty: (i) the denial of the Mining Lease Application; (ii) the development and implementation of the plan to take over the Reko Diq project; and (iii) together with the foregoing breaches, other Government conduct, including the conduct during the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme Court proceedings which, according to Claimant, constitutes an overall course of action that is a composite breach of Article 3(2).717\n\nClaimant's letter dated 18 November 2014. *See* \u00b6 174 above.\n\n749.\n\nIn its analysis, the Tribunal will first determine the precise scope of the FET standard under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. As a second step, the Tribunal will assess whether this particular standard has been breached by Respondent's actions, insofar as they are established by the record.\n\n**1. The Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment Protection under Article 3(2) of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"*Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own territory to investments*.\"718\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**. Art. 3(2).\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n751.\n\nClaimant submits that the obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty to provide fair and equitable treatment constitutes an autonomous requirement, which, contrary to Respondent's allegation, is not confined to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law as embodied in the 1926 case of *Neer v. Mexico*.719\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20.\n\n**i. The Scope of the Autonomous FET Standard Under Article 3(2)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n752.\n\nClaimant submits that there are several inter-related principles embodied within an FET obligation, which set a standard for the host State's conduct towards the investor. According to Claimant, these principles include: (a) protection of the reasonable legitimate expectations of foreign investors; (b) conduct in good faith; (c) procedural propriety and due process; (d) non-discrimination; and (e) no arbitrariness in decision-making.720 Claimant claims that a host State's failure to conform to *any* of these principles may result in a breach of the FET standard.721\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 394.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 394; Reply, \u00b6 337.\n\n**(a) Protection of Reasonable Legitimate Expectations**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n753.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the \"*dominant*\" element of these principles is the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations.722 Claimant refers to what it claims is \"*a widely-accepted formulation*\" of the standard in the case of *Tecmed v. Mexico* :\n\n\"[The fair and equitable treatment obligation] *requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations*.\"723\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 395; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 25.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 25. *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

Czech Republic,* which Respondent relies on in this regard, agreed with the *Tecmed* tribunal that the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations is the \"*dominant element*\" of FET.724 Claimant further notes that the article from Professor Muchlinski, which Respondent also relies on, refers to the standard set out in *Tecmed* as a \"*now reasonably well settled*\" proposition, without citing any other authority.725 Claimant also asserts that Respondent adopted the application of the legitimate expectations standard in its Closing.726\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26. *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v.

Czech Republic*, which stated that an investor is entitled to \"*rely on* [the State's] *legal framework as well as on representations and undertakings made by the host state including those in legislation, treaties, decrees, licenses and contracts.*\"730\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 398 quoting *Azurix Corp. v Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award of 14 July 2006 (\"*Azurix*\") [CA-6], \u00b6 398.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 399. *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic* [CA-41], \u00b6 285.\n\n758.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that contractual commitments may form part of the investor's legitimate expectations and relies on the case of *Bayindir v. Pakistan* in which the tribunal stated that, even in a case where the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on breaches of the contract itself, \"*the Tribunal must nevertheless take into account the terms of the* [c]*ontract as a factual element reflecting the expectations of Claimant*.\"731\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 399. *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v.

Pakistan*\") [CA-55], \u00b6 197.\n\n**(b) Conduct in Good Faith**\n-----------------------------\n\n759.\n\nClaimant further submits that the FET standard is breached in case the State fails to act in good faith and thereby affects the investment.732 Claimant again relies on the case of *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic* in which the tribunal stated that the obligation to act in good faith may be breached by \"*the use of legal instruments for purposes other than those for which they created*\" as well as by \"*a conspiracy by state organs to inflict damage upon or to defeat the investment, the termination of the investment for reasons other than the one put forth by the government, and expulsion of an investment based on local favouritism*\" and by \"[r]*eliance by a government on its internal structures to excuse non-compliance with contractual obligations*.\"733\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 400.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 402-403. *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic* [CA-41], \u00b6 300.\n\n760.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that, while a violation of the good faith principle results in a breach of the FET obligation, the former is not a necessary element of the latter; according to Claimant, even if the minimum standard of treatment were to be applied, the FET standard may also be violated without the State acting in subjective bad faith,.734\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 404; Reply, \u00b6 338; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23.\n\n**(c) Procedural Propriety and Due Process**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n761.\n\nClaimant further states that a denial of fair and equitable treatment may result from \"*an absence of fair procedure or a finding of serious procedural shortcomings,*\" such as defects in an administrative process (*e.g.*, absence of transparency and candor) and defects in judicial proceedings (*e.g.,* undue influence of State political initiatives, unreasoned and arbitrary judicial decision).735\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 405 referring to *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic* [CA-41], \u00b6\u00b6 289-292.\n\n762.\n\nClaimant argues that due process requires \"*an actual and substantive legal procedure,*\" which provides the investor with \"*basic legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute*\" and grants the investor \"*a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard*.\"736\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 406 quoting from *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006 (\"*ADC v. Hungary*\") [CA-61], \u00b6 435.\n\n**(d) Non-Discrimination**\n--------------------------\n\n763.\n\nClaimant submits that a State further breaches its FET obligation if it engages in discriminatory treatment.737 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* which held that \"*differential treatment of a foreign investor*... *must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the foreign-owned investment.*\"738\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 407.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 407. *Saluka v. Czech Republic* [CA- 44], \u00b6 307.\n\n764.\n\nClaimant also notes that pursuant to the Preamble of the Treaty, Pakistan and Australia concluded the Treaty to promote investment relations in accordance with \"*internationally accepted principles\";* according to Claimant, this includes the principle of \"*non-discrimination*.\"739\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 409. **Exhibit CE-4**, Preamble.\n\n**(e) No Arbitrariness in Decision-Making**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n765.\n\nFinally, Claimant states that the host State breaches the FET standard if it treats the foreign investment in an arbitrary manner, which has been found to be the case when a measure is \"*not founded on reason or fact, nor on the law,*... *but on mere fear reflecting national preference*\"740 or when there is \"*a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.*\"741\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of 3 September 2001 (\"*Lauder v.

The Standard under Article 3(2) Is Not Limited to the Minimum Standard of Treatment under Customary International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n766.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's contention that fair and equitable treatment is \"*generally understood to impose* [an] 'international minimum standard'\" of treatment under customary international law and Respondent's conclusion that its treatment of TCCA's investment may violate Article 3(2) of the Treaty only if it \"*amount*[ed] *to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency*.\"742\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 327, 328.\n\n767.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent's contention that the Treaty imposes the minimum standard of treatment is contrary to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention pursuant to which a treaty must be interpreted \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.*\"743\n\nReply, \u00b6 329. Vienna Convention [CA-141].\n\n768.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's argument is not supported by the text of Article 3(2) and notes that, unlike the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\"), which is at issue in the cases of *Glamis Gold* and *Waste Management* that Respondent relies on, the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not link the FET standard to the minimum standard under customary international law.744\n\nReply, \u00b6 329; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 21.\n\n769.\n\nClaimant submits that the tribunal in *Inmaris v. Ukraine* had to interpret a provision similar to Article 3(2) and concluded that, in the absence of any language \"*in the BIT that limits* [the FET provision] *to the standard required by customary international law,*... *the Tribunal interprets the language as written*,\" so that \"[a]*ny government act that is unfair or inequitable with respect to a covered investment breaches that obligation*.\"745\n\nReply, \u00b6 329. *Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH and others v.

The respective treaty provision states: \"*Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its respective laws. **It shall in any case accord investments fair and equitable treatment.***\" Reply, note 99 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n770.\n\nClaimant further asserts that Respondent's argument is not supported by the context of Article 3(2) or the object and purpose of the Treaty. In particular, Claimant claims that the \"*internationally accepted principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence*\" that Respondent refers to in the Preamble to the Treaty cannot be read as indicating an intent to limit the FET obligation to the minimum standard of treatment.746 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, which held that \"*the reference to principles of international law supports a **broader reading** that invites consideration of a **wider range** of international law principles than the minimum standard alone*.\"747\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 330, 331; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22.\n\nReply, \u00b6 331. *Vivendi v. Argentina II* [CA-52], \u00b6 7.4.7 (emphasis added by Claimant). The tribunal in that case had to construe a provision requiring \"*fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law.*\"\n\n771.\n\nClaimant maintains that the FET standard has \"*an autonomous meaning*\" that \"*is not to be assimilated to the lesser minimum standard of treatment under customary international law*.\"748 Claimant again refers to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, which quoted a statement from Dr. F.A. Mann:\n\n\"[t]*he terms* 'fair and equitable treatment' *envisage conduct which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and implied independently and autonomously.*\"749\n\nReply, \u00b6 333 citing *OKO Pankki Oyi and others v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6, Award of 19 November 2007 (\"*OKO v. Estonia* Award\") [CA-145].\n\nReply, \u00b6 334. *Vivendi v. Argentina II* [CA-52], \u00b6 7.4.9.\n\n772.\n\nClaimant further argues that the UNCTAD survey on practice regarding the fair and equitable treatment obligation, which Respondent relies on, distinguishes between \"*formulations of the FET standard*\" that are \"*linked to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law*,\" such as NAFTA, and those treaties which impose an FET obligation \"*without any reference to international law or any further criteria*,\" such as the Treaty in this case. Claimant submits that the survey describes the latter as imposing an \"*unqualified, autonomous or self-standing FET standard*.\"750\n\nReply, \u00b6 335. *UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements. Fair and Equitable Treatment* (United Nations 2012) (\"UNCTAD Series FET\"), [RLA-85], pp. 17-18, 23.\n\n773.\n\nFinally, in relation to Respondent's reliance on the 1926 case of *Neer v. Mexico*, Claimant claims that the minimum standard of treatment has evolved significantly since that decision and argues that, even if the minimum standard were to be applied, it would not be the standard of 1926 but rather the one existing under customary law today.751\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**i. The Standard of Article 3(2) Is Equivalent to the Minimum Standard of Treatment under Customary International Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n774.\n\nRespondent submits that Article 3(2) of the Treaty is \"*no ordinary* 'fair and equitable treatment' *provision,*\" as it has to be read with the preceding Article 3(1), which together provide:\n\n*\"1. Each Party shall encourage and promote investments in its territory by investors of the other Party and shall, **in accordance with its laws and investment policies** applicable from time to time, admit investments.*\n\n*2. Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own territory to Investments.\"752*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 455-456 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n775.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Article 3(2) of the Treaty is equivalent to the minimum standard for the treatment of aliens under customary international law.753\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41.\n\n776.\n\nRespondent submits that the requirement to treat investments in a fair and equitable manner as set out in Article 3(2) is generally understood to impose an \"*international minimum standard.*\" According to Respondent, this standard is breached only if \"*based on the totality of the circumstances of the case, the Government would have acted in such a manner that every reasonable and impartial man or woman would recognise its insufficiency.*\"754\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 533.\n\n777.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's interpretation of Article 3(2) would \"*inappropriately limit*[] *the exercise of sovereign regulatory authority and discretion*,\" as illustrated by Claimant's allegation of a \"*myriad of violations*\" of \"*stability*,\" \"*transparency*,\"*legitimate expectations*,\" \"*procedural propriety*,\" \"*consistency*\" and \"*good faith*.\"755\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 534, 535.\n\n778.\n\nRespondent submits that in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the FET obligation of the Treaty has to be interpreted \"*in light of* [the Treaty's] *object and purpose*.\"756 According to Respondent, the object and purpose of the Treaty are contained in the Preamble, which states that \"*investment relations should be promoted and economic co-operation strengthened in accordance with **internationally accepted principles** of mutual respect for sovereignty*.\"757 Respondent argues that, unlike other treaties, the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not solely aim at promoting and protecting investment, but rather at \"*promoting the flow of capital for economic activity and development*.\"758\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 537.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 537; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 42.\n\n779.\n\nRespondent argues that, in light of the contextual guidance provided by the Preamble, the provisions of the Treaty, including the FET obligation under Article 3(2), should be interpreted in accordance with standards set by international law.759 Respondent refers to the Notes and Comments to Article 1 of the OECD Draft Convention in which the Committee responsible for the Draft stated:\n\n\"*The phrase* 'fair and equitable treatment'*, customary in relevant bilateral agreements, indicates the standard set by international law for the treatment due by each State with regard to the property of foreign nationals.... **The standard required conforms in effect to the*** **'minimum standard'** ***which forms part of customary international law***.\"760\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 538.

OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property (1967) (\"OECD Draft Convention\") [RLA-90], p. 333 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n780.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the \"*authoritative articulation*\" of the FET standard as \"*the functional equivalent*\" of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law has been provided by the tribunal in *Neer v. Mexico* :\n\n\"[t]*he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency*.\"761\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 540. *L.

Mexico*\") [RLA-91], p. 556.\n\n781.\n\nRespondent contends that the *Neer* tribunal set forth a very high threshold that has been adopted by subsequent tribunals and still remains applicable today; according to Respondent, it is the appropriate standard for compliance with Article 3(2).762\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 541, 545; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 43.\n\n782.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v. USA,* which held that in order to constitute a breach of the FET obligation:\n\n\"[a]*n act must be sufficiently egregious and shocking* \u2013 *a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons* \u2013 *so as to fall below accepted international standards and constitute a breach.*\"763\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 541. *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, NAFTA (UNCITRAL), Award dated 8 June 2009 (\"*Glamis Gold v.

Estonia* :\n\n\"*Acts that would violate this minimum standard would include acts showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith.*\"764\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 542. *Alex Genin et al. v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID CaseNo. ARB/99/2, Award of 25 June 2001 (\"*Genin v. Estonia*\") [RLA-93], \u00b6 367.\n\n784.\n\nRespondent claims that the circumstances in *Genin v. Estonia* were similar to the present case. The tribunal stated that the Estonian Central Bank's decision to revoke a license \"*invites criticism*,\" in particular, the reasoning in the notice was \"*formalistic*\" and did not fully express all the \"*not unsound*\" reasons underlying its decision. The tribunal found that \"*ample grounds existed for the action taken*\" by the Bank and, despite the poor form of and non-exhaustive reasons in the revocation decision, such matters \"*do*[] *not rise to the level of a violation of any provision of the BIT.*\"765\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44. *Genin v. Estonia* [RLA-93], \u00b6 367.\n\n785.\n\nRespondent also cites the interpretation given by the tribunal in *Lauder v. Czech Republic* : \"*Fair and equitable treatment is related to the traditional standard of due diligence and provides a* 'minimum international standard which forms part of customary international law'.\"766\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 543. *Lauder v. Czech Republic* [CA-62], Respondent notes that the tribunal in that case quoted from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [RLA-94], \u00b6 292..\n\n786.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to the case of *El Paso v Argentina* in which the tribunal was of the view that:\n\n\"*the position according to which FET is equivalent to the international minimum standard is more in line with the evolution of investment law and international law and with the identical role assigned to FET and to the international minimum standard.*\"767\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 544. *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15 Award of 31 October 2011 (\"*El Paso v Argentina*\") [RLA-115], \u00b6 336.\u00b6\n\n**ii. Even If Considered a Self-Standing Standard, the Threshold for Breach of the FET Obligation Would Be Higher Than Alleged by Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n787.\n\nRespondent contends that even if the Tribunal were to follow Claimant's interpretation of Article 3(2) as a self-standing FET standard that is not connected to the international minimum standard, the standard would be stricter than alleged by Claimant.768\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 45.\n\n788.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's reliance on the articulation of the FET standard in *Tecmed v. Mexico*, Respondent submits that this articulation has been criticized in scholarship and has also been \"*heavily qualified*\" by subsequent case law. Respondent cites the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, which stated in relation to the *Tecmed v. Mexico* standard: \"[I]*f their terms were to be taken too literally, they would impose upon host States obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic.*\"769\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 391-393. *Saluka v. Czech Republic* [CA-44], \u00b6 304.\n\n789.\n\nRespondent further contends that other tribunals have imposed limitations on the standard focusing on the extent to which the frustration of an investor's expectations may constitute a breach of the FET obligation.770 Respondent submits that there are five relevant limitations:771 (a) the reasonableness and legitimacy of an investor's expectations must not be assessed in isolation, but rather in the context of all the surrounding circumstances; (b) the expectations must be based on a representation made by the State specifically to the investor regarding specific commitments, or a representation or rule that is not specifically addressed to a particular investor but which was made with a specific aim to induce foreign investments and on which the foreign investor relied; (c) the representation must be \"*crucial for the investment decision*\"; (d) the expectations must be balanced against legitimate regulatory goals of the host State; and (e) the investor's conduct must be taken into account.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 394.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 395, 399-402.\n\n**(a) Reasonableness and Legitimacy of the Expectations**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nWith regard to the first limitation, Respondent contends that, as the general factor, reasonableness is a key aspect both in terms of the investor's expectations and the host State's conduct.772\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 52.\n\n791.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the extent to which the expectations of the investor are reasonable and legitimate must be considered in the context of all the surrounding circumstances. Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* which stated that:\n\n\"*the **assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances**, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the **political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State**.*\"773\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 395. *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award of 18 August 2008 (\"*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*\") [CA-49], \u00b6 340 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n792.\n\nRespondent further asserts that if the relevant conduct of the host State is reasonable in all the circumstances (and thus to be expected), no liability under the FET standard can arise. Respondent argues that there can thus be no breach of Article 3(2) if the rejection of the Mining Lease Application by the Licensing Authority was not unreasonable.774\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52.\n\n793.\n\nRespondent submits that investors must also take into consideration the level of development and administrative standards in the host State; they have to conduct their own due diligence and may not rely on the terms of an investment treaty if they failed to do so.775\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 396. Respondent relies on the case of *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* in which the tribunal considered it natural that prospects of greater profit come along with greater risks, including risks in the regulatory sphere. *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003 (\"*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*\") [RLA-105], \u00b6 20.37. Respondent also refers to the tribunal in *Parkerings v. Lithuania,* which held that in case of a State in political transition, an investor may not legitimately expect that the legislative regime would remain unchanged. *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award of 11 September 2007 (\"*Parkerings v. Lithuania*\") [RLA-180], \u00b6\u00b6 335-336. Respondent further relies on the case of *Genin v. Estonia* in which the tribunal took into account the fact that the claimants had knowingly chosen to invest in \"*a renascent independent state, coming rapidly to grips with the reality of modern financial, commercial and banking practices and the emergence of state institutions responsible for overseeing and regulating areas of activity perhaps previously unknown*\" and held that such a State cannot be expected to regulate perfectly or consistently. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 397; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 51. *Genin v. Estonia* [RLA-93], \u00b6 348.\n\n794.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimant's focus on \"*whether its own (subjective) expectations were frustrated*\" is misconceived and refers to the statement of the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania* :\n\n*\"Legitimate expectations cannot be solely the subjective expectations of the investor. They must be examined as the expectations at the time the investment is made, as they may be deduced from all the circumstances of the case, due regard being paid to the host State's power to regulate its economic life in the public interest.*\"776\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 398. *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award of 8 October 2009 (\"*EDF v. Romania*\") [CA-136].\n\n795.\n\nRespondent argues that the hopes and wishes of an investor do not form the basis of the State's liability under Article 3(2); to the contrary, Respondent considers the concept of \"*legitimate expectations*\" to be a \"*jurisprudential construct*\" designed to assist in deciding whether the FET obligation was breached. Respondent asserts that there is no freestanding obligation to respect such expectations and also emphasizes that not all expectations can be considered \"*legitimate*.\"777\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n**(b) Specific Representation Made by the State**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n796.\n\nAs to the second limitation, Respondent contends that a legitimate expectation must be based either on a representation made by the State specifically to the investor regarding specific commitments or on a representation or rule which was not specifically addressed to a particular investor but which was made with a specific aim to induce foreign investments and on which the investor relied.778\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 399. Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Methanex v. United States,* which held that Methanex had not been given any representations by the United States that it could reasonably have relied on in its expectation that the impugned regulatory changes would not occur. *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America* NAFTA Arbitral Tribunal, Final Award of 3 August 2005 (\"*Methanex v. USA* \") [RLA-107], \u00b6 IV.D.5.7.\n\n797.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that assurances or representations from the Government can form the basis of legitimate expectations, but argues that they must have \"*a certain grade of precision.*\" Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic*, which rejected an FET claim that was based on assurances and representations from the host Government because they did \"*not exhibit the level of specificity to generate legitimate expectations.*\"779\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. b. *Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic* [CA-41], \u00b6 468.\n\n798.\n\nRespondent further acknowledges that the legal and regulatory framework may form the basis of legitimate expectations, but argues that this is subject to the following qualifications: (i) investors take the law of the host State as they find it; and (ii) the framework must contain some specific basis for a legitimate expectation. Respondent refers to the *EDF v. Romania* tribunal, which stated:\n\n\"*Except where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.*\"780\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit.c. *EDF v. Romania* [CA-136], \u00b6 217.\n\n**(c) \"*****Crucial for the Investment Decision*****\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n799.\n\nIn relation to the third limitation, *i.e.*, that the representation must be \"*crucial for the investment decision*,\" Respondent refers in particular to the frequent allegation of investors that they legitimately expected that their contract would be properly performed by the State and relies on the tribunal's finding in *Parkerings v. Lithuania* that \"*not every hope amounts to an expectation under international law.*... [C]*ontracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do not amount to expectations as understood in international law.*\"781 Respondent further refers to the case of *Hamester v. Ghana* in which the tribunal stated that \"*it is not sufficient for a claimant to invoke contractual rights that have allegedly been infringed to sustain a claim for a violation of the FET standard.*\"782\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 400. *Parkerings v.

Czech Republic:*\n\n\"*In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable, the host State's legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.*... *The determination of a breach of* [the FET standard] *by the Czech Republic therefore requires a weighing of the Claimant's legitimate and reasonable expectations on the one hand and the Respondent's legitimate regulatory interests on the other.*\"784\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 401.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 401. *Saluka v Czech Republic* [CA-44], \u00b6\u00b6 304-308.\n\n**(e) The Investor's Conduct**\n------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nFinally, with regard to the last limitation, Respondent submits that the Tribunal must take into consideration whether Claimant has satisfied the following three duties set out by Professor Muchlinski:\n\n\"[A] *duty to refrain from unconscionable conduct, a duty to engage in the investment in light of an adequate knowledge of its risks, and a duty to conduct its investment in a reasonable manner.*\"785\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 402. Muchlinski [RLA-183], p. 530.\n\n802.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that bilateral investment treaties \"*are not insurance policies against bad business judgments.*\"786\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 402, quoting *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 October 1999 (\"*Maffezini v. Spain*\") [RLA-130], \u00b6 64.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n803.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Treaty provides that \"[e]*ach Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own territory to investments.*\"787 The dispute between the Parties as to the applicable FET standard relates primarily to the question whether this provision refers to the minimum standard under customary international law or whether it rather contains an autonomous standard, as it has been developed by case law on similar provisions.\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 3(2).\n\n**i. The Minimum Standard under Customary International Law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal will interpret the FET obligation of Respondent pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, *i.e.*, \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose*.\"788 First of all, the Tribunal notes that Article 3(2) of the Treaty does not contain any (express) reference to the minimum standard or even to principles of international law. Therefore, Respondent's interpretation would reflect the ordinary meaning of this provision only if it can be established that the Contracting Parties considered that the words \"*fair and equitable treatment*\" in themselves imply a reference to the minimum standard.\n\nVienna Convention [CA-141], Article 31(1).\n\n805.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is no indication that this was indeed the case, in particular taking into account that there are examples of FET provisions in which the Contracting States expressly included a reference to the minimum standard. For example, Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA provides that \"[e]*ach party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security*.\"789\n\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement [CA-142], Article 1105(1).\n\n806.\n\nThe UNCTAD Report of 2007 on trends in investment rulemaking from 1995-2006, *i.e.*, covering the time period in which the Australia-Pakistan BIT was concluded in 1998, confirms that the level of protection agreed on by the various contracting States differed during that time. The Report distinguishes between seven groups of FET standards: (i) standards that do not make any reference to international law or any other criteria to determine their content; (ii) standards that link fair and equitable treatment to a treatment no less favorable than that accorded to the host State's own investors or investors of third States; (iii) standards that combine FET with a duty to abstain from impairing the investment through unreasonable or discriminatory measures; (iv) standards that link FET to the principles of international law; (v) standards that likewise link FET to the principles of international law but additionally include broad examples of which conduct qualifies as a violation of the FET standard; (vi) standards that make FET contingent on the domestic legislation of the host State; and (vii) standards that explicitly refer to the minimum standard of customary international law.790\n\nUNCTAD Report 2007 [RLA-94], pp. 28-33.\n\n807.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 3(2) of the Treaty forms part of the first group of standards that do not make any reference to international law or any criteria pursuant to which their content shall be determined. While the UNCTAD Report states that the specific content of these provisions remains open and has to be determined on a case-by-case basis, the Tribunal is of the view that the comparison to the other groups of standards set out by the Report demonstrates that contracting States that intended to limit the FET standard in their treaty to the minimum standard had means to express such intent through clarifying language. As a result, the Tribunal considers the absence of any reference to international law in Article 3(2) as a strong indication that the Contracting Parties did not intend to limit the FET standard contained therein to the minimum standard.\n\n808.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this indication is not rebutted by the context and/or the object and purpose of the Treaty as expressed in its Preamble. Respondent relies in particular on the second recital pursuant to which \"*investment relations should be promoted and economic co-operation strengthened in accordance with the internationally accepted principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence*.\"791 However, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that this reference to \"*internationally accepted principles*\" indicates an intent of the Contracting Parties to limit the FET standard to the minimum standard.\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Preamble.\n\n809.\n\nFirst, most of the international principles referred to in the recital (\"*sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence*\") do not concern what is understood as the minimum standard under customary international law. Second, the immediate context of Article 3(2) shows that, where the Contracting Parties indeed intended to qualify an obligation, they did so through express language. Article 3(1), which contains an obligation to encourage and promote investments, includes the qualifier \"*in accordance with its laws and investment policies*.\"792 Similarly, Article 3(3), which sets out an obligation to accord protection and security, is qualified by the words \"*subject to its laws*.\"793\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 3(1).\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 3(3).\n\n810.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that the context and the object and purpose of the Treaty in fact confirm that, in the absence of any qualifier in Article 3(2), there is no indication that the Contracting Parties intended to limit the FET standard to the minimum standard under customary international law, but it rather appears that they intended to agree on an autonomous standard, as it has been developed in case law.\n\n**ii. The Autonomous FET Standard as Developed by Case Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nWhat, then, is the content of this autonomous FET standard? In the Tribunal's view, a dominant principle of the FET standard is the protection of the investor's legitimate, investment-backed expectations. The Parties both accept this obligation, although Respondent emphasizes that the concept of legitimate expectations does not simply correspond to any subjective hopes of the investor, but is rather qualified by objective requirements, such as reasonableness, existence of specific representations made by the State, causality for the investment decision, balance of interests and the investor's conduct. Claimant agrees that expectations deserve protection only if they are reasonable and does not expressly dispute the other qualifiers.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties and the case law they rely on that the protection of legitimate expectations is an important element of the FET standard. In the Tribunal's view, the term \"*legitimate*\" further embodies the concept that the expectations must be reasonable, *i.e.*, based on assurances that are attributable to Respondent and that an investor acting reasonably would have relied on in making its investment decision. The Tribunal further considers that the concept of \"*legitimate expectations*\" includes an assessment of all circumstances of the individual case. As part of this analysis, the Tribunal will take into account these further criteria set out by the Parties, such as (i) whether Respondent's conduct was justified by a legitimate purpose or whether it was rather arbitrary and/or discriminatory; (ii) whether Respondent accorded Claimant procedural propriety and due process in the course of its decision-making process; and\n\n(iii) whether Claimant conducted its investment in a reasonable manner.\n\n813.\n\nIn the following analysis of whether Article 3(2) has been breached, the Tribunal will first determine whether and to what extent Respondent's actions created a legitimate expectation on the part of Claimant that it would be entitled to mine Reko Diq. As a second step, the Tribunal will assess whether the actions referred to in Claimant's 18 November 2014 letter breached such legitimate expectations.794\n\n*See* \u00b6 174 above.\n\n**2. Did Respondent Create a Legitimate Expectation That Claimant Would Be Entitled to Mine Reko Diq?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n814.\n\nClaimant submits that over a period of more than fifteen years, both Pakistan and Balochistan repeatedly affirmed in contracts, laws, communications, official statements, meetings, court submissions and court rulings that TCC \u2013 BHP's successor as of 2006 \u2013 would receive a mining lease for Reko Diq, once TCC had successfully completed its exploration and feasibility work and submitted an application and feasibility study meeting \"*routine Government requirements*.\"795 Claimant contends that these affirmations that TCCA reasonably relied on when it invested more than US$ 240 million in exploration and feasibility activities in the Reko Diq area created a legitimate expectation that, after having successfully completed the work, it would be granted a Mining Lease over Reko Diq.796\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 412; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 348.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 413.\n\n815.\n\nClaimant refers to two \"*basic expectations*\" that it considers to be legitimate under the circumstances:\n\n(i) TCCA would have \"*security of tenure,*\" meaning that if it did its work and succeeded in proving a viable mine, it would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease; and\n\n(ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate TCCA's investment.797\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n816.\n\nClaimant claims that TCCA's expectations were fostered by three categories of Government assurances: (i) Balochistan's specific representations in the CHEJVA and related agreements; (ii) representations made through the federal and the provincial regulatory framework; and (iii) specific assurances made by both Governments at \"*critical junctures*.\"798 Claimant claims that in its Closing Respondent did not dispute, *as a matter of law*, that these three categories of assurances could give rise to legitimate expectations.799\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30.\n\n**i. Assurances Under the CHEJVA and Related Agreements**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nClaimant submits that Balochistan assured TCC under the CHEJVA, specifically its Clause 11.8.2, that it had the \"*right to mine Reko Diq,*\" once TCC had successfully completed its exploration and development activities. Article 11.8.2 provides that TCC \"shall be entitled *to convert the relevant* [Exploration] *Licence(s) held by it into Mining* [Leases] *so as to give secure title over the required Mining Area*,\" subject only to \"*compliance with routine Government requirements*.\"800 According to Claimant, this provision specifically provided for security of tenure.801\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 414. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.8.2 (emphasis added by Claimant). Reply, \u00b6 343.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 31.\n\n818.\n\nClaimant further submits that pursuant to Clauses 7.2(a), 10.3 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA, Balochistan undertook to assist TCC by providing \"*appropriate administrative support*\" in obtaining all requisite licenses and permits, including the mining lease, and performing \"*all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of* [the CHEJVA].\"802\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 415. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 7.2(a), 10.3 and 24.6.3. *See also* Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 31 referring to Clauses 24.6.1 and 24.6.2.\n\n819.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Balochistan repeatedly affirmed the validity of the CHEJVA and the \"*finders-keepers*\" principle embodied in Clause 11.8.2. Claimant refers in particular to:803\n\n(i) the 2000 Addendum to the CHEJVA by which Balochistan \"*acknowledge*[d] *and agree*[d] *that the Agreement is in full force and effect*\";804\n\n(ii) the 23 June 2000 Deed of Waiver in which Balochistan agreed that \"*all the provisions of the* [CHEJVA] *remain in full force and effect*\";805\n\n(iii) the 2006 Novation Agreement in which Balochistan agreed that TCCA \"*shall enjoy all rights and benefits accorded to BHP*[] *under the* [CHE] *JVA*,\" and assured that it would \"*observe the terms and conditions of the* [CHE] *JVA which are on its part required to be observed*\";806\n\n(iv) Balochistan's 2007 submissions to the Balochistan High Court in which it \"*specifically denied that the CHE* [JVA] w *as in any manner illegal*,\" and the statement of Balochistan's Advocate General at the hearing before the Court that \"*the Government of Balochistan has rightly entered into CHEJVA and it is in the best interest of the people of Balochistan that* [the Joint Venture's] *project should continue*\";807\n\n(v) the 26 June 2007 judgment of the Balochistan High Court, which states that \"*it can be safely held that CHEJVA has been executed legally and the interest of the people of Balochistan has been very well taken care of*\";808 and\n\n(vi) Balochistan's 11 December 2010 submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court in which it stated that the CHEJVA was \"*made in accordance with the existing laws / rules*\" and \"*is not illegal*.\"809\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 416.\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Clause 4.1. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 344.\n\n**Exhibit CE-194**, Clause 6.\n\n**Exhibit CE-3**, Clauses 2(b) and 4(f). *See also* Reply, \u00b6 344.\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, pp. 11, 13; **Exhibit CE-61**, p. 24.\n\n**Exhibit CE-61**, pp. 29-30.\n\n**Exhibit CE-107**, p. 8 lit. d, \u00b6 14.\n\n820.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Balochistan thereby created the legitimate expectation that it would \"*comply with its contractual obligation to grant TCC the Mining Lease*\" once TCC had successfully completed the exploration program at Reko Diq.810\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 417.\n\n821.\n\nIn reference to Respondent's argument that TCCA never received an \"*express assurance*\" from the Government in relation to \"*the specific* [mining area of]... *over 99,453 square kilometres containing at least 14 mineral deposits*\" that it applied for, Claimant emphasizes that it never claimed an \"*automatic right*\" to mine a specific, predetermined area; rather, it claims the right to receive a mining lease upon the submission of an application meeting all applicable requirements, which includes the identification of the area to be covered by the Mining Lease.811\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 361, 362.\n\n822.\n\nClaimant also refers to Respondent's argument that the Mining Area identified in TCCP's Mining Lease Application \"[did] *not match the scope of* [the] [F]*easibility* [S]*tudy*\" and that under Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA, a Participating Party does not have a right to apply for a mining lease in respect of \"*a greater land area than is necessary to encompass all ore resources which may be properly mined as a single mining enterprise*.\" Claimant notes that Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA expressly includes \"*any necessary plan or facilities for the milling and treatment of ore and other appropriate infrastructure*\" in the definition of the \"*Mining Area*.\"812 In Claimant's view, the Mining Area identified in the Feasibility Study and the Mining Lease Application was in full compliance with Clause 11.8.1, as it was large enough for TCCA to efficiently mine several deposits while using the same infrastructure and processing facilities and yet even smaller than contemplated by the CHEJVA.813\n\nReply, \u00b6 365. **Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.8.1.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 365-366.\n\n823.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's argument that TCCA failed to \"*fulfil the condition precedent of acquiring the BDA's interest*\" before TCCP filed its Mining Lease Application, Claimant submits that the language of the CHEJVA and the parties' intent confirm that the acquisition of the non-participating party's interest (pursuant to the process set out in Clause 11.6) is not a condition for the grant of a mining lease, but has to be completed only before the start of any mining project. Claimant notes that Clause 11.4.2 of the CHEJVA provides that \"[w]*here the BDA is a Non-participating Party, then subject both to* [TCCA] *obtaining all routine Government approvals required and to compliance with Clause 11.6*, [TCCA] *shall be entitled to undertake sole risk investment*... *in a mining development within any of the relevant Prospecting Licences*.\"814\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 367-369.\n\n824.\n\nClaimant also refers to Respondent's argument that the CHEJVA and related agreements were invalid under Pakistani law and claims that the question is not whether TCCA now has a valid contractual right to mine, but rather whether TCCA had a legitimate expectation of a right to mine; therefore, even if, contrary to Claimant's position, the Supreme Court's judgment were authoritative as regards the contractual validity of the CHEJVA, it would nevertheless be irrelevant to the analysis whether Respondent has breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty.815\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 32; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 370-371.\n\n825.\n\nClaimant contends that acts or representations will give rise to liability under international law even if they are \"*considered legally nonexistent or null and void or susceptible to invalidation*\" as a matter of domestic law.816 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* which found that, even though the joint venture agreement of the claimant with a state-owned corporation was void *ab initio* (due to the fact that the latter had exceeded its authority when it concluded the agreement), the respondent \"*created a legitimate expectation for Claimant that his investment was, indeed, made in accordance with Georgian law and, in the event of breach, would be entitled to treaty protection,*\" based on \"[t]*he assurances given to Claimant regarding the validity of the JVA* [that] *were endorsed by the Government itself, and some of the most senior officials of Georgia*.\"817\n\nReply, \u00b6 372 quoting *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v.

Georgia* [CA-134], \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\n826.\n\nIn reference to Pakistan's argument that \"*the mere frustration of contractual expectations without something further will not automatically become a legitimate expectation protected under fair and equitable treatment*,\" Claimant acknowledges that a breach of contract does not always give rise to an FET breach but emphasizes that this is due to the fact that a Treaty breach requires sovereign conduct; it does not preclude a contract from being the foundation of legitimate expectations.818\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\n827.\n\nClaimant also refers to Pakistan's allegation that \"*the first time that the contractual right to a mining lease emerged*\" was in TCCs response to Balochistan's Notice of Intent to Reject, filed on 19 October 2011, and submits that: This right was expressly provided for in the CHEJVA; it had been confirmed by Balochistan when it relaxed the 1970 BM Rules to provide the contractor the \"*absolute right*\" to a Mining Lease, subject only to routine Government requirements (Clause 11.8.2); it was expressly reaffirmed when TCCA first began investing in Pakistan in 2000; it formed a part of the due diligence when Barrick and Antofagasta purchased TCCA in 2006; and TCCA again invoked its security of tenure when the Steering Committee considered an alternative proposal from MCC.819 According to Claimant, TCCA's right to security of tenure was recognized by the Governments given that they declined to consider MCC's proposal in order to avoid \"*legal implications.*\"820 Claimant also submits that the MMDD acknowledged in the 24 December 2009 Working Paper for the Balochistan Cabinet that pursuant to the CHEJVA, \"*if a suitable discovery* [was] *made*[,] *the area was to be converted into a Mining Lease,*\"821 and claims that the Planning Commission also recognized that the \"*Government of Balochistan* [was] *legally bound to convert* [TCC's] *Exploration License into long term renewable mining lease*.\"822\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 34 referring to **Exhibits CE-1, CE-187, CE-189, CE-2, CE-70** and **CE-235**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 35. **Exhibit RE-78**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 35. **Exhibit RE-62**.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 35.

Assurances in Provincial and Federal Law**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nClaimant submits that further assurances of Balochistan were contained in the 1994 Relaxations decision and the 2002 BM Rules.823\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 418.\n\n**(a) The 1994 Relaxations**\n----------------------------\n\n829.\n\nClaimant asserts that by granting the 1994 Relaxations, specifically the relaxation of the \"*preferential right*\" provided for in rule 23 of the 1970 BMC Rules, Balochistan undertook to grant TCC a mining lease. Claimant refers to BHP's request that \"*the subjective discretion of the licensing authority*... *must be waived in favour of an absolute right*\" of the license holder \"*to a M*[ining] *L*[ease]*, provided they comply with routine administrative requirements*.\"824 Claimant notes that BHP emphasized that \"[i]*nternational mining companies will view this aspect of a country's mining regulations as one of the most important.*\"825 Given that Balochistan granted the relaxations as requested to enable BHP \"*to carry out its exploration work without any complication,*\" Claimant claims that Balochistan also granted BHP the requested \"*absolute right*\" to a Mining Lease subject only to \"*routine administrative requirements.*\"826 Claimant further notes that in the context of its consent to the transfer of BHP's interest in the Joint Venture to TCC in 2000, Balochistan expressly reaffirmed that the 1994 Relaxations \"*still h*[e]*ld good.*\"827\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 419. **Exhibit CE-187**, p. 7.\n\nReply, \u00b6 346. **Exhibit CE-187**, p. 7.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 72, 420. **Exhibit CE-189**.

Reply, \u00b6 345.\n\n830.\n\nClaimant refers to Respondent's argument that the assurances provided to BHP in the 1994 Relaxations \"*were of no effect*\" after the 2002 BM Rules entered into force and that the 1994 Relaxations could not have given rise to any legitimate expectations of TCCA because, in particular, TCCA had provided \"*an express Undertaking to comply with the regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules.*\"828 Claimant argues that, in the context of the assessing Pakistan's liability under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, it is irrelevant whether the 2002 BM Rules replaced the 1994 Relaxations as a matter of Pakistani law. In Claimant's view, the assurance provided in the 1994 Relaxations, *i.e.*, that BHP would receive a mining lease subject only to \"*routine administrative requirements,*\" created legitimate expectations on the part of BHP and later TCCA that it would be granted the right to mine Reko Diq once it had successfully completed its exploration and feasibility work.829\n\nReply, \u00b6 373.\n\nReply, \u00b6 374.\n\n831.\n\nIn any event, Claimant claims that, even under Pakistani law, the 1994 Relaxations were not affected by the entry into force of the 2002 BM Rules. Claimant asserts that Pakistani courts have repeatedly held that rights that were obtained under rules that were later repealed are protected from impairment through the enactment of new rules.830\n\nReply, \u00b6 375.\n\n832.\n\nAs regards the 2006 Undertaking that Respondent relies on, Claimant notes that it merely states that TCCA \"*shall abide by all other conditions of* [the] *National Mineral Policy read with* [the] *Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002 as approved / amended from time to time*,\" but does not refer to the 1994 Relaxations. According to Claimant, the 2006 Undertaking therefore does not constitute a waiver of the assurances provided in the 1994 Relaxations.831\n\nReply, \u00b6 376. **Exhibit CE-206**.\n\n**(b) The 2002 BM Rules (Implementing the 1995 NMP)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nClaimant submits that under the 2002 BM Rules, specifically its rule 48(1), Balochistan further undertook that \"*where the holder of an exploration license... makes an application for a mining lease... the licensing authority **shall** grant the mining lease*\" subject only to certain requirements set out in rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules that Claimant claims to be \"*routine*.\"832\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 421. **Exhibit CE-5**, Rule 48(1). Reply, \u00b6 341 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n834.\n\nIn Claimant's view, this language, together with rule 45(1) which provides that a mining lease grants the holder a right to mine, contradicts Respondent's contention that the 2002 BM Rules provided TCCA only with a \"*right to apply for a mining lease*,\" but not with a right to mine833\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 340-341.\n\n835.\n\nClaimant submits that the 2002 BM Rules reflected international standards and refers to the foreword pursuant to which Balochistan intended to provide a \"*set of rules internationally competitive*\" that would \"*attract the interest of investors on such matters as transparency, criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of Licenses and Leases, expeditious decision making process, security of tenure, provision of adequate information on mineral titles, independent resolution mechanism etc.*\"834\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 422. **Exhibit RE-1**, p. 7.

Reply, \u00b6 349.\n\n836.\n\nClaimant further emphasizes that the 2002 BM Rules implemented the 1995 NMP, which provided in Article 8.6.2 that \"[t]*he Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an application for the grant of an ML. Where the Licensing Authority considers that the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for assessment and grant of an ML, the ML **will be** granted.*\"835\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 422. **Exhibit CE-190**, \u00b6 8.6.2 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n837.\n\nClaimant refers to rules 9(1) and 9(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which Balochistan could conclude agreements which \"*make provision with respect to the grant, renewal, cancellation or transfer of a mineral title*\" to a mining company.836 Claimant states that these provisions implemented the policy directive of the 1995 NMP that Provincial Governments could \"*enter into an agreement with an investor, within the framework of the law*,\" that covered \"*the right of the licensee to obtain a mining lease*.\"837 In Claimant's view, the 2002 BM Rules therefore \"*expressly affirmed*\" that Balochistan's contractual promise under Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA was valid.838\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 423. **Exhibit RE-1**.

Transcript (Day 4), pp. 978-979.\n\n840.\n\nReferring to Respondent's argument that TCCA's conduct in the negotiation of the Mineral Agreement demonstrates its awareness of the fact that it did not have a right to a mining lease under the CHEJVA or the 2002 BM Rules, Claimant contends that, in these negotiations, TCCA was not concerned with the scope of the Licensing Authority's discretion to grant or deny a Mining Lease Application. It had already received assurances that the Mining Lease Application would be approved subject to routine Government requirements.844 According to Claimant, its principal concern in the negotiation of the Mineral Agreement was rather the impact that future amendments to the 2002 BM Rules could have on \"*the certainty and security of tenure required for investment and financing on the scale of Reko Diq*,\" given that rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules provided for the precedence of the 2002 BM Rules over the terms of any mineral agreement.845\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 377, 378.\n\nReply, \u00b6 379 quoting **Exhibit RE-227**, p. 4. Claimant refers to a letter dated 27 October 2008 from its witness Ms. Boggs to the GOB in which she stated: \"*Our interpretation of the BM Rules leads us to conclude that some of the BM Rules are not fully compatible with the stability provisions of the Mineral Agreement, and that any future amendment of the BM Rules would be mandatory and applicable to TCC notwithstanding any stability provisions of the Mineral Agreement.*\" Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44 (emphasis added by Claimant). **Exhibit RE-64**, p. 2.\n\n841.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that it did not attempt to exempt itself from the requirements of rule 48, as it believed that Balochistan would apply this rule \"*objectively, fairly and consistent with its security-of-tenure assurances.*\" It intended rather to ensure that the Mineral Agreement could not be \"*negated by any changes to the BM Rules in the future*.\"846 Claimant submits that TCCP therefore proposed to assure legal certainty either by including a statement in the Mineral Agreement that the agreement would prevail in case of inconsistency, or by amending certain provisions of the 2002 BM Rules \"*to further strengthen security of tenure.*\"847\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 45 quoting **Exhibit CE-227**, p. 4.\n\nReply, \u00b6 379.\n\n842.\n\nContrary to Respondent's arguments, Claimant stresses that its 2006 Undertaking did not alter its expectations, as it was part of the novation of the CHEJVA, which Claimant considers to be a single transaction in which the parties affirmed both the validity of the CHEJVA and the applicability of the 2002 BM Rules. According to Claimant, this demonstrates that the parties did not believe there was any inconsistency between the two.848\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47.\n\n843.\n\nClaimant contests Respondent's allegation that TCC's proposed amendments to the 2002 BM Rules violated the 2006 Undertaking and argues that while the 2002 BM Rules expressly allowed mineral agreements, they made such agreements pointless given that the Province could unilaterally override the agreement by amending the Rules. According to Claimant, the proposed amendments were intended to \"*bring the Rules more closely in line with their express purpose.*\"849\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48.\n\n844.\n\nClaimant also refers to Respondent's reliance on the 1995 NMP requirement that mineral agreements be \"*within the framework of the law*\"850 and notes that, while the 2013 NMP still provides that \"[t]*he Provincial Governments may enter into an agreement with an investor, within the framework of the law*,\" the new policy also states that \"[t]*he mineral agreement would have an overriding effect in case anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules subsequently amended*.\"851 Claimant concludes that a mineral agreement can therefore override certain aspects of the 2002 BM Rules and still be \"*within the framework of the law*.\"852\n\n**Exhibit CE-190**, \u00b6 8.12.1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-416**, \u00b6 7.8.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 50.\n\n845.\n\nClaimant further refers to Respondent's argument that \"*the 2002 BM Rules confer a broad discretion upon the Licensing Authority*\" and asserts that this argument is based on rule 48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that \"[s]*ubject to sub-rules (4) and (5), a mining lease shall not be granted... unless... it is in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease*.\"853\n\nReply, \u00b6 380. **Exhibit R-1**. Rule 48(3)(a)(vi).\n\n846.\n\nClaimant argues that, by entering into the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement and by agreeing that TCCA would receive a mining lease \"*subject only to routine Government requirements,*\" Balochistan already exercised any discretion it may have had pursuant to the 2002 BM Rules. Claimant notes that rule 9(1) specifically authorizes the GOB to \"*enter into an agreement... relating to a mineral title*\" with a party proposing to carry on mineral operations \"*if the Government is satisfied that*... *the carrying on of the undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan.*\"854 In Claimant's view, Balochistan determined that any project would be \"*in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan\"* when it entered into the 2006 Novation Agreement with TCCA.855\n\nReply, \u00b6 381. **Exhibit R-1**. Rule 9(1).\n\nReply, \u00b6 381. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 483.\n\n847.\n\nIn addition, Claimant asserts that Pakistan and Balochistan repeatedly assured TCCA that the project was indeed \"*in the interest of the development of mineral resources of Balochistan*\" and refers to the following occasions:856\n\n(i) January 2006: Pakistan's Prime Minister stated that Pakistan needs foreign investment in order to develop the mining sector, which would boost economic growth and exports of the country;857\n\n(ii) 10 July 2007: Balochistan's Chief Minister stated that the Reko Diq project would play an important role in the development of the Province;858\n\n(iii) 14 July 2007: The Board of Investment stated in a letter to TCC's CEO that it \"*appreciates your endeavours and feels indebted to you for your contribution in the development of Pakistan through your investment in* 'Copper Mining'\";859\n\n(iv) 2007: Balochistan stated before the Balochistan High Court that the constitutional petitions \"*undermin*[ed] *the interest of the Province by* [j]*eopardizing such a profitable project of national importance*\";860\n\n(v) 14 July 2010: The Chairman of the Board of Investment stated that he \"*appreciated the work of* [TCC] *on producing employment to the locals and also*... *attract*[ing] *more investment in mining of other natural resources in the remote province of Pakistan*\";861 and\n\n(vi) 25 October 2010: The Chairman of the Board of Investment stated that \"*foreign investors and companies are encouraged to invest in exploiting the riches of the Balochistan province.*\"862\n\nReply, \u00b6 382.\n\nLuksic, \u00b6 7; **Exhibit CE-318**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-326**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-327**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, pp. 11, 12, 14. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 484.\n\n**Exhibit CE-346**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-351**.\n\n848.\n\nClaimant also refers to the 31 December 2009 note to the Chief Secretary in which the MMDD reported that TCC was providing \"*health, education, sanitation and drinking water facilities to the residents of the nearby villages and communities*\" as well as \"*training to their employees using latest scientific knowledge, technology, equipments and computer softwares to build / enhance the capacity of their employees*\" and that its project would provide \"*8000+ employment opportunities during construction phase while during operation phase it will provide 3000+ direct and about 30,000 indirect employment opportunities*.\"863\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 486 quoting **Exhibit CE-31**, pp. 19, 20.\n\n849.\n\nFinally, Claimant claims that international law and Pakistani law did not permit the Licensing Authority to exercise any remaining discretion in bad faith, in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, or without providing adequate reasoning. Nevertheless, Claimant asserts that the Licensing Authority did not deny the Mining Lease Application because it thought that TCCA's mining project would not be \"*in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan,*\" but because it was implementing the decision of the GOB to *\"oust*\" TCCA from Reko Diq.864\n\nReply, \u00b6 383.\n\n**iii. Direct Affirmations by the Government**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n850.\n\nClaimant submits that Pakistan and Balochistan affirmed the undertakings they had given in the CHEJVA, the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules on various occasions during the time period in which TCC performed its exploration and feasibility work.865 Claimant cites the following examples as \"*express affirmations*\":866\n\n(i) 2007: In its submissions to the Balochistan High Court, Balochistan argued that TCC \"*is entitled to retain the benefit*\" of its mineral discovery, because \"*if this was not so*[,] *then no one would come forward to invest millions of dollars in exploration/prospecting*;\"867\n\n(ii) 26 June 2007: The judgment of the Balochistan High Court upheld the validity of the CHEJVA, stating that mining \"*is a risky business and after exploration by a party when the area is proved, then it becomes his vested right to do mining*;\"868\n\n(iii) 23 January 2009: Pakistan and Balochistan stated in a Working Paper of the Steering Committee that \"[u]*nder the Balochistan Mineral Rules (BMR) 2002, the license holder is **legally entitled*** **[to the]** ***conversion of prospecting license into mining lease**, once the area is proved and certain laid down requirements under the rules are fulfilled by the licensee.

Claimant refers, *inter alia*, to:871\n\n(i) Balochistan's consistent encouragement of its joint venture partner TCC to carry on with its exploration activities and the preparation of a feasibility study, e.g., at the 26 October 2007 OC meeting in which Balochistan agreed that TCC \"*should move immediately to commence and complete* [a] *feasibility study*\";872\n\n(ii) Balochistan's renewal of Exploration License EL-5 in 2005, and again in 2008;873\n\n(iii) Balochistan's granting of all permits that TCC required for its exploration activities;874\n\n(iv) the active engagement by both Pakistan and Balochistan in the Mineral Agreement negotiations, which included fiscal incentives and stabilization provisions; and\n\n(v) Balochistan's engagement in the Project Agreement negotiations regarding the future joint mining venture with TCC.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 425; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 350-352.\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-5**.\n\nLivesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 34-45.\n\n852.\n\nClaimant further contends that there were \"*numerous assurances provided directly to representatives of TCC and its corporate parents by Federal and Provincial officials at the highest levels.*\" Claimant cites as examples:875\n\n(i) January 2006: Pakistan's Prime Minister assured Mr. Luksic, Antofagasta's Chairman, that the GOP would work to facilitate TCCA's investment, and recommended that TCCA enter into a Mineral Agreement with the Governments.876\n\n(ii) April 2006: Pakistan's President assured Mr. Luksic that TCCA's investment in the Reko Diq project would have \"*the full protection of the Government*.\"877\n\n(iii) 13 July 2010: Balochistan's Chief Minister and Chief Secretary assured a delegation of TCCA and Barrick executives, including Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs, that the Government wanted *\"to develop the Reko diq project exclusively with TCC, and not with any third parties.*\"878\n\n(iv) 14 July 2010: According to a Government press release, Pakistan's Prime Minister assured the same delegation \"*that the Federal Government has discussed and decided in principle to fully support the consortium and expects the project would be launched at the earliest*.\"879 According to the newspaper *Daily Times*, Pakistan's Finance Secretary stated after the meeting, that he would extend \"*full assurance of cooperation to the* [TCC and Barrick delegation] *for their success in* [the] *Reko Diq Project*.\"880\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 353, 354.\n\nLuksic, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\nLuksic, \u00b6 13. *See also* **Exhibits CE-317** and **CE-318**.\n\nBoggs I, \u00b6 87. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 237.\n\n**Exhibit CE-95**, p. 1. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 238; Boggs I, \u00b6 88.\n\n**Exhibit CE-246***. See also* Memorial, \u00b6 239.\n\n853.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's argument that the officials of the GOP exceeded their powers when they provided assurances regarding Balochistan's disposal of mineral titles to TCC, Claimant claims that Pakistan is liable for the conduct of all its organs and officials under international law; thus, it is irrelevant for the purposes of determining Pakistan's liability under Article 3(2) of the Treaty whether these officials were authorized to provide such assurances under domestic law.881\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 359-360.\n\n854.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that, contrary to Respondent's allegations, TCC did not rely on general statements, but rather on \"*specific representations made by high-level officials of both Governments in face-to-face meetings with leaders of major international companies on the verge of investing hundreds of millions of dollars*.\" Claimant argues that such meetings were not intended to discuss details, but rather an opportunity to receive assurance directly from the Governments that they would provide the required support for TCCA's project. Claimant further states that these representations were made at \"*critical moments*,\"*i.e.*, prior to the initial investment decision and each further infusion of capital, following rumors of a takeover and proposals of other investors like MCC and, similarly, before the Feasibility Study was delivered and the Mining Lease Application was filed.882\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 56.\n\n855.\n\nClaimant claims that it was deliberately led to believe that the Governments were supporting the proposed mining venture and refers to Chief Minister Raisani's assurance that the press reports about the takeover decision were inaccurate even though he had presided over the meeting of the Balochistan Cabinet in which this decision was taken.883\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 55.\n\n856.\n\nIn addition to these specific representations, Claimant argues that the fact that Balochistan supported and facilitated the Joint Venture for many years gave rise to a legitimate expectation that it would continue to do so and fulfill its contractual obligations. Claimant refers in particular to Balochistan's approval of the shift in focus to the Western Porphyries, which gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the Government would not later deny the Mining Lease on the grounds that TCCA had done precisely what had been approved.884\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 57.\n\n**iv. TCCA Relied on These Assurances**\n---------------------------------------\n\n857.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that, in reliance on the assurances given by Pakistan and Balochistan, TCCA spent more than US$ 240 million on the Reko Diq project and thereby \"*transformed a barren strip of land into one of the world's largest copper-gold deposits.*\"885 Claimant claims that it relied on the Governments' assurances specifically when making the following decisions:886\n\n(i) 2000 to 2005: investment of over US$ 23 million in the exploration of Reko Diq and the preparation of a scoping and draft feasibility study on the Tanjeel deposit;887\n\n(ii) October 2002: entry into the Alliance Agreement with BHP in order to assume BHP's obligations under the CHEJVA and to step into the Joint Venture;888\n\n(iii) mid-2006 to end of 2007: investment of over US$ 45 million in expanded drilling and work on the Scoping Study;889\n\n(iv) 2008 and 2009: investment of an additional US$ 150 million in work on the Pre-Feasibility Study and the Feasibility Study for initial mine development at the Western Porphyries and the Expansion Study for Tanjeel and further satellite deposits;890 and\n\n(v) 2010: investment of an additional US$ 22 million in work to finalize the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Study.891\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 426; Reply, \u00b6 356.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 427.\n\n**Exhibit CE-56**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-198**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-65**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-65**, p. 2; **Exhibit CE-82**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-110**, p. 2.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nRespondent submits that no legitimate expectation of a \"*right to mine*\" Reko Diq could arise from the so-called \"*assurances*\" and, in fact, any conduct of the Governments because (i) Respondent cannot be bound by any alleged representations arising out of the CHEJVA and related agreements; (ii) the CHEJVA does not confer a right to a mining lease on Claimant; (iii) there were no representations reducing the \"*routine Government requirements*\" referred to in the CHEJVA to \"*mere administrative niceties*\"; and (iv) none of the alleged \"*assurances*\" could be construed as \"*trumping*\" the 2002 BM Rules.892\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 405; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 131.\n\n**i. Respondent Cannot Be Bound by Expectations Arising Out of the CHEJVA and Related Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n859.\n\nRespondent submits that it was not a party to the CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum or the 2006 Novation Agreement and refers to the Supreme Court's finding that the GOB was also not a party to the CHEJVA, which was rather \"*made between BDA and BHP alone for all practical purposes, and not between GO*[B] *through BDA and BHP*.\"893 In Respondent's view, it cannot be bound by an expectation that arises from an agreement to which it was not a party; therefore, the CHEJVA and related agreements could not have given rise to any legitimate expectations.894\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 406-408. **Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 410.\n\n860.\n\nRespondent further contends that pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment, the CHEJVA, and consequently also the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement, were illegal and void *ab initio*, with the result that the Joint Venture ceased to exist and could not be the holder of any rights under Exploration License EL-5. Respondent asserts that the same applies to the 1994 Relaxations, which the Supreme Court held were illegal under rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules.895\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 411.\n\n861.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant's argument that the Supreme Court's holding is irrelevant in the context of the assessment whether the Governments' assurances gave rise to legitimate expectations. Respondent contests Claimant's submission that liability under international law *will* arise even if the acts or representations are considered illegal as a matter of domestic law, but acknowledges that in such cases liability *may* nevertheless arise. Respondent notes that in the present case, it was the Supreme Court (and not a court of first instance) which made the finding of voidness and illegality, and Claimant has not raised a claim for denial of justice with regard to the substance of the decision.896\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 412.\n\n**ii. The CHEJVA Does Not Confer a Right to Mine on Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n862.\n\nRespondent contends that the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement *per se* could not give rise to any legitimate expectations and refers to the tribunal in *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, which stated \"*contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do not amount to expectations as understood in international law*\" and to the tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana*, which held that \"*it is not sufficient for a claim to invoke contractual rights that have allegedly been infringed to sustain a claim for a violation of the FET standard.*\"897\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. a. *Parkerings v. Lithuania* [RLA-121], \u00b6 344; Gustav *Hamester v. Ghana* [RLA-48], \u00b6 337.\n\n863.\n\nRespondent further argues that even if the CHEJVA and related agreements could be a source of legitimate expectations, the only expectation that Claimant could have had in this case was that it would need to fulfil \"*routine Government requirements*\" before it would be granted a Mining Lease*.* According to Respondent, this is \"*an important caveat*\" which precludes the agreements, without more, from generating a \"*legitimate expectation*\" sufficient to found a breach of the FET obligation.898\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. a; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 413.\n\n864.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant cannot point to any provision of the CHEJVA stipulating that it would be granted a mining lease or that it would be entitled to mine 99.4 square kilometers of Reko Diq.899 Respondent further argues that if the CHEJVA had in fact given such a right, thereby effectively overriding and circumventing the provisions of the licensing regime, it would have been invalid pursuant to section 23 of the Pakistan Contract Act 1872.900\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 135.\n\n865.\n\nRespondent also refers to Article 5.2 of the CHEJVA pursuant to which Claimant did not even have the right to conduct exploration activities without obtaining a license from the Licensing Authority; much less did it have the right to mine.901 Similarly, Respondent argues that Article 11.8.2, which Claimant primarily relies on, did not entail a right to mine and refers to the preamble to the CHEJVA in which the parties stated their intention to \"*enter into a joint venture for the purpose of conducting exploration for and, **if warranted**, developing any Mineral deposits within the Exploration Area.*\"902\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138. **Exhibit CE-1**. Preamble (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n866.\n\nRespondent submits that the text of Article 11.8.2, as well as the context in which it is located, confirms that the CHEJVA granted only a right to apply for a mining lease, subject to the satisfaction of \"*routine Government requirements,*\"*i.e.*, those under the 2002 BM Rules, and further contractual preconditions, but did not guarantee a \"*right to mine.*\"903 Respondent argues that Article 11.8.2 refers to the standing of the Joint Venture or the sole Participating Party to apply for a mining lease, but does not contain a promise by the BDA (or Balochistan) to grant a mining lease; in Respondent's view, it rather clarifies \"*how the relations between the parties will operate in the event the Joint Venture or a Participating Party elects to develop a mine.*\"904\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 418; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 139.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 139.\n\n867.\n\nRespondent claims that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, the word \"*routine*\" does not only entail administrative tasks, but is rather meant to refer to \"*regularly followed procedures*,\" as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary. In Respondent's view, the term demonstrates that Claimant would not receive any special or preferential treatment, but would be subject to the regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules, without any variation or change.905\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 466.\n\n868.\n\nAs to the context of Article 11.8.2, Respondent notes that Article 11 is entitled \"*Decision as to Mine Development*,\" and sets out the procedure for taking a decision to develop a \"*Mining Area*\" in relation to a specific \"*Mineral deposit*.\" Article 11.8.2 in turn refers to a \"*secure title over the required Mining Area*\" and therefore limits the scope of the lease that can be sought to a specific mineral deposit located within the identified \"*Mining Area*.\"906 Respondent argues that Article 11.8.2 thus applies only to a mining lease in respect of the \"*Mining Area*,\"*i.e.*, as defined and limited by the feasibility study.907\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 140-141. Respondent describes this procedure in detail in Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 142-149.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 140. Respondent refers in particular to Article 11.8.1 pursuant to which a \"*Mining Area*\" cannot encompass a space larger than that required for \"*a single mining enterprise*\" as defined in scope by the feasibility study. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\n869.\n\nRespondent contends that a mining lease cannot be validly sought if the procedure set out in Article 11 has not been followed.908 Further, any rights of a single Participating Party under Article 11.8.2 are conditional upon compliance with Article 11.6, *i.e.,* the acquisition of the Non-participating Party's interest, before any mining lease application can be filed.909\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 141.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 152.\n\n870.\n\nRespondent also refers to the broader context of the CHEJVA, *i.e.*, its Articles 12, 17(a) and 5.9, and clauses 5.2-5.4, 5.7 and 13.2-13.3, and argues that those provisions further support Respondent's argument that the CHEJVA did not confer any right to receive a mining lease on Claimant, even if the requirements of Article 11 had been met.910 According to Respondent, however, those requirements were not met in the present case, as the condition precedent set out in Article 11.4.2 (acquisition of Balochistan's interest by TCCP) was never satisfied so that any right under Article 11.8.2 never arose.911\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 153-154.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 156-159.\n\n871.\n\nRespondent claims that the \"*routine Government requirements*\" referred to in Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA are \"*entrenched*\" in the 2002 BM Rules, which Claimant undertook to abide by in its 2006 Undertaking.912 Respondent argues that pursuant to rules 47 and 48, the Licensing Authority is *obliged* to reject mining lease applications unless the application satisfies various objective (*e.g.*, the failure to show that a mine could be \"*profitably developed and operated*\" and the failure to address \"*value addition*\") and subjective requirements (*e.g.*, that the mining lease application is \"*satisfactory*\" and \"*in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan*\").913\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 414. **Exhibit CE-206**.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 414.\n\n872.\n\nIn addition, Respondent refers to rules 9(5) and (6) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provide:\n\n*\"(5) Any provision contained in a mineral agreement which is inconsistent with any provision of these rules or any other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be of no force or effect.*\n\n*(6) Nothing contained in a mineral agreement shall be construed as absolving any party thereto from complying with any requirement laid down by law or from applying for, and obtaining, any licence, approval, permission or other document required by law.914*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 415. **Exhibit RE-1**, rules 9(5) and (6).\n\n873.\n\nRespondent submits that these provisions invalidate any agreement contrary to the 2002 BM Rules, a fact of which Claimant was or should have been aware, as it was part of the legal framework in which Claimant was operating. Respondent concludes that, as a consequence, the CHEJVA could not give rise to a legitimate expectation of a guaranteed right to mine.915\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 415, 416.\n\n**iii. No Representations Were Made That Reduced \"*****Routine Government Requirements*****\" in the CHEJVA to Mere Administrative Niceties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n874.\n\nRespondent contends that, even though Claimant attempts to reduce \"*routine Government requirements*\" to an \"*administrative rubber stamp*,\" the following conduct of Claimant illustrates that it was aware of the fact that any mining lease application would have to comply with the 2002 BM Rules:916\n\n(i) Claimant attempted to obtain a guaranteed right to mine through a Mineral Agreement, which would not have been necessary if it already had such a right under the CHEJVA or if an application to obtain a mining lease under the 2002 BM Rules were a mere formality;\n\n(ii) Claimant's stated reasons for its desire to amend the 2002 BM Rules during the Mineral Agreement negotiations included avoiding any \"*discretionary actions*\" under the 2002 BM Rules, which demonstrates that it was aware that there were discretionary and subjective elements in the 2002 BM Rules that could be used to reject a mining lease application;917\n\n(iii) Claimant gave the Undertaking to abide by the 2002 BM Rules \"*as approved/amended from time to time*,\" which confirms that it regarded the 2002 BM Rules as one of the Government requirements to be complied with; and\n\n(iv) Claimant did not consider that it had a guaranteed \"*right to mine*\" under the CHEJVA; otherwise, it would have referred to that right in the Mining Lease Application.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 418, 419.\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 2.\n\n875.\n\nRespondent further refers to rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides:\n\n*\"(a) A mining lease shall not be granted unless \u2013*\n\n*(i) the feasibility studies show that the mine can be profitably developed;*\n\n*(ii) the proposed plan for development and operation of the mine and the programme of the mining operations of the application will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of mineral resources;*\n\n*(iii) the applicant in question has or can obtain the technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations effectively;*\n\n*(iv) the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the lease;*\n\n*(v) the proposals submitted with the application are satisfactory;*\n\n*(vi) it is in the interests of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease; and*\n\n*(vii) a concrete proposal for value addition for the Ore to be produced/exploited from the applicant's mining ease within the country is submitted, or if the facility is not available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of the province with the prior approval of the Provincial Government;*\n\n*(b) If at the time of the application the applicant in question is in default.\"918*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 420. **Exhibit RE-1**. rule 48(3).\n\n876.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant was aware that a mining lease would not be granted unless its application satisfied *all* of the requirements in rule 48(3). Respondent claims that Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs accepted this during the Hearing, including that it was legitimate for the GOB to desire local smelting/refining and that the Licensing Authority was entitled to take the Governments' value addition objectives into account when deciding whether the Application was satisfactory.919\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67 referring to Transcript (Day 4), p. 822 line 14 to p. 823 line 8 and p. 764 lines 1-6.\n\n877.\n\nAccording to Respondent, rule 48(3) contains \"*significant, mandatory and in some instances subjective Government requirements*\" to be satisfied before a mining lease can be granted.920 Respondent contends that even if the objective criteria were satisfied, the Licensing Authority still had \"*a wide margin of discretion*\" under rule 48(3)(a)(vi) to deny a mining lease which it considered not to be in the \"*interest*\" of Balochistan in terms of \"*the development of its mineral resources*.\" As a result, Respondent claims that an applicant could not maintain that it had an unqualified \"*right*\" to receive an approval of its application.921\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 420. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 68.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 184.\n\n878.\n\nRespondent asserts that TCCP acknowledged this discretion when, in the context of negotiating the Mineral Agreement, it stated that \"[t]*he BMR include a number of powers and discretions that are inconsistent with creating the certainty and security of tenure required for investment and financing on the scale for Reko Diq*\" and therefore proposed to amend the 2002 BM Rules.922\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 186. **Exhibit CE-227**, p. 4. Respondent also refers to the 27 October 2008 letter in which TCCP made specific proposals on how to amend the 2002 BM Rules in order to ensure that the provisions of mineral agreements would take precedence over the Rules. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 187. **Exhibit RE-64**.\n\n879.\n\nRespondent further contends that it is widely known that the 2002 BM Rules confer upon the Licensing Authority broad discretion whether to grant or refuse a mining lease. Respondent refers to the 2003 World Bank report on Pakistan's policy on the development of its mineral sector in which it concluded that \"*provincial rules*\" such as the 2002 BM Rules:\n\n\"*include as a criteria* [sic] *for the grant of a mining lease that it must be* 'in the best interest of the development of the mineral resources of [the province] to grant the lease.' ***This criterion introduces a discretionary element into the procedure for granting mining rights to an investor who has completed a successful exploration program.*****... [I]*****t may be impossible for an applicant to effectively respond to a determination that the development of a particular mine is not in the****best interests of the province. That determination is essentially a political one**.*\"923\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 423 quoting the World Bank Report, Republic of Pakistan, Mineral Sector Development Policy Note, 20 November 2003, p. 22, **Exhibit RE-65** (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n880.\n\nRespondent claims that the 2002 BM Rules reflect the political and socio-economic conditions prevailing in Pakistan and, specifically, Balochistan and argues that Balochistan's power to regulate its economic life in the public interest is clearly expressed in rule 48(3) aiming to enhance the \"*development of the mineral resources of Balochistan*\" and to ensure \"*the efficient, beneficial and timely use of mineral resources.*\"924\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 424.\n\n881.\n\nRespondent also refers to its witness Mr. Khohkar who explained that:\n\n\"[t]*he Licensing Authority's discretion under the BM Rules 2002 is broader than that provided for under the Punjab Mining Rules. We were conscious of the need to ensure that mineral development takes place while keeping in view of* [sic] *unique socio-economic scenario of Balochistan. A quick comparison of Article 48 in each of the Punjab and Balochistan Rules makes it plain that the latter was crafted to maintain greater regulatory discretion for the Balochistan Licensing Authority.\"*925\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 425. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69. Khokhar I, \u00b6 19.\n\n882.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant was aware of the applicable rules when it allegedly invested in Balochistan and argues that it is irrelevant whether Claimant considers it \"*unjust, unfair or inconvenient*\" that such discretion is included in the 2002 BM Rules.926 Respondent emphasizes that the Governments adopted the firm position in all of their statements, and in particular in the Mineral Agreement negotiations, that the 2002 BM Rules would apply in their entirety and that no exemptions would be granted to Claimant's project.927\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 191.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 460, 461, 464. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. b.\n\n883.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant relies on the 1994 Relaxations to argue that it had a guaranteed \"*right to mine,*\" despite the fact that the 2002 BM Rules intentionally did not provide for the power to relax the Rules which existed under rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules.928 Respondent claims that, apart from the fact that they were declared illegal by the Supreme Court, the 1994 Relaxations were of no effect once the 2002 BM Rules had entered into force and, in addition, Claimant provided its 2006 Undertaking to comply with the regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules.929 Respondent also argues that by providing the 2006 Undertaking, Claimant accepted that the Licensing Authority could cancel any mineral title on the basis of any breach of conditions for the transfer of Exploration License EL-5 from BHP to TCCA.930\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 421. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 479.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 486.\n\n884.\n\nIn any event, Respondent argues that the 1994 Relaxations do not support Claimant's position as (a) the notification by which the relaxations were granted did not itself grant BHP any right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease (Claimant's quotes are rather derived from BHP's request); (b) the notification did not \"*vitiate*\" the provisions of the CHEJVA, which contains a provision dealing with changes in legislation in its Article 17; (c) the 1994 Relaxations were no longer applicable under the 2002 BM Rules given that only leases and licenses granted or renewed under the 1970 BMC Rules were saved; and (d) the 1994 Relaxations did not benefit Claimant since they were specifically granted to BHP and lapsed with the introduction of the 2002 BM Rules; in addition, Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA (via the 2006 Novation Agreement) in the knowledge that the grant of all mineral titles would take place pursuant to the 2002 BM Rules and undertook to comply with them, without seeking any relaxations.931\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 480-483.\n\n885.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that Claimant concedes in its Reply, the Feasibility Study \"*and elsewhere*\" that it only had a right to apply for a mining lease pursuant to the CHEJVA, rather than a guaranteed \"*right to mine*.\"932 According to Respondent, Claimant further conceded during the Hearing that it did not receive any assurance from Respondent it would be exempted from the requirements of the 2002 BM Rules when making its Mining Lease Application.933\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 426-428. Respondent quotes Claimant's alleged concession in its Reply at \u00b6 362: Claimant \"*never claimed an automatic right to mine a specific, pre-determined area, but rather the right to receive a mining lease upon the submission of an application that met all applicable requirements*\" and in its Feasibility Study at Ch. 1.8.5, p. 22 (**Exhibit CE-97**): \"*TCCP has the right to apply for the granting of a Mining Lease*\" and Ch. 3.2.1 (**Exhibit RE-60**): \"*A M* [ining] *L* [ease] *will not be granted unless the* [applicable] *conditions are met*.\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. b referring to Transcript (Day 3) p. 665 line 16 to p. 667 line 5 (cross-examination of Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic).\n\n**iv. No Purported \"*****Assurance*****\" Could Have Legitimately Been Construed as Trumping the 2002 BM Rules**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nRespondent claims that Claimant seeks to establish that its alleged expectations in respect of mining in the Reko Diq area \"*trumped*\" the routine, *i.e.*, the usual, application of the Government requirements in the 2002 BM Rules; nevertheless, Respondent maintains that its actions did not give rise to a legitimate expectation of a guaranteed \"*right to mine*.\"934\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 429.\n\n887.\n\nRespondent refers to the \"*mandatory legislative status*\" of the requirements under the 2002 BM Rules and notes that pursuant to rule 9, not even a Mineral Agreement could dispense with these requirements, making it \"*legally impossible*\" to \"*override*\" the 2002 BM Rules. Therefore, Respondent argues that Claimant could not have legitimately relied on purported assurances that these requirements would be waived in relation to Claimant's project. In any event, Respondent emphasizes that it was under no obligation to conclude a Mineral Agreement and that none was ever, in fact, concluded.935\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 430. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 63.\n\n888.\n\nRespondent again quotes the World Bank report of 2003, which referred to a \"*discretionary element*\" in the procedure for granting mining rights to an investor,936 and notes that this was a Joint Policy Note co-authored by the MPNR. In Respondent's view, Claimant could not reasonably have held a legitimate expectation that satisfying these requirements \"*would be a given*\" in light of this contrary representation from the MPNR.937\n\n*See* paragraph 879 above (the criteria for the grant of a mining lease that it must be '*in the best interest of the development of the mineral resources of* [the province] *to grant the lease*' introduces a discretionary element into the procedure for granting mining rights to an investor who has completed a successful exploration program).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 431-432. **Exhibit RE-65**.\n\n889.\n\nIn light of the clear terms of the 2002 BM Rules and the Joint Policy Note of 2003, Respondent claims that Mr. van Borries' expectation as expressed in his presentation to the Supreme Court in 2011 in which he spoke of \"*a certain sense of security*\" that \"*at the end of the day, if* [they] *were successful*, [they] *would have the certainty to be awarded the right to shape a mining-processing business*\" is not realistic.938 Respondent also argues that Mr. van Borries' position is contradicted by Claimant's stated objective during the Mineral Agreement negotiations, *i.e.*, \"*avoidance of damaging discretionary actions.*\"939\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 434. **Exhibit RE-58(ix)(b)**.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 435. **Exhibit RE-64**.\n\n890.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant therefore either failed to notice the obvious subjective requirements in the 2002 BM Rules, which would result from a lack of due diligence, or it knew the potential impact of those requirements and thus the unreasonableness of its expectation.940\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 436.\n\n891.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's reliance on the 1995 NMP, which states that \"[w]*here the Licensing Authority considers that the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for assessment and grant of an ML, the ML will be granted,*\" Respondent argues that this statement does not support Claimant's position on legitimate expectations, but rather reiterates Respondent's point that there was no guaranteed \"*right to mine*\" because a mining lease could only be granted after the Licensing Authority had determined whether the criteria of rule 48(3) have been satisfied.941\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 437. **Exhibit CE-190**.\n\n892.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimant's reliance on the fact that prior to the decision on the Mining Lease Application, Balochistan took some regulatory steps, such as renewing Exploration License EL-5. Respondent argues that such actions could not give rise to a legitimate expectation that Claimant would also receive a mining lease, which would have been an entirely different and much longer-lasting title than EL-5.942\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 437.\n\n893.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's reliance on \"*extended negotiations*\" with Respondent and Balochistan regarding a Project/Shareholders Agreement and the Mineral Agreement, Respondent emphasizes that those negotiations ultimately failed because the parties were not able to agree on critical issues, such as value addition in the form of a smelter/refinery within the country. In Respondent's view, the failure of the negotiations, which Claimant had pursued in order to avoid having to submit a mining lease application, demonstrates that Claimant never had a right to mine.943\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 437.\n\n894.\n\nRespondent further refers to Claimant's reliance on Pakistan's and Balochistan's \"*affirmations*\" made in the proceedings before the Balochistan High Court and the Pakistan Supreme Court and contends that these do not represent or waive the qualification contained in the CHEJVA or the conditions imposed by the 2002 BM Rules.944\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 437. Similarly, Respondent emphasizes that while the 23 January 2009 Working Paper of the Steering Committee, which Claimant relies on, does state that \"[the license holder is] *legally entitled* [to the] *conversion of prospecting license into mining lease*,\" the same sentence qualifies the same statement by adding \"*once the area is proved\" and \"certain laid down requirements under the rules are fulfilled by the licence*.\" **Exhibit CE-69**.\n\n895.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submits that the officials of the GOP whose \"*assurances*\" Claimant relies on had no power to give any assurances in relation to mineral titles, which are within the competence of the Provincial Governments, and contends that Claimant must have been aware of this. Respondent further argues that even if the officials had power to intervene or opine on the grant of mineral titles, their statements do not contain a representation that Claimant would have a right to mine, as they were only \"*general statements*\" encouraging Claimant to invest in Pakistan.945\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 437.\n\n896.\n\nRespondent also claims that there is a \"*lack of specificity*\" in all of the assurances that were allegedly given, as Claimant cannot point to any specific assurance or affirmation that the subjective requirements in rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules would not apply. In Respondent's view, all of the alleged assurances and affirmations are general in nature and \"*non-committal*\"; thus, it is \"*inconceivable*\" that Claimant would rely on them as the basis of its \"*right to mine*.\"946\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 438, 439. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. b and c.\n\n897.\n\nRespondent refers to the case of *Noble Ventures Inc. v. Romania* in which the tribunal found that the claimant could not establish that Romania had breached the FET standard under the applicable US-Romania BIT, as it was clear on the evidence that without the satisfaction of key requirements, the failure of the claimant's project was \"*all too readily foreseeable*.\"947\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 441; *Noble Ventures v. Romania* [RLA-75], \u00b6 152.\n\n898.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent argues that Claimant rather made its investment: (i) in awareness of the terms of the 1995 NMP; (ii) knowing that the 2002 BM Rules, which were adopted following the publication of the 1995 NMP, would be applicable to its investment; (iii) on giving the 2006 Undertaking that it would comply with the 2002 BM Rules \"*as approved/amended from time to time*\"; and (iv) knowing that BM Rule 48(3) left to the Licensing Authority \"*some discretion and subjective latitude*\" in respect to its power to grant or reject a mining lease application.948\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. c, \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nThe Tribunal will now determine the scope of Claimant's legitimate expectations that will form the basis of the subsequent analysis of whether such expectations were violated by Respondent's conduct. Given that legitimate expectations may vary over time, the Tribunal first has to define the relevant point in time for its analysis.\n\n900.\n\nAn investor's legitimate expectations have to be determined as of the date of the investment decision. In the present case, the Tribunal considers the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement by which Claimant, on 1 April 2006, replaced BHP as a party to, and thereby acquired the rights and obligations under, the CHEJVA as the main investment decision.\n\n901.\n\nIn principle, Respondent's conduct after 1 April 2006 would therefore be irrelevant because it could not have influenced Claimant's decision to enter into the 2006 Novation Agreement. However, in light of the fact that Claimant incurred the major part of its exploration expenditures only after it had become party to the CHEJVA, the Tribunal considers that Respondent's conduct in the years following the 2006 Novation Agreement has to be taken into account as well \u2013 to the extent that it encouraged Claimant to continue investing in the Reko Diq Project and thereby to repeatedly confirm its investment decision.\n\n902.\n\nClaimant claims that Respondent's conduct created a legitimate expectation that, after having successfully completed the exploration work, Claimant would be granted a mining lease over Reko Diq. More specifically, Claimant refers to the following two \"*basic expectations*\": (i) \"*security of tenure*,\" meaning that if it succeeded in proving a viable mine, Claimant would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease; and (ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate its investment.949\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 413; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n903.\n\nIn support of this claim, Claimant relies on three different categories of assurances: (i) the contractual framework contained in the CHEJVA and its related agreements; (ii) the federal and provincial regulatory framework; and (iii) direct assurances made by Government officials.950 The Tribunal will follow this structure in its analysis of whether Respondent indeed created legitimate expectations, in particular the two \"*basic expectations*\" referred to by Claimant above.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30.\n\n904.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to Respondent's argument, Claimant does not claim that it had an \"*automatic right to mine*,\" but rather that it legitimately expected that it would be granted a mining lease upon the submission of an application that met all \"*routine Government requirements*.\" Therefore, the Tribunal will not analyze whether there should have been such automatic right to mine, but only deal with Claimant's actual allegation and in particular on the meaning of the term \"*routine Government requirements*.\"\n\n**i. The Contractual Framework for Claimant's Expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n905.\n\nThe first category of assurances that Claimant relies on is contained in the CHEJVA and its related agreements, to which TCCA became a party by means of the 2006 Novation Agreement. While the Tribunal is aware that the Supreme Court has declared that the CHEJVA and its related agreements are null and void *ab initio*, the Tribunal considers that this is not relevant to the question as to whether the conclusion and performance of the CHEJVA gave rise to legitimate expectations under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. Respondent acknowledges that acts or representations \"*may*\" give rise to liability under international law \"*even if the acts or representations are considered legally non-existent or null and void or susceptible to invalidation as a matter of domestic law*.\"951 In light of the fact that, up to early 2011, all parties involved in the conclusion and performance of the CHEJVA acted on the assumption that it was valid and there was no indication that the GOB thought otherwise, the Tribunal is of the view that the declaration of the Supreme Court in 2013 cannot have any effect on Claimant's legitimate expectations in 2006.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 412.\n\n906.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal will now turn to Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA and its reasonable interpretation, while taking into account the negotiation history of the CHEJVA and the events that were closely related to its conclusion. In light of its overarching significance for Claimant's case, Clause 11.8.2 may first be quoted again:\n\n\"*Where the Joint Venture or, pursuant to sub-clause 11.3.2, a Participating Party elects to develop a mine then, subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements, it shall be entitled to convert the relevant Prospecting Licence(s) held by it into Mining Licences so as to give secure title over the required Mining Area.*\"952\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.8.2.\n\n907.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties relates in particular to the meaning of the words \"*subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements*.\" In this regard, the Tribunal considers it indicative that, in a letter of 16 September 1993 by which it sought relaxations of the 1970 BMC Rules, BHP gave the following interpretation of this phrase:\n\n\"*9. Application for Mining Leases*\n\n*It is essential that the Joint Venture, or a sole* 'Participating Party' *under Clause 11, is entitled to convert the relevant PL into a ML if it wishes to develop a mine. Currently, the right of a holder of a PL to receive a ML is described in Rule 23 as a* 'preferential right' *only. The subjective discretion of the licensing authority here and under Rules 31(2), 38, 62 and 63 must be waived in favour of an absolute right of the Joint Venture, or a sole* 'Participating Party'*, to a ML, provided that they comply with routine administrative requirements. Clause 11.8.2 of the Agreement anticipates this right of transition.*\n\n*International mining companies will view this aspect of a country's mining regulations as one of the most important. The necessary rights can be secured by appropriate Notified Orders.*\n\n*\u2026The unqualified discretion of the licensing authority to void a ML application for failure to furnish evidence* 'to the satisfaction of the licensing authority' *must be removed in favour of defined requirements.*\n\n*\u2026*\"953\n\n**Exhibit CE-187**, p. 7.\n\n908.\n\nIn light of the fact that the relaxations that BHP sought by means of this letter were granted by the GOB by simply reproducing the headings of BHP's request, including the heading \"9. Application for Mining Leases,\"954 the Tribunal is of the view that the 1994 Relaxations must be construed as giving effect to the points made in BHP's letter. Likewise, it can be assumed that the interpretation given by BHP that Clause 11.8.2 \"*anticipates*\" the requested \"*absolute right*\" subject to compliance with \"*routine administrative requirements*\" corresponded to the common understanding of the contracting parties to the CHEJVA at the time with regard to the meaning of the disputed phrase in Clause 11.8.2.\n\nThe Notification states: \"*In exercise of the powers confirmed by rule 98 of Mining Concession Rules 1970, the Government of Balochistan is pleased to grant the following relaxations as a special case in favour of BHP Company enabling the company to carry out its exploration work with out* [sic] *any complication:- 1. \u2026, 9. Application for Mining Lease, 10. \u2026.*\"*Cf.* **Exhibit CE-189**.\n\n909.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that the 1994 Relaxations were not validly granted because the requirements of rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules had not been fulfilled, as declared by the Supreme Court in its 2013 judgment. While the ICC Tribunal has taken a different view on the interpretation of rule 98 and consequently the validity of the 1994 Relaxations, this Tribunal is of the view that it does not need to express an opinion on their validity under Pakistani law. The Tribunal recalls its observation above that, despite its potential illegality, the CHEJVA may give rise to legitimate expectations because all parties acted on the assumption that it was valid and therefore performed it for many years. Likewise, the GOB (at least) created the impression that the 1994 Relaxations had been validly granted and even confirmed in a letter dated 11 November 2000, issued in connection with its consent to BHP's transfer of its interest to TCCA, that they \"*still h* [e] *ld good*.\"955\n\n**Exhibit CE-195**.\n\n910.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is of the view that, for purposes of the FET obligation, Respondent could in any event not rely on a failure on the part of the GOB to comply with its own rules. As a result, the Tribunal considers that, irrespective whether they were in fact validly granted under Pakistani law, the 1994 Relaxations could in any case inform the scope of Claimant's legitimate expectations.\n\n911.\n\nAs to Respondent's further arguments that the 1994 Relaxations were in any event superseded by the entry into force of the 2002 BM Rules (which did not contain an option to relax the rules similar to that under the 1970 BMC Rules) and the 2006 Undertaking in which Claimant undertook to abide by the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal is not convinced that those events should have any effect on the relevance of the 1994 Relaxations for Claimant's legitimate expectations. The 2002 BM Rules do not contain a provision relating to the future status of relaxations that had previously been granted under the 1970 BMC Rules,956 and the 2006 Undertaking also does not contain an indication that TCCA thereby intended to waive its rights under the 1994 Relaxations.\n\nRule 125 of the 2002 BM Rules provides only for the continued validity of licenses and leases that were granted, renewed or saved under the 1970 BMC Rules (or any other law in force before the 2002 BM Rules), but does not refer to relaxations granted under the 1970 BMC Rules. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 125.\n\n912.\n\nIt has to be noted that the 2006 Undertaking was given in the context of TCCA's becoming party to the CHEJVA by means of the 2006 Novation Agreement. At that time, the main focus of the parties was on the reaffirmation of the CHEJVA, and the GOB knew that it was on that basis, especially the security of tenure it conferred, that Claimant was going to raise money and invest in exploration; therefore, the 2006 Undertaking did not affect Claimant's legitimate expectation.\n\n913.\n\nIt appears that Respondent's argument that the 1994 Relaxations ceased to have any effect also does not correspond to the contemporaneous understanding of the GOB, given that it stated in its submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court on 15 December 2010 that the \"*enactment of Rules is within the legislative competence of the Government from securing for the Province of Balochistan a better deal that* [sic] *one prescribed in the 1970 Rules or the 2002 Rules.*\"957\n\n**Exhibit CE-107**, pp. 11-12. Respondent does not contest Claimant's submission that, in this context, the \"*enactment of Rules*\" refers to the 1994 Relaxations. *See* Reply, \u00b6 83.\n\n914.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the 1994 Relaxations, granted as requested in BHP's 16 September 1993 letter, support Claimant's understanding that Clause 11.8.2 was intended to give BHP, and later TCCA, security of tenure in the form of a right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease, provided that it would submit an application meeting the routine requirements.\n\n915.\n\nThis understanding of Clause 11.8.2 is further confirmed by the submission of the GOB to the Balochistan High Court in 2007 in which the GOB repeatedly emphasized that it had secured the \"*best deal possible*\" for Balochistan that would allow the Province to receive a 25% share in profits in addition to the royalty payments.958 In its 11 December 2010 submission to the Supreme Court, the GOB emphasized that the 25% profit share would come into play once the mining operations started, which would be the case once the review of the Feasibility Study was complete and the mineral agreement was executed.959 In the Tribunal's view, the GOB thereby demonstrated that it considered it a given that Claimant would be granted the mining lease that it required in order to proceed to the mining of the explored area.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-212**, p. 9.\n\n**Exhibit CE-107**, \u00b6 14.\n\n916.\n\nHowever, in light of the fact that Clause 11.8.2 conferred a right \"*subject to compliance with routine Government requirements*,\" the Tribunal considers that the scope of Claimant's expectation cannot be evaluated without taking into account the regulatory framework that shaped these requirements. This consideration therefore leads to the second category of alleged assurances, *i.e.*, the federal and provincial regulatory framework as it was in place at the time Claimant made its investment.\n\n**ii. The Regulatory Framework for Claimant's Expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n917.\n\nWhile the minerals that Claimant sought to exploit through its investment are under the ownership of the Province of Balochistan, which therefore enacts the immediate regulatory framework that the investment and the investor is subject to, the federal law, the 1995 National Mineral Policy, sets out the overall directives on the regulation of the mineral sector.\n\n918.\n\nWith regard to the application for a mining lease, the 1995 NMP provides in its Article 8.6.2 (in relevant part):\n\n\"*The Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an application for the grant of an ML. Where the Licensing Authority considers that the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for assessment and grant of an ML, the ML will be granted.*\"960\n\n**Exhibit CE-190**, Article 8.6.2.\n\n919.\n\nThe 2002 BM Rules through which the 1995 NMP was implemented in the territory of Balochistan provide in their rule 48 (in relevant part):\n\n\"*(1) Subject to these Rules, where the holder of exploration licence or a mineral deposit retention licence, makes an application for a mining lease in respect of \u2013*\n\n*(a) an area of land in, or which constitutes, the exploitation area or, as the case may be, the retention area; and*\n\n*(b) any mineral or group of minerals included in such exploration licence or such mineral deposit retention licence, as the case may be, the licensing authority shall grant the mining lease.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(3) Subject to sub-rules (4) and (5), a mining lease shall not be granted \u2013*\n\n*(a) unless \u2013*\n\n*(i) the feasibility studies show that the mine can be profitably developed and operated;*\n\n*(ii) the proposed plans for development and operation of the mine and the programme of the mining operations of the applicant will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources;*\n\n*(iii) the applicant in question has or can obtain the technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations effectively;*\n\n*(iv) the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the lease;*\n\n*(v) the proposals submitted with the application are satisfactory; and*\n\n*(vi) it is in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease;*\n\n*(b) if at the time of the application the applicant in question is in default.*\"961\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48.\n\n920.\n\nAs of 1 October 2010, Rule 48(3)(a) was amended to include a new sub-clause (vii):962\n\n\"*(vii) a concrete proposal for value addition of the Ore to be produced / exploited from the applicant's mining lease within the country is submitted, or if the facility is not available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of province with the prior approval of the Provincial Government.*\"\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, p. 153.\n\n921.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 8.6.2 of the 1995 NMP provides that, in case the applicant satisfies the specified criteria, the application *will be* granted. Similarly, rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules provides that, in case the applicant makes an application subject to the Rules, the Licensing Authority *shall grant* the mining lease. This language indicates that the Licensing Authority does not have any discretion, but is bound to grant a mining lease if the applicant satisfies the criteria specified in the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n922.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also notes that the substantive criteria to be met by the application are spelled out in rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that the mining lease *shall not be granted* unless all six criteria are satisfied. In addition, the criteria spelled out in rule 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi), *i.e*., that the proposals submitted with the application have to be *satisfactory* and that the mining lease has to be *in the interest* of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan, contain discretionary elements, which have to be assessed by the Licensing Authority. The 1995 NMP states in this regard that the Licensing Authority *shall not unreasonably refuse* an application and thereby also recognizes a certain amount of discretion in the assessment of the application.\n\n923.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that the \"*routine Government requirements*\" referred to in Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA were shaped by the criteria set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules.963 The GOB likewise made clear during the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement that any application for a mining lease would be subject to these requirements. However, the Tribunal considers that it was reasonable for Claimant to expect that the assessment of these criteria would be made in light of the contractual agreement in the CHEJVA, in particular its Clause 11.8.2, which provided Claimant with security of tenure, *i.e.*, the comfort that its application would be granted if it met all routine requirements.\n\nClaimant's witness Ms. Boggs confirmed during her oral testimony that \"[w]*e always knew that we would have to submit an Application that met these criteria* [under rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules].\" Transcript (Day 3), p. 766 lines 1-3.\n\n924.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the existence of discretionary elements as such does not come into conflict with the expectation created under Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the discretion of the Licensing Authority under rule 48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules is not so broad as to make unreasonable an expectation of security of tenure. Given the mandatory character of the 2002 BM Rules as provided for in rules 9(5) and (6), the criteria set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules would prevail over any conflicting contractual criteria; however, this does not exclude that the exercise of the Licensing Authority's discretion can be informed by the existence of such contractual provisions.\n\n925.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no inconsistency between rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules (implementing Article 8.6.2 of the 1995 NMP) and Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA. Rules 9(1) and (3)(a) and (c) of the 2002 BM Rules (implementing Articles 8.12.1 and 8.12.2 of the 1995 NMP) confirm that the Provincial Government, in this case the GOB, may enter into contracts that contain provisions on the grant of mineral titles and in particular the mining lease, such as Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA.\n\n926.\n\nArticle 8.12 of the 1995 NMP provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*8.12.1 The Provincial Government may enter into an agreement with an investor, within the framework of the law, to stabilize the terms or to predetermine procedures with respect to certain matters relating to the carrying out of operations under a license/lease, if government is satisfied that substantial foreign investment in exploration and mining operations is likely to be made and it is desirable in the interest of the development of mineral resources, to do so.* [\u2026]\n\n*8.12.2 The agreement may cover, for example, the right of the licensee to obtain a mining lease, assignment rights \u2026.*\"964\n\n**Exhibit CE-190**, Article 8.12.\n\n927.\n\nRule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*(1) The Government may, at the request of a person proposing to carry on mineral operations, enter into an agreement, with that person relating to a mineral title, not inconsistent with these Rules or any other law, if the Government is satisfied that substantial foreign investment is likely to be made in mineral operations and that the carrying on of the undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of* Balochistan*.* [\u2026]\n\n*(3) A mineral agreement may, in particular, make provision with respect to all or any other following matters \u2013*\n\n*(a) the grant, renewal, cancellation or transfer of a mineral title;*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(c) the formation of joint ventures;*\n\n[\u2026].\"965\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 9.\n\n928.\n\nIn light of these provisions, the Tribunal considers that Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA serves as a provision that specifies the procedure for granting a mineral lease to the Joint Venture, or as the case may be, the sole Participating Party, as it was permitted and in fact later specifically provided for in the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules. At this point, the Tribunal also notes that both the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules state that agreements such as the CHEJVA shall be entered only if the Provincial Government considers it to be \"*in the interest of the development of* [the] *mineral resources*\" of the province, *i.e.*, they contain the same language that embodies the main discretionary element of the Licensing Authority's decision on the grant of the mineral lease in rule 48(3)(a)(vi).\n\n929.\n\nTherefore, the fact the GOB entered into the CHEJVA with BHP (and later into the 2006 Novation Agreement with TCCA) implies that the GOB at those points considered that it was in the interest of the development of its mineral resources to have TCCA explore and eventually exploit its mineral resources. In this context, the words \"*only*\" and \"*routine*\" in Clause 11.8.2 indicate that they were intended to limit the Licensing Authority's discretion because the assessment whether such collaboration would be in the interest of the development of Balochistan's mineral resources had already been made by the GOB when it decided to collaborate with BHP and later TCCA. In the Tribunal's view, this consideration applies not only to the requirements provided for in the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules, which were not yet in force when the CHEJVA was concluded, but also to the discretion granted to the Licensing Authority under the 1970 BMC Rules.\n\n930.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, such an interpretation is not in conflict with the mandatory character of the 2002 BM Rules as prescribed in rules 9(5) and (6). Apart from the above quoted provisions in Article 8.12 of the 1995 NMP and in the very same rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules, the Foreword of the 2002 BM Rules states that the rules were enacted with the aim \"*to put in place a set of rules internationally competitive*\" and to \"*attract the interest of the investors on such matters as \u2026 criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of Licences and Leases, \u2026 security of tenure, and to equitably meet the objectives of the investors as well as aspirations of the Government*.\"966 Therefore, it was apparently not the aim of the legislator to prevent agreements that would give investors the comfort they required in order to invest considerable amounts of money in exploration before being granted the mining lease that would secure their right to ultimately benefit from the findings they had made through their expenditures.\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, Foreword.\n\n931.\n\nThe GOB's contemporaneous understanding of the regulatory framework is expressed in its submission to the Balochistan High Court in 2007, in which the GOB stated:\n\n\"*It seems that the Petitioners have not bothered to read the law and the Rules because if they had they would not have made statements about inviting bids after the copper/gold had been discovered as the discoverer is entitled to retain the benefits thereof. It is submitted that if this was not so then no one would come forward to invest millions of dollar in exploration/prospecting when no benefit or advantage would accrue to them*.\"967\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, p. 14.\n\n932.\n\nThe GOB further stated in a Working Paper that was prepared for the second meeting of the Steering Committee on 23 January 2009:\n\n\"*Under the Balochistan Mining Rules (BMR) 2002, the license holder is legally entitled for conversion of prospecting license into mining lease, once the area is proved and certain laid down requirements under the rules are fulfilled by the licensee.*\"968\n\n**Exhibit CE-69**, p. 5.\n\n933.\n\nThe GOP appears to have shared this understanding, given that it stated in its 23 November 2010 submission to the Supreme Court:\n\n\"*Mineral Exploration is a high risk capital investment with a success ratio of less than 1:10. This is known as the 'finders \u2013 keepers' principle which is fundamental for the development of the mining industry and is recognized by the National Mineral Policy and the 2002 BMC Rules*.\"969\n\n**Exhibit CE-264**, \u00b6 3.\n\n934.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, both Governments thereby acknowledged Claimant's need for security of tenure in light of the \"high risk capital investment\" that was required for the exploration operations and, more importantly, expressed the opinion that such security of tenure was reflected in the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n935.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs testified in her written witness statement that the requirements set out in rules 47 and 48 of the 2002 BM Rules were \"*in line with standard industry practice, as reflected in contemporaneous mining regulations*.\"970 She further stated:\n\n\"*It would make no sense for a major international mining company to undertake the substantial investments required to conduct exploration and feasibility activities on this scale if the requirements for obtaining the lease to actually mine the deposits were not clear and objective or if the government could simply refuse to grant the mining lease even if the company met those objective criteria.*\"971\n\nBoggs II, \u00b6 3.\n\nBoggs II, \u00b6 4.\n\n936.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Ms. Boggs qualified her initial statement to the extent that such requirements were \"*in line with what* [she] *would expect to see in a jurisdiction such as Pakistan that was in the process of developing a mining sector*.\"972 Nevertheless, Ms. Boggs maintained that the requirements set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules were objective criteria and, in answer to the proposition that the terms \"*efficient, beneficial and timely use of mineral resources*\" give rise to \"*judgmental, subjective questions for the Licensing Authority to take a view on*,\" she gave the following explanation:\n\n\"*No. I think in the mining world, these terms all have meaning, meaning that can be demonstrated by very objective evidence. So, an efficient Mine Development Plan, particularly one that you can demonstrate as being developed in accordance with international standards. Efficient, beneficial, and timely, those are criteria that you can establish by objective evidence.*\"973\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 757 lines 20-22.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), pp. 759 line 10 to p. 760 line 8.\n\n937.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the terms \"*satisfactory*\" and \"*in the interest of the development of the mineral resource of Balochistan,*\" Ms. Boggs was asked whether these were \"*matters on which reasonable people might disagree on the same set of facts*.\" She answered:\n\n\"*No, I don't think I would agree on that. I think professionals in the mining sector, people who understand what these terms mean, would come to a general agreement around that*. \u2026 *They* [*i.e*., all mining companies] *don't have exactly the same view, but I think they are able to demonstrate objectively that they've met these criteria*.\"974\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 760 line 17 to p. 761 line 12.\n\n938.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Ms. Boggs' testimony confirms that requirements such as the ones set out in rules 47 and 48, and in particular in rule 48(3)(a), of the 2002 BM Rules were not understood in the industry as providing for unrestrained discretion of the licensing authorities, but rather they were attributed a certain meaning that allowed the mining company to demonstrate the satisfaction of those requirements in an objectively comprehensible manner. According to their Foreword, the 2002 BM Rules were specifically intended to create an \"*internationally competitive*\" set of rules that was meant to \"*attract the interest of the investors on such matters as transparency, criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of Licenses and Leases, expeditious decision making process, security of tenure, provision of adequate information on mineral titles, independent resolution mechanism* [illegible] *and to equitably meet the objectives of the investors as well as aspirations of the Government*.\"975\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, Foreword.\n\n939.\n\nTherefore, it is apparent that the criteria in rule 48(3)(a) were intended to have the meaning attributed to such criteria according to the practice in the industry and thereby also to constitute the \"*specified criteria for assessment and grant*\" of a mining lease that the 1995 NMP had envisaged.976\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-190**, Article 8.6.2.\n\n940.\n\nIn any event, Claimant reasonably expected that the Licensing Authority would comply with the due process requirements set out in rule 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules:\n\n\"*(4) The licensing authority shall not refuse to grant a mining lease to the holder of a mineral title referred to in sub-rule (1) \u2013*\n\n(a) in *accordance with sub-rule (3) (a), unless the licensing authority has \u2013*\n\n*(i) by notice in writing informed the applicant, of its intended refusal and the reasons therefor;*\n\n*(ii) afforded the applicant an opportunity to make, within such reasonable period as may be specified in the notice, representations in relation to all matters relating to its intention and, if the applicant so desires, to make proposals in relation to any such matters; and*\n\n*(iii) taken any such representations into consideration.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(5) The licensing authority shall not refuse to grant a mining lease on the ground that any proposals submitted with the application are inadequate or unsatisfactory unless the licensing authority has, by notice in writing, informed the applicant accordingly and afforded the applicant a reasonable opportunity to modify those proposals.*\"977\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 48(4) and (5).\n\n941.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, together with the manner in which matters had previously been handled between Claimant and the Governments over the course of Claimant's exploration activities at Reko Diq, these procedural requirements support Claimant's expectation that any concerns of the Licensing Authority with regard to its Mining Lease Application would be subject to a fair discussion between the parties. In particular, Claimant reasonably expected that, in light of the security of tenure that had been promised to Claimant by means of the CHEJVA, the Licensing Authority would (a) spell out any concerns in a manner sufficiently clear for Claimant to be able to address them; (b) give Claimant a fair opportunity to give explanations and/or make proposals in relation to these concerns; and (c) take any such explanations and/or proposals into consideration in making its decision on the Mining Lease Application.\n\n942.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is of the view that the discretionary elements contained within the criteria in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules do not exclude a legitimate expectation on the part of Claimant; they rather shape the scope of such expectation to the effect that Claimant could expect that the Licensing Authority's discretion was limited as described above and that any remaining discretion would be exercised in a reasonable manner. In addition, Claimant could expect that the Licensing Authority would take into account the representations made by officials from both Governments in the relevant time period, as they will be examined as part of the third category of assurances that Claimant invokes.\n\n**iii. Expectations Based on Direct Assurances from Government Officials**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n943.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will examine whether Claimant's expectations were further shaped by direct assurances given by officials from the GOB and/or GOP, in particular as regards the second \"*basic expectation*\" on which Claimant relies, *i.e.*, that both Governments would support and facilitate the investment.\n\n944.\n\nWith regard to the role of the GOB in the context of the Joint Venture, Clause 7.2(a) of the CHEJVA provides that the GOB (through the BDA) shall provide at its own expense, *inter alia*,\n\n\"*appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of all leases, licences, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.*\"978\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\n945.\n\nClause 5.7.1 of the CHEJVA further provides that the GOB (through the BDA), if directed by the Manager of the Joint Venture, is responsible for making applications, *inter alia*, for Mining Leases. Pursuant to Clause 5.7.2 of the CHEJVA, the GOB is further responsible for\n\n\"*liaising with relevant Provincial Government and local government authorities and with affected landholders to ensure that good relations are maintained between the Joint Venture and other persons during the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.*\"979\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2.\n\n946.\n\nFinally, Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA provide:\n\n\"*The Parties shall be just and faithful to one another and will not do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture contemplated herein as a whole are prejudiced.*\n\n*Each Party shall execute all necessary additional documents and do all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of this Agreement.*\"980\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 24.6.3.\n\n947.\n\nPursuant to these provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole, *i.e.*, to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Diq. It is undisputed between the Parties that the GOB did provide such support for, and thus facilitated, Claimant's investment over a period of many years, including the time period in which the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed. Specifically on the Operating Committee, the GOB (through the BDA) encouraged Claimant to carry on its exploration activities and to prepare a feasibility study for the Western Porphyries, as evidenced by the following documents.\n\n948.\n\nIn its meeting on 15 July 2006, the Operating Meeting passed the resolution that \"*the pre-feasibility studies as outlined in the work program should commence immediately and that this program should include both the drill out of the Western Porphyries as well as the drilling to upgrade the resources of the other significant ore bodies including the hypogene copper ore body below the Tanjeel supergene deposit.*\"981\n\n**Exhibit RE-57**, p. 4.\n\n949.\n\nDuring the meeting on 26 October 2007, both parties on the Operating Committee agreed: \"*After new work and additional analysis the Tanjeel project found not to be economic on its own.*\n\n*Only additional work outside the Tanjeel area by the JV developed a play for a larger scale project based on the newly discovered WP deposits, which discoveries also transformed the Tanjeel ore deposits to a potential economic and value adding activity.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*In view of the potential for developing the project TCC and BDA agreed that the JV through TCC as Manager should move immediately to commence and complete feasibility study. In this connection TCC presented a work plan and preliminary budget for full feasibility study on option 72 kptd and parallel pre-feasibility study on expansion options*. *The parties agreed the conceptual preliminary budget of US$ 106.5 million TCC was authorized to make carry out the feasibility.*\"982\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3.\n\n950.\n\nIn this regard, it has to be noted that Respondent does not contest Claimant's submission that \"*option 72 kptd*\" refers to the deposits at the Western Porphyries,983 and thus that the Operating Committee expressly authorized the preparation of a full feasibility study that focused on the Western Porphyries and in parallel a pre-feasibility study focusing on expansion options.\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6 167.\n\n951.\n\nBeyond its actions on the Operating Committee, it is undisputed that the GOB twice renewed Exploration License EL-5 in 2005 and in 2008, and in general granted all required permits for the continuing exploration activities.984 The GOB further started to negotiate with Claimant on the terms of the Mineral Agreement and the Project Agreement.\n\n*Cf*. Livesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n952.\n\nShortly after a Constitutional petition was filed seeking the invalidation of the CHEJVA, the Operating Committee passed a resolution in its 24 February 2007 meeting that \"*both parties of the joint venture have examined the Constitutional Petition in detail and have come to the conclusion that the case is without any merit*[,] *that it will be defending the challenge to their title to EL-5 and Tethyan is authorized to take steps as may be expedient to defend the same.*\"985\n\n**Exhibit CE-60**, p. 6.\n\n953.\n\nIn its 2007 submission to the Balochistan High Court, the GOB defended the validity of the CHEJVA and submitted that Claimant, being the one that discovered the copper and gold deposits, \"*is entitled to retain the benefits thereof*.\" The GOB further argued:\n\n\"[I]*f this was not so then no one would come forward to invest millions in exploration/prospecting when no benefit or advantage would accrue to them. The benefits are earned by the Province of Balochistan are* [sic] *through Royalty payments, licence fees and the extraordinary benefit of retaining 25% of the profits*.\n\n*The answering Respondents have been kept abreast of all relevant developments and are constantly viewing that nothing is done which will in any manner adversely affect the interest* [of] *the Province of Balochistan.*\"986\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, pp. 14-15.\n\n954.\n\nThe GOP, in its 23 November 2010 submission to the Supreme Court, likewise stated that the \"*finders-keepers*\" principle is \"*fundamental for the development of the mining industry and is recognized by the National Mineral Policy and by the 2002 BMC Rules.*\"987\n\n**Exhibit CE-264**, p. 2.\n\n955.\n\nFinally, Respondent does not contest the submission of Claimant's witnesses Mr. Luksic and Ms. Boggs that various officials on the highest levels of both GOB and the GOP, including the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan as well as the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary of Balochistan, assured Claimant of their support for its investment.988 Respondent rather argues that those assurances were far too general and non-committal as to constitute a specific representation capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation.989 While this might be true if one were to look at some of the respective statements in isolation, the Tribunal is of the view that, together with the GOB's conduct both on the Operating Committee and in relation to the granting of permits required to conduct the exploration activities as well as the Governments' submissions in the High Court and Supreme Court proceedings (up to early 2011), those assurances contributed to the expectation that the Governments would support and facilitate Claimant's investment.\n\nLuksic, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 13; Boggs I, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. *See* also **Exhibits CE-95**, **CE-246**, **CE-317** and **CE-318**.\n\n*Cf.* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 438-439; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48 lit. b and c.\n\n956.\n\nIn addition, such conduct created the impression that the Governments considered Claimant's investment to be in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan so that the Licensing Authority would assess this element under rule 48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules in a positive manner.\n\n957.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the assurances given by officials from both the GOB and the GOP continued when rumors started to emerge in 2010 that Balochistan was planning its own project at Reko Diq.990 Even though this occurred at a time when the Novation Agreement had long been concluded, the Tribunal considers this conduct particularly relevant because at that time, Claimant was still to finish its Feasibility Study, which constitutes a significant part of the investment in light of the costs and efforts that were continuously put into this Study until it was presented to the GOB in August 2010.\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibits CE-95** and **CE-246**; Boggs I, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n\n958.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that by means of both the contractual and the regulatory framework of Claimant's investment as well as the conduct of the GOB and the GOP during the time period in which Claimant explored the area at Reko Diq, Respondent created the legitimate expectation that Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon submission of an application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules. Even though these requirements contained certain discretionary elements, the Governments created the impression that such discretion had either already been exercised or that it would be exercised in Claimant's favor because they recognized the general principle that, after having invested millions of dollars into the exploration of the area, Claimant should also be the one that would later reap the benefit of its exploitation together with its Joint Venture partner. Finally, both the GOB and the GOP repeatedly assured Claimant that they would support and facilitate Claimant's investment.\n\n**iv. Causality for Claimant's Investment Decision**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n959.\n\nAs a final step, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Claimant's legitimate expectations are relevant only to the extent that they formed the basis for Claimant's investment decision. In this regard, Respondent claims that Claimant itself did not believe that it had security of tenure on the basis of the contractual and regulatory framework because it sought to obtain such security of tenure through the Mineral Agreement negotiations.991 Respondent refers in particular to the 27 October 2008 letter that Ms. Boggs sent to Mr. Lehri, then Additional Chief Secretary of the GOB, in which TCCP proposed amendments to the 2002 BM Rules in order to avoid \"*damaging discretionary actions.*\"992\n\n*Cf*. Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 418-419.\n\n**Exhibit RE-64**, p. 2.\n\n960.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that Claimant argues that TCCP was not concerned with the Licensing Authority's scope of discretion to grant TCCP's future mining lease application, but rather with future amendments to the 2002 BM Rules that might change Claimant's rights.993 This argument is supported by the same 27 October 2008 letter that Respondent relies on, given that Ms. Boggs in fact refers to the fact that \"*any future amendment of the BMR would be mandatory and applicable to TCC notwithstanding any stability provisions of the Mineral Agreement.*\"994 In its 18 August 2008 letter, by which TCCP replied to the revised proposal for the Mineral Agreement that it had received from GOB and the GOP, TCCP likewise stated that their \"*primary concern*\" was that agreements creating the certainty and security of tenure required for the investment in, and financing of, the Reko Diq project would be \"*negated by any changes to the BMR in the future*\" and therefore, they proposed amendments to the 2002 BM Rules.995\n\n*Cf.* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379; Boggs II, \u00b6 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-64**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-227**, p. 4.\n\n961.\n\nThe Tribunal is further convinced by Claimant's explanation that they sought to correct a \"*defect*\" in the 2002 BM Rules, which on the one hand intended to provide security of tenure (as expressly stated in the Foreword) and provided for the possibility of entering into mineral agreements, but on the other hand stipulated that any future amendment to the Rules would prevail over the terms of a mineral agreement (rules 9(5) and (6)). In the Tribunal's view, this is supported by the fact that Pakistan identified and corrected this \"*defect*\" in 2013 NMP, which provides in its Article 7.8.2:\n\n\"*The Mineral Agreement would have an overriding effect in case anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules subsequently amended.*\"996\n\n**Exhibit CE-416**, Article 7.8.2. *See* also Transcript (Day 4), pp. 1114-115 and (Day 8), pp. 2272-2274.\n\n962.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers that Claimant's request for amendments to the 2002 BM Rules does not exclude a finding that Claimant nevertheless relied on the legitimate expectation that it benefitted from security of tenure as regards the granting of the mining lease under the current contractual and regulatory framework. To the contrary, it appears rather obvious to the Tribunal that Claimant's decision to invest more than US$ 240 million and more than eight years of work in the exploration at Reko Diq997 was based on the legitimate expectation that it would be granted the mining lease required to benefit from its exploration results thereafter and that the Governments would support and facilitate its investment.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 326 *et seq*. above.\n\n**3. Did Respondent Breach Its Obligation to Provide Fair and Equitable Treatment under the Treaty?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n963.\n\nClaimant claims that Respondent breached the FET obligation imposed by Article 3(2) of the Treaty by: (i) denying the Mining Lease Application; (ii) developing and implementing a plan to take over the Reko Diq project; and (iii) together with the foregoing breaches, which also constitute independent violations, other Government conduct relating to TCCA's investment, including the conduct of both Governments during the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme Court proceedings which, according to Claimant, constitutes an overall course of action that is a composite breach of Article 3(2).998\n\nClaimant's letter dated 18 November 2014. *See* \u00b6 174 above. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 392; Reply, \u00b6 323.\n\n**i. Pakistan Breached Article 3(2) by Denying TCC's Mining Lease Application**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n964.\n\nClaimant contends that the Licensing Authority denied the Mining Lease on \"*spurious and pretextual ground* s\" and argues that Pakistan cannot rely on new grounds that were not specified in the Licensing Authority's Notice of Intent to Reject.999\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 59. *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 405, 416.\n\n965.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's argument that only one of the grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject has to be reasonable in order for TCCA's claim to fail and argues that the FET standard rather requires taking into account the State's overall course of conduct and thus assessing whether the Licensing Authority was acting as a \"*normal, independent, good-faith regulator*,\"*i.e.*, in a way that TCCA should have expected, or instead in a manner that was \"*arbitrary, partial, or aimed at achieving a particular end.*\"1000\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60.\n\n966.\n\nClaimant further argues that States must act in a proportional manner, while disproportionate action is held to be unfair and inequitable under international law. Therefore, Claimant argues that even if some of the grounds for the denial of the Mining Lease Application \"*were arguably applicable*,\" the summary denial and thereby \"*complete destruction*\" of TCC's investment was disproportionate in light of the \"*extraordinary time, effort, expertise and capital TCC had devoted to Reko Diq.*\"1001\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 62.\n\n**(a) Pakistan's Conduct in Denying the Mining Lease Breached Basic Notions of Fairness and Due Process**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n967.\n\nClaimant claims that Pakistan failed to treat TCC fairly and to observe its due process rights because it (i) did not provide TCC with adequate notice and explanation of the grounds for the rejection; (ii) failed to discuss with TCC the alleged concerns regarding the Application with a view to enabling the project to go forward; and (iii) violated TCC's basic due process rights on appeal given that the hearing date of the appeal was advanced on short notice and the decision was issued without appropriate reasoning.1002\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 63. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 489; Reply, \u00b6 432.\n\n968.\n\nClaimant submits that the FET standard as well as rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules and Pakistani law in general required the Licensing Authority to identify clearly all the grounds for rejection and provide adequate reasoning explaining why TCC had failed to meet each in the Notice of Intent to Reject.1003 In Claimant's view, the Notice of Intent to Reject did not meet these requirements because:1004\n\n(i) the ten grounds for denial were \"*confusing and vague*\";\n\n(ii) the reasoning was not \"*commensurate with the size of the investment, the amount at stake, and the volume of material submitted in support*\" (*e.g*., no reference to any section of the Feasibility Study); and\n\n(iii) three of the grounds now raised by Respondent (*i.e.*, the alleged failure to show that the mining project was economically viable; the alleged security risks relating to the slurry pipeline; and the alleged failure to prove the sufficiency of the water source) were not contained in the Notice.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. **Exhibit RE-1**. Rules 48(4) and (5). Claimant states that, under general Pakistani law, an administrative authority must \"*act fairly and justly*\" and give reasons for its opinion. [**CA-91**], p. 1080.

According to Claimant, during the seven-month time period between the filing of the application and its rejection, there was only one meeting between the GOB and TCC, on 21 July 2011, at which none of the grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject was discussed, except for the smelter issue; following the Notice, the Licensing Authority refused to meet with TCC, despite TCC's repeated requests for clarification.

Claimant argues that there is no requirement that local remedies have to be exhausted and notes that the Supreme Court did not act as appellate authority for the MMDD.1013\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 77.\n\n**(b) The Grounds Stated in the Notice of Intent to Reject Provide No Rational Basis for Denial of the Mining Lease Application**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n974.\n\nClaimant claims that the grounds of rejection stated in the Notice of Intent to Reject were \"*baseless and arbitrary*\" and cites as an example the Fourth Ground, *i.e.*, that no exploration had taken place in Reko Diq in the past seventeen years, despite the fact that Balochistan as TCC's joint venture partner had participated in all important decisions regarding the exploration work and had received quarterly reports on the progress of the exploration activities and an 18,000-page Feasibility Study.1014 Claimant notes that Balochistan itself stated before the Balochistan High Court in 2007 that (i) \"*BHP carried out reconnaissance and detailed work upto* [sic] *1999*\"; (ii) \"*TCC continued the work and carried out extensive exploration activities at Reko Diq*\"; and (iii) following its acquisition by Barrick and Antofagasta in 2006, TCC \"*started a very huge advanced drilling and exploration programme at Reko Diq*.\"1015\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 78, 79; Memorial, \u00b6 457. **Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 458. **Exhibit CE-212** pp. 2-4, 16. Claimant also refers to the High Court's holding that \"*exploration is a time consuming work, which involves drilling, collection of samples and tests, thus mining and cannot be started over night*\" and that \"*it can be safely concluded that, lot has been done and efforts have been made to start the mining, which of course is a slow and time consuming process*.\" **Exhibit CE-61**, p. 52.\n\n975.\n\nClaimant also refers to the First Ground, *i.e.*, that TCCP was not incorporated in Pakistan, and notes that TCCP's certificate of incorporation was attached to the Application and the Licensing Authority thus must have been aware of TCCP's valid registration.1016\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 79.

Transcript (Day 7), p. 1772.\n\n983.\n\nWith regard to the scope of the Feasibility Study, Claimant refers to rule 47(2)(f), which provides that the feasibility study shall include \"*detailed plans for* [the] *development and operation of the mine and the programme of proposed mining operations,*\" and rule 48(3)(a)(i), which requires the feasibility study to \"*show that **the mine** can be profitably developed and operated*.\"1028 Claimant emphasizes that those provisions do not limit the Mining Area to a single deposit and notes that Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA also refers to \"*all ore resources which may be properly mined as a single mining enterprise*\" and submits that a \"*mining enterprise*\" usually includes several deposits.1029 Therefore, Claimant argues that the \"*mining operation*\" set out in the Feasibility Study was the initial mine development comprising H14 and H15.1030\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92. **Exhibit RE-1**, rules 47(2)(f) and 48(3)(a)(i) (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 476 referring to Livesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92. Claimant asserts that Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar confirmed during the Hearing that a \"*mine*\" or a \"*mining operation*\" is not the same thing as a deposit or group of deposits. Transcript (Day 7) pp. 1784-1785.\n\n984.\n\nClaimant further contends that the BM Rules accord with industry practice regarding mine development: It is standard industry practice for mining companies to start a project with an initial mining operation and then use the revenues from that development to finance future expansions in order to increase the profitability of the project at economies of scale derived from additional volume.1031 According to Claimant, it is also standard industry practice to prepare a feasibility study for initial mine development (the \"*base case*\") and then prepare additional feasibility studies if a decision is made to proceed with mine expansion, as TCC had done in preparing, with the consent and approval of its Joint Venture partner, a pre-feasibility study for an expansion in the present case.1032 Claimant contends that, consistent with this practice, the Feasibility Study demonstrated, through the use of base case focused on the Western Porphyries, that mining operations at Reko Diq would be both technically viable and profitable.1033\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 94.

Claimant claims that TCC was not required to address smelting or refining of the extracted minerals in its Feasibility Study or to actually construct such a smelter and refinery.1043\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99 referring to Ground 9 of the Notice of Intent to Reject. **Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 479, 480.

Claimant further claims that, in any event, the Feasibility Study met the \"*value addition*\" requirement and refers to its witnesses Mr. Livesey and Ms. Boggs, who testified during the Hearing that the transformation of the ore into concentrate is in fact \"*the most important link of the value chain,*\"1044 as well as to Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar, who agreed that treatment of the ore creates value addition.1045\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102. Ms. Boggs stated that turning ore into concentrate is \"*probably the biggest value addition to it in the mining process*.\" Transcript (Day 4), p. 1037 lines 14-15. Mr. Livesey further explained: \"*A tonne of rock from Reko Diq can't be sold on the open market, but a tonne of concentrate can. So you have immediately added value to the ore by creating the concentrate.* \u2026 *In the case of this porphyry system, we increased the grade from half a percent copper to 30 percent copper in the concentrate.* \u2026 *so you've added value and you've created a product that is saleable on the international market.*\" Transcript (Day 5), p. 1426 line 8 to p. 1427 line 1. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 481; Reply, \u00b6 425.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102.

At the same time, Claimant notes that it offered to provide an amount of up to US$ 1 million to assist Balochistan in preparing its own smelter feasibility study.1046\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 480; Reply, \u00b6 426; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103.\n\n992.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's argument that it was within the Licensing Authority's discretion to impose the obligation to construct a smelter on TCC, Claimant argues that if this were the case, Balochistan could deny the mining lease on the sole ground that TCC was not willing to spend a billion dollars on loss-making facilities, which do not even form part of the industry sector in which TCC's parent companies are experienced. In Claimant's view, such an exercise of discretion would not only be \"*wholly arbitrary*,\" but would also contradict the purpose of rules 47 and 48, *i.e.*, to ensure that mining operations are profitable and efficient, and further would violate Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA, since the construction of a smelter is not a routine requirement.1047\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105.\n\n993.\n\nAs to Pakistan's argument that TCC's Feasibility Study should have discussed allocating ore for the Government's planned smelter, Claimant contends that besides there being no requirement under the 2002 BM Rules to do so, Balochistan never responded to TCC's offer on 5 October 2010 to provide concentrate to a Government smelter at internationally accepted commercial terms.1048\n\nReply, \u00b6 426 referring to Livesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 85-89; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106 referring to **Exhibit CE-257**.\n\n**(c) Pakistan's New Grounds Are Irrelevant and Without Merit**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n994.\n\nClaimant submits that the three additional grounds raised by Pakistan in these proceedings, *i.e.*, that the Project was not economically viable, that the proposed slurry pipeline was infeasible, and that the water supply was insufficient, are irrelevant to the Tribunal's evaluation of the Licensing Authority's rejection of the Mining Lease Application, as they were not raised in the Notice of Intent to Reject or at any other occasion prior to the rejection. In any event, Claimant contends that those grounds are also without merit.1049\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108. With regard to the second reason, *see also* Reply, \u00b6 428.\n\n**(i) The Proposed Project Was Economically Viable**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n995.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's contention that the Feasibility Study failed to show that \"*the mine can be profitably developed and operated*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i), Claimant refers to the Feasibility Study stating that \"*given its strong economic results, and its strategic fit for the owners, it is recommended that the project advances to the commitment phase*\" and to its witness Mr. Williams' testimony that \"*a major mining house is not going to put a feasibility study out if they don't believe the project is economic.*\"1050\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 109. **Exhibit RE-133**, p. 1. Transcript (Day 3), p. 586.\n\n996.\n\nClaimant rejects Pakistan's assertion that the 10% discount rate used for the \"*base case*\" in the Feasibility Study was too low \"*in this sort of part of the world*\" and claims that the discount rate was selected by the highly experienced mining industry professionals on TCC's Board of Directors, most of whom also served on the boards of Barrick Gold or Antofagasta who were planning to contribute to the project US$ 1.5 billion of their own funds as equity.1051\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 110.\n\n997.\n\nClaimant also argues that the IRR of 12.3% in the base case scenario was not \"*worryingly low*\" as alleged by Respondent, since Barrick and Antofagasta did not require a particularly high rate of return, given their very low cost of capital and easy access to debt capital as a result of long track records in conducting successful mining ventures*.*1052 Claimant emphasizes that the project was highly sensitive to metals prices and refers to the statement in the Feasibility Study that \"*there is significant upside considering current trend on metal prices*,\" which would have resulted in a considerably higher IRR at the time the Application was rejected.1053\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111. Transcript (Day 5), pp. 1226-1227, 1423.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112 referring to **Exhibit RE-133**, p. 6. See also Mr. Livesey's testimony: \"*The big issues here are the infrastructure requirements and the sensitivities are the metals prices. If, for example, you took today's long-term metal price predictions over the ones we put into the study here, the IRR would be virtually double what it is in this study.*\" Transcript (Day 4), p. 1094 lines 16-22. Mr. Livesey further stated that \"*if you were to take today's prices on copper and gold, you would actually be off the chart* \u2026 *and your IRR would be somewhere close to 20 percent*.\" Transcript (Day 5), p. 1415 lines 16-19. Claimant further contends that IRR and Net Present Value (NPV) are generally not considered to be useful measures for a long-term project (in this case, 56 years) and refers to its witness Mr. Luksic testifying that the expansions of a mine, which were not taken into account in the Feasibility Study, tended to produce even more substantial returns than the starter project. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 113. Transcript (Day 3), p. 632 lines 11-17.\n\n998.\n\nWith regard to the tax regime, Claimant asserts that it was reasonable to assume that the project would be granted EPZ status for at least part of the project life, given that (a) this status has been regularly granted to major investments in the mining sector, including the mining projects at Saindak and Duddar in Balochistan and, in 2002, TCC's own Tanjeel project; and (b) TCC expected to have Balochistan's support in the negotiations with the GOP once the Mining Lease was granted, as this would have been in Balochistan's own interest.1054 In any event, Claimant claims that the project would have remained profitable even without EPZ status and cites the Feasibility Study, which noted that \"*even in the case that TCC is not granted certain tax incentives requested, the project still show attractive economic results in the Normal tax regime*.\"1055\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117. **Exhibit RE-133**, p. 27.\n\n999.\n\nIn relation to the royalty rate, Claimant states that TCC assumed a 2% rate because, as explained in the Feasibility Study, the increase to a 5% rate adopted in July 2009 had not yet entered into force and there were still ongoing negotiations regarding the royalty rate. In addition, Claimant refers to its witness Mr. Livesey who stated that, while a 5% royalty rate would have had a \"*substantial impact*\" on the project, it would not have resulted in negative cash flows.1056\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 118 referring to Transcript (Day 5) pp. 1206-1209.\n\n1000.\n\nClaimant further rejects Respondent's allegation that TCC would not have been able to obtain third-party funding for the project and notes that TCC's owners are \"*two of the world's leading mining companies*,\" which have access to substantial debt capital. Claimant submits that, while it expected the Governments to resume negotiations once the mining lease was granted and ultimately to enter into a Mineral Agreement, the project could also potentially have been financed without a Mineral Agreement, as testified by its witness Mr. Livesey during the Hearing.1057\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119 referring to Transcript (Day 5) pp. 1235-1237.\n\n1001.\n\nWith regard to security risks, Claimant notes that, besides a chapter on security and another one on risk, the Feasibility Study contains a risk register in which the risks are catalogued, assigned a mitigation strategy and tracked with respect to progress and mitigation level. In addition, Claimant submits that the costs associated with the security plans were included in the project's finances as part of the operating and capital expense estimates, including contingencies amounting to more than half a billion dollars in the capital expense estimates.1058\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120.\n\n**(ii) The Pipeline Plan Was Sensible and Feasible**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1002.\n\nClaimant submits that TCC's decision to transport the concentrate from Reko Diq to the port of Gwadar through a slurry pipeline was taken only after extensive studies had been conducted, which compared the costs and benefits of a pipeline to those of road transport and rail and concluded that the pipeline was the \"*safest and most economical option,*\"*inter alia*, because of \"*several distinct security advantages*\" over the other options: (a) securing operations required less manpower; (b) the transport via pipeline was less susceptible to theft; and (c) it involved and benefited local residents.1059\n\nReply, \u00b6 429; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123 referring to **Exhibit CE-219**, pp. 41, 45-46, 63.\n\n1003.\n\nClaimant further states that it informed the GOB as early as December 2007 that a pipeline was one of the transport options and repeatedly raised the option thereafter.1060 While Claimant acknowledges that the GOB expressed its interest in having TCC build a road to Gwadar, it claims that the GOB never raised any concerns that a pipeline would be unviable for any reason, including security concerns. Claimant also notes that Pakistan's witness Mr. Yaqoob admitted during the Hearing that he was not aware of any discussions within the GOB regarding security concerns relating to TCC's project.1061\n\nReply, \u00b6 430; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125 referring to Transcript (Day 7) p. 1925.\n\n1004.\n\nClaimant contends that TCC had prepared \"*detailed plans to provide adequate security during both the construction and operation phases*,\" the costs of which were included in the project's operating and capital expense estimates. Claimant refers, *inter alia*, to its intention to create incentives for local tribes and communities to become involved in the pipeline's maintenance and security.1062\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 125.\n\n1005.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Reko Diq pipeline cannot be compared to the \"*politically charged*\" Sui gas pipeline, as it would have measured only eight inches in diameter, would have been buried several feet underground and would have transported non-flammable slurry. In addition, Claimant notes that the pipeline would have transported the slurry of a project in which Balochistan held a 25% interest and emphasizes that there have not been any major security incidents at Reko Diq during the years of exploration activities or even after TCC had to abandon its assets at the project site.1063\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 126.\n\n**(iii) TCC's Water Source Selection Was Based on Sound Analysis**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1006.\n\nAs to the water source for the project, Claimant submits that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, the water study was investigated to full feasibility level, except for the areas located outside of Pakistan.1064\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 131.\n\n1007.\n\nClaimant states that it selected the fan sediments (also known as \"*Baghicha*\") as the project's water source because there were no competing users and TCC's testing revealed that it contained \"*ample quantities*\" of water. Claimant emphasizes that the largest part of the water is located on the Pakistani side of the border and claims that any impact on the Afghan side would be minimal.1065\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n1008.\n\nFinally, Claimant notes that for its own Reko Diq project, Balochistan also selected the Baghicha aquifer for the same reasons: \"*No other groundwater user*,\" a \"[l]*arge volume of groundwater storage*\" and \"[m]*ost* [of the] *area of resource is* [located] *in Pakistan*.\"1066\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 132 quoting **Exhibit CE-372**, pp. 12-13.\n\n**ii. Pakistan Breached Article 3(2) by the Takeover of Reko Diq**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1009.\n\nClaimant asserts that Balochistan's decision to deny the Mining Lease Application can only be explained by Balochistan's plan to take over TCC's project and develop a Balochistan-only project, which started in early 2009. Claimant submits that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, Balochistan's project was in direct conflict with TCC's project. According to Claimant, Balochistan knew it had to overcome TCC's right to mine Reko Diq and therefore instructed the Licensing Authority to deny TCC's Mining Lease Application so that Balochistan could implement its own project.1067\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 134-135.\n\n1010.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Governments' repeated assurances to TCC that Balochistan's project would be complementary to that of TCC until the submission of TCC's Feasibility Study in August 2010, while Balochistan was already planning to take over the Project, constitute a \"*flagrant violation*\" of Respondent's good faith obligation under the FET standard.1068 Claimant further argues that Balochistan's preference for its own \"*indigenous*\" project constitutes \"*differential treatment*\" of TCC \"*motivated by a preference for other investments over foreign-owned investments*\" and therefore violates Article 3(2).1069\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 441.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 488 referring to *Saluka v Czech Republic* [**CA-44**], \u00b6 307.\n\n1011.\n\nIn addition, Claimant asserts that Pakistan and Balochistan started in 2008 to solicit and entertain a competing offer from MCC, as part of which they invited MCC to the Steering Committee meeting in January 2009. Claimant contends that despite the assurances following this meeting that it was \"*officially decided to decline the proposal of MCC*,\" the Governments continued their negotiations with MCC in 2009, and refers to (a) a letter sent by MCC to the Embassy of Pakistan; (b) local media reports according to which MCC made an additional proposal in 2010; and (c) attempts of MCC employees to enter the Reko Diq site in 2012.1070\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 391-394 referring to **Exhibits CE-69**, p. 2, **CE-339**, pp. 1-2, **CE-32**, p. 2, and **CE-149**, p. 1. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 155\n\n**(a) With Federal Assistance, Balochistan Developed a PC-1 Proposal for a Balochistan-Only Project at Reko Diq**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1012.\n\nClaimant submits that between May and December 2009, Pakistan's Planning Commission developed a \"*proposal for mining and refining copper in the Reko Diq area of Balochistan*\" and, even though TCC had been performing exploration work at Reko Diq for more than eight years, the Governments initially did not inform TCC about this proposal.1071\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 431 quoting Mubarakmand I, \u00b6 6.

Claimant emphasizes that the Licensing Authority as well as the appellate authority were offices held by the Director General, respectively the Secretary, of the MMDD, *i.e.*, the same department that was involved in the implementation of Balochistan's project.1109\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 449-451; Reply, \u00b6 405, 408, 410.\n\n**(f) Having Ousted TCC, Balochistan Completed the Takeover by Replicating TCC's Project**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1036.\n\nClaimant submits that in 2012, the Governments began to implement their own project and contends that this project \"*replicated the very project set forth in the Mining Lease Application Balochistan denied.*\" Claimant refers to the following facts:1110 (i) the area over which Balochistan sought rights was identical in size, shape and location to the mining area proposed by TCC;1111 (ii) Balochistan expressly reserved not only Tanjeel, but also H14 and H15;1112 (iii) Balochistan planned to use the same water source that TCC had chosen for its project; and (iv) Balochistan originally contemplated requesting a relaxation of rule 48(1) given that it did not hold an exploration license.1113\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185.\n\n**Exhibits CE-272**, p. 16 and **CE-283**, p. 15.\n\n**Exhibit CE-373**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-283**, p. 5.

The Mineral Agreement Negotiations and Supreme Court Proceedings Provide No Defense and Further Demonstrate the Governments' Treaty Breaches**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1037.\n\nClaimant claims that the Mineral Agreement negotiations and the Supreme Court decision confirm the Governments' intent to take over Reko Diq and demonstrate the unfair and inequitable treatment that TCC was accorded.1114\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 187, 188-202 and 203-214.\n\n**(a) The Absence of a Mineral Agreement Does Not Excuse Pakistan's Breaches**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1038.\n\nClaimant submits that the failure to agree on the terms of a Mineral Agreement was not a valid basis for denying TCC's application, as TCC's right to obtain a mining lease did not depend on the issues discussed at the negotiations for the Mineral Agreement. Claimant argues that TCC was not required to agree to the additional benefits that the Governments sought in these negotiations, in particular to construct a billion-dollar smelter, and points out that, under the 2002 BM Rules, a mineral agreement is not mandatory and its absence is not listed in rule 48 (nor is it mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject) as a reason for denying the mining lease application.1115\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 401.\n\n1039.\n\nIn addition, Claimant claims that the Governments' conduct during the negotiations \"*underscores the overall unfair and inequitable treatment TCC received*,\" given that at least by December 2009, Balochistan had decided *not* to conclude a mineral agreement with TCC, as a consequence of its decision to take over the project rather than of its opposition to TCC's negotiation position in principle.1116\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 192-193.\n\n1040.\n\nClaimant asserts that there was no justification for the Government's refusal to engage in further good-faith negotiations. With regard to Pakistan's argument that TCC attempted to \"*exempt itself entirely*\" from the 2002 BM Rules relying on TCC's first 2007 draft of the Mineral Agreement and its definition of the \"*Overall Development Plan,*\" Claimant contends that the purpose of this clause was to make it unnecessary to obtain further regulatory approvals in the future so long as the activity was contemplated by an overall plan to be agreed jointly by TCC and Balochistan. In any event, neither the Overall Development Plan nor \"*an automatic right to mine*\" was mentioned in any of the follow-up correspondence about the Mineral Agreement and thus dropped out of the negotiations after the parties' initial drafts.1117\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195.\n\n1041.\n\nClaimant argues that TCC rather continued to pursue the \"*concept of stability*\" and sought to correct a \"*defect*\" in the 2002 BM Rules, which, while providing for mineral agreements, rendered them ineffective by having later changes in the rules take precedence over their terms. Claimant submits that Balochistan agreed to this point in principle and refers to a working paper prepared by Mr. Khokhar for the third Steering Committee meeting in which he noted that the parties \"*have resolved main issues of DMA i.e. regulatory issues, infrastructure, stability provisions, fiscal system and dispute resolution*\" and listed as one of the remaining issues to be discussed: \"***drafting** of legal issues relating to exemption from Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 2002*.\"1118\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 196 quoting **Exhibit CE-71**, p. 3 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n1042.\n\nClaimant claims that the reasonableness of TCC's proposal is further confirmed by the fact that Pakistan subsequently adopted that proposal in its 2013 NMP, which provides that the \"*existing Mineral Rules will be amended to remove any conflict/overlapping with or other effect on, and to give effect to, the rights and obligations of the mining company under the mineral agreement in line with best international practices*.\"1119\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 198. **Exhibit CE-416**, p. 9.\n\n1043.\n\nReferring to Pakistan's allegation that TCC was not willing to accept anything other than a 2% royalty rate, Claimant submits that, to the contrary, in October 2008 when Balochistan still had a royalty rate of 2% on copper and gold, TCC offered a rate that would increase over time from 2% to 4%, but instead of negotiating the issue, Balochistan rather amended the 2002 BM Rules, raising the royalty to 5%.1120 Claimant claims that its subsequent return to the 2% proposal was due to the fact that it also offered an overall fiscal package to the Governments, including \"*other substantial financial benefits*,\" favorable financing on Balochistan's equity interest, social investment, etc., to which the Governments never responded.1121\n\nClaimant notes, however, that to the best of its knowledge, the amendment was never officially gazetted and thus never entered into force. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199.\n\n1044.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's arguments that TCC was not willing to build a smelter or provide some comparable large-scale infrastructure development in Pakistan, Claimant argues that it repeatedly explained to the Governments that it was not in the smelter business and that it would cost approximately US$ 1 billion to build a smelter, which was \"*unprofitable and environmentally risky.*\" TCC also refers to the technical \"*white paper*\" about smelting that it provided to Balochistan and its offer to pay US$ 1 million in order to assist Balochistan in conducting its own smelter feasibility study to which Balochistan never responded.1122\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 200. **Exhibit CE-237**.\n\n1045.\n\nClaimant concludes that the Government's refusal to further negotiate with TCC was thus not caused by TCC's allegedly unreasonable demands, but rather was part of the \"*pattern of unfair and inequitable treatment towards TCC*.\"1123\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 201-202.\n\n**(b) Balochistan Cannot Use the Supreme Court Proceedings to Avoid International Liability**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1046.\n\nClaimant submits that Balochistan's conduct in \"*procuring*\" the Supreme Court judgment provides further evidence of its attempt to defeat TCCA's legal rights and international arbitration remedies and thus of Pakistan's Treaty breach.1124 In Claimant's view, Pakistan and Balochistan intended to deprive this Tribunal as well as the ICC Tribunal of jurisdiction in an attempt to escape liability under international law.1125\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 203.\n\nReply, \u00b6 450.\n\n1047.\n\nClaimant refers to (i) Balochistan's 18 February 2012 submission in which, for the first time, it took the position that the CHEJVA violated the 2002 BM Rules and that the Supreme Court had the power to declare it void *ab initio;* and (ii) Balochistan's March 2012 request that the Supreme Court overturn the judgment of the Balochistan High Court, which had upheld the validity of the CHEJVA.1126\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 204. *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 442-443.\n\n1048.\n\nIn relation to Pakistan's argument that Balochistan's reversed position was based on the conclusion of former Advocate General Kanrani that the record of the GOB's actions concerning the CHEJVA was \"*riddled with discrepancies and irregularities,*\" Claimant notes that Respondent cannot explain (i) why this evidence of invalidity was discovered only after TCC had initiated the arbitrations against the Governments, even though litigation on these issues had been ongoing for years before the Pakistani courts; (ii) why no other Government official ever came to the same conclusion during the twenty-year history of the CHEJVA Agreements; and (iii) why Mr. Kanrani filed only one-sentence submissions, stating that the Petitioners' arguments about the invalidity of the CHEJVA were correct even though they had not had access to the record he reviewed.1127\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 205. Claimant further argues that due to Mr. Kanrani's \"*obstructionist approach*\" to cross-examination, the Tribunal received no explanation from Mr. Kanrani so the record must speak for itself.\n\n1049.\n\nClaimant argues that Balochistan instead hoped that the Supreme Court \"*would find a way to eviscerate TCC's rights*\" that were to be vindicated by this Tribunal as well as by the ICC Tribunal.1128 Claimant refers to Balochistan's 20 December 2012 submission to the Supreme Court:\n\n\"*If this Honourable Court upholds the CHEJVA and other documentation, then the Memorial will state accordingly and the Government of Balochistan and the Government of Pakistan shall proceed to contest the matter on the merits on CHEJVA and other agreements. On the other hand if this Honourable Court declares CHEJVA void* ab *init[i]o, then the Government will argue before ICSID that an illegal investment is not protected by BIT and before ICC that arbitrations should end since the agreement from which it derives its jurisdiction has been struck down*.\"1129\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 207. **Exhibit CE-376**, \u00b6 51.\n\n1050.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the Supreme Court \"*heeded Balochistan's request*\" when it issued a short Order on 7 January 2013 and invalidated every agreement that Balochistan had said gave TCC rights at Reko Diq. Claimant notes that this invalidation included two contracts to which neither Pakistan nor Balochistan were parties, as they were concluded between Australian entities and were governed by Australian law.1130\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 208. **Exhibit CE-289**. Claimant refers to the Option Agreement between BHP and Mincor and the Alliance Agreement between BHP and TCCA.\n\n1051.\n\nAs regards the reasoned Supreme Court judgment issued on 10 May 2013, Claimant notes that the Court copied entire passages *verbatim* from Balochistan's pleadings, including issues that it should have properly assessed for itself, such as the alleged improper intent of GOB officials or private parties.1131 According to Claimant, the judgment was rendered based on \"*a cold, incomplete record and without the benefit of any contemporaneous testimony*\" as well as \"*a number of technicalities*\" and disregarded undertakings and assurances given by Pakistan and Balochistan over a fifteen-year period that the CHEJVA was valid and enforceable and TCC was entitled to mine Reko Diq.1132\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 209 comparing **Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 105, 108 to **Exhibit CE-376**, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48-49, 56.\n\nReply, \u00b6 445. Claimant also refers to the discussion of ICSID jurisprudence on the impact of corruption on jurisdiction and admissibility of claims at the end of the judgment, even though such case law had not been argued before the Court and was not relevant to its decision on the constitutional petitions pending before it. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 446-447; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 209 referring to **Exhibit RE-18**, \u00b6\u00b6 118-122.\n\n1052.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's allegation that TCCA is bound by the Supreme Court judgment and submits that only TCCP appeared before the Supreme Court. Claimant argues that despite Balochistan's attempts to convince them otherwise, both the Supreme Court and the ICC Tribunal confirmed that TCCA was not present in the Supreme Court proceedings.1133 In relation to the \"*Chronological Overview of Pakistan Court Proceedings*\" provided by Respondent during the Hearing, Claimant notes that each of the four submissions listed as allegedly filed by TCCA was in fact filed by Respondent No. 4, which was TCCP.1134\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 210-212 referring to **Exhibits RE-58(x)(e)**, p. 10, **RE-58(IX)(m)**, **RE-48(VI)(ak)**, p. 149 and ICC Preliminary Issues Rulings, \u00b6\u00b6 147, 165-172.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 213.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1053.\n\nRespondent submits that there were legitimate reasons for the Licensing Authority to reject the Mining Lease Application and asserts that Claimant was not denied any due process rights. In addition, Respondent claims that neither Pakistan nor Balochistan had a plan to \"*oust TCCA*\" from Reko Diq in order to implement Balochistan's project.1135 Finally, Respondent rejects Claimant's allegation that the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and in the Supreme Court proceedings adds to a composite breach of the FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.1136\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 443.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\n**i. The Rejection of the Mining Lease Application Was in Accordance with the 2002 BM Rules**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1054.\n\nRespondent submits that, in its analysis whether the rejection of the Mining Lease Application constituted a breach of Respondent's FET obligation, \"*it is no part of the Tribunal's function to second-guess or substitute its view for the decision taken by the Licensing Authority on any given ground within the framework of the BMR*.\"1137 According to Respondent, Claimant has to prove that the Licensing Authority exercised its discretion \"*outrageously, in bad faith or in neglect of duty, or at a minimum unreasonably*\" in respect of each of the grounds for its decision. Respondent claims that in case Claimant fails to discharge this burden of proof on any one single ground, its claim must fail.1138\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 75.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 77.\n\n1055.\n\nReferring to Claimant's allegation that the Licensing Authority arbitrarily rejected the Mining Lease Application, Respondent submits that the term \"*arbitrary*\" has been described by the tribunal in *Lauder v. Czech Republic* as \"*founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact*.\"1139 Respondent also claims that the International Court of Justice stated in the *ELSI* case that even if a measure is unwise, inefficient or not the best course of action in the circumstances, it is not arbitrary if there is some rational relationship to the alleged objective of the measure.1140\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 444 referring to *Lauder v. Czech Republic* [CA-62], \u00b6 221.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 445 referring to *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Award of 20 July 1989 (\"*ELSI*\") [RLA-99]. Respondent also refers to the tribunal in *Enron v. Argentina*, which stated: \"*The measures adopted might have been good or bad*... *but they were not arbitrary in that they were what the Government believed and understood was the best response to the unfolding crisis. Irrespective of the question of intention, a finding of arbitrariness requires that some important measure of impropriety is manifest, and this is not found in a process which although far from being desirable is nonetheless not entirely surprising in the context it took place.*\"*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award of 22 May 2007 (\"*Enron v. Argentina*\") [CA-46], \u00b6\u00b6 264-266.\n\n1056.\n\nRespondent notes that in the present case, the Licensing Authority was prohibited by rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules from granting the mining lease unless the various subjective and objective requirements set out in this provision had been satisfied by the applicant. In Respondent's view, the Feasibility Study that TCCP submitted as part of its Application was \"*manifestly deficient*\"; therefore, the Licensing Authority was in fact bound to reject, but in any event did not act arbitrarily when it did reject, the Application.1141\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 446, 447.\n\n**(a) The Five Grounds for Rejection Identified in the Notice of Intent to Reject**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1057.\n\nRespondent submits that the Notice of Intent to Reject identifies at least five grounds for rejecting the Mining Lease Application under rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules. With regard to the fourth and fifth grounds, Respondent acknowledges that they are not set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject \"*as clearly as they might have been*,\" but claims that they nevertheless \"*were referred to, were evidently in the minds of the Licensing Authority at the time, and constituted objectively justified reasons*\" for rejecting the Application. In Respondent's view, these two grounds should therefore be taken into consideration as well.1142\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79 referring to **Exhibit CE-354**, \u00b6\u00b6 (ii)-(viii).\n\n**(i) Ground One: TCCP Lacked Standing to Make the Mining Lease Application1143**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 80. Grounds 5 and 6 of the Notice of Intent to Reject.\n\n1058.\n\nRespondent submits that the Licensing Authority's view that TCCP (alone) was not the \"*holder of* [an] *exploration licence*\" within the meaning of rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, and therefore lacked standing to make the Mining Lease Application, was \"*factually accurate*,\" given that the Exploration License (EL-5) was held by the Joint Venture in which TCC[P] had a 75% interest and the BDA had a 25% interest*.*1144\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.\n\n1059.\n\nRespondent notes that Ground 6 of the Notice of Intent to Reject refers to Claimant's letter of 3 March 2011 by which it sought to initiate negotiations for the acquisition of its partner's interest in the Joint Venture in accordance with Article 11.4 of the CHEJVA. Article 11.4 requires Claimant to acquire the transfer of the joint venture partner's interest before it can undertake a sole risk joint venture, subject to compliance with all required Government approvals to enable it to do so. According to Respondent, this demonstrates that Claimant never sought to do so before it filed its Application, despite the fact that it had given an express undertaking that it would comply with all of its obligations under the CHEJVA and the Licensing Authority had made this a condition for approving the assignment of BHP's interest in the Exploration License EL-5 to Claimant in 2006.1145\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 558.\n\n1060.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submits that the Licensing Authority noted in Ground 1 that, even though the Joint Venture was the holder of Exploration License EL-5, it would not have been eligible to file the Application either because it was not a \"*body corporate*\" in Pakistan as required by rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules.1146\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 559-560.\n\n1061.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that the rejection was reasonable under rule 48(2), which provides that:\n\n\"*the Licensing Authority shall not grant a mining lease*... *if*... *any person other than the applicant holds any exploration licence conferring an exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in that area*.\"1147\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(1).\n\n1062.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that pursuant to rule 23(1)(a), all exploration licenses are, by default, exclusive, which is why the right of the BDA to carry out exploration activities was \"*exclusive*.\" In Respondent's view, the Licensing Authority was therefore \"*duty bound*\" to reject the Application under rule 48(2), but in any event, the decision was not \"*outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect of duty, or unreasonable*.\"1148\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n**(ii) Ground Two: The Mining Lease Application Failed to Provide \"*****Value Addition*****\"1149**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87. Ground 9 of the Notice of Intent to Reject.\n\n1063.\n\nRespondent claims that the Licensing Authority rejected the Mining Lease Application because it did not provide value addition in the form of a smelter and refinery. Respondent refers to rules 48(3)(a)(ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) and notes in particular that rule 48(3)(b)(vii) requires \"*a concrete proposal for value addition for the Ore to be produced/exploited from the applicant's mining lease within the country is submitted, or if the facility is not available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of the province with the prior approval of the Provincial Government.*\"1150 According to Respondent, Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey acknowledged during the Hearing that the amendment to the 2002 BM Rules of 1 October 2010, by which \"*value addition*\" was included as an express requirement, had been gazetted and that Claimant was aware of this requirement when it filed its Application.1151\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 566.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89 referring to Transcript (Day 5), pp. 1316-1318 line 2.\n\n1064.\n\nRespondent submits that the decision of the Licensing Authority on this issue clearly involved the exercise of discretion, which the Tribunal may only gainsay if it considers that the invocation of this ground was \"*outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect of duty*...*, or at the very least unreasonable*.\"1152 According to Respondent, Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs conceded that local smelting/refining was a legitimate objective and that, in its evaluation whether the Application was satisfactory, the Licensing Authority was entitled to take this objective into account.1153\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92 referring to Transcript (day 4), p. 822 line 14 to p. 823 line 8.\n\n1065.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"*value addition*\" in this case was the need for smelting/refining capacities within the country, as it had been repeatedly stressed during the Mineral Agreement negotiations.1154 Respondent contends that, despite the fact that the GOB had pursued its \"*core objective of securing local smelting/refining in the interests of the people of Balochistan and Pakistan to ensure a transfer of metals technology and skills, and job creation*\" and emphasized the need for \"*such local benefits in order to obtain a social licence to operate*,\" Claimant nevertheless intended to export all of the concentrate via a pipeline to the sea, which would not bring any local benefits to the tribal people, and did not address this issue at all in its Application.1155\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 453.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 568.\n\n1066.\n\nRespondent argues that \"*it was very far from being outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect of duty, and equally far from being unreasonable*\" for the Licensing Authority to conclude that smelting/refining was required under the rule 48(3)(a), in particular given that smelting/refining was envisaged in the \"*value addition of the ore*\" requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(vii), as confirmed by the MMDD Summary of 11 June 2010 seeking the Chief Minister's approval for the 1 October 2010 amendment to the 2002 BM Rules, and was consistent with the GOB's desire for a local smelter/refinery.1156\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 93, 94. **Exhibit CE-345**, \u00b6 2.\n\n1067.\n\nRespondent submits that in light of Claimant's failure, in its Mining Lease Application and again in its Interim Response, to address local smelting/refining or to offer to supply the Government's smelter with ore/concentrate (as Respondent claims it had been agreed) and also taking into account \"*the long history of discussions on this key issue,*\" the Licensing Authority was duty bound, but in any event entitled, to reject the Application as \"*unsatisfactory*\" and \"*not in the interests of the development of the mineral resources*\" as set out in paragraph 10 of the Notice of Intent to Reject.1157\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 94-96. **Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 10.\n\n**(iii) Ground Three: The Mining Lease Application Was Incomplete and Failed to Ensure the Efficient, Beneficial and Timely Use of the Mineral Resources1158**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 97. Grounds 2, 3, 7, 8 and 10 of the Notice of Intent to Reject.\n\n1068.\n\nRespondent notes that the Feasibility Study undisputedly covered only two of the 14 deposits over which the mining lease was sought and asserts that Claimant had no plan to develop the other 12 deposits, given that there was only an undisclosed Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study for developing some, but not all, of them.1159\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n1069.\n\nRespondent claims that Claimant knew that the Feasibility Study should have covered all of the discovered deposits, not just within the mining lease area, but rather within the larger area of Exploration License EL-5, and refers to the minutes of the OC Meeting of 26 October 2007:\n\n\"*TCC pointed out that EL-5 is to expire in February, 2008 and an application for renewal of the licence has to be filed with the Government of Balochistan by November 22, 2007. **TCC stated that given the wide area over which discoveries had been made and the time that would be needed to carry out the feasibility study to tie all the deposit together** ... **TCC was recommending that the request for renewal be over 90% of the existing EL-5 area and that the term of the renewal be three years***.\"1160\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 100 quoting **Exhibit CE-64**, Item 5 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1070.\n\nRespondent further refers to Claimant's second renewal application, filed on 2 November 2007:\n\n\"[t]*he Applicant faced a number of technical and other challenges which have or will affect its ability to complete a **full** feasibility study during the first renewal period.*... *With EL-5 to expire in February, 2008 the Applicant will be able to commence activities for drawing up the Feasibility study in the first renewal period but will not be able to complete the same given the time that will be needed **to carry out the Feasibility Study to tie the development of all the deposits, which are spread over a large area of EL-5***... ***together into one mining project.*** ... *the Applicant considers that it requires a renewal for the full three year period over 90% of the existing EL-5 area to be in a position **to fully develop the discoveries**.*\"1161\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 448; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101 quoting **Exhibit RE-15**, pp. 317-318 (original numbering) (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1071.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the reference to a \"*full*\" Feasibility Study reflected rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules which provides:\n\n\"*An application for the renewal of a licence shall*... *not be made*... *in the case of a second renewal, unless the applicant can satisfy the authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a **full feasibility study of the discovered deposits***.\"1162\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 449; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 28(2)(c)(iii) (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1072.\n\nRespondent submits that rule 29(2)(c)(iii) aims at ensuring the \"*efficient, beneficial and timely use of mineral resources*\" and therefore conditions a second renewal upon the submission of a feasibility study that covers all discovered deposits in the exploration area.1163 Respondent argues that, by failing to do so, Claimant acted wrongfully because it:1164\n\n(i) breached its promise under rule 29(2)(c)(iii) and was therefore in default pursuant to rule 48(3)(b);\n\n(ii) failed to demonstrate that its \"*proposed plans*... *will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources*\";1165\n\n(iii) failed to submit \"*the relevant feasibility studies*\" with its Mining Lease Application;1166\n\n(iv) breached its 2006 Undertaking to comply with the 2002 BM Rules;\n\n(v) failed to submit \"*satisfactory*\" proposals;1167 and\n\n(vi) failed to convince the Licensing Authority that \"*it is in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease.*\"1168\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 562.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 562.\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**.

Referring to Claimant's submission that the Quarterly Report for the period ending September 2007 made clear that the focus lay on H-14 and H-15, Respondent argues that there is no indication in this Quarterly Report, or elsewhere, that the GOB had agreed to limit the Feasibility Study to those two deposits. Respondent adds that in any event, such an agreement would have been contrary to rule 29(2)(c)(iii), which was intended to prevent that the development of further deposits would be blocked.1169 In Respondent's view, the Licensing Authority was therefore barred from granting the Application under rule 48(3)(b) which provides that \"*a mining lease shall not be granted*... *if at the time of the application the applicant in question is in default.*\"1170\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 109-111 referring to **Exhibit CE-8**, \u00b6 3.23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 452. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(b).\n\n1074.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimant intended to \"*flout*\" rule 48(3)(a)(ii) of the 2002 BM Rules by \"*land-banking*\" the mining lease area for 56 years, as it stated in its Interim Response that ore sites other than H14 and H15 \"***may** become viable*\" in the future and expressed its desire to avoid the inconvenience of having to submit further applications for mining leases if and when such an ore site became viable.1171 In Respondent's view, it would not \"*ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources*\" if Claimant were granted a mining lease over areas in which it had no present intention of mining and for which it had not submitted a feasibility study.1172 Therefore, Respondent claims that the Interim Response only confirmed the concerns of the Licensing Authority, which is why it reasonably concluded that the Application was incomplete and failed to *\"ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources*.\"1173\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113 referring to **Exhibit CE-8**, \u00b6 3.18(b) (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 456; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 565.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 114.\n\n**(iv) Ground Four: The Feasibility Study Failed to Demonstrate that the Mine Could Be Profitably Developed and Operated1174**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 115 referring to **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(a)(i).\n\n1075.\n\nRespondent claims that the GOB was concerned about the project's lack of economic viability and refers to the Feasibility Review Committee Report of January 2011 and the Summary for the Chief Minister of May 2011.1175 According to Respondent, the Licensing Authority is referring to this concern in paragraphs 2 and 7 (ii)-(iv) of the Notice of Intent to Reject.1176\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118 referring to **Exhibit RE-142** pp. 1, 2 and 15 and **Exhibit CE-354**, pp. 2-4.

However, Respondent claims that TCCP addressed this issue only in the \"*vaguest and most incomplete and unsatisfactory of terms*.\"1190 In Respondent's view, this was due to the fact that the \"*skinny*\" economics of the project and the absence of a Mineral Agreement made the project unfinanceable.1191\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 128-129 referring to **Exhibits CE-98**, Chapter 2.5.3 and **CE-97**, pp. 1-5 and 1-88.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 130\n\n1081.\n\nReferring to Claimant's argument that copper prices increased following the submission of the Feasibility Study and that Claimant's parent companies might have contributed additional funds to the project, Respondent emphasizes that the Licensing Authority could only judge the Application on the basis of the material provided to it; therefore, it had to conclude that TCCP had not established how it would raise the financial resources to fund the project and thus failed to satisfy rule 48(3)(a)(iii).1192\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 132.\n\n**(vi) There Were No Assurances to Claimant Which Would Have Rendered the Rejection of the Mining Lease Application Arbitrary**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1082.\n\nReferring to Claimant's argument that TCCA was assured prior to submitting its Application that the project was \"*in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan,*\" Respondent submits that these alleged assurances do not render the rejection of the Application by the Licensing Authority improper. Respondent notes that (a) four of the six statements that Claimant relies on were made in 2006/2007, *i.e.*, more than four years before the Feasibility Study and Application were submitted, and thus in an outdated context; (b) none of these statements were made by the Licensing Authority; and (c) all of these statements were very general and were not made on a review of the Application.1193\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 460.\n\n**(b) The Mining Lease Application Was Handled in Accordance with Due Process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1083.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's claim that Article 3(2) of the Treaty was breached because the Licensing Authority did not handle the Application in accordance with due process and argues as follows:1194\n\n(i) In accordance with rule 48(4) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Notice of Intent to Reject identified \"*at least three clear grounds*\" and referred to \"*two other objectively justified grounds*\" for rejecting the Application and Claimant was given the opportunity to respond to the Notice and make new proposals;1195\n\n(ii) Respondent submits in this regard that, despite the \"*succinct style*\" of the Licensing Authority's rejection letters, the reasoning behind the decision was adequate and sufficiently clear, in particular when taking into account that the reasons had been raised in the context of the Mineral Agreement negotiations. Noting that Claimant was made aware of this style by Mr. Lehri, Respondent claims that it reflects the \"*house style*\" in Balochistan, which is the only standard to which the Licensing Authority can be held.1196\n\n(iii) Claimant's Interim Response filed on 19 October 2011 showed that Claimant understood the grounds identified by the Licensing Authority; however, it did not address any of the legitimate concerns and requirements raised in the Notice of Intent to Reject, but rather adopted \"*an inflexible and adversarial stance*,\" which is why any \"*dialogue*\" would have been fruitless;1197\n\n(iv) Respondent claims that Claimant's \"*aggressive*\" legal response demonstrates that Claimant was not aware of the administrative environment into which it made its investment, and was unable to communicate effectively;1198\n\n(v) the Licensing Authority was not required under the 2002 BM Rules to meet, or \"*engage in any informal dialogue,*\" with Claimant and, in fact, it would have been improper for the Licensing Authority to do so;1199\n\n(vi) the 2002 BM Rules did not require the Licensing Authority to provide further reasons at the time the Application was finally rejected \u2013 beyond those set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject;1200 and\n\n(vii) Claimant did not make a due process complaint about the handling of the Application by the Licensing Authority before the Supreme Court or a complaint about the appeal decision of the Secretary of the MMDD, which it could have challenged before the High Court under Article 199 of the Pakistan Constitution.1201\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 133, 142.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 134-135.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 461, 465-466 referring to **Exhibit CE-84**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 136. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 553.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 461.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 137.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 138.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 139-141.\n\n**ii. There Was No Plan to Oust Claimant**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1084.\n\nRespondent claims that in order to succeed with its \"*ouster theory,*\" Claimant must establish both that the alleged ouster plan existed at the relevant point in time and that such plan played a causative role in the rejection of the Application.1202\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143, 144.\n\n1085.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant acknowledged at the Hearing that: (a) \"[t]*here was no express repudiation* [of the CHEJVA]\";1203 (b) the parties continued to negotiate in 2010 after the Cabinet's (provisional) 24 December 2009 decision;1204 and (c) the negotiations in 2010 contemplated that Claimant would supply ore/concentrate to the Government's project, which demonstrates that Respondent acted on the assumption that Claimant would be granted a mining lease.1205\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 145 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 104 lines 13, 19-20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 145-146.\n\n1086.\n\nRespondent submits that the Application was rejected on the grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject and argues that, \"[w]*hatever might have seemed to have been the case from scraps of evidence as to the position months or years beforehand, there was absolutely no ouster plan as at the time when the MLA came to be considered, and was rejected*.\"1206\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 147.\n\n**(a) MCC's Expression of Interest in Mining Reko Diq**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1087.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant has not established that the GOB intended to give Claimant's project to MCC or that the Application was rejected on this ground and notes that the Governments decided to reject MCC's proposal in early 2009, *i.e.*, two years before the Application was submitted, as Mr. Khokhar confirmed in his testimony.1207\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 150-152 referring to Exhibits **CE-71** and **RE-78** as well as to Khokhar I, \u00b6 44 and Transcript (Day 7) p 1871 line 11 to p. 1873 line 10. *See* Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 463, 222-223.

According to Respondent, the Governments showed only \"*polite interest,*\" but were not motivated by a plan to oust Claimant from Reko Diq in the invitation to submit a further proposal.1209\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 229-233 referring to **Exhibit CE-339**. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154 referring to Khokhar II, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44 and Transcript (Day 7) p. 1874 line 21 to p. 1876 line 7. Respondent notes that the MPNR was not even responsible for approving mining projects in Balochistan and simply forwarded the proposal; in any event, no further steps were taken und MCC has never been awarded any mining rights in Reko Diq. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\n1090.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that there is no evidence that MCC's proposal (rejected in 2009) played any causative role in the rejection of the Application in late 2011.1210\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156.\n\n**(b) The GOB's Reko Diq Project Was a Complementary Smelter Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1091.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant's second argument that the GOB wanted to mine Reko Diq itself and this caused the Mining Lease Application to be rejected is contradictory to its first argument, *i.e.*, that Respondent wanted to give the project to MCC.1211 In addition, Respondent submits that the GOB never intended to mine, but rather to secure a local smelter/refinery in Balochistan, as demonstrated by Article 5.5 of the GOB's August 2008 draft of the Mineral Agreement.1212 Respondent argues that the GOB's own smelter proposal was caused by Claimant's unwillingness to accommodate the GOB's desire for a smelter and claims that, if Claimant had changed its mind at any time, the GOB would not have needed its own smelter project.1213\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 462; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 157.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 159 referring to **Exhibit CE-216**, pp. 23-24. Article 5 is entitled \"*Mining Facilities for Mining Projects*\" and refers to the responsibilities of the Mineral Title Holder relating to the Mining Facilities.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 160.\n\n1092.\n\nAccording to Respondent, all three versions of the PC-1 proposal show that the GOB's project was complementary to Claimant's mining project and not competitive with it. Respondent emphasizes that the (only) reference to mining in the third PC-1 proposal contemplates the possibility of mining 15,000 t/d to supply the smelter, based on a budget of approximately US$ 100 million (compared to US$ 3.8 billion allocated by Claimant in order to mine the proposed 110,000 t/d).1214\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 161.\n\n1093.\n\nRespondent notes that the budget in Balochistan's project was actually allocated to \"*costs of ore*\" and argues that the Governments had not yet made a decision whether to purchase the ore from the CHEJVA or another mining project or whether to conduct the limited mining required to supply their smelter themselves.1215 In addition, Respondent submits that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, the heavy machinery listed in the \"*Funds Required*\" document was not required for mining operations, but rather for processing.1216\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 204-205 referring to Mubarakmand, \u00b6 29.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 206 referring to **Exhibit CE-242**.\n\n1094.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Governments communicated to Claimant from the outset that they were considering options for setting up a smelter/refinery in Pakistan and refers to the Working Papers circulated prior to the second Steering Committee meeting on 23 January 2009 and the third Steering Committee meeting on 13 March 2009, as well as to Claimant's notes of its meetings with Chief Secretary Lehri on 4 March 2010 and on 2 June 2010.1217\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199 referring to **Exhibits CE-69** and **CE-71** and Lehri, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 77.\n\n1095.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's reliance on the 24 December 2009 Working Paper, Respondent claims that this document is \"*merely a discussion paper*\" and does not reflect what actually happened at or after the Cabinet meeting.1218 Respondent also refers to the Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting on 24 December 2009 and puts particular emphasis on the decision \"*in principle*\" to take over Claimant's project, but also a decision that the \"*future course of action would be decided by the Chief Minister*,\" meaning that the Chief Minister had a free hand. Respondent further argues that the Chief Minister did not decide to \"*take over*\" the project, but rather opted to continue negotiations with Claimant in 2010 and even 2011, and actually wanted to buy concentrate from it.1219 In Respondent's view, this was accepted by Claimant at the Hearing.1220\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162 referring to **Exhibit RE-62**.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 463, 247-248; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 163 referring to **Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 164 referring to Transcript (Day 1) p. 145 line 5.\n\n1096.\n\nIn support of its argument that the Government continued to negotiate with Claimant in good faith and wanted the project to proceed, Respondent refers to a meeting of the Chief Minister with Claimant in January 2010 and a further meeting between Chief Secretary Lehri and Claimant on 4 March 2010 in which Mr. Lehri stated, according to Claimant's notes, that \"*in his assessment TCC (Antofagasta/Barrick) was the best company to implement the Reko Diq project*.\"1221 However, Respondent notes that Mr. Lehri also pointed out the need to develop a lobby in support of the project and that TCC should agree to supply 25% of their output to the Government smelter, contribute to building a road from Gwadar to Reko Diq, set up 20-25 scholarships for students from western Balochistan at the Khuzdar University of Technology and Engineering and make public its plans for large scale training of Baloch people being prepared by TCC to meet its commitment to employ as many Baloch people as possible \u2013 in order to maintain a \"*social licence to operate*.\"1222\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 252 quoting **Exhibit CE-84**. Respondent claims that the Government's report to the MPNR of 28 September 2010 also confirms that there were ongoing negotiations as it stated: \"*TCCP has been asked to submit it* [sic] *revised proposals on the subject as per GoB's principled stance for future consideration.*\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 257 quoting **Exhibit RE-143**.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253 referring to **Exhibit CE-84**. Respondent also refers to a second meeting between Chief Secretary Lehri and Claimant on 2 June 2010 in which Mr. Lehri again advised Claimant to be \"*more proactive*\" and \"*to step up its PR efforts in the province.*\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 246 quoting **Exhibit CE-90**.\n\n1097.\n\nRespondent also refers to the Board of Governors' Meeting on 28 May 2010 in which the Chief Minister stated:\n\n\"[I]*f TCC is keen on a mining lease, then they can have it. We will buy the ore from them and do the refining and metal production ourselves....The future role of* [TCC] *will be decided by the Government of Balochistan, after they apply for mining lease.*\"1223\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 208, 255; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 165, 167 quoting **Exhibit CE-31**, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11(iii).\n\n1098.\n\nRespondent claims that the Chief Minister's intentions were communicated to Claimant at a meeting on 2 June 2010:\n\n\"*DG(M) informed the Tethyan team of the 1st meeting of the BOG for the Reko Diq Refinery. The salient points that came under discussion in the meeting were as follows:*\n\n*a. GOB made its final decision to go for a refinery that would be made with the help of GOP at site.*\n\n*b. The refinery would get its concentrate / ore from Tethyan and Saindak and processing of Copper would be carried at site. It was decided that Tethyan would be told to apply for a mining lease and the lease would be approved under the Balochistan Mining Rules.*\n\n*c. Tethyan would supply concentrate / ore to the refinery set up by the GOB and GOB would buy it on international market rate*.\"1224\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 168 quoting **Exhibit CE-91**.\n\n1099.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant agreed in principle to this supply-purchase arrangement, as is apparent from its letter to the GOB dated 5 October 2010,1225 and argues that this arrangement would not have worked if Claimant had not received a mining lease; thus, the Chief Minister could not have intended otherwise.1226\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 199; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 169 referring to **Exhibit CE-257**. Respondent notes that Claimant's letter also confirms that there were ongoing negotiations, as it stated: \"*Following our recent interaction, where you desired an improved offer that corresponded better to the aspirations of your Government and the people of Balochistan*...\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 259.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 170, 178. Respondent also refers to a meeting held on 21 July 2011 in which the TCC representative stated that \"*TCC are willing to negotiate an off take agreement for the sale of concentrate within Balochistan*.\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 209; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 521. **Exhibit RE-79**.\n\n1100.\n\nRespondent claims that when the GOB realized in 2010 that there was no reference to this arrangement in the Feasibility Study, the Board of Governors of the PC-1 project decided that \"*we will do the mining*\" to supply the GOB's smelter, as it was envisaged in the third PC-1 proposal, but not to take over Claimant's proposed project.1227\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 171-172 referring to **Exhibits CE-354** and **CE-355**. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 214.\n\n1101.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant's reliance on the 30 May 2011 Working Paper, in which the Chief Minister's stated that \"*we will do the mining,*\" and claims that it would not have made sense to \"*carefully prepare*\" this document \"*recording the GOB's legitimate concerns regarding the Feasibility Study*\" if the decision to reject the Mining Lease Application had already been taken.1228\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 173 referring to **Exhibit RE-142**.\n\n1102.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the reference to the remark of the Chief Minister (\"*we will do the mining*\") in the Director General's internal letter of 12 September 2011 reflects that the Director General had not been involved in the Government's project and therefore sought clarification from his superior the Secretary of the MMDD when he learned of an apparent decision on the Government's project.1229 In Respondent's view, the Government's decision to conduct limited mining activities itself did not intend to oust Claimant from its project, which is confirmed by the Chief Minister's press statement of 15 September 2011: \"*If Tethyan wants to do the mining, well and good, but I have decided that the total refining will be done by us.*\"1230\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 216 quoting **Exhibit CE-26**.\n\n1103.\n\nRespondent further claims that the instruction of the Secretary to the Director General on 16 September to \"*dispose off* [sic] *the Mining Lease application*\" meant that the application should be considered in accordance with the 2002 BM Rules and contends that when the Director General did so, his decision was not affected by the Government's steps in 2012 to implement its own project.1231 Finally, Respondent notes that pursuant to its draft mining lease application of 25 April 2012, the Government intended to mine only 15,000 t/d and proposed to start at H4, which was not covered by Claimant's Feasibility Study. In any event, Respondent contends that the Government's Reko Diq project was never implemented and has now been abandoned.1232\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 219 referring to **Exhibits CE-369** and **CE-373**.\n\n**iii. Claimant's Assertion of a Composite Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation Adds Nothing to its Case**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1104.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant's assertion that there has been a \"*composite breach*\" of the FET obligation, comprised of the denial of the Mining Lease Application and the plan to take over the Reko Diq project as well as the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and the Supreme Court proceedings.1233\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 184.\n\n1105.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant has thereby abandoned its claims that some of those acts were wrongful *per se*, and instead invokes a concept of State responsibility that \"*usually operates*... *in the context of genocide, apartheid, crimes against humanity or systemic discrimination*.\" In Respondent's view, the Tribunal should reject this alleged \"*composite breach,*\" as there is no precedent for it and \"*barely a scintilla of justification*\" in the law of State responsibility.1234\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 185-186.\n\n1106.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant abandoned its claim that the Government's and the Supreme Court's conduct during the Supreme Court proceedings constituted a breach of the FET obligation because there is no evidence that the Supreme Court was influenced in its decision making by any improper pressure or request from the Governments. Respondent refers to the order of May 2011 by which the Supreme Court ordered that the Mining Lease Application should be dealt with on the merits and should not be affected by the pending Supreme Court proceedings.1235 In addition, Respondent notes that the Application was rejected in November 2011 and the Supreme Court's decision was rendered in 2013; thus, the latter cannot have played any causative role in the rejection of the Application.1236\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 180-182.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 183.\n\n1107.\n\nIn any event, Respondent submits that Claimant does not explain how the Supreme Court's decision affects any purported investment and notes that Claimant has not pleaded that there has been any denial of justice. Respondent further argues that (a) Balochistan's change of position on the validity of the CHEJVA was due to new evidence that came to light as a consequence of the Supreme Court ordering disclosure of documents; (b) the Supreme Court's judgment was correct under Pakistani law and Claimant's Pakistani lawyers never stated that there was any issue related to due process in those proceedings; and (c) Claimant's complaints about the discussion of ICSID jurisprudence at the end of the Supreme Court's decision is irrelevant to the evaluation of Claimant's FET claim.1237\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 468-471.\n\n1108.\n\nWith regard to the Mineral Agreement negotiations, Respondent claims that Claimant attempted to obtain fiscal and legal exemptions, including from the Licensing Authority's discretion to grant or reject mining lease applications, and thereby sought a guaranteed \"*right to mine*\" for multiple, not yet defined, mining projects within the area covered by Exploration License EL-5 (pursuant to an \"*Overall Development Plan*\").1238 Respondent argues that this request was intended to circumvent the requirements under rules 47 and 48, which was legally impossible under rules 9(5) and (6); therefore, the Governments made it clear in their revised draft that TCCP \"*shall be subject*\" to all provisions of the 2002 BM Rules.1239\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 490-493 referring to **Exhibit CE-216**, clauses 14.2 and 1.1. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 49, 56-59. Clause 14.2 of TCCA's draft reads: \"*The Parties agree that, except as expressly provided under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Mineral Title Holder shall not be subject to any obligations under the terms and conditions of the BMR.*\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 494, 505-507; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61 referring to **Exhibit CE-226**, clause 1.6. Clause 1.6 of the revised Government draft reads: \"*The Parties agree that, under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensee shall be subject to all obligations under the terms and conditions of the BMR in force at the time.*\"\n\n1109.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant's letter of 18 August 2008 by which it responded to the revised draft and expressed its disagreement with the royalty rate of 5%, the lack of EPZ status, the introduction of a Management Committee and the fact that the Mineral Agreement would be subject to the 2002 BM Rules.1240 In addition, Respondent maintains that the Governments reiterated the smelter/refinery requirement to which Claimant was not willing to accede,1241 emphasizing, however, that the \"*central message*\" was whether the Mineral Agreement should override the 2002 BM Rules or \"*it should be the other way around*.\"1242\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 512 referring to **Exhibit CE-227**.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 64. Respondent refers to Clause 5.5 of the revised draft which reads in relevant part: \"*The Licensee shall install smelter/refinery for processing of ore*...\" According to Respondent, the GOB's insistence on the smelter/refinery requirement was justified by rule 9(1) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which the GOB could only enter into the Mineral Agreement \"*if the Government is satisfied... that the carrying on of the undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan*\"; nevertheless, Claimant failed to address this issue, which thus remained unresolved. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 64-68, 74.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 512-514.\n\n1110.\n\nRespondent claims that despite Claimant's attempt to obtain legally impossible concessions and its failure to address the value addition requirement as well as the Governments' financial concerns, which ultimately caused the negotiations to stall, the Governments continued to negotiate with Claimant throughout 2010 and even in 2011.1243 Respondent refers to meetings between Claimant and the Governments,1244*e.g.*, (a) the Chief Minister in January 2010;1245 (b) Chief Secretary Lehri in March and June 2010;1246 (c) the Prime Minister of Pakistan in July 2010;1247 (d) the MPNR in September 2010;1248 and (e) officials from both Governments in July 2011.1249\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 77. In addition to these meetings, Respondent notes that Claimant itself referred to recent discussions in its letter of 5 October 2010. **Exhibit CE-257**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-85**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-84** and **CE-90**. Lehri, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Exhibit RE-162**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-80**. WS Khokhar II, \u00b6 27.\n\n**Exhibit RE-79**.\n\n1111.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the falsity of Claimant's allegation that the Governments conducted the negotiations in bad faith is further confirmed by the fact that the Governments did not even consider proposals from other parties such as MCC, despite the fact that they would have offered significantly more attractive terms.1250\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 517-519.\n\n**iv. Claimant's Own Conduct Precludes a Finding that the FET Standard was Breached**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1112.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to the three duties of an investor set out by Professor Muchlinski, *i.e.*, \"*a duty to refrain from unconscionable conduct, a duty to engage in the investment in light of an adequate knowledge of its risks, and a duty to conduct its investment in a reasonable manner.*\" Respondent claims that Claimant breached each of these duties and therefore cannot rely on provisions of the Treaty to cure the defects in its own conduct.1251\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 472 quoting *Muchlinski* [RLA-193], p. 530.\n\n1113.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant did not \"*refrain from unconscionable conduct*\" because it sought illegal exemptions from mandatory local legislative requirements under the 2002 BM Rules and filed a Mining Lease Application that it must have known was doomed to fail, in order to \"*manufactur* [e]\" its international arbitration claims seeking specific performance.1252\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 473.\n\n1114.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that Claimant did not \"*engage in the investment in light of an adequate knowledge of its risks*\" because it failed to conduct a proper risk assessment when it began its activities in an underdeveloped region with limited experience in large-scale mining; it failed to conduct a proper due diligence into BHP's activities prior to acquiring its interest and the requirements of the BM Rules; and it also failed to address the need to maintain a \"*social licence to operate*\" in Balochistan.1253\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 474.\n\n1115.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that Claimant did not \"*conduct its investment in a reasonable manner*\" because it tried to mislead the Governments with regard to the economic viability of its project, in particular by making incorrect assumptions in the Feasibility Study and stating before the Supreme Court that it was \"*still confident that the international financial community will be willing and happy to finance this project*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant's attempt to \"*force through*\" its Application despite the \"*numerous shortcomings*\" in the Feasibility Study\" likewise reflected the unreasonable manner in which Claimant pursued its project.1254\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 475-476 quoting **Exhibit RE-58((ix)(b)**.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1116.\n\nIt is Claimant's position that there were two separate, independent breaches of the FET obligation by (i) the denial of the Mining Lease Application; and (ii) the development and implementation of the GOB's plan to take over Claimant's project. In addition, Claimant claims that there was a composite breach of the FET standard by the foregoing conduct, together with the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or the Supreme Court proceedings.\n\n1117.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, however, a separate analysis of the purported individual breaches appears rather artificial because the two are inextricably linked. The planned takeover of Claimant's project, if proven as the motive for denying the Mining Lease Application would, in the absence of any valid grounds for the denial, be the ground upon which the denial amounted to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation.\n\n1118.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal will assess as a first step whether Claimant has established that there was a plan to take over Claimant's project and whether this motive informed the decision of the Licensing Authority to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application. However, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that this was indeed the case, this would not in itself be sufficient for a finding that the denial of the Mining Lease Application amounted to a violation of the FET obligation. In its Notice of Intent to Reject, the Licensing Authority did not invoke the GOB's own project as a ground for denial but rather, on its face, based its decision on ten other grounds, which could lead to the conclusion that there were in fact legitimate reasons for denying the Mining Lease Application.\n\n1119.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will analyze as a second step whether the Grounds given in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in this arbitration nevertheless provide a justified basis for the denial or whether they rather served as a pretext designed to conceal the true motive of implementing the GOB's own project. Only if the latter were the case, the Tribunal would reach the conclusion that Respondent has breached its FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.\n\n**i. The Takeover of Claimant's Project as a Motive for Denying the Mining Lease Application**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the GOB prepared a total of three proposals for a \"*Reko Diq Gold/Copper Project*,\" the third of which was approved by an organ of the Federal Planning Commission (the CDWP) on 9 December 2009 and by the ECNEC, the Executive Committee of Pakistan's National Economic Council, on 9 December 2010. The Parties are in dispute, however, as to whether this project was meant to be complementary to Claimant's project, as alleged by Respondent, or whether it was a competitive project by means of which the GOB intended to \"*oust*\" Claimant from the Reko Diq area, as alleged by Claimant.\n\n1121.\n\nIn light of the differing submissions of the Parties on the purpose of the GOB's project, the Tribunal has reviewed the contemporaneous evidence in order to shed light on the project's scope as it evolved over the course of the proposals and through the decisions taken by the relevant authorities.\n\n**(a) The Evidentiary Record on the Scope of the GOB's Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1122.\n\nThe first proposal that was submitted on 16 May 2009 contemplated \"*the processing of copper ore 5000-tons per day to produce copper metal and other valuables*.\"1255 The second proposal submitted on 19 October 2009 was still based on the plan to process 5,000 tons of ore per day, but included in its cost analysis an item \"*Annual profit for processing 15000 ton/day*.\"1256\n\n**Exhibit CE-111**, p. 16.\n\n**Exhibit CE-80**, p. 42.\n\n1123.\n\nIn its Working Paper for the Planning Commission dated 17 November 2009, the Planning & Development Division of the GOP stated in relation to the \"*Status of Mining Rights*\":\n\n\"*It is understood that Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) is a joint venture between Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold of Canada and has completed exploratory work in its mining concession, which is valid up to 2010. The sponsors may clarify whether Government of Balochistan is legally bound to convert Exploration License into long term renewable mining lease for thirty (30) years under Balochistan Mining Concession Rules 2002 or not. If so, then what would be their strategy to implement the subject project?*\"1257\n\n**Exhibit CE-240**, p. 4.\n\n1124.\n\nThe third proposal that was submitted and approved by the CDWP on 9 December 2009 was still based on the plan to process 5,000 tons of ore per day but nevertheless included in its \"*Annual operating and maintenance cost after completion of the project*\" an item \"*Mining of Ore 15000 ton/day*.\"1258\n\n**Exhibit CE-242**, p. 18. *See* also **Exhibit CE-409**, pp. 6 and 7.\n\n1125.\n\nThe Working Paper for a meeting of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 that was prepared by the MMDD sets out a total of 13 items as \"*Justification for taking over the Project by Balochistan Government*\": (i) transfer of TCCP's shares to Antofagasta and Barrick Gold without the GOB's consent; (ii) TCCP's reluctance to build a refinery plant; (iii) TCCP's refusal to exempt the GOB from its obligation to invest into the project in accordance with its 25% equity share; (iv) TCCP's desire to obtain exemptions from federal and provincial taxes through the Mineral Agreement; (v) TCCP's unwillingness to invest into a mining academy; (vi) TCCP's plan to transport the ore via pipeline to the Gwadar port and then on to Chile / Canada for refining purposes; (vii) TCCP's lack of a mining lease to be granted by the Licensing Authority, which \"*can exercise his* [sic] *power to reject Mining Lease for the better interest of the province*\"; (viii) the PC-1 proposal submitted by the GOB for processing 15,000 tons of ore per day; \"[f]*or this processing plant we require Ore that's why the mining activities are also required to be undertaken by the Provincial Government for smooth and efficient supply of Ore*\"; (ix) the expiry of the agreement between the GOP and MCC on the Saindak Copper & Gold Project in October 2011, which would then be handed over to Balochistan so that the ore produced in the Saindak mine could also be used for the GOB's project; (x) an anticipated annual profit of the GOB's project in the amount of Rs. 15,375 million; (xi) technical assistance ensured by the Director General, Strategic Plans Division for mining copper and gold at Reko Diq; (xii) sufficient technical staff at the MMDD \"*to run mining activities efficiently*,\" in particular after having absorbed the mining staff of the BDA; (xiii) anticipated submission of a PC-1 proposal by the MMDD for \"*carrying out mining activities in the mine areas of Reko-Di* q.\"1259\n\n**Exhibit RE-62**, pp. 2-4.\n\n1126.\n\nAgainst this background, the MMDD requested that the Balochistan Cabinet \"*solicit approval for awarding the mining rights of Reko-Diq Copper / Gold Project to* [the MMDD] *for the larger interests of the province*.\"1260\n\n**Exhibit RE-62**, p. 5.\n\n1127.\n\nClaimant further submitted a PowerPoint presentation that was apparently presented at the 24 December 2009 meeting. The document itself, which is entitled \"*REKO DIQ Gold/Copper 2009*,\"1261 is undated and does not reveal the occasion at which it was presented. However, Claimant pointed out during the Hearing and again in its Post-Hearing Brief that Respondent disclosed the presentation during document production as \"*Presentation on* 'Baluchistan Copper Gold Project' *given to the Baluchistan Cabinet in its meeting on 24 December 2009*.\"1262 Respondent did not dispute that it had described the presentation in this manner. The cost analysis presented therein includes an item \"*Annual profit for processing 30000 ton/day*.\"1263 Under the heading \"*Mining*,\" the document states:\n\n\"*The growth path currently envisaged, will start at*\n\n*5,000 T/d and expanding to*\n\n*15,000 t/d (year 4),*\n\n*30,000 t/d (year 6) and*\n\n*60,000 t/d (year 10).*\"1264\n\n**Exhibit CE-409**, p. 2.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 95 lines 9-14; (Day 6), p. 1530 line 20 \u2013 p. 1531 line 2; (Day 7), p. 1943 lines 17-19; (Day 8), p. 2202 lines 12-16; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 145.\n\n**Exhibit CE-409**, p. 9. The document then presents the GOB's net profit pursuant to the following three scenarios: (i) \"*Tethyan Copper Co. Operation,*\" in which the GOB has a 25% profit share and receives royalties at a 5% rate, resulting in a net profit of US$ 325.8 million per year; (ii) \"*Indigenous Operation (Strategic Orgs.),*\" resulting in a net profit of US$ 2,448 million per year; and (iii) \"*Joint Venture: TCC + Indigenous \u2013 Indigenous Operation,*\" resulting in a net profit of US$ 1,676 million per year. **Exhibit CE-409**, p. 10.\n\n**Exhibit CE-409**, p. 12. The document also contains a section entitled \"*Mine Equipment*\" in which the type and size of the selected equipment is presented for the purpose of estimating the mine capital expenditures. The presented on-site infrastructure further includes \"mine service buildings.\" **Exhibit CE-409**, pp. 15 and 16.\n\n1128.\n\nThe minutes of the Balochistan Cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 record under item no. 4 on the agenda, *i.e*., \"*Taking over of Rekodiq Copper & Gold Project from TCCP by the Government of Balochistan,*\" that \"[t]*he agenda was approved in principle. It was further decided **not** to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP. Further course of action would be decided by the Chief Minister*.\"1265\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16 (emphasis in original).\n\n1129.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Chief Secretary dated 31 December 2009, the Secretary of the MMDD reported on the progress made by Claimant's project and concluded by stating:\n\n\"*Since the Government of Balochistan has decided to take over the project from TCCP, it is utmost important to establish a camp office of Mines & Mineral Development Department at the site to closely monitor the project till proper taking / handing-over the project.*\"1266\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 20.\n\n1130.\n\nIn a further memorandum to the Chief Minister dated 11 February 2010, the Secretary of the MMDD reported on the negotiations of legal services to be rendered in relation to the Reko Diq Gold/Copper Project and stated:\n\n\"*In the aftermath of the decision of the Provincial Cabinet to take over the Reko-Diq Project from Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (TCCP) \u2026, it was deemed necessary to engage Legal Advisor / Consultant for advi* [c]*e before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of Exploration Agreement.*\"1267\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 21.\n\n1131.\n\nOn 18 March 2010, the CDWP recommended the GOB's project for submission to the ECNEC. According to the project description, the \"*Government of Balochistan envisages creating a facility for processing 15,000 tons per day of copper ore to produce copper metal, and other valuables*.\" However, the breakdown of the capital cost again included the item \"*Mining of Ore 15,000 ton/day*.\"1268\n\n**Exhibit RE-87**, pp. 1 and 4. The CDWP identified, *inter alia*, the following \"*Sector Issues*\": \"*Lack of expertise in mining and processing of minerals*\"; \"*Inadequate infrastructure for mining*\"; and \"*Dependence on foreign companies*.\" The \"*Sector Strategy*\" included, *inter alia*, the following items: \"*Indigenously development of mineral resources*\"; \"*Self-reliance in the production of Hi-tech materials*\"; and \"*Infrastructure development*.\" **Exhibit RE-87**, p. 2.\n\n1132.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the Board of Governors meeting on 28 May 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand informed the other participants of the meeting that Claimant was not willing to refine the ore within Pakistan, but was planning to export the ore for the refining process. He then stated that \"[w]*ith deposits worth billions of dollar discovered till now, it is worth considering that the ore may be kept within the country and refined locally*\" and requested guidance from the Chief Minister. In response to the Chief Minister's inquiry whether they should adopt a course of litigation, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that he would not recommend litigation, but rather to inquire about Claimant's willingness \"*for mining the ore only while the Government of Balochistan may install and commission the refining plant*.\"1269\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 26.\n\n1133.\n\nWhen another Board member raised the concern that \"*only giving prospect license will earn a bad reputation for the country*,\" the Chief Minister stated that \"*national interest is above all*\" and observed that \"*if TCC is keen on a mining licence, then they can have it. We will buy the ore from them and do the refining and metal production ourselves*.\"1270 The Board ultimately decided, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n\"*(iii) The future role of Tithium Copper Company (TCC) will be* de *cided by the Government of Balochistan, after they apply for mining lease.*\n\n*(iv) Plants for refining and production of pure copper and gold will be designed, developed and commissioned in Balochistan and under no circumstances will the pure metals be allowed to leave the country.*\"1271\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 27.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 28.\n\n1134.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand, who led the technical development of the GOB's project, participated in a talkshow on the *Duniya* television network. Dr. Mubarakmand emphasized that, while the exploration work at Reko Diq had been performed by a foreign company, Pakistan itself possessed the technical capability for the mining of copper and gold and added that \"*it remains to be seen whether the government of Baluchistan will sanction the mining contract to Pakistan or to foreign companies.*\"1272 In response to the interviewer's comment that the GOB \"*should give the contract to the local companies rather than the outsiders,*\" Dr. Mubarakmand stated:\n\n\"*This is the reason why I had developed a technical project and presented it to the Chief Minister of Baluchistan. He appreciated my efforts and endorsed that this project should be handled by Pakistani scientists and engineers. If our project is approved in the ACNEC meeting on December 9, 2010, the Baluchistan government has the funds for us to start work on this project.*\"1273\n\n**Exhibit CE-105**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-105**, p. 2.\n\n1135.\n\nOn 9 December 2010, the ECNEC considered the Summary on the Reko Diq Gold/Copper Project that the Federal Planning Commission had submitted to it on 15 July 2010. According to the minutes of the 9 December 2010 meeting, the ECNEC was informed that the \"*Government of Balochistan envisaged creating a facility for processing 15,000 tons per day of copper ore to produce copper metal and other valuables.*\" The minutes further record:\n\n\"*It was also added that a foreign firm had done a feasibility study, but they intend to work as a joint venture, but would take raw gold/copper for refinery to their country at 50:50 share, thus it could not be established as to whether final distribution would be fair or not?*\n\n*ECNEC was apprised that local technology and expertise is available to develop the mines, therefore it would be appropriate to consider this option in the larger national interest. It was also pointed out that some cases related to the project are pending consideration in the courts of law.*\"1274\n\n**Exhibit CE-352**.\n\n1136.\n\nAt the meeting, the ECNEC approved the GOB's project and further directed:\n\n\"[I]*f an agreement has not been signed with any firm for mining and refining etc, then Govt. of Balochistan may decide, as to whether the project is to be executed by them. If the project is to be bifurcated involving some other companies, the draft agreement shall be vetted by Law & Justice Division to ensure transparency and consistency with International Law.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Before launching the project, Government of Balochistan will check from the courts about litigation on the issue, if any.*\"1275\n\n**Exhibits CE-106** and **RE-88**.\n\n1137.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand gave a telephone interview on *Dawn* television about the GOB's project and confirmed that \"*ECNEC has approved this project and the project is to be done by Pakistan herself. \u2026 There is no discussion regarding the involvement of foreign companies in it.*\"1276 In response to the interviewer's comment that \"i *t is generally said that mining contracts are awarded to those companies who do the exploration work*\" and the question what the \"*best international practices*\" were in this regard, Dr. Mubarakmand stated:\n\n\"*Under the international best practices it is not necessary that one who does exploration will also get the mining license. People initially enter into an exploration contract with the Government which owns the minerals. This contract contains terms and conditions whether or not the exploration license will convert into a mining license and upon which terms. So the exploration license which they [Tethyan Copper Company] obtained from the Balochistan Government must in my opinion contain such terms and conditions. The Balochistan Government and this company must be aware of such terms and conditions in accordance with which a mining license can or cannot be awarded. This condition must be there.\"1277*\n\n**Exhibit CE-108**, p. 4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-408**, pp. 4-5.\n\n1138.\n\nIn his submission to the Supreme Court dated 19 January 2011, Dr. Mubarakmand compared the total profit (share) to be generated by the GOB over the 56-year life of the mine under (i) the project presented by Claimant in its Feasibility Study (US$ 8.97 billion); and (ii) the GOB's own project (US$ 131,824 billion).1278 With regard to the GOB's project, Dr. Mubarakmand explained that, while the plant would initially be installed for processing 15,000 tons of ore per day, \"*as the mine grows wider and deeper with time, more ore is expected per day and therefore every 5-6 years the size of the plant is enhanced*.\"1279 He emphasized:\n\n\"*That the local project is designed to start with mining of the Ore and finally produce 99.9% pure Copper and Gold metal. All steps of the process are catered for in the design of the plant and have been duly budgeted*.\"1280\n\n**Exhibit CE-111**, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 and Annexes D and E.\n\n**Exhibit CE-111**, \u00b6 10.\n\n**Exhibit CE-111**, \u00b6 13.\n\n1139.\n\nDr. Mubarakmand further submitted:\n\n\"*That the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice berg in the EL-5 area. If the indigenous project is sanctioned though a decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Government of Balochistan, it will be launched using the H-15 Ore deposits. That while the project is running, a massive exploration effort will simultaneously commence to bring out the content and location of mineral deposits containing Copper, Gold or other metals in the Chaghi region.*\"1281\n\n**Exhibit CE-111**, \u00b6 17.\n\n1140.\n\nThree days later, the GOB also filed a submission in the Supreme Court proceedings in which it informed the Court about the approval of its project by ECNEC and stated that this approval was \"*also in conformity with the earlier decision taken by the Balochistan Cabinet on 26 December 2009 wherein the Balochistan Government had expressed its interest to execute the project*.\"1282 The GOB further stated that it considered TCC's Feasibility Study \"*deficient in several aspects,*\" although it was still in the course of being examined, and submitted:\n\n\"*That it is thus clear that no entity holding a license for exploration has a vested right for the grant of the mineral concession and the grant of the said right / concession, partly or fully continues to be the discretion of the Government of Balochistan*.\n\n*That accordingly, the Government of Balochistan is interested to implement the approval / decision received from the ECNEC and also take appropriate decision in its own right about the fate of the mining concession based on its independent judgment*.\"1283\n\n**Exhibit CE-269**, \u00b6\u00b6 3-9.\n\n**Exhibit CE-269**, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n1141.\n\nBalochistan concluded by requesting that the Supreme Court:\n\n\"*permit the Government of Balochistan to execute the decision of the ECNEC dated 9.12.2010 while declaring that in the circumstances of the case, no entity has any vested right for the mining concession and that only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this regard in the best national interest*.\"1284\n\n**Exhibit CE-269**, p. 6.\n\n1142.\n\nOn 25 April 2012, Balochistan prepared, but ultimately did not file,1285 a mining lease application for an area identical to the Mining Area that TCCP had applied for in its Mining Lease Application of 15 February 2011.1286 On 20 May 2012, Balochistan submitted a proposal to the Federal Planning Commission regarding a water supply project for its Reko Diq Copper Gold Project that envisaged using water from the \"*Baghicha Site*,\"*i.e.*, the same groundwater source that Claimant had discovered and identified in its Feasibility Study as the groundwater source for its mining operations.1287 Finally, on 30 May 2012, Balochistan also applied for surface rights at Reko Diq, which overlapped Claimant's exclusive Surface Rights Lease and proposed Mining Area.1288\n\nOn 12 September 2012, the Board of Governors decided that the Project was \"*an implementation unit of the Government of Balochistan*\" and therefore did not require a separate mining lease for its operations. **Exhibit CE-282**, p. 3.\n\nThe coordinates of TCCP's proposed Mining Lease Area presented in the Detailed Topographical and Geological Description, enclosed to its Mining Lease Application dated 15 February 2011, as \"*Lambert India Zone-1*\" are identical to the coordinates included by Balochistan in its draft application for a mining lease as the \"*AREA APPLIED BY M/S REKO DIQ COPPER GOLD PRJECT, FOR THE MINING LEASE OF COPPER, GOLD AND ASSOCIATED MATTALIC* [sic] *MATERIALS*.\"*Compare* **Exhibit CE-272**, p. 16 *with* **Exhibit CE-369**, p. 9.\n\n**Exhibit CE-283**, p. 6; **Exhibit CE-282**, p. 3. *See* **Exhibit CE-251**, pp. 8-8, 8-9 and 8-13.\n\n**Exhibit CE-283**, pp. 5 and 19; **Exhibit CE-182**; **Exhibit CE-272**, p. 16.\n\n1143.\n\nIn its meeting on 12 September 2012, the Board of Governors decided, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n\"*Government of Balochistan will grant permission to B*[alochistan] *C*[opper] *G*[old] *P*[roject] *to start their operations at the designated sites, including exploration, mining and refining.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The area previously identified by \u2026 BGCP in their application may be reserved for the project for their future activities and that the same may not be allotted to any other agency or organization.*\"1289\n\n**Exhibit CE-282**, p. 3.\n\n**(b) The Tribunal's Considerations on the Evidentiary Record**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1144.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the contemporaneous evidence shows that the GOB's project was not only a complementary smelting project intended to process ore that it would buy from Claimant (or any other mining company operating in Pakistan). The question raised in the Working Paper of 17 November 2009 whether the GOB was bound to convert Claimant's Exploration License into a mining lease and if so \"*what would be the strategy to implement the project?*\" rather demonstrates that at least as of that time, the GOB intended to implement a competing mining project in the same area.1290\n\n**Exhibit CE-240**, p. 4.\n\n1145.\n\nThe third and final proposal that was ultimately approved by the Planning Commission and the ECNEC further explicitly provided for a budget for the mining of ore at a rate of 15,000 tons per day.1291 The Tribunal is aware that Claimant's project envisaged an initial rate of 110,000 tons per day, later expanding to 220,000 tons per day, and thus was planned to operate at a larger scale. The PowerPoint presentation that was apparently presented during the Balochistan Cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 indicates that the GOB intended to expand its own mining operations beyond 15,000 tons per day (up to 60,000 tons per day within ten years).1292\n\n**Exhibit CE-242**, p. 18.\n\n**Exhibit CE-409**, p. 12.\n\n1146.\n\nA further indication for an expansion plan is contained in Dr. Mubarakmand's 19 January 2011 submission in which he stated that the size of the plant would be enhanced every five to six years along with the growth of the mine.1293 However, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Mubarakmand was not a Government official and would have required the approval of the relevant authorities for his plans. Given that none of the summaries and/or working papers prepared by Government officials on the project mention such expansion plans, the Tribunal is not convinced that the GOB in fact had a concrete plan at the time to expand the capacity of its project to a scale comparable to that of Claimant's project.\n\n**Exhibit CE-269**, \u00b6 10.\n\n1147.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, however, it is not relevant whether the GOB's project was at the same scale as Claimant's project. What matters is whether the implementation of the Government's project excluded the simultaneous implementation of Claimant's project and therefore presented a motive for denying TCCP'S Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal considers it established that the GOB intended to mine (at least) 15,000 tons of ore per day at the area that was covered by Claimant's Exploration License (EL-5) and would have been part of Claimant's proposed Mining Area.1294 In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that it included the budget for mining only in case it did not reach an agreement with Claimant on the supply of ore.\n\nIn his 19 January 2011 submission, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that the GOB's project would be launched by using the H-15 deposits, *i.e*., the same deposits that Claimant intended to form part of its Initial Mine Development. **Exhibit CE-269**, \u00b6 17. In his witness statement, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that when he was instructed \"*to go ahead with the project*\" in May/June 2012, he decided that the best place for the mining was H-4 in order to \"*avoid any dispute with the Claimant over the areas that it had identified in their Feasibility Study, H-14 and H-15*\" and also for technical reasons (at H-4, the copper is closer to the surface than at H-14 and H-15, and it contains copper oxide ore which is easier and less energy intensive to refine). Mubarakmand I, \u00b6 17.\n\n1148.\n\nThe minutes of the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting, the 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary as well as the 11 February 2010 memorandum to the Chief Minister record that the GOB had decided to \"*take over*\" the project from Claimant.1295 The Tribunal does not follow Respondent's argument that this was only a decision in principle which had to be, and never was, implemented by the Chief Minister. Contrary to Respondent's submission, after the decision to \"*take over*\" the project and \"*not to go ahead with*\" the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement and the Project Agreement had been made, no actual negotiations took place but only high-level meetings in which Claimant was assured that there was no competing project. In addition, the GOB even considered in February 2010 that it was \"*necessary to engage Legal Advisor / Consultant for advi* [c]*e before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of Exploration Agreement.*\"1296\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, pp. 16, 20 and 21.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 21.\n\n1149.\n\nFurther, the Working Paper for the 24 December 2009 meeting that sets out the \"*Justification for taking over the Project by Balochistan Government*\" expressly states that \"*mining activities are also required to be undertaken by the Provincial Government*\" and that the MMDD was planning to submit a PC-1 proposal \"*for carrying out mining activities in the mine areas of Reko Diq*\"; finally, the MMDD requested that the Cabinet \"*solicit approval for awarding the mining rights of Reko-Diq Copper / Gold Project to* [the MMDD] *for the larger interests of this province*.\"1297\n\n**Exhibit RE-62**, pp. 2-4.\n\n1150.\n\nFinally, Dr. Mubarakmand's contemporaneous statements both during the interviews that he gave in December 2010 and in his submission to the Supreme Court in January 2011 demonstrate that he considered the GOB's project as an alternative, and not a supplement, to Claimant's project.1298 While Dr. Mubarakmand served as a member of the Pakistan Planning Commission and was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Reko Diq Project, his conduct as such may not be attributable to Respondent because he may not have been a \"*Government official*.\" Nevertheless, the Tribunal recalls that he was responsible for the technical development of the project that was fully endorsed by the GOB and approved by the CDWP and later the ECNEC. Therefore, there is at least a strong indication that his statements reflected the view taken by the GOB and the relevant authorities as well.\n\nCf. Exhibits **CE-105**, **CE-108** and **CE-111**.\n\n1151.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is sufficient evidence that mining activities formed part of the GOB's project and that the GOB thus did not intend to implement a complementary processing project, but rather a competing mining and processing project (albeit at a smaller scale) that was not compatible with Claimant's project. This is confirmed by the fact that the GOB ultimately sought a mining lease over the exact same area that TCCP had proposed as the Mining Area in its Mining Lease Application.1299\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CE-272**, p. 16 *with* **Exhibit CE-369**, p. 9. *See* note 1286 above.\n\n1152.\n\nThis finding is not contradicted by the statement made by the Chief Minister in the 28 May 2010 meeting of the Board of Governors that \"*if TCC is keen on a mining licence, then they can have it. We will buy the ore from them and do the refining and metal production ourselves.*\"1300 While the GOB may have been willing to consider buying the ore from Claimant, the Chief Minister's further statement that \"*national interest is above all*\" and the Board's resolution that the \"*future role of* [TCC] *will be decided by the Government of Balochistan, after they apply for mining lease*\"1301 shows clearly that the GOB did not consider itself bound by the contractual commitments and assurances it had given to Claimant. The GOB rather considered that it could interpret the requirements in the 2002 BM Rules, in particular rule 48(3)(a)(vi), in a manner that would allow it to impose any obligation on Claimant that would be labelled as being in the \"*national interest*.\" This approach is confirmed by Balochistan's submission in the Supreme Court proceedings dated 22 January 2011 in which it requested that the Supreme Court allow it to execute its own project and declared that \"*no entity has any vested right for the mining concession and that only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this regard in the best national interest.*\"1302\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 27.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 28.\n\n**Exhibit CE-269**, p. 6.\n\n1153.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its statement above that the desire of the GOB to implement its own project as such does not impact Claimant's investment and therefore cannot constitute an FET breach in itself, but only if it is established that this desire became the motive for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that the remarks made by Chief Minister Raisani as recorded in the letter from the Director General to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 12 September 2012 and their apparent impact on the decision of the Licensing Authority are particularly relevant. The Chief Minister is recorded to have said:\n\n\"*It was decided by the Board of Governors that:-*\n\ni) *We will do the mining*\n\nii) *We will do the refining.*\"1303\n\n**Exhibit CE-355**.\n\n1154.\n\nIn light of these remarks, the Director General (*i.e.*, the Licensing Authority) requested from the Secretary of the MMDD (*i.e.*, his superior and the appellate authority) that \"*future line of action in the matter kindly be conveyed whether the TCC be refused Mining Lease for Reko-Diq Gold-Gold Project or otherwise*.\"1304 In response to this request, the Secretary of the MMDD requested on 13 September 2011 \"*to dispose off the Mining Lease application*.\"1305 While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the term \"*dispose off*\" could be interpreted differently and does not necessarily imply that the Application was to be rejected, the Tribunal has to take into account the context of the Director General's request for guidance. In this particular context, the Secretary's instruction can only be understood to mean that the Director General should decide on the Application in line with the Chief Minister's remarks, *i.e.*, that he should deny the Application.\n\n**Exhibit CE-355**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-356**.\n\n1155.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal notes that the Chief Minister, the Director General and/or the Secretary of the MMDD could have explained in evidence that the refusal of the Mining Lease Application was nevertheless a *bona fide* decision, which was taken independently of the developments regarding the GOB's project, but Respondent decided not to present any of them as a witness in this arbitration. Consequently, there is no evidence that would rebut the strong indication from the above-mentioned evidence that the refusal was motivated by the GOB's desire to take over the project from Claimant.\n\n1156.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal considers that this indication is confirmed by the various news articles, which record statements made by Government officials with regard to the project at the time. For example, the online edition of the Pakistani newspaper *The Dawn* reported on 25 December 2009, *i.e.*, the day after the Cabinet meeting in which it was decided to take over the project, that the \"*Reko Dik exploration contract* [was] *cancelled*.\" The article cited Chief Minister Raisani stating that the \"[c]*ancellation of the Reko Dik copper and gold project agreement is a step towards getting control over provincial resources in accordance with the wishes of the people*.\"1306\n\n**Exhibit C-81**.\n\n1157.\n\nOn 22 May 2010, Balochistan's Directorate of Public Relations issued a press release describing an \"*official handout*\" issued the day before, which reportedly stated that \"*the foremost objective of the provincial government would be to take full control of Reko-Diq Copper and Gold Project from its present operators i.e. M/s. Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) and thereafter the provincial government would run the project itself*.\" Pursuant to the press release, the newly constituted Board of Governors would discuss at its first meeting \"*the role of TCC in the project, if any*.\" The press release then reported that \"[t]*he Government of Balochistan had decided to take over the Reko-Diq Copper and Gold Project and cancel the agreement with TCCP*\" and quoted the thirteen grounds referred to in the Working Paper for the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting.1307\n\n**Exhibit CE-89**.\n\n1158.\n\nAccording to a further news article in *The Dawn* dated 4 November 2010, Chief Minister Raisani said that \"[TCC's] *exploration licence would expire next year and his government had decided that afterwards it would run the project itself*.\"1308 On the same day, the daily newspaper *Balochistan Express* also reported that Chief Minister Raisani had said that \"*a company had been issued only exploration license and it will be ended in 2011 after that government will take over the project*.\"1309\n\n**Exhibit C-262**, p. 5.\n\n**Exhibit C-262**, p. 8.\n\n1159.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that officials from both the GOB and the GOP repeatedly assured Claimant's representatives during this time period that these news articles and also the press release issued by Balochistan's own public relations department did not represent the official position of the Governments, it rather appears that the press was given reasonably accurate accounts of the GOB's decision. In particular, the press release quoted from an \"*official handout*\" that used the same wording that was also used in the Working Paper for, and the meeting minutes of, the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting strongly indicates that it was rather TCC that was deceived until it had finished and submitted its Feasibility Study to the GOB. Dr. Mubarakmand further expressly stated during his 15 December 2010 interview: \"*Now when we work we will have the results of exploration in front of us which will help us and we will be able to benefit from those results.*\"1310 Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the press coverage in 2010 reinforces its conclusion that the GOB had decided to take over the project and, accordingly, to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application.\n\n**Exhibit CE-108**, p. 6.\n\n1160.\n\nHowever, as stated at the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal considers that the existence of such motive in itself is not sufficient for a finding that Respondent is in breach of its FET obligation because there may have been, at the same time, legitimate reasons for denying the Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal will therefore assess in a second step whether the Grounds given in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in this arbitration nevertheless provide a justified basis for denial or whether they only served as a pretext to disguise the true motive of implementing the GOB's own project. Only if the latter were the case, the denial would amount to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation.\n\n**ii. The Stated Grounds for Denying the Mining Lease Application**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1161.\n\nAs to the various grounds for the denial that Respondent invokes, the Tribunal will first analyze the ten grounds given in the Notice of Intent to Reject. As both Parties grouped these grounds into three main reasons in their Post-Hearing Briefs, the Tribunal will follow this structure in its analysis as well. Thereafter, the Tribunal will determine whether Respondent can rely on the additional grounds it invokes in this arbitration and whether they could justify the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application.\n\n**(a) The Grounds Given in the Notice of Intent to Reject**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1162.\n\nBefore analyzing the three main reasons identified by the Parties in more detail, the Tribunal will address the two grounds that were only summarily touched upon by the Parties. The first ground states:\n\n\"*That from the record, it appears that the Balochistan Development Authority had signed a Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement with BHP, thereafter M/S Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for exploration, evaluation of Gold, Copper and Associated Minerals during the period of license existing for exploration and prospecting of the area. The record reflects that neither any company was registered and incorporated under the Companies Act 1984 with the registrar of the Firm's nor in any other law.*\"1311\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 1.\n\n1163.\n\nPursuant to rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, \"[a]*n application for the grant of a mining lease may be made only by a body corporate formed by or under a law for the time being in force in Pakistan.*\"1312 The Mining Lease Application of 15 February 2011 was submitted by TCCP and included in its enclosure no. 12 a copy of the Memorandum and the Articles of Association of TCCP with an attested copy of its certificate of incorporation in Pakistan.1313 Pursuant to this certificate of incorporation, TCCP is incorporated as a company under Pakistani law as of 30 November 2000.1314 Therefore, the Tribunal finds that there is no merit in the first ground given by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject.\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 47(1).\n\n**Exhibit CE-6**, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-14**.\n\n1164.\n\nThe fourth ground states:\n\n\"*That on account of non-exploration and failure to explore the area during the last 17 years, the Government of Balochistan and the local inhabitants of the area has been deprived of the fruitful results.*\"1315\n\n**Exhibit C-7**, \u00b6 4.\n\n1165.\n\nPursuant to rule 48(3)(a)(ii) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Licensing Authority shall not grant the mining lease unless \"*the proposed plans for development and operation of the mine and the programme of the mining operations of the applicant will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources.*\"1316 In the Tribunal's view, it is apparent from the evidentiary record that Claimant did not fail to explore the area covered by Exploration License EL-5. Apart from the fact that the GOB was continuously informed about the status and progress of the exploration work through both the Operating Committee meetings, in which it was represented by the BDA and later by the MMDD, and the quarterly reports that Claimant submitted to the GOB, the Tribunal considers it established that Claimant has indeed performed a considerable amount of work as recorded in the sections above on TCC's initial and expanded exploration work during the time period from 2002 through 2009.1317\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(a(ii).\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 332 *et seq.* and 350 *et seq.* above.\n\n1166.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the GOB itself recognized at various times that Claimant had performed a significant amount of exploration work at Reko Diq. For example, in its submission to the Balochistan High Court in 2007, the GOB stated:\n\n\"*It was as a result of* [the foreign investors' US$ 200 million] *investment that the large copper and gold deposits were discovered in 1996-1997.* [The GOB and the BDA] *have been very closely monitoring the progress of the subject project and receive* [sic] *Quarterly Reports which detail the progress that is being made, local employment that has been provided and investments made in each quarter*.\"1318\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, p. 6.\n\n1167.\n\nThe MMDD also reported in its 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary:\n\n\"[TCC] *ha*[s] *done tremendous efforts in discovering the Reko-Diq Copper & Gold prospects, and going according to schedule. \u2026 Mining is one of the most difficult activities to be carried out requiring huge amount of investment, rich expertise and skills, and very careful planning and proper management to make it a success. The way of working and performance reflect that their attitude is serious and they are committed to develop the project.*\"1319\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 19.\n\n1168.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal sees no basis for the allegation that Claimant failed to explore the area over the last 17 years and finds that there is no merit in the Licensing Authority's fourth ground.\n\n**(i) The First Set of Grounds: TCCP Was Not the Proper Applicant**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1169.\n\nThe first set of grounds invoked by Respondent is based on the argument that TCCP was not eligible to file the Mining Lease Application without its Joint Venture partner under the CHEJVA, given that it had not acquired the GOB's interest in the Joint Venture beforehand. The fifth and sixth ground state:\n\n\"*That the present application has been filed on behalf of M/S Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd and not on behalf of co sharer, who was alleged to be co-associate in the working project under the Rule 48 of the Balochistan Mineral Rule 2002. Since the applicant alone was not allottee of exploration licence and thus not legally applicant is not competent to make application for grant of Mining lease.*\n\n*That the Mines Committee has noted the fact that the application was received on 18-02-2011 and the licence had expired on 19-02-2011 later on request was made to the Secretary, Mines & Mineral Department, Government of Balochistan on 03-03-2011 for participating in the mining lease. This fact indicates that the application was filed alone by the company and the co sharer was not made party in it. In such circumstances, the application is incomplete and is in violation of rule 48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002.*\"1320\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 6.\n\n1170.\n\nAs to the requirements to be met by TCCP, the Tribunal considers that it has to be distinguished between (i) the regulatory requirements established by the 2002 BM Rules; and (ii) the contractual procedure foreseen in the CHEJVA.\n\n1171.\n\nAs stated above, rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules requires that the applicant be \"*a body corporate formed by or under a law for the time being in force in Pakistan.*\"1321 Rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules refers to \"*the holder of exploration licence*\" making an application for a mining lease and rule 48(2)(a) provides that a mining lease shall not be granted \"*if, at the time of the application, any person other than the application holds any exploration licence conferring an exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in that area of land in respect of that mineral or group of minerals*.\"1322 Pursuant to rule 23(1)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules, \"*an exploration licence shall confer on the licensee \u2013 (a) the exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in the exploration area in respect of any mineral or group of minerals to which the licence relates.*\"1323\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 47(1).\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 48(1) and 48(2)(a).\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 23(1)(a).\n\n1172.\n\nIn sum, the 2002 BM Rules require that (i) the applicant is a company incorporated in Pakistan; (ii) the applicant is an exploration license holder; and (iii) no person other than the applicant has been granted an exclusive right to explore the area over which the mining lease is being sought. While the first requirement has clearly been met as set out above, Respondent argues that TCCP held only a 75% interest in Exploration License EL-5, while its Joint Venture partner held the other 25%, and therefore was not the exploration license holder; in addition, its partner also held an exclusive right to explore the area according to rule 23(1), which prevented the grant of a mining lease to TCCP under rule 48(2)(a).\n\n1173.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's first argument. The Joint Venture was unincorporated and, pursuant to Clause 4.1 of the CHEJVA, nothing in the CHEJVA was intended to create a trust, mining or commercial partnership or a new legal entity \"*for any purpose whatsoever*.\"1324 Clause 4.3 of the CHEJVA further provides that the Joint Venture partners held a beneficial interest in the Joint Venture Property as tenants-in-common according to their respective Percentage Interest.1325 While the Tribunal is aware that EL-5 was granted and renewed in favor of the Joint Venture, the parties to the CHEJVA apparently considered that TCCA (and later TCCP) held an interest in the Exploration License EL-5 \u2013 distinguishable from Claimant's interest in the Joint Venture as such.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 4.1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 4.3.\n\n1174.\n\nThis understanding of the parties is demonstrated by the fact that the GOB, BHP and TCCA entered into a separate Novation Agreement for Exploration License EL-5, which states that the parties intended \"*to transfer by novation BHPB's undivided interest in the Licence to TCC such that TCC shall replace BHPB as a party to the Licence*.\"1326 Subsequently, on 5 November 2007 and 3 January 2008, the GOB gave its no-objection to the transfer of TCCA's interest in EL-5 to TCCP through the amalgamation of TCCA's Pakistani branch into TCCP.1327\n\n**Exhibit RE-153**, Recital E. It is not clear from this document on which date the Agreement was concluded. However, by letter of 8 April 2006, the Licensing Authority referred to an application dated 28 March 2006 and informed the Joint Venture that it \"*has been pleased to assign your Exploration License No. EL(5) \u2026 in favour of M/S Tethyan Copper Company Limited under rule 64 of the Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002*.\" **Exhibit RE-25**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-61**, pp. 116 and 117 (numbered as pp. 103 and 104). While the Tribunal is aware of the fact that the no-objection was \"*subject to registering the share holding status of the component companies including the 25% share held by the Government of Balochistan (through BDA),*\" a condition that was not fulfilled because the GOB never exchanged its interest in EL-5 for a 25% share in TCCP, this document confirms that both parties considered that Claimant's interest in EL-5 could be transferred separately from its interest in the Joint Venture.\n\n1175.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers it undisputed that TCCP held a 75% interest in EL-5 (and not only in the Joint Venture Property as a whole). Given that there is no requirement in the 2002 BM Rules that the applicant must hold a 100% interest in the exploration license, the Tribunal is of the view that TCCP can thus be considered an exploration license holder under rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules. In fact, the Amalgamation demonstrates that Claimant transferred its interest in EL-5 to TCCP for the exact purpose of creating an eligible applicant for the Mining Lease Application.1328 The Amalgamation further records that the GOB and the BDA \"*had already given their no objection to the amalgamation as the same is necessary to meet the requirement of rule 47(1) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002.*\"1329\n\nThe Amalgamation records: \"*An application for the grant of a mining lease, under Rule 47(1) of Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, can only be granted to a body corporate which should be formed under the Companies Ordinance 1984 and other provisions of laws of Pakistan. Given the foregoing the respective Boards of Directors of the petitioners, after, inter alia, considering ways and means to improve and more economically carry on their businesses and to meet the requirements of Rule 47(1) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, had resolved that it would be to the advantage of petitioner No. 1 and petitioner No. 2 and their respective shareholders if by way of reorganization of the assets/undertakings of petitioner no. 2, which along with other assets, comprising the Licences, are amalgamated with and transferred to petitioner No. 1.*\" **Exhibit CE-21**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-21**, p. 5.\n\n1176.\n\nIn addition, the negotiations between TCCA and the GOB for a Shareholders Agreement illustrate the parties' initial plan that the GOB would acquire a 25% share in TCCP in exchange for the assignment of its 25% interest in EL-5 to TCCP.1330 The Tribunal notes that it was due to the GOB's decision not to go forward with the negotiations of the Shareholder Agreement, as recorded in the minutes of the Cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009,1331 that this plan was never implemented and TCCP thus did not acquire the remaining 25% interest in EL-5. In light of the fact that the GOB (i) was on notice at least as of 2008 when TCCA transferred its 75% interest in EL-5 to TCCP that TCCP was intended to become the (only) eligible applicant under rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules; and (ii) chose to abandon the plan to transfer its 25% interest to TCCP, the Tribunal considers that, in any event, the GOB cannot invoke the missing 25% as a reason for denying TCCP the eligibility to apply for a mining lease under the 2002 BM Rules.\n\nIn its letter to the GOB dated 21 May 2008, Claimant wrote that \"*the Shareholders Agreement only works where the Government of Balochistan becomes shareholder of TCCP and assigns its 25% interest in EL-5 to TCCP*.\" **Exhibit CE-331**. This intention is also recorded in the Preliminary Statements of the draft Shareholders Agreement returned to Claimant by the GOB with its comments on 24 October 2008: \"[C]*oncurrently with the execution of this agreement, GOB is assigning and/or transferring its 25% undivided interest in EL-5 to TCCP for a twenty five percent (25%) of the paid up share capital as an equity interest in TCCP pursuant to the terms of the GOB Assignment Agreement.*\" **Exhibit CE-231**, p. 7.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\n1177.\n\nAs to Respondent's second argument, *i.e*., the GOB's alleged exclusive right under rule 48(2)(a), the Tribunal is of the view that, while both Joint Venture partners held an \"*exclusive right*\" in relation to any third party to explore the area covered by EL-5, the GOB's 25% interest in the Joint Venture (and in EL-5) did not confer on it an \"*exclusive right*\"*vis-\u00e0-vis* its Joint Venture partner TCCA. Therefore, TCCP was an, and in fact the only, eligible applicant under the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n1178.\n\nApart from the regulatory requirements under the 2002 BM Rules, the CHEJVA contained a specific contractual procedure to be observed in relation to the application for a mining lease. Clause 5.7.1 provides that \"[w]*here so directed by the Manager, the BDA shall be responsible on behalf of the Joint Venture for making all applications \u2026 for Mining Leases required pursuant to Clause 5.9* \u2026.\"1332 The referenced Clause 5.9 provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*The Parties shall pursuant to Clause 2.2 seek an assurance from the Provincial Government, namely that the Joint Venture shall have the right to apply for a Mining Lease at any time during the conduct of Stage Three* [pre-feasibility work] *or Stage Four* [feasibility study work] *Activities if in the opinion of the Manager a decision to undertake mining development is likely to be made pursuant to either of sub-clauses 8.2.10(d)* [transfer of the Joint Venture Activities to the Mining Venture] *or 11.3.2* [any of the parties gives notice of intention to participate in mining development]*. \u2026*\"1333\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 5.7.1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 5.9.\n\n1179.\n\nClause 11.4.2 of the CHEJVA provides that in case Claimant gives notice of its intention to participate in mining development, but the GOB is (deemed) a Non-participating Party, \"*then subject both to* [TCCA] *obtaining all routine Government approvals required and to compliance with Clause 11.6,* [TCCA] *shall be entitled to undertake sole risk investment \u2026 in a mining development within any of the relevant Prospecting Licences.*\"1334 In this case, Clause 11.5 stipulates that the parties shall negotiate in good faith and, within 120 days from the Election Date, \"*agree upon the fair value to be paid by the Participating Party to the Non-participating Party as consideration for transfer of the Non-participating Party's Percentage Interest in all the Joint Venture Property pertaining to the proposed Mining Area*.\"1335\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.4.2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.5.\n\n1180.\n\nIn case the parties are unable to reach an agreement on the fair value, Clause 11.6.2 provides that the question shall be referred to an expert. Finally, Clause 11.6.3 of the CHEJVA stipulates that once the fair value has been determined by either means, \"*the Non-participating Party shall do all things reasonable and necessary to transfer all legal and beneficial interest in the non-participating Party's Transfer Interest to the Participating Party.*\"1336\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 11.6.2 and 11.6.3.\n\n1181.\n\nAccording to Respondent, TCCP was not eligible to file the Mining Lease Application on its own, *i.e.*, without its Joint Venture partner, because, contrary to Clause 11.4.2, it did not acquire its partner's 25% interest in the Joint Venture pursuant to Clause 11.6 beforehand. At the outset, the Tribunal considers it questionable whether a failure to comply with this contractual procedure could theoretically serve as a ground for the Licensing Authority to deny the Mining Lease Application because this is not part of the regulatory requirements on which the Licensing Authority must base its decision. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument.\n\n1182.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, under the 2002 BM Rules, the unincorporated Joint Venture was not eligible to apply for a mining lease; therefore, the CHEJVA provided that either (i) the Joint Venture partners would form a new, incorporated Mining Venture under a Project Agreement; or (ii) TCCA would notify the GOB of its intent to participate in a mining development and, in case, the GOB decided, or was deemed, not to participate, would be entitled to proceed with the mining development on its own.\n\n1183.\n\nWhile it is correct that, under the second scenario, the CHEJVA provides for a detailed procedure as to how TCCA would then acquire the GOB's interest in the Joint Venture, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that this procedure had to be completed before TCCP could apply for a mining lease. First, Clause 11.4.2 does not state that the application for a mining lease, specifically, is subject to \"*compliance with Clause 11.6*,\" but rather refers more generally to Claimant's entitlement \"t *o undertake sole risk investment \u2026 in a mining development*.\" In addition and more importantly, the Tribunal considers that, if Respondent's interpretation of the contractual provisions in the CHEJVA were correct, the GOB could in fact block any further mining development by refusing to participate in the procedure set out in the CHEJVA. This is particularly relevant given that in the present case Exploration License EL-5 was to expire three months after Claimant had notified the GOB of its intention to participate in mining development and there was no possibility under the 2002 BM Rules to apply for a further renewal.\n\n1184.\n\nWhile Respondent correctly pointed out that Claimant did not even attempt to acquire the GOB's interest until 3 March 2011, *i.e.*, after the Application was filed, the record shows that Claimant repeatedly emphasized the need for action in light of the impending expiry of EL-5. According to TCC's minutes of a meeting with the MMDD on 8 November 2010, *i.e.*, before the time limit for the GOB's election to participate in the Mining Venture expired, the Secretary of the MMDD indicated that their review of the Feasibility Study would require at least six months. The minutes further record:\n\n\"*Mr. von Borries explained that assuming the GOB elected to participate, both parties need to form a Mining Venture in order to submit the Mining Lease Application before the expiration of EL-5 on 19th February 2011. Therefore he asked whether the GOB would sign a Memorandum of Understanding in order to file for a Mining Lease Application. Mr. Raisani said the GoB would agree with the MOU and make its election to participate after the presentation* [of the Feasibility Study] *to the cabinet has been done*.\"1337\n\n**Exhibit CE-103**, p. 3 (emphasis in original).\n\n1185.\n\nIn his letter to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 30 November 2010, Mr. von Borries (in his function as Manager of the Joint Venture) noted that the 90-day election period under Clause 11.3.1 of the CHEJVA had expired on 24 November 2010 and that he had received no notification from the GOB. Mr. von Borries informed both parties to the CHEJVA that \"*the procedure laid out down in the CHEJVA \u2026 shall now follow*\" and suggested that the parties and the Manager meet at their earliest convenience \"*to discuss and formulate the future course of action pursuant to the CHEJVA.*\"1338\n\n**Exhibit CE-24**.\n\n1186.\n\nFollowing a request from the MMDD, dated 18 December 2010, to extend the 90-day election period under the CHEJVA until the review of the Feasibility Study would be completed,1339 Mr. von Borries again noted in his letter to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 29 December 2010 that the election period under the CHEJVA had expired on 24 November 2010, with no response from the GOB. He further emphasized that Exploration License EL-5 would expire on 19 February 2011 and, \"[g]*iven these circumstances*,\" asked for \"*advice as to how to move forward*\" in considering this request.1340 It appears from the record that there was no response to this letter.\n\n**Exhibit CE-266**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-109**.\n\n1187.\n\nIn a further letter to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 8 February 2011, *i.e.*, shortly before the Mining Lease Application was filed on 15 February 2011, Mr. von Borries again noted that EL-5 would expire on 19 February 2011 and stated:\n\n\"[I]*t is imperative that the Mining Lease Application in relation to the Mining Area (as defined in the CHEJVA) for the Mining Operations (as defined in the CHEJVA) of the Reko Diq project may be filed with the licensing authority ahead of the expiration of EL-5. As per requirements of rule 47(1) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, the Mining Lease Application will be filed by Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Private) Limited which is a company incorporated under the laws of Pakistan.*\"1341\n\n**Exhibit CE-113**, p. 1.\n\n1188.\n\nMr. von Borries further enclosed a draft letter to be signed by the Secretary of the MMDD by which the MMDD would ask the Manager of the Joint Venture \"*to take all necessary steps in order to file the Mining Lease Application by* [TCCP] *on behalf of the \u2026 Joint Venture with the licensing authority in relation to the Mining Area*.\"1342 The letter was never signed by the MMDD and it appears from the record that, again, there was no response.\n\n**Exhibit CE-113**, p. 2.\n\n1189.\n\nBy letter of 3 March 2011, *i.e*., two weeks after the Mining Lease Application was filed, Claimant notified the GOB of its intention to purchase the interest of the GOB (as Non-participating Party) in the Joint Venture and to engage with the GOB in agreeing the fair value of such interest pursuant to Clause 11.5.3 of the CHEJVA. At the same time, Claimant noted that \"*it is still the wish of TCC and its shareholders to have the GOB as a 25% partner in the Reko Diq project. TCC would welcome the opportunity to discuss how this can be achieved.*\"1343\n\n**Exhibit CE-25**.\n\n1190.\n\nBy letter of 28 March 2011, the GOB stated that \"*the matter is subjudice in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Provincial Government at this stage is not in a position to negotiate / discuss the provisions of CHEJVA for becoming either a participating or non-participating party, as well as consideration of Joint Application for mining lease till the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan is arrived*.\" In conclusion, the GOB therefore requested that the time limit for its election be postponed until after the Supreme Court's decision would be rendered.1344\n\n**Exhibit CE-114**.\n\n1191.\n\nFollowing Claimant's letter dated 29 April 2011 by which it noted that the 120-day period for reaching a mutually agreeable decision under Clause 11.6.2 had expired and notified the GOB of its intention to submit the matter to an independent expert,1345 the GOB reiterated its position in its letter dated 8 May 2011 that it would be \"*premature and unhealthy to proceed further in disregard of court proceedings*\" and concluded that it would be \"*better we may not proceed till the case is decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan*.\"1346\n\n**Exhibit CE-115**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-116**.\n\n1192.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal considers it established that irrespective of the exact date on which Claimant notified the GOB of its intent to purchase the GOB's interest in the Joint Venture, the GOB refused to acknowledge, while the Supreme Court proceedings were still ongoing, that it was deemed a Non-participating Party pursuant to Clause 11.3.3 and, consequently, to negotiate with Claimant or participate in the contractual procedure for the determination of the fair value to be paid in consideration for the transfer of its interest. The GOB also refused to consider a joint application for a mining lease even though Mr. von Borries had repeatedly emphasized that the Exploration License EL-5 was about to expire and would have already expired by the time the GOB communicated such refusal in its letter of 28 March 2011, if TCCP had not taken unilateral action by then.\n\n1193.\n\nTherefore, if Respondent's interpretation of the CHEJVA provisions were correct, the GOB could, and would successfully, have blocked any action that prevented EL-5 from expiring in February 2011 because there would not have been any eligible applicant at the time that could have filed a mining lease application for this area. In the Tribunal's view, this cannot have been the intent of the contracting parties when they entered into the CHEJVA and clearly does not correspond to the co-operation and good faith obligations of the GOB as set out in Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA. Therefore, the non-completion of the contractual procedure can in any event not serve as a ground for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application.\n\n**(ii) The Second Set of Grounds: The Feasibility Study Did Not Provide for Processing, Smelting and Refining the Ore**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1194.\n\nThe second set of grounds invoked by Respondent is based on the alleged silence of Claimant's Feasibility Study as to the further treatment of the ore after its extraction. The ninth ground states:\n\n\"*That feasibility report is silent about the processing, smelting and refining of the metals / minerals to be extracted from the mining area.*\"1347\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 9.\n\n1195.\n\nAs to the processing of the ore, the Tribunal notes that Chapter 6 of the Feasibility Study is entitled \"*Metallurgy and Process Development*\" and presents at a total length of 145 pages how Claimant intended to process the ore into concentrate.1348 Therefore, the Feasibility Study is clearly not \"*silent about the processing*\" of the minerals to be extracted from the Mining Area.\n\n**Exhibit CE-249**.\n\n1196.\n\nWith regard to the smelting and refining of the concentrate, Claimant anticipated in the Feasibility Study that the ore would be transported via a pipeline to the port of Gwadar and then be exported in order to be smelted and refined outside of Pakistan. The Tribunal is also aware that the GOB had repeatedly requested that Claimant build a local smelter and refinery, something which Claimant refused as being uneconomic. Therefore, the Tribunal has to assess whether the GOB was entitled to make such request or, more specifically, whether the Licensing Authority was entitled to refuse the Mining Lease Application on such grounds.\n\n1197.\n\nRule 48(3)(a)(vii) of the 2002 BM Rules, as amended as of 1 October 2010, provides that the Licensing Authority shall not grant the application for a mining lease unless the applicant submits \"*a concrete proposal for value addition of the ore to be produced / exploited from the applicant's mining lease within the country \u2026, or if the facility is not available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of province with the prior approval of the Provincial Government.*\"1349\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, Notification on p. 162.\n\n1198.\n\nClaimant's witness Mr. Livesey acknowledged during the Hearing that, even though the amendment was enacted only after Claimant had submitted the Feasibility Study to the GOB, this amended requirement had to be observed when TCCP filed its Mining Lease Application in February 2011.1350 However, the Parties are in dispute as to the meaning of the term \"*value addition*\" and, consequently, whether TCCP satisfied the requirement in its Application. While Respondent alleges that rule 48(3)(a)(vii) established a requirement to build a smelter and refinery within Pakistan, Claimant argues that the term \"*value addition*\" is used in the industry for the processing of the ore into concentrate. This was confirmed by Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs during the Hearing:\n\n\"*Q. And is turning ore into concentrate value addition to the ore?*\n\n*A. Absolutely. I mean, if you don't turn it into concentrate, it's essentially just rocks.*\n\n*Q. Is that how it's widely understood in the industry?*\n\n*A. Absolutely. It's probably the biggest value addition to it in the mining process.*\"1351\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1317 line 22 to p. 1318 line 9.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1037 lines 8-15.\n\n1199.\n\nIn response to the question \"[w]*hat is the* [sic] *understood under* 'value addition' *of ore in the mining industry in general*,\" Mr. Livesey confirmed that \"*you have immediately added value to the ore by creating the concentrate*\" and explained that the ore is thereby turned into \"*a product that is saleable on the international market*.\"1352 Mr. Livesey further emphasized that \"[w]*e consider we have created value addition. Just to be clear, we don't consider this to be the request for a smelter, or the requirement, rather, for a smelter.*\"1353 Finally, he added that \"*adding a smelter to the project would be value-destructive, not value accretive*.\"1354\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1425 line 19 to p. 1427 line 1.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1317 lines 15-18.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1318 lines 10-11.\n\n1200.\n\nRespondent's witness Mr. Khokhar was also asked during the Hearing whether the processing of ore constitutes value addition:\n\n\"*Q. And turning ore into concentrate is a form of treatment of ore; correct?*\n\n*A. To an extent, yeah, maybe.*\n\n*Q. Okay. And you would agree with me that treatment of the ore adds value to the ore; correct?*\n\n*A. Partially, yes.*\"1355\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1773 lines 15-20.\n\n1201.\n\nTaking into account the above testimony of the witnesses, the Tribunal considers that the term \"*value addition*\" in rule 48(3)(a)(vii) of the 2002 BM Rules cannot be interpreted to establish a requirement for a smelter and refinery within Pakistan. If it were otherwise, the Tribunal would have to assume that Respondent introduced the requirement specifically in order to target Claimant's project and to prevail with the GOB's request for a local smelter and refinery; such conduct would then not correspond to *bona fide* regulatory exercise of State power but rather to an abuse of sovereign power to achieve a concession that the Governments had failed to achieve through negotiations with Claimant. In light of the rather general wording of the requirement, which appears to have a different meaning in the industry, the Tribunal does not wish to go that far, but rather finds that TCCP's Mining Lease Application has satisfied this particular requirement by providing a \"*concrete proposal*\" for processing the ore into concentrate within Pakistan.\n\n1202.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Licensing Authority further stated in its tenth ground:\n\n\"*That in view of aforementioned reasons, the Committee found that the application submitted by the applicant is not satisfactory. It is also not in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the lease cannot be granted on a documents which is in complete* [sic] *and sketchy.*\"1356\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6 10.\n\n1203.\n\nThe Licensing Authority thus (also) bases its denial of the Mining Lease Application on the discretionary elements contained in rules 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which a mining lease shall not be granted unless \"*the proposals submitted with the application are satisfactory*\" and \"*it is in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease*.\"1357\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi).\n\n1204.\n\nWhile these elements indeed granted a certain amount of discretion to the Licensing Authority, the Tribunal also recalls its finding above that Claimant legitimately expected that the Licensing Authority would exercise such discretion in line with the security of tenure conferred in Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA and the assurances given by Government officials throughout the years of Claimant's exploration work at Reko Diq. In particular, Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA provides that Claimant shall be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease \"*subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements*.\"1358\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 11.8.2.\n\n1205.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it has to be taken into account at this point that, following the GOB's repeated emphasis on having a local smelter and refinery, Claimant provided the GOB with a white paper that set out the reasons why a local smelter and refinery would (i) \"*not* [be] *economically justified*\"; (ii) make the Reko Diq project \"*unprofitable and therefore unviable*\"; and (iii) \"*not be necessary in order to ensure that TCC and the GOB are properly paid for the metal content of the concentrate that is produced*.\"1359 Respondent further admitted during the Hearing:\n\n\"*At no stage was the Government of Balochistan saying that it would be a profitable element on its own for a smelter to be constructed. But what they were saying was, it was necessary in order to get the social license to operate*.\"1360\n\n**Exhibit C-237**, p. 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 9), p. 2600 lines 13-18.\n\n1206.\n\nIn light of this admission, the Tribunal considers that, while the construction of a smelter may have remained a point of negotiation for the Mineral Agreement (as evidenced by Claimant's 5 October 2010 offer to co-finance a feasibility study for a Government-owned smelter and to supply such smelter on mutually acceptable terms),1361 spending an additional US$ 1 billion on, undisputedly uneconomic, non-mining facilities could certainly not be considered a \"*routine*\" requirement that the Licensing Authority could have imposed on Claimant as the price for receiving the mining lease. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the denial of the Mining Lease Application based on such grounds was not in line with Claimant's legitimate expectation that TCCP's Application would be assessed in accordance with the contractual agreements and assurances given to Claimant.\n\n**Exhibit CE-257**.\n\n**(iii) Third Set of Grounds: TCCP Failed to Submit a Proper/Complete Feasibility Study on the Discovered Deposits in the Exploration Area**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1207.\n\nRespondent further invokes that, contrary to the regulatory requirements and Claimant's undertaking in the application for the second renewal of Exploration License EL-5, the Feasibility Study that Claimant submitted together with its Mining Lease Application covered only the mine development of two deposits (H-14 and H-15) rather than of all deposits within the exploration area. The second, third, seventh and eight grounds in the Notice of Intent to Reject state:\n\n\"2. *That the company did not make proper feasibility or exploration of the discovered deposits and achieve the targets under the rules.*\n\n*3. That the second renewal application submitted by the applicant, had given declaration that the applicant will submit the complete feasibility of the entire lease/exploration area. The applicant has utterly failed to submit the said feasibility reports and meaning thereby that they have failed to conduct and complete exploration in the exploration license / granted area.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*7. The relevant portion on the feasibility study report submitted by the expert committee was also examined by the Mines Committee and found following observation:*\n\n*(i) That the Company has failed to comment or dilate upon rest of discover deposits except H-14 and H-15;*\n\n*(ii) The proposed development, operation and scheme of the mines in programme of the mining operation for the 11 other potential resources is missing/omitted to be considered in the feasibility report;*\n\n*(iii) That the information given by the company in all respect keeping in to consideration the Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002, the Company has further failed to identify all resources and achievements of all the targets within stipulated time.*\n\n*(iv) Misrepresentation for obtaining exploration licenses EL-6, EL-8, EL-26 and EL-27 where there is no share of partner. Despite being a world class Exploration/ Mining Company so called partner has failed to submit the technical, financial, economical viability report of the entire resources of EL-5 enjoying with special relaxations in all respect allegedly granted by the Government of Balochistan for the last 17 years.*\n\n*(v) There is a default and violation committed under rule 29 (2) (c) (iii) of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002 as well as failure to provide the required information as contemplated under rule 47 of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002.*\n\n*8. That the submission of the application relating to H-4, H-8, H-13, H-35 and H-79 etc is in violation of rule-48 of Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002.*\"1362\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 7-8.\n\n1208.\n\nGiven that it is Claimant's position that the Feasibility Study covered only an initial mine development, which was later to be expanded as set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study, the Tribunal has to assess whether such a phased development of the mining area is in line with the regulatory requirements under the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n1209.\n\nRules 48(3)(a)(i) and (ii) of the 2002 BM Rules provide that a mining lease shall not be granted unless \"*the feasibility studies show that the mine can be profitably developed and operated*\" and \"*the proposed plans for development and operation of the mine and the programme of the mining operations of the applicant will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources*.\"1363\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 48(3)(a)(i) and (ii).\n\n1210.\n\nPursuant to rule 47(2)(f) of the 2002 BM Rules, the application for a mining lease \"*shall be accompanied by the relevant feasibility studies, and shall include, for the approval of the licensing authority, detailed plans for development and operation of the mine and programme of proposed mining operations, including a forecast of \u2013 (i) the date by which the applicant intends to work; (ii) the capacity and expected rate of production and scale of operations; (iii) the anticipated overall recovery or ore and mineral products; and (iv) the nature of the products.*\"1364\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 47(2)(f).\n\n1211.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that all of the above quoted provisions refer to a \"*mine.*\" The term is defined in rule 2(za)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules as \"*any surface or underground excavation where any operation for the purpose of searching for or obtaining a mineral has been or is being carried on, and includes all works, machinery, tramway, ropeway and siding, whether above or below ground, in or adjacent or belonging to or appurtenant to a mine but does not include the manufacturing or processing plant*.\"1365\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 2(za)(i).\n\n1212.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is no indication in the above mentioned regulatory requirements that the phased development of a mine is prohibited. In particular, the Tribunal considers that a gradual development does not exclude a profitable development and operation of the mine or an \"*efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources.*\" To the contrary, Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic, Chairman of Antofagasta, the world's biggest copper mining company, explained that even if an initial mine development as anticipated at H-14 and H-15 did not turn out to be very profitable, \"*the marginal expansions are very profitable*.\" Mr. Luksic then explained that this approach is common in the industry and corresponds to what Antofagasta has very successfully been doing at one of its mines in Chile over the past years:\n\n\"A. *Even if you have a start that is tight, your expansions are going to be extremely profitable. We have the experience, we have seen it. And this is how the mining industry operates.*\n\n*Q. You mentioned about the expansion, but if you don't have a feasible and viable project, there is nothing to expand, is there Mr. Luksic?*\n\n*A. Of course there is. This is how the mining industry works. You do your first project, you work for five years, and then you present your next expansion.*\"1366\n\n\u2026\n\n\"*H14 and H15 is a 5 billion tonne resource. You're going to work here, says 2 billion tonnes of those. In what? In 56 years.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*What you do is you start with a small mine or the smallest viable mine. So, you make the smallest investment first. And then you make marginal expansion on the same deposit, and those marginal expansions are extremely profitable. They're very, very, very useful. And this is what happened for us in one of our mines. We started with a plant the size of 85,000 tonnes per day. In the last ten years, we have taken that mine to 175,000 tonnes per day. And that is what happens in this mining world in mines, and that is what we believe is going to happen with H14 and H15.*\"1367\n\n\"*What happens after this \u2026 starting project, as I called it, then you start making expansions. You go, and this happens. I mean, you go to any mining board, and that's what we all do when you have resources like this. You can actually expand further, and we have in our case, in one of our mines in Chile, in the last 12 years we have expanded four times, and that's how we managed to get where we are.*\"1368\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 695 line 13 to p. 696 line 5.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 721 line 11 to 722 line 3.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 725 line 20 to p. 726 line 6.\n\n1213.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the unrebutted statement of Mr. Luksic that a phased development corresponds to the common practice in the industry is relevant to the interpretation of the regulatory requirements in the 2002 BM Rules. Not only does the Foreword state that the Rules were intended to be \"*internationally competitive*,\" but rule 31(1)(a), *e.g*., provides that an exploration license holder shall carry on the exploration activities \"*in accordance with good exploration practices*,\" which are defined in rule 2(q) (together with \"*good reconnaissance practices*\" and \"*good mining practices*\") as \"*practices which are generally accepted internationally by persons involved in reconnaissance operations, exploration operations, or mining operations, as the case may be, as good, safe and necessary in carrying out such operations*.\"1369\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**. Foreword, rules 31(1)(a) and 2(q).\n\n1214.\n\nIn addition, rule 45(1)(b(i) of the 2002 BM Rules expressly provides for the right of a mining lease holder to \"*carry on in the mining area, in conjunction with mining operations \u2026, exploration operations in relation to any such mineral or group of minerals.*\"1370 Rule 56(1)(a), which sets out the obligations of the mining lease holder with regard to keeping records on its mining operations, also repeatedly refers to \"*exploration operations*\" that are carried out within the mining area.1371\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 45(1)(b)(i).\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 56(1)(a)(v), (vi), (vii) and (ix).\n\n1215.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is convinced that the 2002 BM Rules do not require an immediate development of all deposits that were discovered within the anticipated mining area throughout the exploration activities, but rather generally allow for a phased development, as intended by Claimant. However, Respondent further argues that Claimant specifically undertook to submit a feasibility study on all deposits that were discovered within the area of Exploration License EL-5 when the Joint Venture filed its application for a second renewal of EL-5 and was therefore required to do so under rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n1216.\n\nRule 29(2)(c)(iii) provides that an application for a second renewal shall not be made \"*unless the applicant can satisfy the authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits and that the proposed activities could not have been reasonably completed during the period of the first renewal*.\"1372\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 29(2)(c)(iii).\n\n1217.\n\nIn the application for a second renewal of Exploration License EL-5 dated 2 November 2007, the section entitled \"*Justification for Second Renewal for 3 years over 90% of Existing El-5 Area*\" includes, *inter alia*, the following statement:\n\n\"*With EL-5 to expire in February 2008, the Applicant will be able to commence activities for drawing up the Feasibility Study in the first renewal period but will not be able to complete the same given the time that will be needed to carry out the Feasibility Study to tie the development of all the deposits, which are spread over a large are of EL-5, (some of which are still being reviewed through further drilling work) together into one mining project. \u2026* [t]*he Applicant considers that it requires a renewal for the full three year period over 90% of the existing EL-5 area to be in a position to fully develop the discoveries*.\"1373\n\n**Exhibit RE-15**, p. 11.\n\n1218.\n\nThe regulatory requirement in rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules consists of a \"*full feasibility study of the discovered deposits*.\" In the Tribunal's view, it is clear from the application for the second renewal of EL-5 that the Joint Venture intended to satisfy this requirement, given that the application was expressly submitted \"[p]*ursuant to Rule 29(2) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002*\" and the language in the above statement was apparently used to reflect the language used in the provision itself. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the alleged default referred to in the seventh ground (rule 48(3)(b)) could be based only on a direct violation of rule 29(2)(c)(iii); therefore, the Tribunal will focus on the interpretation of the regulatory requirement itself.\n\n1219.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the term \"*full feasibility study*\" does not mean that TCCP had to submit a feasibility study on each and every deposit within the exploration license area, irrespective of whether such deposit formed part of a reasonable (initial) mine development project. If the provision were interpreted in such a manner, this requirement would impose on the investor the uneconomic and irrational obligation to invest large amounts of money and working hours into the full assessment of deposits that were not meant to be part of the (initial) mine development because they were found to be too small or to have only limited potential in previous pre-feasibility studies.1374\n\nClaimant's witness Mr. Luksic confirmed during his oral testimony that such deposits might be developed later, \"*once you are completely established in the area, and then you will continue to explore your other targets and hopefully develop now in the future*.\" Transcript (Day 3), p. 722 lines 11-14.\n\n1220.\n\nIn addition, this interpretation would also be contrary to the approach explained by Mr. Luksic to start with a rather small investment into an initial project and then make additional investments into various expansions over the years when the initial investments had already paid off. Given that Respondent does not dispute that this is a common approach in the industry and further given that the 2002 BM Rules contain provisions expressly allowing for such phased development, the Tribunal is not convinced that rule 29(2)(c)(iii) BM Rules should be interpreted to require a development of each deposit to feasibility level before a mining lease can be granted.\n\n1221.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal recalls that the GOB was aware of Claimant's actual plans both through the meetings of the Operating Committee and the quarterly reports by means of which Claimant continuously informed the GOB of the progress made at Reko Diq. In particular, the Operating Committee agreed in its 26 October 2007 meeting on the preliminary budget for \"*full feasibility study on option 72 ktpd and parallel pre-feasibility study on expansion options*.\"1375 Given that Respondent does not contest that \"*option 72 kptd*\" referred to the Western Porphyries, *i.e.*, the two deposits H-14 and H-15, the GOB was thus aware as of that date that Claimant would prepare a \"*full feasibility study*\" on these two deposits and, in parallel, a pre-feasibility study on future expansion options.\n\n**Exhibit CE-64**, p. 3.\n\n1222.\n\nFollowing the approval of this approach, the GOB was kept abreast of Claimant's work through the quarterly reports; Respondent does not allege that there was any indication in these reports that the approach approved by the Operating Committee was subsequently changed or expanded. In addition, the application for the second renewal itself, in its summary of the progress made during the first renewal period, reported that \"*the focus of the geological team shifted from the Tanjeel area, primarily to the drill out of the resource at the W* [estern] *P* [orphyries]\" and further that \"[s] *coping studies for the pre feasibility and feasibility studies was carried out*.\"1376\n\n**Exhibit RE-15**, p. 10.\n\n1223.\n\nIn its 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary, the MMDD also reported that Claimant was planning to \"*produce 110,000 tons of ore and 2000 tons of concentrate per day at the initial stage and to increase it to the maximum of 220,000 tons of ore and 4000 tons of concentrate per day at a later stage*.\"1377 This demonstrates that the GOB was aware at all times that Claimant intended to pursue a phased approach with an initial project and future expansions; nevertheless, the GOB never indicated to Claimant prior to completion of the Feasibility Study that it considered the Study's scope to be insufficient and/or incompatible with rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n**Exhibit C-31**, p. 19.\n\n1224.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that Claimant intended to block the deposits that it did not intend to mine in the near future from being developed by anyone else. First, Claimant established that its approach corresponds to international mining practice, and second, the GOB intended to apply for the exact same area when it drafted the mining lease application for its own project in 2012 even though it intended to mine only H-4 in the beginning and it remains unclear whether it had any concrete expansion plans beyond this deposit.\n\n1225.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the Licensing Authority could not use the fact that Feasibility Study covered only H-14 and H-15 while the proposed Mining Area covered a total of 13 discovered deposits, as a ground for denying the Mining Lease Application.\n\n**(iv) Conclusion on the Grounds Given in the Notice of Intent to Reject and Remarks on the Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1226.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons given in the Notice of Intent to Reject could have justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application. In addition, the Tribunal considers that, even though the Licensing Authority, on its face, complied with the procedure set out in rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which the applicant must be notified of the reasons for the intended refusal and be afforded the opportunity to make representations and/or proposals thereon, which in turn must be given due consideration by the Licensing Authority, the Notice of Intent to Reject and the subsequent denial letter did not fulfill the actual purpose of these requirements.\n\n1227.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the reasons set out in the Notice were \"*not commensurate with the size of the investment*\" because they remained at a very general level and further included several allegations that were false, even on a superficial review. In addition, the Licensing Authority refused, despite Claimant's repeated requests,1378 to provide any further clarifications on the stated reasons or to meet with Claimant prior to the expiry of the 30-day deadline, which it also refused to extend.1379\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibits CE-274** and **CE-29**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-28** and **CE-30**.\n\n1228.\n\nFinally, the Licensing Authority rejected the Mining Lease Application on 15 November 2011 with a single sentence of reasoning: \"*You are hereby informed that your reply was found unsatisfactory under Rules 10, 29 (2) (c) (iii) 47, 48, 52 etc of Balochistan Mining Rules 2002*.\"1380 This sentence does not convey the impression that the Licensing Authority took into consideration the arguments raised by TCCP in its 22-page response to the Notice of Intent to Reject, which already set out several of the arguments that were raised and subject to an intense debate in this arbitration.1381\n\n**Exhibit CE-11**.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-8**.\n\n1229.\n\nAs to the administrative appeal that TCCP submitted to the Secretary of the MMDD on 28 November 2011, the Tribunal notes that, following an order of the Supreme Court1382 and against TCCP's protest,1383 the Secretary advanced the hearing date on two days' notice.1384 As a result of this antedating, TCCP could not submit a written rejoinder to the submission of the Licensing Authority and TCCP's CEO could not be present during the hearing.1385 In addition, Respondent does not dispute that the hearing and TCCP's opportunity to present its arguments was cut short by the Secretary of the MMDD's announcement that he had to leave and travel abroad.1386 Finally, again following the order of the Supreme Court, the Secretary of the MMDD rendered his decision immediately after the hearing and without officially communicating such decision to TCCP.1387\n\n**Exhibit CE-131**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-136**.\n\n**Exhibits CE-132**.\n\nClaimant also claims that due to the antedating, TCCP's senior counsel could not arrive at the hearing in time. According to Claimant's letter dated 2 March 2012, its senior counsel could not arrive in Quetta before 2.40 p.m. that day. Given that Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey states in his witness statement that the hearing started only at 7 p.m., the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's submission is not supported by the evidence in the record. *See* **Exhibit CE-136**; Livesey IV, \u00b6 112.\n\nLivesey IV, \u00b6 112.\n\n**Exhibit CE-137**.\n\n1230.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal does not consider it sufficient that the requirements set out under rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules were complied with from a formal point of view and that the appeal procedure was conducted. In the Tribunal's view, the real question is whether the underlying purpose of these provisions, *i.e.*, to afford the applicant the fundamental right to be heard, was fulfilled. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD as appellate authority does not correspond to the treatment that Claimant could legitimately expect under the circumstances, *i.e.*, in light of the contractual and regulatory framework as well as the direct assurances given by Government officials on the basis of which it decided to invest more than US$ 240 million and many years of work into the project. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that that the manner in which the application and appeal procedure were carried out amounts to a further violation of the FET obligation.\n\n**(b) The Additional Grounds Invoked by Respondent in This Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1231.\n\nAs a last step, the Tribunal will assess whether Respondent can rely on additional reasons that were not raised in the Notice of Intent to Reject and whether they provide a justification for the Licensing Authority's decision to deny the Mining Lease Application. Respondent claims that Claimant failed to demonstrate in the Feasibility Study that (i) its project would be profitable; and that (ii) it would have or obtain the financial resources required to carry out the mining operations in an efficient manner. In addition, Respondent alleges that (iii) the security risks of transporting the ore via pipeline to the port of Gwadar had not been adequately addressed; and (iv) the water source for its project had not been fully assessed.\n\n1232.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject because Respondent would thereby be allowed to ignore the procedural requirements set out in rule 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules and, more generally, this would violate Claimant's right to be heard both during the procedure before the Licensing Authority and the appeal before the Secretary of the MMDD. Even though Respondent claims that in particular the first additional reason was in fact included in the Licensing Authority's ground no. 7 (iv), the Tribunal further considers that Respondent should not be allowed to benefit from the fact that the language used by the Licensing Authority was very broad and could have been interpreted in many ways. The Tribunal also takes into account that, as noted above, the Licensing Authority refused to provide clarifications on the reasons, despite Claimant's repeated requests in this regard.\n\n1233.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is of the view that none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application in the present case.\n\n**(i) The First Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Prove that the Mine Could Be Profitably Developed and Operated**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1234.\n\nAs to the first reason, *i.e.*, that Claimant failed to demonstrate in the Feasibility Study \"*that the mine can be profitably developed and operated*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal recalls the oral testimony of Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic who explained that \"[e] *ven if you have a start that is tight, your expansions are going to be extremely, extremely profitable*.\"1388 In light of this undisputed testimony and further taking into account the fact that two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to invest large amounts of equity into this project, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently established that the mining project as envisaged by Claimant, *i.e.*, consisting of the initial mine development set out in the Feasibility Study and the expansions set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study, could be \"*profitably developed and operated*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 695 lines 13-17.\n\n1235.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is aware that, contrary to the Feasibility Study, the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study that Claimant completed in July 2010 was not part of the documents that supported TCCP's Mining Lease Application. While the Feasibility Study contains a few references to an \"*Expansion Study*\" or a \"*second phase feasibility study*\" that it expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2010,1389 such references were not made in the context of increasing the profitability of the mine; thus, the Licensing Authority was not made aware, through the documents submitted together with the Application, of the economics as described by Mr. Luksic.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibits CE-97**, p. 1-1; **CE-98**, p. 2-1; **CE-99**, p. 4-3.\n\n1236.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers it essential whether the Licensing Authority nevertheless had knowledge of the fact that the anticipated expansions in the future would considerably improve the profitability of the mine over its 56-year life span. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that on 19 January 2011, Dr. Mubarakmand submitted to the Supreme Court that \"*the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice berg in the EL-5 area*\" and added that the GOB's project would yield a net profit of US$ 131,824 billion during the life of the mine.1390 Together with the above mentioned fact that Claimant's shareholders, two highly experienced mining companies, were willing to contribute their equity into the project, this strongly indicated that the project would indeed yield considerable profits over its life span.\n\n**Exhibit C-111**, pp. 6-8.\n\n1237.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal further notes that, if the Licensing Authority had observed the procedure set out in rule 48(4) of the 2002 BM Rules in this respect, Claimant would have had the opportunity to clarify its concept and explain the increasing profitability of the project through its expansions. The Licensing Authority's failure to (clearly) mention this ground in its Notice of Intent to Reject and to clarify its reasons must not go to the detriment of Claimant.\n\n1238.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that the initial mine development as presented in the Feasibility Study would have been unprofitable. While Respondent focused its argument primarily on the allegation that Claimant made wrong assumptions with regard to the tax and royalty regime, Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey explained during the Hearing that the profitability was much more sensitive to the prices of fuel and metals, in particular copper, and further stated that in light of the subsequent rise of the copper prices after the completion of the Feasibility Study, the profitability had increased \"*into high teens to twenties IRR even in the normal tax regime.*\"1391 This is reflected in the sensitivity analysis on metal prices conducted in Chapters 28.3.1 and 28.3.2 of the Feasibility Study, which further includes the statement that a \"*conservative base copper price*\" was selected for this analysis.1392\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1398 lines 12-22. *See* also pp. 1410-1422.\n\n**Exhibit RE-133**, pp. 28-20 to 28-26. Specifically with regard to Table 28.20 entitled \"*Impact of Price on IRR*,\" Mr. Livesey further explained that \"*if you were to take today's prices on copper and gold, you would actually be off the chart another block to the right, down on that bottom line, and your IRR would be somewhat close to 20 percent.*\" Transcript (Day 5), p. 1415 lines 16-19.\n\n1239.\n\nFinally, with regard to Respondent's argument that Claimant made wrong assumptions as to the tax and royalty regime, the Tribunal notes that the applicable tax and royalty rates were still subject to the Mineral Agreement negotiations. While such negotiations had apparently stalled before the Mining Lease Application was filed, the parties may well have decided to revive them after the grant of the mining lease, given that Claimant would then have been the only one allowed to conduct mining operations in the area. There would thus have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant would have been in a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became clear that the Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant made unrealistic assumptions in the absence of which the project would have been unprofitable without any future expansions.\n\n**(ii) The Second Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Establish That It Had or Could Obtain the Resources to Carry Out the Mining Operations Effectively**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1240.\n\nAs to the second additional reason, *i.e.*, that TCCP failed to demonstrate that it had or could obtain the \"*technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations effectively*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, Respondent claims that TCCP addressed third-party financing in the Feasibility Study only in the \"*vaguest and most incomplete and unsatisfactory of terms*.\"1393\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129.\n\n1241.\n\nAs part of its Introduction, the Feasibility Study sets out Claimant's Financing Strategy as follows:\n\n\"*TCC's Financing Plan for the project is to finance the development and commissioning of the project with a combination of Senior Debt advanced by a group of lenders and Shareholder Equity and subordinated Shareholder Loans provided by the project sponsors.*\n\n*The Senior Debt will be a traditional* 'Project Financing' *structure, similar to the structure that the sponsors have successfully put in place for other projects. Project Financing is typically sourced via consortiums consisting primarily of large international financial institutions (IFIs), governmental Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks.*\n\n*Given the large capital requirement for Reko Diq the funding approach to be undertaken will involve discussions with a large number of ECAs, IFIs, and commercial banks. Additional funding sources, including the potential for an Islamic tranche or funding tied to off-take will be evaluated. Finally, the potential to fund particular items that make up the overall capital number is being evaluated, particularly in connection with the power solution for Reko Diq and the port.*\"1394\n\n**Exhibit CE-98**, p. 2-10.\n\n1242.\n\nIt is further noted in the Introduction that it is important for the investment decision of each stakeholder whether the required contribution of equity and corporate guarantees is affordable and whether conventional financial institutions will fund the project, \"*particularly given the challenging aspects of the project.*\" However, it is further noted that \"[w]*hile certain preliminary work has been undertaken during the FS stage in relation to both* 'fundability' *and* 'affordability'*, it is generally not deemed appropriate to attend too much to these aspects of the project until completion of the FS and, wherein, there is a well defined project and well defined financial requirements.*\" Finally, the Feasibility Study expressly refers to the 2002 BM Rules that \"*require that the anticipated source of funding is addressed within the FS*\" and concludes that the above quoted information about the Financing Strategy \"*satisfies that requirement*.\"1395\n\n**Exhibit CE-98**, p. 2-9.\n\n1243.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that during the Hearing, Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic referred to meetings that Claimant's shareholders had with the World Bank, which supported a program for developing mining in Balochistan, the Asian Development Bank and \"*a few others, agencies that were very, very interested*\" in financing or being part of the financing of the project.1396 In response to the question why no documents were on the records that could support that statement, Mr. Luksic explained: \"*I don't think we ever got to that stage. We had lots of meetings, lots of previous meetings. We prepared, and you need to have a fully approved project before you get the financing.*\"1397\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 635 lines 5-10.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 635 lines 15-18.\n\n1244.\n\nFinally, in response to Respondent's suggestion that \"*without a Mineral Agreement \u2026 it would have been impossible or at least very difficult to obtain external funding for this project,*\" Mr. Luksic stated: \"*I'm not so sure. I mean, the World Bank seemed very committed. \u2026* [T]*hey were very committed to Pakistan developing mining. It had a special man in charge of a mining program, and they were very committed*.\"1398\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 675 lines 6-17.\n\n1245.\n\nIn light of this testimony and again taking into account that Antofagasta and Barrick Gold as two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to contribute large amounts of equity to the project, it appears improbable that they would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank. In the Tribunal's view, the absence of a Mineral Agreement might have made such financing more challenging, but there was no indication that it would have been impossible.\n\n1246.\n\nIn addition and apart from the above mentioned fact that the parties might have decided to resume the negotiations on the Mineral Agreement after the grant of a mining lease, the Tribunal considers that the requirement that Respondent tries to impose on Claimant with regard to the financing details is not realistic. Mr. Luksic confirmed what is stated in the Feasibility Study, *i.e.*, that it is premature to have more than general discussions on financing before the project is approved and its financial requirements are determined. This applies in particular when, as in the present case, the third-party financing is meant to be based on a project-financing structure, which naturally requires that the basic parameters of the project are fixed before a financing institution will enter into any commitment or even make a binding offer as to the financing conditions.\n\n1247.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the information given in the Feasibility Study satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules in the present context and the Licensing Authority therefore could not deny the Mining Lease Application on this basis.\n\n**(iii) The Third Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Adequately Address the Security Risks of the Pipeline**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1248.\n\nAs to the third additional reason that Respondent invokes, *i.e*., that TCCP failed to adequately address the security risks associated with transporting the concentrate via pipeline to the port of Gwadar, Respondent refers in particular to the following statement made in the Bankable Feasibility Report on the pipeline prepared by the pipeline construction company PSI:\n\n\"*The safety and security only includes minor support for the offices. No safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better cost estimate for this important task.*\"1399\n\n**Exhibit RE-119**, p. 71.\n\n1249.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the security risks were subject to an extensive discussion with Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey during the Hearing. Specifically with regard to this statement, Mr. Livesey explained that PSI is \"*not a pipeline security company, so the security risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under G&A.*\"1400\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1262 lines 7-13.\n\n1250.\n\nMr. Livesey further explained that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, Claimant did recognize the security risks and dedicated a separate section to this matter; specifically with regard to the pipeline, it had a mitigation strategy to avoid business disruption, which would involve \"*security along the pipeline using the local communities*.\"1401 The Tribunal notes that this strategy is reflected in the section entitled \"*Business Strategy*,\" which sets out three levels of strategic partnerships intended to reduce project risk: (i) the joint venture of Antofagasta and Barrick Gold, the partnership with the GOB and the \"*network of relationships with service and infrastructure providers and the socio-economic participants*.\"1402 The security chapter of the Feasibility Study further includes the following statement:\n\n\"*The concentrate pipeline route, choke and valve stations, and Panjgur drivers' rest stop will be patrolled by a light truck, a driver, and a guard on 24 h/d, 7 d/w basis. The three stations will be monitored by CCTV and access control and alarm systems.*\"1403\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1254 lines 12-19.\n\n**Exhibit CE-98**, p. 2-9.\n\n**Exhibit CE-255**, p. 19-40.\n\n1251.\n\nWhen asked about the Sui gas pipeline, which has been subject to various attacks and therefore has an extensive security concept implemented, Mr. Livesey explained:\n\n\"[t]*he Sui has pipeline and the rest of the gas infrastructure in Balochistan does not pay any royalty or revenue to Balochistan itself, so it's naturally a target because it's seen by the Balochis as being a non-Balochi project. It's being seen as something that is not adding value to them necessarily.*\n\n*The Sui gas pipeline is, I think, I would guess, 800 kilometers away from us, and it's a very easy target for exactly that reason. We would be paying royalty and we would have, we assumed, an equity stakeholder from the government, and we would be engaging with the local community to provide ongoing support for the project. So we felt our level of risk was much lower than in the gas pipelines, and that was our position.*\"1404\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1255 line 10 to p. 1256 line 3.\n\n1252.\n\nMr. Livesey further explained why they considered that the pipeline was a safer option than using trucks or railway:\n\n\"*When we did the analysis of the trade-off studies for the transport routes, we found that the chances of serious incidents on the roads were extremely high. It was another reason why we weren't keen on using the roadways, and we knew that on the rail the costs would be high and we wouldn't have access to it. And the rail itself is also subject to a lot of interruption from attacks. I think there has been probably half as many attacks on the rail as there has in the gas pipelines in the last ten years.*\n\n*\u2026 So, the pipeline option to us offered the safest and the cheapest option. We're talking about an 8-inch pipeline buried here in the ground with roving patrols along that pipeline made up of people from the local communities who benefit from that pipeline and that route staying in existence.*\"1405\n\n\u2026\n\n\"[Y]*ou've got an issue there with community relations by bringing in outsiders. And this is one of the risks that we looked at with trucking. If you bring in a trucking fleet to provide transport, there is no existing Balochistan company that can provide a contract trucking fleet with the 600, 700, 800 trucks required for the project.*\n\n*So, that likelihood is that that trucking firm will be tendered out to somebody from Karachi or from Sindh or Punjab. You would immediately bring into conflict that entire trucking route with the people of Balochistan, and this is exactly the sort of thing we're trying to avoid. We are trying to build this as Balochi-centric project. That's one of the reasons we moved away from Port Qasim and Port Karachi as our preferred port of operation because by moving to Gwadar you keep the entire project in Balochistan. It gives you a better chance to build that relationship with your partner, Balochistan, the 25 percent equity stakeholder in the project, potentially 25 percent stakeholder in the project.*\"1406\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1264 line 18 to p. 1265 line 12.\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1274 line 11 to p. 1275 line 9.\n\n1253.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Livesey's testimony is supported by the fact that the Feasibility Study contained separate sections on both security and risks, which identified certain issues and set out the strategies to address them.1407 While it is true that it is also stated in the chapter on asset evaluation that certain \"*residual risks*,\" including security risks, were identified the value of which was not included in the economic evaluation of the project,1408 the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that TCCP therefore failed to adequately address security risks. The same section cited by Respondent states that such risks \"*will require further mitigation attention during the subsequent stages*.\" In the Tribunal's view, it is plausible that not all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy evolves over time and the further development of the project. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume a failure on the part of TCCP to adequately address security risks in the Feasibility Study.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibits RE-132** and **RE-134**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-133**, p. 28-30.\n\n1254.\n\nFinally, Mr. Livesey emphasized that at no point until the rejection of the Mining Lease Application did the GOB raise any concerns and that, in fact, the pipeline was not even mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject. He concluded that \"*I don't see why this is all of a sudden become a significant issue.*\"1409\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1281 line 16 to p. 1282 line 13.\n\n1255.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal notes that the GOB had known about the option to transport the concentrate by means of a slurry pipeline since December 2007 when Claimant presented the transport options as part of its Mineral Agreement Proposals to the Governments in Dubai.1410 While the GOB did express its interest in having built a road to Gwadar in order to improve the infrastructure of the region, there is no indication in the record that it ever raised any security concerns with regard to the pipeline option. Respondent's witness Mr. Yaqoob confirmed during the Hearing that \"*there was no official discussion with the Government of Balochistan on security issues*\" and further that, to his knowledge, there was also no internal discussion between the Licensing Authority and the GOB.1411\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-219**, pp. 41, 46.\n\nTranscript (Day 7), p. 1925 lines 5-12.\n\n1256.\n\nFurther taking into account the fact that the pipeline as such, let alone the allegedly ignored security risks, were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that this additional reason invoked by Respondent in this arbitration played any role in the decision-making process of the Licensing Authority at the relevant time.\n\n**(iv) The Fourth Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Fully Assess the Water Source for its Project**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1257.\n\nAs to the fourth additional reason, *i.e.*, that TCCP failed to assess the water source that it intended to use for its project to full feasibility level, Respondent relies in particular on the statement made in the Final Report on the Water Resource Assessment that \"[a]*ll Preferred Groundwater Source acquifers span international borders,*\"*i.e.*, Iran or Afghanistan; however,\n\n\"*Hydrogeological assessment has been restricted to specific localities in Pakistan as permission from the Client to assess the adjacent groundwater resources by visiting Iran and Afghanistan was not received. Thus hydrogeological assessment of these areas to Feasibility level has not been carried out*.\"1412\n\n**Exhibit CE-410**, pp. 1-1 to 1-2.\n\n1258.\n\nIt thus appears that, as far as the Pakistani side of the acquifer is concerned, it is undisputed that Claimant did make a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for the project, *i.e.*, the Baghicha Bore Field.1413 The dispute between the Parties rather relates to the question whether it was inadequate for TCCP not to make the same assessment for the Afghan side of the acquifer because this would result in a substantial uncertainty for the project's water supply.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-410**, pp. ES-12 and 1-1.\n\n1259.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as emphasized by Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey during the Hearing,1414 the section quoted by Respondent above continues as follows:\n\n\"*Although most aquifers appear regionally extensive and the confidence level of hydrogeological extrapolation appears reasonable, there is a risk of hydrogeological misinterpretation as a large percentage of some aquifers cannot be physically assessed and tested.*\"1415\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1328 lines 4-8.\n\n**Exhibit CE-410**, p. 1-2.\n\n1260.\n\nMr. Livesey explained that the statement relied on by Respondent related primarily to the other groundwater sources that were assessed in the Final Report because \"*the bulk of the Tahlab and the Patangaz head waters are in Iran,*\" and they feed the Tahlab valley, the Tahlab River and the Saindak river; by contrast, \"*in the case of the fan sediments which was our selected area, the water flow was from Pakistan into Afghanistan, so, the feasibility of the water quantities in Afghanistan doesn't impact \u2013 it's not flowing back into Pakistan, it's flowing the other way.*\"1416\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1329 line 16 to p. 1331 line 1.\n\n1261.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Livesey laid out that in order to mitigate the risk of not receiving the required quantities from the Baghicha source, Claimant maintained licenses to the other areas, which gave them extraction rights with regard to the other water sources, if needed.1417\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1331 lines 5-13.\n\n1262.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Livesey's convincing testimony on this issue, the Tribunal notes that, according to its own Feasibility Study for the Supply of Water submitted on 7 September 2012, the GOB chose the same water source for its own mining project, citing the following advantages over other potential groundwater sources: \"*No other groundwater user*\"; \"*Large volume of groundwater storage*\"; \"*Easy accessibility of pipe line route*\"; and \"*Most of area of resource is in Pakistan*.\"1418\n\n**Exhibit CE-372**, pp. 12-13.\n\n1263.\n\nBased on this record, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant did in fact make an adequate assessment of the groundwater source it intended to use for its project so that Respondent's fourth additional reason also does not present a justifiable basis for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application.\n\n**iii. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n1264.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration justified the Licensing Authority's decision to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal is convinced that the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this motive. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent had created legitimate expectations on Claimant's part that it would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease \"*subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements*.\" Given that Claimant in fact fulfilled all of the requirements under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules in its Mining Lease Application, Respondent's denial, motivated by its desire to mine the area on its own, violated Claimant's legitimate expectations and thereby breached the FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.\n\n1265.\n\nAs a result of this finding, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion as to whether this conduct, together with the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or the Supreme Court proceedings amounted to a composite breach of the FET standard.\n\n**D. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 7(1) OF THE TREATY?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1266.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties as regards the applicable expropriation standard, which is contained in Article 7(1) of the Treaty:\n\n\"*Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as 'expropriation') the investments of investors of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and under due process of law;*\n\n*(b) the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and*\n\n*(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation*.\"1419\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**. Article 7(1).\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1267.\n\nClaimant alleges that Pakistan breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty by, without payment of any compensation, (a) arbitrarily depriving TCCA of its right to mine Reko Diq; and (b) appropriating information and data from TCC's exploration work and studies in order to use them in Balochistan's own project.1420 According to Claimant, Respondent deprived Claimant of its investment \"*precisely in order take over the project for itself*\"; therefore, the Governments' conduct amounts to an expropriation pursuant to either a \"*pure* 'effects' *test or a more motivation-centered test.*\"1421\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 505; Reply, \u00b6 452.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 216.\n\n**a. Pakistan Unlawfully Expropriated TCCA's Right to Mine Reko Diq**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. The Right to Mine Reko Diq Is a Protected Investment Under the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1268.\n\nClaimant submits that \"*TCCA's right to mine Reko Diq subject only to compliance with certain routine requirements*\" qualifies as an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty and is thus protected by the expropriation provision under Article 7(1).1422\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 507. **Exhibit CE-4,** Article 1(1).\n\n1269.\n\nClaimant refers to the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina*, which observed that the State parties to an investment treaty have confirmed that contractual rights can be expropriated where a contract \"*falls under the definition of* 'investment' *under the treaty*\" and the expropriation provision of the treaty refers to \"*expropriation or nationalization of investments.*\"1423 Claimant also cites the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina (III)*, which confirmed that:\n\n\"*the taking away or destruction of rights acquired, transmitted and defined by contract is as much a wrong entitling the sufferer to redress as the taking away or destruction of a tangible property*.\"1424\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 508. *Siemens A.G. v.

Argentina* [CA-52], \u00b6\u00b6 7.5.4, 7.5.18-7.5.19.\n\n1270.\n\nClaimant claims that its right to mine Reko Diq arises under Article 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA as well as under rule 48(1)(b) of the 2002 BM Rules, both of which provide for the grant of a mining lease subject to the satisfaction of \"*routine requirements*\" (*i.e.*, those specified in rule 48).1425 In Claimant's view, TCCP's Mining Lease Application \"*by far exceeded*\" those \"*routine Government requirements*.\"1426\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 509. **Exhibit CE-1**, clause 11.8.2; **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(1)(b).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 510.\n\n1271.\n\nIn relation to Pakistan's argument that the scope of Article 7(1) is limited to specific property rights, Claimant maintains that the provision protects TCCA's investment \"*as a whole*,\"*i.e.*, the mining business that it developed in Pakistan, which included, but was not limited to, the right to mine Reko Diq and the data and information contained in the Feasibility Study.1427\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 456-457.\n\n**ii. Balochistan's Rejection of the Mining Lease Application Constitutes an Expropriation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1272.\n\nClaimant submits that Balochistan's rejection of the Mining Lease Application in pursuit of its scheme to take over TCC's project deprived TCC of its right to mine Reko Diq and therefore constitutes a measure \"*having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation*\" under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.1428\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 511.\n\n1273.\n\nClaimant claims that Balochistan acknowledged that its measures constitute a taking and refers to the following documents:1429\n\n(i) the 24 December 2009 Cabinet decision to \"*tak* [e] *over Rekodiq Copper & Gold Project from TCCP*\";1430\n\n(ii) the 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary in which the MMDD stated that \"*the Government of Balochistan has decided to **take over the project from TCCP** \";*1431\n\n(iii) the 11 February 2010 Working Paper in which the MMDD referred to the Cabinet's decision \"*to take over the Reko-Diq Project from Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (TCCP)*\" and considered it \"*necessary to engage Legal Advisor / Consultant for advi* [c]*e before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of Exploration Agreement*\";1432 and\n\n(iv) the 22 May 2010 press release in which Balochistan's Directorate of Public Relations referred to an \"*official handout*\" issued the day before stating that \"*the foremost objective of the provincial government would be to **take full control of Reko-Diq Copper and Gold Project from its present operators***... *and thereafter*... *run the project itself.*\"1433\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 512; Reply, \u00b6 454.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 20 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 21.\n\n**Exhibit CE-89**, p. 2 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n1274.\n\nClaimant submits that a measure has \"*effect equivalent to expropriation*\" if it results in \"*substantial deprivation, or effectively neutralizes the enjoyment, of an investment*.\" Claimant refers to the tribunal in *AIG Capital Partners v Kazakhstan*, which held that such measures include\n\n\"*covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner in whole or in significant part of the use or reasonably to be expected benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.*\"1434\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513. *AIG Capital Partners Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v.

Ukraine*, which in turn referred to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal stating in the *Starrett Housing* case:\n\n\"[I]*t is recognized in international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.*\"1435\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513. *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v.

According to Claimant, Pakistan and Balochistan were fully aware of this value when they took TCCA's contractual and statutory right to mine Reko Diq and thereby rendered TCCA's property rights useless.1436\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 515-519.\n\n1277.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's argument that the rejection of the Mining Lease Application was an \"*exercise of regulatory power*,\" which does not amount to expropriation, Claimant argues that TCC did not lose its investment as a result of \"*non-discriminatory*\" and \"bona fide *regulations that aimed at the general welfare*\" passed by the Licensing Authority or any other organ of the GOP. Claimant emphasizes that it alleges an expropriation resulting from the passage of the 2002 BM Rules or other Pakistani legislation, but that it contends that Pakistan expropriated TCCA's investment by arbitrarily denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, taking over TCC's project and using the information and data that TCCA had obtained as a result of its exploration and feasibility work.1437 In Claimant's view, the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD acted *mala fide*, and in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner when they denied the Mining Lease Application to implement the preordained decision that the Application be \"*dispose*[d] *of*\" so that Balochistan could then take over the Reko Diq Project from TCCP and use the data and information from the Feasibility Study to mine the valuable deposits that TCC had identified1438\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 459-460.\n\nReply, \u00b6 461\n\n1278.\n\nClaimant submits that this conduct amounts to an expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, despite the fact the Licensing Authority pretended to apply the criteria of rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules.1439 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina (III)*, which commented that \"*international tribunals, jurists and scholars have consistently appreciated that* state *s may accomplish expropriations in ways*... *that may seek to cloak expropriative conduct with a veneer of legitimacy.*\"1440\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 519; Reply, \u00b6 462.\n\nReply, \u00b6 462. *Vivendi v. Argentina II* [**CA-52**], \u00b6 7.5.20.\n\n1279.\n\nClaimant further argues that \"*tribunals have recognized that where a government body acts outside the proper bounds of its authority, with the purpose and effect of destroying the value of an investment, the line between ordinary regulatory measures and expropriatory regulatory measures has been crossed*.\" Therefore, Claimant claims that Respondent cannot defeat its expropriation claim by relying on any exercise of authority under the 2002 BM Rules.1441\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 462-463.\n\n**iii. Pakistan Failed to Pay Prompt, Full and Effective Compensation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1280.\n\nClaimant submits that TCCA undisputedly has not received any compensation from Pakistan or Balochistan in connection with the rejection of the Application and argues that this is sufficient, by itself, to render the expropriation of TCCA's investment unlawful and in violation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty, regardless of whether the measures served a public purpose and were non-discriminatory.1442\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 520-521.\n\n1281.\n\nClaimant claims that, as a result, the Tribunal does not need to establish that the expropriation also failed to meet the other requirements of Article 7(1), *i.e.*, whether it (a) served a public purpose, (b) was not discriminatory and (c) complied with basic notions of due process. In any event, Claimant asserts that Balochistan failed to meet those requirements as well and refers to its argument that the Government ousted TCC from Reko Diq in order to develop its own project.1443\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 522.\n\n**b. Pakistan Unlawfully Expropriated the Data and Information from TCC's Feasibility Study**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. The Content of the Feasibility Study Is a Protected Investment Under the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1282.\n\nClaimant submits that TCC's rights to the content of the Feasibility Study as well as other studies that TCC prepared as part of its exploration work qualify as an investment within the definition of Article 1 of the Treaty; in particular, they constitute \"*intangible rights*\" and \"*intellectual and industrial property rights*.\"1444\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 524. **Exhibit CE-4,** Art. 1(1)(a)(i) and (iv).\n\n1283.\n\nClaimant notes that, TCC prepared the Feasibility Study and other exploration studies pursuant to Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA \"*at its sole cost.*\"1445 According to Claimant, the Feasibility Study consists of \"*nearly 18,000 pages*... *reflect*[ing] *nearly 200 component studies, with 300,000 hours of analysis, review and drafting*\"; it \"*contains commercially sensitive, highly valuable conclusions that are the culmination of a decade of exploration work at Reko Diq*\"; it \"*provides detailed guidance for a massive undertaking tailored to Reko Diq's unique characteristics and contains industry secrets and commercially sensitive proprietary information*\"; and it \"*includes improved processing methods, developed specifically for Reko Diq, which are currently the subject of a patent application in the United States*.\"1446\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 525.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 525 referring to Livesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 46-71.\n\n1284.\n\nClaimant refers to Clause 18 of the CHEJVA, pursuant to which \"*all Mining Information flowing to a Party by reason of the operation of this Agreement shall be confidential*\" and shall not be disclosed \"*without the consent of each party*... *to any third person,*\" subject only to certain narrow standard exceptions; in addition, the parties agreed to \"*take all steps necessary to ensure that the contents of*... *Mining Information*... *shall be known only to such persons as must necessarily acquire such knowledge in the course of their duties*.\"1447 In Claimant's view, by agreeing to Clause 18, Pakistan and Balochistan recognized TCC's property rights over the data and information contained in the Feasibility Study and other studies.1448\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 526-527. **Exhibit CE-1**, Article 18. Claimant also cites the definition of \"*Mining Information*\" in Clause 1 of the CHEJVA: \"*such information obtained as a result of Joint Venture activities in respect of the Exploration Area as is available including: all surveys, maps, mosaics, aerial photographs, electro-magnetic* *tapes, sketches, drawings, memoranda, drill cores, logs of such drill cores, geophysical, geological drill maps, sampling and assay reports, notes.*\"\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 526.\n\n1285.\n\nClaimant further notes that the first page of the Feasibility Study expressly reminds Balochistan that the information contained therein is confidential and that the CHEJVA parties had agreed to \"*cause their directors, officers, employees and representatives to use the information herein contained only for purposes specified in the CHEJVA and for no other purpose*.\"1449\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 528. **Exhibit CE-96**.\n\n**ii. Pakistan's Use of the Information from the Feasibility Study for Its Own Project Constitutes an Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1286.\n\nClaimant submits that by making unauthorized use of the data and information contained in the Feasibility Study and other studies for Balochistan's project, Pakistan and Balochistan have appropriated TCCA's intellectual rights, commercially sensitive proprietary information and industry secrets. In Claimant's view, TCCA was thereby deprived of the value of its investment, which constitutes a measure \"*having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation*\" under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.1450\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 529, 532.\n\n1287.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Balochistan's intention to use TCC's exploration data for its own project was acknowledged by Dr. Mubarakmand in a December 2010 TV interview:\n\n\"Now *when we work we will have the results of exploration in front of us which will help us and we will be able to benefit from those results*.\"1451\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 530. **Exhibit CE-108**, p. 6.\n\n1288.\n\nClaimant argues that Dr. Mubarakmand's statement is confirmed by the fact that Balochistan has:\n\n(i) adopted for its project a mining area, which is identical in size, shape and location to the area that TCC presented at the 25 August 2010 OC meeting when it introduced the Feasibility Study and TCCP outlined in its Mining Lease Application;1452 and\n\n(ii) used for its water supply project data and information about the Baghicha water source that TCC discovered in 2008 and identified in its Feasibility Study as the best water source for mining operations at Reko Diq.1453\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 531; Reply, 465. *Compare* **Exhibit CE-283**, p. 15 *with* **Exhibit CE-272**, p. 17. Claimant refers to the mining area identified in Balochistan's draft mining lease application of 25 April 2012 and notes that, even though Balochistan ultimately decided that it was not necessary to apply for a mining lease for the Government's project, it nevertheless sought to secure all the land within the area of TCC's previous exploration licenses. Reply, \u00b6 465. **Exhibit CE-283**, p. 4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 531; Reply, \u00b6 466. *Compare* **Exhibit CE- 282**, p. 3 with **Exhibit CE-371**.\n\n1289.\n\nWith regard to the water source, Claimant claims that the Government could not have chosen the Baghicha water source on any basis other than TCC's Feasibility Study, given that Balochistan's water supply proposal of 20 May 2012 does not indicate that the Government had undertaken any independent work to select this source, which is approximately 80 meters underground and cannot be detected from the surface.1454 Claimant further submits that on 7 September 2012 Balochistan submitted a \"[r]*evised feasibility*\" study for the water project, which contained information that was in substance identical to that in the Feasibility Study, and notes that, despite TCCA's requests, Respondent has not produced evidence that it independently undertook any feasibility work for its project.1455\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 531; Reply, \u00b6 466. **Exhibit CE-371**. Livesey IV, \u00b6 150.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 467-468. *Compare* **Exhibit CE-251** *with* **Exhibit CE-372**. Claimant submits that the drilling data from the GSP that Respondent relies on could not support Balochistan's planned mining operations, as the documents total only six pages in length and cannot support full-scale mining operations. Reply, \u00b6 469. *See* **Exhibits CE-392** and **CE-393**.\n\n1290.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's argument that the data and information contained in the Feasibility Study and other studies prepared by TCC do not belong to TCCA, but rather to the Government, Claimant submits that neither the CHEJVA nor the 2002 BM Rules permit the Governments to appropriate this data for Balochistan's own project.1456\n\nReply, \u00b6 470.\n\n1291.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the fact that the CHEJVA classifies the data as \"*Joint Venture Property*\" does not grant Balochistan the right to use it to TCC's exclusion because the Mining Information was intended to be used only for the Joint Venture's mining plans and was to remain \"*strictly confidential*.\" Claimant argues that Balochistan would have been entitled to use the data to undertake its own project only if it had been the sole Participating Party and had paid a fair value for TCCA's interest in the Joint Venture, including \"*the amount of exploration expense*.\" However, Claimant claims that by failing to elect to proceed in this manner, Balochistan forfeited any right under the CHEJVA to the Mining Information.1457\n\nReply, \u00b6 471. **Exhibit CE-1**, Article 18, sub-clause 11.6.1.\n\n1292.\n\nClaimant also refers to sub-clause 5.3.3 of the CHEJVA pursuant to which Balochistan was permitted to use the Mining Information and explore any area over which \"*the Joint Venture relinquishes any Prospecting License,*\" but \"*in dealing with third parties with respect to the relinquished area,* [had to] *maintain strict confidentiality in accordance with the requirements of Article 18.*\" Claimant argues that this provision would have been superfluous if Balochistan had been free to use Mining Information in any event.1458\n\nReply, \u00b6 472. **Exhibit CE-1**, sub-clause 5.3.3 as amended by **Exhibit CE-2**, clause 2.1.\n\n1293.\n\nFinally, Claimant refers to Respondent's argument that the Governments' use of TCCA's information for Balochistan's own project was permitted under rule 71(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides the Provincial Government with the right to \"*data*... *and other information in respect of exploration or mining operations*\" and submits that any regulatory action must still comply with the \"*fundamental requirements*\" of Pakistani law. Claimant refers to Pakistani courts stating that \"*if power confer[ed] on an Authority is exercised in bad faith or for any purpose against the concept of law, it is an abuse of power and fraud on the Statute*.\"1459\n\nReply, \u00b6 473. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 71(1). *Maple Leaf Cement Factory Limited v. Pakistan*, 2001 MLD 500 (\"*Maple Leaf v. Pakistan*\") [**CA-159**], p. 512A.\n\n1294.\n\nClaimant notes that the Director General of the MMDD stated in the foreword of the 2002 BM Rules that their purpose was to \"*attract the interest of investors on such matters as transparency,*... *security of tenure,*... *independent resolution mechanism etc., and to equitably meet the objectives of investors as well as aspirations of the Government.*\" In Claimant's view, the Governments' conduct cannot be reconciled with this purpose, as this would allow a government to become a competitor of the investor without prior disclosure of its intentions or subsequent compensation.1460\n\nReply, \u00b6 474, **Exhibit RE-1**, p. 7.\n\n**iii. Pakistan Failed to Pay Prompt, Full and Effective Compensation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1295.\n\nClaimant submits that TCCA has undisputedly not received any compensation for Balochistan's unauthorized use of the data and information contained in the Feasibility Study and other studies for purposes of Balochistan's own project and claims that, as a result, Pakistan's expropriation of this data is unlawful and constitutes a violation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty. In relation to the other criteria in Article 7(1), Claimant refers to its argument that the denial of the Mining Lease Application was arbitrary and contends that the expropriation was therefore also carried out without a valid public purpose, without due process and in a discriminatory manner.1461\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 533-534.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Claimant Never Had the \"*****Right to Mine Reko Diq*****\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1296.\n\nRespondent refers to the definition of expropriation used by the tribunal in *Tradex v. Albania*, *i.e.*, a \"*compulsory transfer of property rights,*\"1462 and submits that the question whether Claimant has acquired such property rights is determined by Pakistani law. Respondent claims that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, neither the CHEJVA nor the 2002 BM Rules conferred a guaranteed \"*right to mine*\" Reko Diq upon Claimant.1463\n\n*Tradex Hellas SA v Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award of 29 April 1999 (\"*Tradex v. Albania*\") [RLA-102], \u00b6 177.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 584-586; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 482.\n\n1297.\n\nRespondent argues that, besides the fact that the CHEJVA was illegal, void and *non-est*, Claimant never complied with the contractual provisions regulating when a joint venture party could apply for a mining lease in relation to an Exploration Area that belonged to the Joint Venture.1464\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 587. Respondent also reiterates its argument that neither Respondent nor the GOB was party to the CHEJVA and that a contractual right arising out of it therefore cannot be invoked against either of them. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 482.\n\n1298.\n\nRespondent refers to sub-clause 11.4.2 of the CHEJVA, which provides that \"*where the BDA is a Non-participating Party, then subject both to BHPM obtaining all routine Government approvals required and to compliance with Clause 11.6, BHPM shall be entitled to undertake sole risk investment (or form a consortium to undertake such investment in a mining area)*\" and claims that Claimant never sought, nor was granted any such Government approval.1465\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 588. **Exhibit CE-1**, clause 11.4.\n\n1299.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submits that Claimant did not satisfy the condition precedent of acquiring its joint venture partner's \"*percentage interest pertaining to the proposed Mining Area*\" for a price to be agreed by means of negotiations or expert-determination, as set out in Clause 11.6 of the CHEJVA.1466 Respondent claims that Claimant acknowledges its failure to comply with this provision by stating in its letter to the Secretary of Mines dated 29 April 2011 that the parties had been unable to reach a mutually acceptable decision pursuant to Clause 11.5 within 120 days of the Election Date, referring to its invitation to the GOB to negotiate of 3 March 2011, and, further, giving notice of its intent to submit the matter to an independent expert and accordingly proposing the name of an expert to determine the fair value of the interest.1467\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 589. Respondent notes that Claimant did not offer to purchase the interest prior to its letter of 3 March 2011, *i.e.*, after the Mining Lease Application had been filed. Counter-Memorial, note 626.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 590. **Exhibit CE-115**.\n\n1300.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Claimant did not refer the matter to expert determination, and claims that Claimant's alleged right to apply for a mining lease under Article 11.8.2 thus never arose, before TCCP filed its Mining Lease Application on 15 February 2011.1468 Respondent further notes that the potential for such right to arise was coterminous with the expiry of Exploration License EL-5 on 19 February 2011.1469\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 591. The Mining Lease Application was dated 8 February 2011; it was filed 15 February 2011; *see* **Exhibit CE-6**.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 396, 591; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 189.\n\n1301.\n\nIn addition, Respondent asserts that, even if the pre-condition was satisfied, Claimant's Mining Lease Application was for 99,473 square kilometers of the area covered by Exploration License EL-5, whereas Claimant's election as a Participating Party was the less than six square kilometers covered by the Feasibility Study. Thus, the question of any entitlement to the remaining 93 or more square kilometers of the area covered by Exploration License EL-5 does not even arise under Article 11.8.2. That sub-clause applies to a Participating Party's right to \"*develop a mine*\" in the Mining Area whose parameters are determined by the Feasibility Study. Respondent refers to the fact that the Feasibility Study notes that Claimant has the \"*right to apply for a mining lease*.\"1470\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 592.\n\n1302.\n\nRespondent further argues that any right under sub-clause 11.8.2 to convert an exploration license into a mining lease was subject to compliance with the routine Government requirements set out in rules 47 and 48 of the 2002 BM Rules and alleges that many of the requirements in rule 48(3) were not satisfied by the Mining Lease Application.1471 Respondent refers in particular to TCCP's alleged lack of standing to file the Mining Lease Application on its own, given that it had not acquired its joint venture partner's interest pursuant to Clause 11.4 before filing the Application, but only approached its partner to commence negotiations nearly one month later, despite the fact that it had undertaken to comply with the CHEJVA in its 2006 Undertaking.1472\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 593-594.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 595-597. **Exhibit RE-25**.\n\n1303.\n\nRespondent submits that in the absence of a guarantee that Claimant would obtain a right to mine Reko Diq, the right to apply for a mining lease under the CHEJVA does not meet the threshold of an \"*investment.*\"1473\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 599. Respondent refers to the case of *Nagel v. The Czech Republic*, in which the tribunal stated: \"*There was not, and could not be, a guarantee that a licence would in fact be obtained. That would depend on the Government, and the Government had made no undertaking in this regard. Mr Nagel could do no more than hope that his cooperation with the State-owned Czech company SRA would increase his chances to become involved in the operation of GSM in the Czech Republic, but he could not be certain of getting a licence. Although he may have been encouraged by various remarks from Ministers or Government officials or by the general interest they demonstrated in his plans, this was not sufficient, in the Arbitral Tribunal's view, to raise his prospects based on the Cooperation Agreement to the level of a* 'legitimate expectation' *with a financial value.*\" *Nagel v. The Czech Republic* [RLA-104], \u00b6 326. Respondent also refers to the case of *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, in which the tribunal considered it \"*important first to identify the object of the alleged expropriation*\" and found that \"*the Claimant had a very limited bundle of rights arising under the Order on Land Allocation, Lease Agreements, Foundation Agreement and Construction Permit. Thus, if the Kyiv City State Administration's omission on 31 October 1997 did constitute an expropriation, it could only have deprived the Claimant of these legal interests and them alone.*\" Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 604-605. *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* [RLA-105], \u00b6 20.7. Respondent claims that in the present case, Claimant did not even have a limited bundle of rights in relation to the Mining Lease Application, as its purported rights did not exist. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 606.\n\n**b. Claimant's Case on Expropriation Remains Unclear**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1304.\n\nWith regard to the alleged expropriation of a \"*right to mine*,\" Respondent argues that Claimant does not fulfil the requirements for establishing a breach of Article 7(1) of the Treaty, as it does not specify (i) the precise scope of its alleged guaranteed \"*right to mine*\"; (ii) when precisely such right was taken; and (iii) whether it was taken other than for a public purpose, discriminatorily and without due process. According to Respondent, the same applies to Claimant's \"*claim to performance of the CHEJVA.*\"1474\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 483-484.\n\n1305.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's claim that \"*the mining Business* [it purportedly] *developed in Pakistan*\" was expropriated, Respondent contends that Claimant has not defined what is meant by this phrase and has failed to link this alleged investment to an expropriatory act. Similarly, Respondent argues that Claimant refers to undefined \"*property rights*\" without specifying their nature, scope or source and the wrongful conduct alleged to have amounted to an expropriation.1475\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 485-486.\n\n**c. The Licensing Authority's Exercise of Regulatory Powers Over Mineral Resources Does Not Amount to an Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1306.\n\nRespondent submits that, in refusing TCCP's Mining Lease Application, the Licensing Authority duly exercised its regulatory powers with regard to the grant or refusal of mineral titles in Balochistan in accordance with the 2002 BM Rules.1476 Respondent claims that the exercise of a state's \"*police powers*\" will not give rise to a right of compensation under international law, as *bona fide* regulatory measures fall outside the scope of the expropriation provisions found in investment treaties.1477 Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, which held:\n\n\"*It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*[T]he principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are 'commonly accepted as within the police power of States' forms part of customary international law today.*\"1478\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 607; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 479.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 608.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 608, 610. *Saluka v. Czech Republic* [RLA-106], \u00b6 262.\n\n1307.\n\nRespondent also cites the tribunal in *Methanex v. USA*, which stated:\n\n\"[A]*s a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and which affects, inter alios (sic), a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\"*1479\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 609. *Methanex v. USA* [RLA-107]. Respondent further refers to the case of *Genin v. Estonia* in which the Central Bank of Estonia had cancelled an operating license held by a financial institute. Respondent claims that the tribunal in that case found that in light of the political and economic transition prevailing in the country at the time, the State had been acting, through the Central Bank, as a prudent and concerned supervisor in the banking sector. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 611. *Genin v. Estonia* [RLA-93].\n\n1308.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to Article 3 of the 1967 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property, which states that \"*no Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, of his property a national of another Party*\"; however, Respondent emphasizes that pursuant to subsequent notes, \"***the concept of 'taking' is not intended to apply to normal and lawful regulatory measures short of direct taking of property rights.***\"1480\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 612. OECD [RLA-108], p. 8 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1309.\n\nRespondent argues that the Licensing Authority did not cancel a mineral title, but rather refused TCCP's Mining Lease Application because it did not satisfy the requirements under rule 48(3), including the requirement that it be in the best interests for the development of minerals in Balochistan. According to Respondent, there is no evidence that the refusal was not *bona fide* and not a legitimate exercise of the state's police powers.1481\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 613-614.\n\n**d. The Claim that the Government of Pakistan Expropriated Information and Data in Relation to the Exploration of Reko Diq Fails as a Matter of Law and Fact**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1310.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's allegation that it expropriated \"*intellectual and industrial property rights in the Feasibility Study and other works (scoping study, pre-feasibility study, expansion study)*.\"1482\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 487.\n\n1311.\n\nRespondent claims that pursuant to the CHEJVA, the information and data arising from the exploration of the area covered by Exploration License EL-5 is Joint Venture Property; thus, Claimant cannot assume ownership of this information and data without having sought a transfer of its joint venture partner's rights in the Joint Venture Property.1483 Referring to Claimant's reliance on the confidentiality provision in Clause 18 of the CHEJVA in support of its argument that Balochistan may not use the information to TCC's exclusion, Respondent emphasizes that the CHEJVA does not contain an exclusivity requirement and argues that Claimant therefore cannot be the sole owner of the information.1484\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 616; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 489.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 489.\n\n1312.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimant's allegation that, by failing to elect to undertake its own project upon payment of a fair value for TCCA's interest in the Joint Venture pursuant to Clause 11.6.1 of the CHEJVA, Balochistan \"*forfeited any right under the CHEJVA*.\" Respondent argues that, to the contrary, only upon payment by Claimant of fair market value for Balochistan's interest would Balochistan have transferred its rights to Joint Venture Property; however, given that this never happened, Balochistan retained its right in the Joint Venture's data and information.1485\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 490-491. **Exhibit CE-1**, clause 11.6.1.\n\n1313.\n\nRespondent further claims that, pursuant to the rule 71 of the 2002 BM Rules, which Claimant undertook to abide by, the Government has exclusive ownership and rights over the data produced during the exploration.1486 Rule 71 provides:\n\n*\"71. Rights over data - (1 **) Subject to sub-rule (2), the Government shall have the exclusive right to all data including geological,****geophysical, geochemical, petrophysical, engineering, pit logs, maps, magnetic tapes, cores and production data, as well as all interpretative and derivative data including reports, studies, analyses, interpretations, bulk sampling results, assaying results, evaluations and other information in respect of exploration or mining operations.***\n\n*(2) Subject to sub-rule (3) the holder of a mineral tile or mineral concession shall have the right to make use of the data referred to in sub-rule (1), free of costs, for the purpose of exploration or mining operations and to retain copies or samples of material or information constituting the data.\"1487*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 617; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 488.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 617. **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 71(1) and (2) (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1314.\n\nRespondent also cites the 1995 NMP, which provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*Proprietary Rights over Data*\n\n*All geodata obtained by a licensee/lessee shall be a property of the Licensing Authority and shall be deposited at such offices and at such intervals as are specified in the Rules.\"*1488\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 618. **Exhibit CE-190**, \u00b6 8.18.\n\n1315.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant was aware that it did not have any right to the data under rule 71, given that the minutes of the OC Meeting held on 24 February 2007 record that:\n\n\"*Mr Hargreaves noted that GOB had expressed concern at the lack of submission of reports for the previous Tanjeel Feasibility Study. He stated that the full suite of engineering reports, all of which were in draft form at the point of suspension, had been delivered to BDA in early 2006. **He added that it could be misleading to submit the draft reports to GOB since these would effectively become public documents** containing outdated information, there was risk of extracts of information causing further confusion.*\"1489\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 619-620. **Exhibit CE-60** (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n1316.\n\nRespondent also notes that Claimant's witness Mr. Williams confirmed during the Hearing that Respondent had a right to, and thus owned, the data generated during the exploration of Reko Diq.1490\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 189. Mr. Williams stated: \"*That's the nature of mining around the world that it's reported\u2014the information as it's gathered is regularly reported to the relevant Government authority and that information belongs to the Government as the mineral right.*\" Transcript (Day 3), p. 531 lines 2-6.\n\n1317.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's argument that rule 71 may not be read \"*in a vacuum*,\" Respondent argues that (i) rule 71 does not contain a qualifier, but simply grants the Government with \"*the exclusive right to all data*... *in respect of exploration or mining operations*\"; and (ii) the Licensing Authority has not breached any applicable law, but rather its actions have been entirely consistent with its mandate under the 2002 BM Rules.1491\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 488.\n\n1318.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimant's allegation that Balochistan \"*used*\" the exploration data and information for its own project. Respondent emphasizes that Balochistan's project has not progressed and therefore, by definition, any data from the Feasibility Study cannot have been used for that purpose.1492\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 619; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 492.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1319.\n\nArticle 7(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"*Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as 'expropriation') the investments of investors of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and under due process of law;*\n\n*(b) the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and*\n\n*(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\"1493\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(1).\n\n1320.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Claimant separates its expropriation claim as follows: (i) Respondent arbitrarily deprived Claimant of its right to mine Reko Diq; and (ii) Respondent appropriated information and data from Claimant's exploration work and studies and used them for Balochistan's own project. In the Tribunal's view, however, the second claim is in fact contained within the first claim because the data and information that Claimant collected over the course of its exploration work and processed in its studies, in particular the Feasibility Study, as well as the costs that it incurred in this regard, form part of Claimant's investment at Reko Diq.\n\n**a. Claimant's Investment Within the Meaning of Article 7(1) of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1321.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it determined above that Claimant's investment is primarily based on two pillars: (i) TCCA's interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture, including in particular the right under Clause 11.8.2; and (ii) its interest in TCCP, which was established for the exclusive purpose of carrying out Claimant's activities in Pakistan and which held all further rights in the Reko Diq project that were not held by the Joint Venture. Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA includes a 75% interest in the Joint Venture Property, which is a protected investment under Article 1(1)(a) Treaty because it includes \"*tangible and intangible property*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(i) of the Treaty); \"*intellectual and industrial property rights*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(iv) of the Treaty); and \"*business concessions and other rights required to conduct economic activity and having economic value*\" (Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty). The information and data that Claimant collected and processed throughout its exploration work forms part of this protected Joint Venture Property.\n\n1322.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal notes that it does not follow Claimant's argument that the GOB forfeited its right to the Joint Venture Property by failing to elect to participate in the mining development pursuant to Clause 11.3 of the CHEJVA. Rather, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the GOB would have lost its right only upon transferring its interest to TCCA against payment of the fair value of its interest. However, the absence of such transfer does not exclude that Claimant's 75% interest in the Joint Venture Property, and in particular the information and data from Claimant's exploration work and studies, nevertheless formed an important part of its investment, without which the project could not have been implemented.\n\n1323.\n\nThe Tribunal is further aware of Respondent's argument that the right under Clause 11.8.2 to convert the exploration license into a mining lease \"*subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements*\" in fact never arose because the procedure under Clauses 11.4 through 11.6 was not completed. However, the Tribunal refers to its finding above that it cannot have been the common intention of the contracting parties that the GOB would be in a position to block TCCP from making a Mining Lease Application on its own by refusing to participate in this procedure. The same must apply to the most essential right of the Joint Venture (or TCCA as the Sole Participating Party) under Clause 11.8.2 to make use of the information and data collected during the exploration period by applying for, and being granted, a mining lease that would allow it to actually mine the area. Consequently, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's investment did include the right to convert Exploration License EL-5 into a mining lease upon submission of an application that met all routine regulatory requirements.\n\n**b. Respondent's Measure Having an Effect Equivalent to an Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1324.\n\nAs a next step, the Tribunal will analyze whether Claimant's investment as determined above was expropriated or made subject to a measure having an equivalent effect and, if so, whether any of the conditions set out in Article 7(1) of the Treaty was not complied with. If that was indeed the case, there is no need for the Tribunal to conduct a separate analysis on Claimant's second expropriation claim.\n\n1325.\n\nIn its analysis of whether Respondent breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal will first assess whether Claimant's investment was expropriated or made subject to a measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation. Given that Claimant still has its 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture and still owns 100% of the shares in TCCP, there has been no direct taking of Claimant's investment and it is thus undisputed between the Parties that Respondent has not (directly) expropriated such investment. However, the Parties are in dispute as to whether Respondent's conduct, in particular the denial of the Mining Lease Application but also the GOB's alleged use of the information and data, constituted measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation.\n\n1326.\n\nRespondent does not contest Claimant's submission that a measure has an \"*effect equivalent to expropriation*\" if it results in \"*substantial deprivation, or effectively neutralizes the enjoyment of an investment*.\"1494 The same is true for Claimant's reference to a statement made by Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the *Starrett Housing* case that property rights \"*must be deemed to have been expropriated*,\" even though the legal title formally remained with its owner, if the \"*State interfere*[d] *with* [the] *property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered \u2026 useless*.\"1495\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513. The statement is quoted in *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine AS*. [CA 72], \u00b6 408.\n\n1327.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal must determine whether Claimant's investment was substantially deprived of its value and/or rendered useless by Respondent's conduct, in particular by the Licensing Authority's decision to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application.\n\n1328.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the sole purpose of the Joint Venture under the CHEJVA and, likewise, of TCCP was to carry out the exploration and eventual mining operations at Reko Diq. After Claimant had spent more than US$ 240 million on its exploration work and had completed its Feasibility Study on the Initial Mine Development of the area, TCCP filed an application for a mining lease, which would have allowed Claimant to amortize the expenditures it had incurred during the exploration period. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, however, the Licensing Authority rendered it impossible for Claimant to make use of the information and data it had collected and thereby also rendered Claimant's interest in both the CHEJVA and in TCCP useless. Without a mining lease, neither of them could any longer fulfill their exclusive purpose, after the exploration had been completed; thus, following the denial of TCCP's Application, the value of both the CHEJVA and TCCP was effectively neutralized.\n\n1329.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application was a measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation. While the Tribunal is aware of, and agrees with, Respondent's argument that a *bona fide* regulatory measure of the State cannot amount to an expropriation, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that the decision of the Licensing Authority was not justified by any of the grounds invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration. Rather, it was motivated by the GOB's decision to implement its own project, instead of continuing its collaboration with Claimant, and therefore amounted to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation. At the same time, the Tribunal considers that such a motivation excludes the classification of the denial as a *bona fide* regulatory measure; despite its \"*disguise*\" as an exercise of regulatory power under rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, the denial amounts to abuse of sovereign power that can also constitute a measure with expropriatory effect.\n\n1330.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal's finding on the motive for denying the Mining Lease Application makes it superfluous to decide whether the expropriatory measure must further satisfy a motivation-centered test (in addition to a pure \"*effects*\" test) because the denial not only had an expropriatory effect, but it was also based on the GOB's motive to take the value of Claimant's investment for itself and therefore satisfied both tests.\n\n1331.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal considers that it does not have to make a separate finding as to whether the GOB's use of the information and data from Claimant's exploration work and studies for its own project amounted to a further expropriatory measure. While it indeed appears from the evidentiary record that the GOB intended to, and did, use information from Claimant's Feasibility Study, in particular with regard to the proposed Mining Area1496 and the groundwater source,1497 during the planning phase of its own project,1498 the Tribunal notes that the GOB did have a right to this information and data both as a Joint Venture partner under the CHEJVA and as the Government under rule 71(1) of the 2002 BM Rules. While the provisions of the CHEJVA may not have granted the GOB a right to use the information and data to Claimant's exclusion but only for the purpose of the project of the Joint Venture (except for information relating to \"*relinquished areas*\" under Clause 5.3.3, which does not apply in the present case), rule 71(1) of the 2002 BM Rules expressly grants the GOB the \"*exclusive right to all data \u2026 as well as all interpretative and derivative data including reports, studies \u2026 and other information in respect of exploration or mining operations*.\"1499\n\nThe coordinates of the mining area over which Balochistan intended to seek a mining lease is identical to the ones of the proposed Mining Area that TCCP applied for in its Mining Lease Application. *Cf*. **Exhibits CE-283**, p. 15 and **CE-272**, p. 17.\n\nThe information contained in Balochistan's revised feasibility study on the water source for its project is very similar to the information contained in Claimant's Feasibility Study. *Cf*. **Exhibits CE-251** and **CE-372**.\n\nThis is confirmed by Dr. Mubarakmand's statement during an interview that he gave on 15 December 2010: \"*Now when we work we will have the results of the exploration in front of us which will help us and we will be able to benefit from those results*.\" **Exhibit CE-108**, p. 6.\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 71(1).\n\n1332.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Claimant's witness Mr. Williams confirmed during the Hearing that it corresponds to \"*the nature of mining around the world, that \u2026 the information as it's gathered is regularly reported to the relevant Government authority and that information belongs to the Government as the mineral rights*.\"1500 However, in response to the suggestion that the Government may thus use the information \"*any way they like*,\" Mr. Williams stated that this was not customary practice but that the information provided to the Government would rather remain confidential between the parties and not be used by the Government.1501\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 531 lines 2-6.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 531 line 13 to p. 532 line 3.\n\n1333.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal does not need to make a separate finding as to whether the use of the data and information from Claimant's exploration work amounts to a further expropriatory measure under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.\n\n**c. Non-Compliance with the Legality Requirements for an Expropriatory Measure under Article 7(1) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1334.\n\nHaving determined that the Licensing Authority's denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application constituted a measure having an effect equivalent to an expropriation, the Tribunal must now analyze whether this measure complied with the requirements for a lawful expropriation as set out in Article 7(1) of the Treaty. Pursuant to this provision, the expropriatory measure must (i) serve a \"*public purpose related to the internal needs of* [Pakistan]\"; (ii) be carried out under due process of law; (iii) be non-discriminatory; and (iv) be accompanied by the payment of \"*prompt, adequate and effective*\" compensation.\n\n1335.\n\nWhile both Parties focused their submissions on the existence (or non-existence) of Claimant's investment and of an expropriatory measure, they are also in dispute as to whether the denial, if considered as an expropriatory measure, complied with the further requirements of Article 7(1) of the Treaty. However, given that Respondent does not allege that Claimant has received any amount of compensation from either Pakistan or Balochistan, it can be considered common ground that the expropriation was not accompanied by the payment of \"*prompt, adequate and effective*\" compensation.\n\n1336.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has found above that the denial was not based on justified grounds but rather motivated by the GOB's desire to implement its own project instead of collaborating with Claimant under the CHEJVA. Apart from the fact that this finding renders it questionable whether the expropriatory measure served a public purpose, the Tribunal in any event considers that the denial was discriminatory because it favored the GOB's local project over the project of a foreign company. While the Tribunal has further found that the procedure by means of which TCCP's Application and its subsequent appeal were denied amounts to a violation of Claimant's legitimate expectations, it does not need to make a finding as to whether this also amounts to a breach of the due process requirement. In any event, Respondent has not complied with (at least) two out of four Treaty requirements and therefore breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty.\n\n**E. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 3(3) OF THE TREATY?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1337.\n\nArticle 3(3) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n*\"Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory protection and security to investments and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments.\"1502*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 570.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Legal Standard of Non-Impairment Under Article 3(3) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1338.\n\nClaimant refers to the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic* for a definition of the legal standard of impairment. The *Saluka* tribunal stated that the term \"*impairment*\" includes \"*any negative impact or effect caused by measures taken by*\" the host State. In addition, the Saluka tribunal held that the term \"*enjoyment*\" means \"*the exercise of a right which includes the beneficial use, interest and purpose to which property may be put, and implies* [the] *right to profits and income therefrom*.\"1503\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 539; *Saluka v Czech Republic* Partial Award [CA-44], \u00b6 458.\n\n1339.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Article 3(3) does not require that the impairment be caused by \"*arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures*\" in order to constitute a Treaty breach and argues that it is therefore irrelevant in this context whether or not Pakistan's conduct is also unfair and inequitable, within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the Treaty, or arbitrary and discriminatory, within the meaning of Article 7(1)(b) of the Treaty.1504\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 540-541.\n\n1340.\n\nWith regard to Pakistan's argument that Article 3(3) has been violated only if Claimant can \"*prove*[] *that the measures allegedly constituting such impairment were in breach of Pakistani law,*\" Claimant claims that the qualifier \"*subject to its laws,*\" on which Respondent relies, does not apply to the non-impairment obligation. Claimant argues that the repetition of the word \"*shall*\" indicates that Article 3(3) imposes two distinct obligations on the Contracting States: (i) the full protection and security obligation, which is qualified by the condition that the host State's conduct be \"*subject to its laws*\"; and (ii) the non-impairment obligation, which is not subject to that condition.1505\n\nReply, \u00b6 481. Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 217.\n\n1341.\n\nIn any event, even if the qualifier \"*subject to its laws*\" applied to the non-impairment obligation, Claimant refers to the tribunal in *White Industries v. India*, which held that such a reference does \"*not mean that national laws* 'trump' *international laws, or that the content of national law affects the interpretation to be given to obligations freely given by the State*\" in an investment treaty.1506 Claimant submits that the standard by which this Tribunal will determine whether Article 3(3) has been breached is not to be found in the 2002 BM Rules or any other aspect of Pakistani law, but rather in the terms of the Treaty and general international law.1507\n\nReply, \u00b6 482. *White Industries Australia Limited v. Republic of India* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of 30 November 2011 (\"*White Industries v. India*\") [CA-160], \u00b6 11.2.6.\n\nReply, \u00b6 483. In relation to Pakistan's further arguments that (i) there was no \"*promise in the CHEJVA that requires* [TCCA's] *joint venture partner to support its Mining Lease Application*\"; (ii) TCCA had \"*at best a right to apply for, not receive a mining lease*\"; (iii) \"[t]*here was no interference with* [TCCA's] *purported right to apply*\"; and (iv) \"*TCCP's application was duly considered under the 2002 BM Rules*,\" Claimant submits that these arguments are based on the same assertions that Respondent raises as a defense against TCCA's other claims, which are rebutted in the context of these claims. Reply, \u00b6 485.\n\n**b. Respondent Breached Its Obligation Not to Impair Claimant's Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1342.\n\nClaimant submits that Pakistan has breached Article 3(3) of the Treaty because Pakistan and Balochistan have not only impaired but altogether prevented TCCA from managing, maintaining, using, enjoying and disposing of its investment in Reko Diq.1508\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 536. In this section, Claimant generally refers to these five specific rights as \"*use.*\"\n\n1343.\n\nClaimant argues that Article 3(3) protects TCCA's ability to use the rights and plans it possessed in relation to its investment in Reko Diq (including, *inter alia*, rights under the CHEJVA, the 2002 BM Rules, its Exploration Licenses, its Surface Rights Lease and the \"*comprehensive plan to mine Reko Diq*\") as an investor would use them in the normal course, *i.e.*, if not impaired by the host State's conduct.1509\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 537.\n\n1344.\n\nClaimant claims that Balochistan has impaired TCCA's use of those rights and plans by, for example, (i) taking various measures that prevented TCC from carrying out the plans for a mine at Reko Diq laid out in the Feasibility Study; (ii) trying to undermine the CHEJVA in the Supreme Court proceedings by attacking its validity; (iii) breaking the promises it made in the CHEJVA to support TCC's Mining Lease Application; (iv) unlawfully denying TCC a mining lease; (v) denying TCC's expatriate staff full and effective access to the Reko Diq site by delaying and denying administrative clearances, which had previously been granted \"*as a matter of course*\"; (vi) starting to use TCC's plans as the foundation for its own mining project; and (vii) \"*purposely hindering and eventually halting*\" the Mineral Agreement and Project Agreement negotiations.1510\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 538; \u00b6 Reply, \u00b6 477; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219. Claimant notes that the first denial of a security clearance occurred in December 2009, on the same day that the MMDD replaced the BDA as TCC's Joint Venture partner and three days after the GOB submitted the third and final version of the PC-1 for its own project. **Exhibits CE-94**, **CE-163** and **CE-242**.\n\n1345.\n\nClaimant submits that these acts qualify as an \"*impairment*\" within the meaning of Article 3(3) of the Treaty. According to Claimant, there can be little question that Balochistan's various measures negatively impacted TCCA and its beneficial use of its investment. Claimant further claims that, even if the impairment were required to be \"*arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory*,\" Respondent's conduct would satisfy this standard in the present case.1511\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 539, 541.\n\n1346.\n\nClaimant concludes that, if ever there was a case of the State impairing the \"*management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments*\" as set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty, it would be the wrongful conduct of Pakistan's organs and officials, which prevented TCCA from mining Reko Diq or making any other beneficial use of the work that TCC performed over a decade or enjoying any return on its investment of more than US$ 240 million.1512\n\nReply, \u00b6 484; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 217.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Legal Standard of Non-Impairment Under Article 3(3) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1347.\n\nRespondent submits that pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Treaty, any obligation \"*not to impair*\" is subject to Pakistani law.1513 According to Respondent, the ordinary meaning of Article 3(3) makes clear that the qualifier \"*subject to* [the host State's] *laws*\" applies to the non-impairment obligation set out therein; therefore, the application of those laws cannot result in a violation of the Treaty, even if they result in an impairment.1514\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 570-571.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 497; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190. In Respondent's view, Claimant's interpretation of Article 3(3) that the qualifier applies only to the full protection and security obligation in the same paragraph, would have been arguable if the provision had been worded as follows: \"*Each Party shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments and shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory protection and security to investments.*\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 497\n\n1348.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's reliance on the case of *White Industries v. India*, Respondent claims that this case concerned a most-favored nation clause, which was not qualified by a comparable phrase; therefore, it cannot provide any guidance as to the statutory interpretation of the non-impairment obligation in the present case.1515\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 500. *White Industries v. India* [CA-160], \u00b6 11.1.4.\n\n1349.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimant's reliance on the case of *Saluka v Czech Republic*, and the tribunal's definition of the term \"*impairment*\" in that case as \"*any negative impact or effect caused by measures taken by*\" the host State. Respondent notes that the non-impairment standard in that case was qualified by a requirement of \"*reasonableness*,\" as explained by the tribunal:\n\n*\"The standard of '* reasonableness *' has no different meaning in this context than in the context of the '* fair and equitable treatment' *standard with which it is associated; and the same is true with regard to the standard of '* non-discrimination *'. The standard of '* reasonableness *' therefore requires, in this context as well, a showing that the State's conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy, whereas the standard of '* non-discrimination *' requires a rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Insofar as the standard of conduct is concerned, a violation of the non-impairment requirement does not therefore differ substantially from a violation of the '* fair and equitable treatment *' standard. The non-impairment requirement merely identifies more specific effects of any such violation, namely with regard to the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investment by the investor*.\"1516\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 494-495. *Saluka v. Czech Republic* [**CA-44**], \u00b6\u00b6 460-461.\n\n1350.\n\nIn Respondent's view, this statement contradicts Claimant's assertion that, in the present case, Respondent's measures do not have to be \"*arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory*\" in order to give rise to a breach of Article 3(3).1517\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 496.\n\n**b. Respondent Did Not Breach Its Obligation Not to Impair Claimant's Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1351.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant has not established any breach of Pakistani law in relation to the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of its alleged investments.1518\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 571.\n\n1352.\n\nAs regards Claimant's plans to mine Reko Diq, Respondent argues that, besides failing to explain how those plans constitute an investment, Claimant cannot show how the alleged unspecified \"*various measures*\" have impaired its plans in breach of Pakistani law. According to Respondent, the Licensing Authority refused to grant the Mining Lease Application in accordance with its powers under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules and TCC's joint venture partner refused to participate in the mining venture in compliance with Article 11.3 of the CHEJVA.1519\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 575.\n\n1353.\n\nIn relation to Balochistan's conduct in the Supreme Court proceedings, Respondent claims that Balochistan had a duty to the Court to provide the entire record relating to the CHEJVA and took the position that the Court should decide the matter on the merits. According to Respondent, \"*Pakistani law permits a party to change or modify its position in court upon the receipt of additional information or documentation.*\"1520\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 576.\n\n1354.\n\nReferring to Claimant's allegation that Balochistan broke the \"*promises it made in the CHEJVA to support TCC's Mining Lease Application,*\" Respondent claims that there is no provision in the CHEJVA that requires the joint venture partner to do so. Respondent emphasizes that pursuant to the CHEJVA, the BDA was expressly allowed not to participate in the mining venture, in which event Claimant could make an application at its sole risk, subject to the satisfaction of the required Government regulations and the conditions precedent concerning the acquisition of the BDA's interest pursuant to Article 11.6.1521\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 577. **Exhibit CE-1**, clause 11.4.2. Respondent maintains that in light of Claimant's failure to fulfill this condition precedent, any right to apply for a mining lease did not arise. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190.\n\n1355.\n\nAs for the Licensing Authority's rejection of Claimant's Mining Lease Application, Respondent contends that the decision was made pursuant to the 2002 Mining Rules and does not constitute an impairment. Respondent contends that Claimant did not have a right to receive, but at best a right to apply for, a mining lease, and claims that this right was not interfered with, as TCCP's Application was duly considered under the 2002 BM Rules.1522 In Respondent's view, the rejection of the Mining Lease Application on \"*proper, or at least not unreasonable, grounds*\" cannot be considered an impairment of the right to apply for a mining lease.1523\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 578.\n\nRespondent's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190.\n\n1356.\n\nFinally, as to the denial of security clearances by the Governments for certain members of Claimant's staff, Respondent contends that Claimant has not established how this conduct constitutes an impairment of its investment..1524\n\nRespondent's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1357.\n\nThe Parties are in disagreement as to (a) the applicable standard of non-impairment under Article 3(3) of the Treaty, in particular whether the standard is qualified by the words \"*subject to its laws*\"; and (b) whether Respondent's conduct, *i.e.*, the denial of the Mining Lease Application but also further individual actions, amounts to a violation of the non-impairment obligation. The Tribunal will therefore first determine the standard applicable to Respondent's obligation to refrain from impairing Claimant's investment in its territory pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Treaty before assessing in a second step whether Respondent's conduct amounts to a violation of this obligation.\n\n**a. The Applicable Standard of Non-Impairment**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1358.\n\nWith regard to the applicable standard, the Parties agree that Respondent's non-impairment obligation is provided for in Article 3(3) of the Treaty, which may be quoted again at this point:\n\n*\"Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory protection and security to investments and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments.*\"1525\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 3(3).\n\n1359.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to (i) whether the qualifier \"*subject to its laws*\" applies only to the Contracting Parties' obligation to accord protection and security to investments (first part) or also to the obligation to refrain from impairing investments (second part); and (ii) whether an impairment amounts to a violation of the Treaty only if it is caused by \"*arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures.*\"\n\n1360.\n\nThe Tribunal will interpret Article 3(3) of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, *i.e*., \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context in the light of its object and purpose*.\"1526 The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the decision to place the qualifier \"*subject to its laws*\" after the word \"*shall*\" before the first part of the provision and to repeat the word \"*shall*\" before the second part of the provision indicates that the Contracting States intended to make a distinction between the two obligations contained in this provision -to the effect that only the first obligation is qualified by the term \"*subject to its laws*.\"\n\nVienna Convention [CA-141], Article 31(1).\n\n1361.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this interpretation is supported by the differing quality of the two obligations: While the obligation to accord protection and security to an investment requires the State to take proactive measures in order to protect the investment, the non-impairment obligation requires the State to refrain from taking measures against the investment. In the context of the obligation to accord protection and security, the Contracting Parties intended to clarify that the State can be expected to take proactive measures only within the framework of its own laws. However, if the qualifier were to be applied literally to the non-impairment obligation, the State would be obliged to refrain from taking measures \"*subject to its laws*,\" to the effect that it would not be prohibited to take measures outside the framework of its laws. It is apparent that this was not the intention of the Contracting Parties.\n\n1362.\n\nRespondent's interpretation, on the other hand, would allow the State to impair the investment as long as it would be entitled to do so under its own laws. This interpretation would be contrary to the fundamental principle that a State cannot rely on its domestic law to determine the scope of, and thus to escape its liability under, international law. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that it corresponds to both the ordinary meaning of the provision and the object and purpose of the Treaty that the non-impairment obligation is not qualified by the term \"*subject to its laws*.\"\n\n1363.\n\nWith regard to the second question whether the impairment must be caused by \"*arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures*,\" the Tribunal notes that, unlike other treaties (*e.g.*, Article 2(2) of the Australia-Hong Kong BIT1527 or Article 3(2) of the Australia-Chile BIT1528), Article 3(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not qualify the non-impairment obligation by reference to arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable measures, thus raising the question of whether it prohibits *any* measure that impairs the investment. However, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding on this question if it finds that the impairment of Claimant's investment was in any event arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory and thus fulfills even the stricter standard advanced by Respondent.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Australia-Hong Kong BIT provides in relevant part: \"[...] *Neither Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to its laws, in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments in its area of investors of the other Contracting Party.* [\u2026]\" (emphasis added)\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Australia-Chile BIT provides: \"*Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws, regulations and investment policies, protect within its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, sale and liquidation of such investments.*\" (emphasis added)\n\n**b. Did Respondent's Conduct Amount to a Violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1364.\n\nAs stated above, the same conduct that amounts to a violation of the FET obligation, in this case, the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application, can at the same time amount to a violation of the non-impairment obligation if such conduct has one or more of the effects set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty, *i.e.*, if it \"*impair*[s] *the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of* [Claimant's] *investment*.\"1529 In addition to the denial of the Application, Claimant invokes the following actions of Respondent as conduct that impaired the use of its investment: (i) Balochistan's attacks on the validity of the CHEJVA in the Supreme Court proceedings; (ii) Balochistan's violation of its promises under the CHEJVA to support TCCP's Mining Lease Application; (iii) Balochistan's denial of the administrative clearances, and thus access to Reko Diq, for TCC's expatriate staff; (iv) Balochistan's use of TCC's plans for its own project; and (v) the Governments' conduct in the negotiations on the Mineral Agreement and the Project Agreement by which they \"*purposely*\" hindered and halted the negotiations.\n\nFor the sake of easier reading, the Tribunal will refer to these various means in which an investment can be impaired as \"*use*\" of the investment.\n\n1365.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to assess whether each of these actions by itself would amount to a violation of Respondent's non-impairment obligation because, if considered together with the denial of the Mining Lease Application, Respondent's conduct clearly impaired, if not prevented altogether, the use of Claimant's investment. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Respondent prevented Claimant from making any use of its exploration work and of any possibility to amortize its expenditures \u2013 much less to realize the benefit of its investment. Given that both the Joint Venture in which Claimant had a 75% interest and Claimant's subsidiary TCCP were established for the sole purpose of carrying out the exploration and, ultimately, the mining operations at Reko Diq, Claimant's investment was rendered useless when the Mining Lease Application was denied.\n\n1366.\n\nThe Tribunal further refers to its findings above that (i) the denial was motivated by the GOB's desire to implement its own project rather than to continue its collaboration with TCCA; and that (ii) the Licensing Authority did not have any justified grounds for denying the Application. In light of these findings, the Tribunal considered it questionable whether the denial served a public purpose, but in any event found that it was \"*discriminatory*\" because Respondent thereby favored the GOB's local project over that of Claimant or the Joint Venture.\n\n1367.\n\nRespondent's further actions that Claimant invokes confirm this finding \u2013 except for the alleged violation of specific provisions under the CHEJVA, which is a question to be decided by the ICC Tribunal and on which this Tribunal will therefore not express an opinion. In the Tribunal's view, all of these actions contributed to the impairment effect on Claimant's investment and/or demonstrate that the GOB's true motive behind the denial was its desire to implement its own project.\n\n1368.\n\nFirst, Balochistan's change of position in the Supreme Court proceedings in early 2011 was aimed at obtaining a declaration from the Supreme Court that the CHEJVA and thus Claimant's right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease was null and void. While this conduct did not have an immediate effect on Claimant's investment, it contributed to the fact that the security of tenure conferred to Claimant by means of Clause 11.8.2 was called into question.\n\n1369.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal considers it (at least) curious that the GOB started to deny administrative clearances for TCC's expatriate staff on 12 December 2009, *i.e.*, three days after its own project had been approved by the ECNEC and on the very same day that the MMDD took over as the GOB's representative on the Operating Committee.1530 The denial of access for experienced staff impaired the use of Claimant's investment and the timing indicates that this conduct was motivated by the GOB's intention to \"*take over*\" Claimant's project as decided by the Balochistan Cabinet in its meeting a few days later.1531\n\n**Exhibit CE-94**. *Cf*. **Exhibits CE-163** and **CE-242**.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\n1370.\n\nThird, Balochistan's use of TCC's exploration data for its own project confirms that the purported insufficiencies of Claimant's Feasibility Study did not have any justified basis. While the use of the data in itself does not impair Claimant's investment, it demonstrates that Balochistan intended to develop its own project in the exact same area and thus in a manner that would not be compatible with the simultaneous implementation of Claimant's project.\n\n1371.\n\nFinally, as regards the negotiations on the Mineral and Project Agreements, the Tribunal considers that the decision of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 \"*not to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP*,\"1532 together with the Tribunal's impression from the record that no actual negotiations took place after this decision,1533 further support the Tribunal's finding that the decision against Claimant's project was related to Balochistan's plans to develop its own project.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\nAs to the meetings referred to by Respondent that TCC had with Balochistan's Chief Minister in January 2010, with Balochistan's Chief Secretary in March and June 2010, with Pakistan's Prime Minister in July 2010, with the MPNW in September 2010 and officials from both Governments in July 2011, it appears from the record that these were high-level meetings, which did not include any actual negotiations on the terms of the Mineral and/or Project Agreement. *Cf*. **Exhibits CE-84**, **CE-85**, **CE-90**, **RE-79** and **RE-80**.\n\n1372.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that, as confirmed by the above mentioned actions, the denial of the Mining Lease Application impaired the use of Claimant's investment. The Tribunal is further convinced that Respondent's measures were motivated by the desire to implement its own project \u2013 without having a justified ground for denying the Mining Lease Application. Therefore, the measures were also \"*arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory*\" and thus fulfill even the stricter standard of protection that has been advanced by Respondent. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding as to the exact scope of the non-impairment obligation, since the denial of the Mining Lease Application in any event amounts to a violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n**F. CONCLUSION ON CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1373.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent breached its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n1374.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument that Claimant's claim must fail *in limine* because it has failed to address causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that Respondent's conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings. In the Tribunal's view, any specific questions on whether Respondent's conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant's \u2013 yet unquantified \u2013 claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed as part of the *quantum* phase of the proceedings.\n\n**VII. RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIMS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1375.\n\nRespondent claims that (i) Claimant's alleged \"*investment*\" was not made \"*in accordance with* [Pakistan's] *laws and investment policies*\" as set out in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty; (ii) Claimant breached Clauses 11, 15 and 24.6 of the CHEJVA because it did not even attempt to comply with the contractual pre-conditions set out in the CHEJVA before filing its Mining Lease Application, and because it prepared a \"*secret*\" Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study; and (iii) Claimant violated rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules because it failed to complete \"*a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits*\" in the area covered by Exploration License EL-5, despite the fact that it had undertaken to do so in its application for a second renewal of EL-5.1534\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 624.\n\n1376.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that it raises its counterclaims without prejudice to its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility and its arguments on attribution;1535 therefore, it pursues its counterclaims only \"*if and to the extent that the Tribunal finds that Claimant made a qualifying* 'investment' *and upholds the relevant premises of jurisdiction for the purposes of the BIT.\"*1536\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 623; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 531.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 623.\n\n**A. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1377.\n\nRespondent submits that pursuant to the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, counterclaims are admissible. Respondent refers to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, which states:\n\n\"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any... counter-claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"1537\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6626.\n\n1378.\n\nRespondent further quotes Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n\"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"\n\n1379.\n\nRespondent notes that it timely filed its counterclaims under Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides that a counterclaim is timely if presented \"*no later than in the Counter-Memorial*.\"1538\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 629.\n\n1380.\n\nRespondent submits that its counterclaims further meet all other jurisdictional requirements under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as they (a) arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute; (b) are within the scope of the consent of the parties; and (c) are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.1539\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 630.\n\n**a. Respondent's Counterclaims Arise Directly out of the Subject-Matter of the Dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1381.\n\nIn the context of the first requirement, Respondent refers to Note B (a) to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n\"*The test to satisfy* [whether a counter-claim arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute] *is whether the factual connection between the original and ancillary claim is so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, the object being to dispose of all grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject-matter*.\"1540\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 631.\n\n1382.\n\nRespondent claims that there is a close factual connection between Claimant's claims and Respondent's counterclaims, which requires that they are adjudicated in the same proceedings, because the counterclaims are \"*the flip side*\" of Pakistan's defenses against Claimant's claims, and arise primarily from the same provisions of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules; therefore, a final settlement of the dispute between Claimant and Respondent requires that Respondent's counterclaims be considered as well.1541\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 632.\n\n1383.\n\nIn relation to Claimant's argument that the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty can only result in a rejection of its claim for lack of jurisdiction, but not give rise to a counterclaim for a violation of the Treaty, Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(a) imposes an obligation on the investor, which Claimant has failed to fulfil, and therefore it can give rise to a counterclaim by Respondent.1542\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 554.\n\n1384.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's argument that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide Respondent's counterclaims to the extent they are based on alleged breaches of the CHEJVA because of the exclusive arbitration clause contained therein, Respondent argues that the only question to be considered by this Tribunal is whether the counterclaims have a sufficient nexus with Claimant's claim under the Treaty and thus satisfy the requirements of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.1543\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 557.\n\n1385.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to Claimant's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Respondent's counterclaims that are based on to the 2002 BM Rules and notes that the tribunal in the case of *Paushok v. Mongolia*, which Claimant relies on, had to consider Article 19 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which specifically limit counterclaims to issues \"*arising out of the same contract.*\"1544 In addition, Respondent claims that the present case can be distinguished from *Paushok v. Mongolia* because, unlike the relevant treaty in that case, Article 13 of the Treaty makes provision for counterclaims as well as for claims under both domestic law and the Treaty. As a result, Respondent claims that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims based on the 2002 BM Rules and the laws or investment policies of Pakistan.1545\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 558.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 559.\n\n**b. Respondent's Counterclaims Are Within the Scope of Consent of the Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1386.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal in *Roussalis v. Romania*, which held that the question whether a claimant's consent to arbitrate extended to counterclaims \"*must be determined in the first place by reference to the dispute resolution clause in the BIT.*\"1546\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 535. *Roussalis v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Award of 7 December 2011 (\"*Roussalis v. Romania*\") [RLA-110], \u00b6 866.\n\n1387.\n\nRespondent submits that, contrary to other treaties such as the Greece-Romania BIT, which limit the class of claimants to investors only,1547 Article 13(2) of the Treaty provides that \"*either party*\" may submit \"*the dispute*\" to ICSID arbitration. In addition, Respondent notes that Article 13(5) refers to \"*counter-claim*[s]\" being asserted by a Contracting Party to the Treaty against an investor and argues that the Treaty thus clearly anticipates that a State may advance claims or counterclaims against an investor.1548 Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that this reference to counterclaims in Article 13(5) is limited to domestic proceedings as being contrary to the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"*any proceeding*.\"1549\n\nRespondent notes that the dispute resolution clause in *Roussalis v. Romania* (Article 9 of the Greece-Romania BIT) states: \"*Disputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party **concerning an obligation of the latter** under this Agreement, in relation to investment of former, shall, if possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an amicable way\u2026*  \n*If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, **the investor concerned may submit the dispute** either to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made or **to international arbitration**.*\" Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 539. *Roussalis v. Romania* [RLA-110], \u00b6 869 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 634; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 536-537, 541.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 538.\n\n1388.\n\nAs a result, Respondent claims that, by initiating these proceedings pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty, Claimant also consented to counterclaims being raised by Respondent.1550\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 634.\n\n1389.\n\nRespondent further claims that, by resorting to ICSID arbitration, Claimant consented to be bound by Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.1551 According to Respondent, Article 46, if interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, clearly envisages that, subject to certain conditions, a State respondent may bring counterclaims. According to Respondent, this is confirmed by Article 36(1) of the ICSID Convention, which refers to institution of arbitration proceedings either by a national of a Contracting State or by a Contracting State itself.1552 Respondent refers to *Kendra* in relation to the *travaux preparatoires* of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"*It was therefore the expressed intention of the authors of the Convention that ICSID arbitration should not be a one-way street and that claims and therefore counterclaims could be brought by host states.*\"1553\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 532, 542.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 544-545.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 546.

It is important to bear in mind that such counterclaim jurisdiction is not only a concession to the State Party: Article 46 works to the benefit of both respondent state and investor.*\"1554\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 635; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 548. *Roussalis v. Romania* [RLA-110].\n\n1391.\n\nIn addition, Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Goetz v. Burundi*, which held that, by accepting Burundi's offer in the treaty to go to ICSID arbitration, the claimants had provided a \"*twofold consent,*\" which included their consent that counterclaims would be considered by the tribunal, provided that the conditions laid down by Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules were met.1555\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 549. *Antoine Goetz and others v Republic of Burundi*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/2, Award of 21 June 2012 (\"*Goetz v. Burundi*\") [RLA-193], \u00b6 278.\n\n**c. Respondent's Counterclaims Are Otherwise Within the Jurisdiction of the Centre**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1392.\n\nRespondent submits that its counterclaims also meet the five jurisdictional requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention: (1) there is a \"*legal dispute*\" between the Parties; (2) the dispute relates to an \"*investment*\"; (3) it \"*arises directly*\" out of that investment; (4) it is between a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and a national of another Contracting State; and (5) the Parties consented in writing to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.1556\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 639.\n\n1393.\n\nRespondent submits that there is a \"*legal dispute*\" between the Parties because Respondent's counterclaims arise out of Claimant's breach of the Treaty, in particular its failure to comply with the requirement that the investment be \"*admitted by* [Respondent] *subject to its laws*,\" its breach of the CHEJVA as the underlying investment agreement in this case, and its breach of the 2002 BM Rules.1557\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 640.\n\n1394.\n\nRespondent claims that, in case the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, the dispute also \"*arises directly*\" out of Claimant's \"*investment*,\" as the counterclaims relate to and arise out of the same contractual instruments (the CHEJVA and related agreements), and the same regulatory instrument (the 2002 BM Rules), which Claimant relies on as constituting its investment.1558\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 641, 642.\n\n1395.\n\nRespondent further notes that it is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and that Claimant is a national of another Contracting State to the ICSID Convention (namely, Australia).1559\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 643.\n\n1396.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that both Parties have consented in writing to submit this dispute to the jurisdiction of this ICSID Tribunal: Respondent provided its written consent in Article 13 of the Treaty; and Claimant provided its written consent in paragraph 16 of its Request for Arbitration.1560\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 644.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1397.\n\nClaimant refers to the requirements under Article 46 of the Convention and submits that the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic* held that a counterclaim is not admissible unless its subject matter is \"*intimately connected with the subject-matter of the primary claim*.\"1561 Claimant claims that the claims and counterclaims must be \"*indivisible*\" and \"*interdependent*.\"1562\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 488-489. *Saluka v. Czech Republic* Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic's Counterclaim of 7 May 2004 (\"*Saluka v Czech Republic Decision over Counterclaim*\") [CA-161], \u00b6 66.\n\nReply, \u00b6 489.\n\n**a. There Is No Basis on Which the Tribunal Could Hear the Sole Counterclaim Alleging a Treaty Breach**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1398.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's first counterclaim alleging that TCCA violated Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, Claimant submits that none of the provisions of the Treaty impose an obligation on the investor. According to Claimant, Article 1(1)(a) is only a definition, which establishes a jurisdictional requirement that an investor must satisfy in order to be protected by the Treaty; it does not impose a substantive obligation on the investor and therefore cannot give rise to a claim by the State for a violation of the Treaty.1563\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 490-492; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 63.\n\n1399.\n\nClaimant relies on the tribunal in *Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania*, which found that where a treaty \"*imposes no obligations on investors, only on contracting States... counterclaims fall outside the tribunal's jurisdiction*,\" unless the treaty specifies otherwise.1564 Claimant argues that, contrary to Respondent's allegations, Article 13(5) of the Treaty does not provide authority for the host State to bring counterclaims against the investor for breach of the Treaty. Article 13(5) states:\n\n*\"In any proceeding involving a dispute relating to an investment, a Party shall not assert, as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has received or will receive pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of any alleged loss.\"1565*\n\nReply, \u00b6 493. *Roussalis v. Romania* [CA-162], \u00b6 871.\n\nReply, \u00b6 493. **Exhibit CE-4**. Article 13(5).\n\n1400.\n\nClaimant argues that the term \"*any proceeding*\" refers not only to ICSID proceedings (initiated pursuant to Article 13(2)(b)), but also to domestic judicial or administrative proceedings (initiated under Article 13(2)(a)).1566 In addition, Claimant emphasizes that Article 13(5) does not authorize the filing of counterclaims based on the Treaty, but rather denies the right to assert defenses or counterclaims based on the investor's recovery from third parties.1567 In Claimant's view, Article 13(5) therefore only refers to counterclaims that may be filed in domestic proceedings, but it does not constitute the Contracting States' consent to arbitration of counterclaims against an investor in ICSID proceedings.1568\n\nClaimant emphasizes that it does not deny that Respondent could have initiated ICSID proceeding pursuant to Article 13(2)(b) in order to obtain an arbitral decision on TCCA's claims, but according to Claimant, Respondent attempts to obtain a decision on matters unrelated to the Treaty. Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 65.\n\nReply, \u00b6 494; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 65.\n\nReply, \u00b6 494.\n\n**b. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction over Pakistan's Non-Treaty Counterclaims**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1401.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's second counterclaim alleging that TCCA breached the CHEJVA, Claimant notes that it is undisputed that the Government of Pakistan is not a party to the CHEJVA; therefore, Respondent has no standing to bring a claim under the CHEJVA.1569 Claimant emphasizes that, while Balochistan's acts are attributable to Respondent under international law, Balochistan remains a separate entity under Pakistani law, which is juridically distinct from Respondent and has the authority to enter into and enforce its own contracts.1570\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 496-497; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\n1402.\n\nClaimant further submits that even if Respondent did have standing to assert contractual claims against TCCA, this Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to hear them, given that Treaty does not contain an umbrella clause (the only possible source of jurisdiction over contractual disputes) and there is no satisfactory nexus with TCCA's Treaty-based claims.1571\n\nReply, \u00b6 498.\n\n1403.\n\nClaimant also refers to the exclusive arbitration provision contained in the CHEJVA, pursuant to which all disputes concerning the CHEJVA must be submitted to ICC arbitration, and emphasizes that Balochistan has brought identical counterclaims (as regards the alleged breaches of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules) in the pending ICC Proceedings, which is the proper forum for these claims.1572 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, which held that \"[t]*he Tribunal thus cannot in this arbitration entertain a counterclaim based on a dispute arising out of or in connection with, or the alleged breach of, an agreement which... contains its own mandatory arbitration provision*\" and which is already the subject of separate proceedings.1573\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 499, 502. **Exhibit CE-381**, \u00b6\u00b6 458-463 and \u00b6\u00b6 464-472.\n\nReply, \u00b6 499. *Saluka v Czech Republic Decision over Counterclaim* [CA-161], \u00b6\u00b6 52-58.\n\n1404.\n\nAs to Respondent's third counterclaim alleging that TCCA breached the 2002 BM Rules, Claimant similarly argues that the Treaty does not provide any basis for jurisdiction over claims which are based on an alleged breach of Pakistani law, and that there is no satisfactory nexus to TCCA's Treaty claims.1574 Claimant refers to the UNCITRAL tribunal in *Paushok v. Mongolia*, which held that \"*an arbitral tribunal exclusively vested with jurisdiction under the BIT*\" does not have jurisdiction over counterclaims that \"*exclusively raise issues of non-compliance with* [Respondent's] *public law*,\" because such claims \"*cannot be considered as constituting an indivisible part of the Claimants' claims based on the BIT and international law or as creating a reasonable nexus between the Claimants' claims and the Counterclaims*.\"1575\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 500, 501.\n\nReply, \u00b6 501. *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company, and CJSC Vostoknetegaz Company v.Mongolia* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability of 28 April 2011 (\"*Paushok v. Mongolia*\") [CA-164], \u00b6 694.\n\n1405.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Pakistan acknowledges that its primary counterclaims do not arise under the Treaty, but only as a matter of contract (the CHEJVA) or under Pakistani law (the 2002 BM Rules), and merely asserts that the Tribunal's jurisdiction over them follows from its jurisdiction over Claimant's claims (in the alternative, that its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility should fail). Claimant submits that Respondent's argument is based on the \"*fallacy*\" that TCCA asserts non-Treaty claims over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction. Claimant emphasizes that, to the contrary, TCCA's claims arise under the Treaty, which is why Pakistan's argument that it should likewise be entitled to assert non-Treaty claims must fail.1576\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 64.\n\n1406.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's reliance on Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, Claimant claims that this provision is irrelevant in the present case because it is only of a procedural nature and cannot provide the source of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as the dispute must be \"*within the scope of the consent of the Parties and... otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"1577 Claimant argues that neither of those two requirements is met with regard to Respondent's contract claims; in particular, the scope of consent as defined by the Treaty does not extend to non-Treaty claims, which are, as Respondent itself argues, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal.1578\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 66.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 67, referring to Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 356-357.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1407.\n\nRespondent raises its counterclaims in the alternative, *i.e*., in the event that the Tribunal finds that Claimant made an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and dismisses Respondent's further objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. As set out above, the Tribunal affirmed its jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and found them to be admissible. Therefore, the Tribunal is called to make a decision on Respondent's counterclaims and must first determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear them.\n\n1408.\n\nIn its analysis, the Tribunal will have to take into account that Respondent invokes three bases of a different legal quality for its counterclaims: (i) Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty; (ii) Clauses 11, 15 and 24 of the CHEJVA, *i.e.*, provisions of the investment agreement concluded between Claimant and the GOB, representing the Province of Balochistan; and (iii) rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, *i.e.*, a provision of the provincial regulatory framework enacted by Balochistan. The Tribunal will therefore assess whether it has jurisdiction to hear any or all of Respondent's counterclaims on these legal bases.\n\n1409.\n\nEven though Claimant emphasizes that Article 46 of the ICSID Convention cannot in itself be the source of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Parties agree that the relevant jurisdictional requirements for raising counterclaims in ICSID proceedings can be derived from this provision as well as from Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n1410.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention reads:\n\n\"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.*\"\n\n1411.\n\nRule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads:\n\n\"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"\n\n1412.\n\nBoth provisions provide for the same three requirements: (a) the counterclaims must arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute; (b) they must be within the scope of consent of the Parties; and (c) they must otherwise be within the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Tribunal will address these requirements in turn.\n\n**a. Do the Counterclaims Arise Directly Out of the Subject Matter of the Dispute?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1413.\n\nAs to the first requirement that the counterclaims must arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute, Respondent refers to Note B (a) to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules pursuant to which it has to be determined \"*whether the factual connection between the original and ancillary claim is so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute*.\"1579 Claimant relies on the interpretation given by the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, which held that the subject matter of the counterclaim must be \"*intimately connected with the subject-matter of the primary claim*.\"1580 In the Tribunal's view, these interpretations are not very far apart from one another but the dispute between the Parties rather focuses on whether there is a sufficient nexus between Claimant's Treaty claims and Respondent's counterclaims, insofar as the latter are based on breaches of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, as to constitute the required \"*close*\" or \"*intimate*\" connection.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 631.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 488-489. *Saluka v. Czech Republic Decision over Counterclaim* [CA-161], \u00b6 66.\n\n1414.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, irrespective of the question whether Article 13 of the Treaty extends to non-Treaty claims in the present case (to be answered as part of the analysis of the second requirement of consent), there is no general rule pursuant to which there cannot be a sufficient nexus within the meaning of Article 46(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules between an investor's treaty claims and a host State's non-treaty counterclaims. To the contrary, the Tribunal considers that there indeed can be such a close or intimate connection if the analysis of the investor's Treaty claims necessarily includes the examination of the contractual and regulatory instruments on which the counterclaims are based.\n\n1415.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal had to take into account in its analysis of Claimant's Treaty claims not only the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules in general, but very specifically several of the provisions on which Respondent relies as a basis for its counterclaims, in particular Clauses 11.3 and 11.4 of the CHEJVA and rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules. In addition, Respondent submits and Claimant in fact acknowledges that Respondent's counterclaims are the \"*flipside*\" of its defenses against Claimant's claims; therefore, the Tribunal considers that all three of Respondent's counterclaims arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute and therefore satisfy the first jurisdictional requirement.\n\n**b. Are the Counterclaims Within the Scope of Consent of the Parties?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1416.\n\nAs to the second requirement of whether Respondent's counterclaims are within the scope of consent of the Parties to arbitrate, the Parties agree that the question of whether their consent extends to counterclaims in general and to non-Treaty claims in particular is determined by reference to the Treaty's dispute resolution clause in Article 13. The Tribunal will interpret Article 13 of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose*.\"1581\n\nVienna Convention [CA-141], Article 31(1).\n\n1417.\n\nArticle 13(1) of the Treaty refers to \"*dispute*[s] *between a Party and an investor of the other Party relating to an investment*.\" Article 13(2)(b) states that \"*either party to the dispute may \u2026 refer the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*.\" Finally, Article 13(5) provides that \"[i]*n any proceeding involving a dispute relating to an investment, a Party shall not assert, as a defence, counter-claim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has received or will receive*\" any form of compensation for its alleged loss from third parties.1582\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 13.\n\n1418.\n\nThe language used in Article 13(1) and (2) of the Treaty makes clear that both sides, *i.e.*, the investor and the host State, may initiate ICSID proceedings with regard to disputes relating to an investment. In the Tribunal's view, there is no indication for Claimant's allegation that the host State may do so only in order to obtain a decision on claims of the investor. To the contrary, while the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 13(5) does not explicitly authorize a State to raise counterclaims, the provision is nevertheless premised on the assumption that the State may in fact do so and the Tribunal is not convinced by Claimant's argument that counterclaims are mentioned only because the term \"*any proceeding*\" also refers to domestic proceedings initiated pursuant to Article 13(2)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n1419.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, not only the language used in Article 13 itself, but also the expressed intention of the authors of the ICSID Convention not to provide for a \"*one-way street*\" for investors,1583 together with the absence of any indication that the Contracting Parties intended to provide otherwise in their dispute resolution clause, support and confirm an interpretation of Article 13 that allows the host State to raise counterclaims against the claims of the investor.\n\n*Cf*. *Kendra* [RLA-189], p. 577.\n\n1420.\n\nAs to the further question whether the scope of consent extends to counterclaims that are not based on violations of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that the language used in Article 13(1) of the Treaty, *i.e*., \"*dispute \u2026 relating to an investment,*\" indicates that the scope of consent is not limited to disputes based on Treaty violations but rather extends to disputes based on the investment agreement (in this case, the CHEJVA and related agreements) and/or the regulatory framework for the investment (in this case, in particular the 2002 BM Rules). Therefore, the fact that Respondent's counterclaims, insofar as they are based on a breach of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, are not Treaty claims, does not exclude them from the scope of Article 13.\n\n1421.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that in the present case, Respondent did not become party to the CHEJVA and its related agreements and Respondent further did not enact the 2002 BM Rules, but in both cases, its autonomous province Balochistan did so. While Balochistan's actions can be attributed to Respondent pursuant to the ILC Articles for the purposes of Treaty claims, *i.e.*, claims under international law, such attribution does not apply for non-Treaty claims under domestic law. In the context of Respondent's claims based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal must therefore give effect to the juridical distinction between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Province of Balochistan under Pakistani law.\n\n1422.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal considers that Respondent lacks standing to raise non-Treaty claims based on the alleged breach of a contract that Claimant entered into with, and that can be enforced by, Balochistan. The same applies to Respondent's claim based on domestic law that was enacted, and can again be enforced, by Balochistan. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that Balochistan has in fact raised very similar counterclaims, based on an alleged breach of Clauses 11, 15 and 24 of the CHEJVA as well as rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, in the parallel ICC Proceedings that Claimant has initiated against Balochistan on the basis of the dispute resolution clause in Clause 15.4 of the CHEJVA.1584 It is thus apparent that Balochistan not only has the means to enforce such claims against Claimant, but it is in fact doing so before the ICC Tribunal*.*\n\n*Cf*. Exhibit CE-381, \u00b6\u00b6 458-463 and \u00b6\u00b6 464-472.\n\n1423.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that Respondent lacks standing to raise counterclaims on the basis of alleged breaches of the CHEJVA and/or the 2002 BM Rules because these claims are for Balochistan to raise, as it has in fact done in the parallel ICC Proceedings. As a result, the Tribunal finds that it does not have jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims insofar as they are based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n1424.\n\nAs to Respondent's counterclaim based on Claimant's alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds that this claim is within the scope of consent as provided for in Article 13 of the Treaty. While Article 13 (directly) defines only the scope of Respondent's consent, which is contained in this very provision, the Tribunal is of the view that it is also (indirectly) relevant to the scope of Claimant's consent as provided in its Request for Arbitration. In this submission, Claimant stated:\n\n\"*TCCA hereby consents to submit to the Centre the dispute that is the subject of this Request for Arbitration.*\"1585\n\nRfA, \u00b6 16.\n\n1425.\n\nWhile this statement in isolation could be read as limiting Claimant's consent to its own claims because Respondent's counterclaims were not \"*subject of* [its] *Request for Arbitration*,\" Claimant also referred in its Request for Arbitration to Article 13 of the Treaty as constituting Respondent's consent and did not indicate that the scope of its own consent differed from that under Article 13 of the Treaty. In addition, the Tribunal is of the view that, if the dispute resolution clause in a treaty allows for counterclaims, it is not for the investor to decide that such counterclaims shall not be part of its arbitration with the host State. This would contradict the intention of both the authors of the ICSID Convention and the Contracting Parties to the Treaty that the arbitration initiated by the investor should not be a \"*one-way street*.\"\n\n1426.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the second jurisdictional requirement is satisfied for Respondent's counterclaim based on Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, but the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the counterclaims based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules. Therefore, the Tribunal will limit its analysis of the third jurisdictional requirement to Respondent's counterclaim based on the Treaty.\n\n**c. Are the Counterclaims Otherwise Within the Jurisdiction of the Centre?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1427.\n\nAs to the third jurisdiction requirement that the counterclaims are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Tribunal considers that this is a reference to the general jurisdiction requirements under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which partially overlap with those explicitly mentioned in Article 46.\n\n1428.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads:\n\n\"*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State \u2026 and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*\"\n\n1429.\n\nFirst, Respondent's counterclaim arises out of Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and therefore constitutes a legal dispute between the Parties.\n\n1430.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal has found above that Claimant had a qualifying investment within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and that Respondent's counterclaim arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute on Claimant's claim. Therefore, the counterclaim can also be considered as arising directly out of Claimant's investment.\n\n1431.\n\nThird, Pakistan is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention because Pakistan has ratified the ICSID Convention on 15 September 1966 and the Convention entered into force for Pakistan on 15 October 1966. Claimant is a national of another Contracting State to the ICSID Convention because it is a company incorporated under Australian law and Australia has ratified the ICSID Convention on 2 May 1991, and the Convention came into force for Australia on 1 June 1991.\n\n1432.\n\nFinally, as found above, Respondent's consent to submit the dispute on its counterclaim to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is contained in Article 13 of the Treaty and Claimant's written consent that it provided in paragraph 16 of its Request for Arbitration likewise extends to an arbitration on Respondent's counterclaim.\n\n1433.\n\nAs a result, the general jurisdictional requirements under Article 25(1) and thus all three of the specific requirements under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules are fulfilled for Respondent's counterclaim based on Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear this counterclaim, but it does not have jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules.\n\n1434.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Claimant also argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaim based on the Treaty because, in Claimant's view, Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty does not impose an obligation on the investor and therefore cannot give rise to any claim of the host State. However, the Tribunal considers that this is a question for the merits and will thus be addressed as part of its analysis of the merits.\n\n**B. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent's Position**1586\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's finding that it has jurisdiction to hear only one of Respondent's counterclaims, the following summaries of the Parties' positions do not include their arguments on the other two counterclaims.\n\n1435.\n\nOn the merits, Respondent submits that Claimant's alleged investment was admitted in violation of Pakistani law and investment policies and thus unlawful under Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.1587\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 646-647; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 560.\n\n1436.\n\nRespondent refers to the definition of the term \"*investment*\" in Article 1(a) of the Treaty, which requires that the asset must be \"*admitted by the other Party subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time*\" and also to the Preamble to the Treaty, which \"[a]*cknowledg* [es] *that investments of investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party would be made within the framework of the laws of that other Party*.\"1588 Respondent claims that Claimant's alleged investment is unlawful and therefore does not meet the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.1589\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 647. **Exhibit CE-4**. Article 1(1)(a) and Preamble.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 647; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 562.\n\n1437.\n\nRespondent states that the illegality of Claimant's alleged investment has been determined conclusively by the Supreme Court and claims that it was also known to BHP by 2000, when it received advice from its Pakistani lawyers on the contemplated 2000 Addendum that was only to BHP's benefit.1590 According to Respondent, Claimant built on the illegality of BHP's initial investment when it executed the 2006 Novation Agreement, which relied on the existence of the CHEJVA and the 2000 Addendum for its operation and was therefore predicated on the same unlawfulness.1591\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 648. **Exhibits RE-56** and **RE-57**.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 648-649.\n\n1438.\n\nRespondent contends that, for the purpose of this arbitration, the unlawfulness of Claimant's investment as determined by the Supreme Court is a matter of fact under Pakistani law, which cannot be adjudicated afresh by this Tribunal.1592\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 650.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1439.\n\nClaimant submits that, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims, those claims would fail on the merits. Claimant quotes Respondent's submission that its counterclaims \"*represent the flipside of* [its] *defences to* [TCCA's] *claims in this arbitration*\" and therefore merely refers to its arguments on Respondent's liability in relation to Claimant's Treaty claims.1593\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 503, 504.\n\n1440.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that it contests all of Respondent's counterclaims, but submits that all of them are addressed in the context of Claimant's claims, as each of the counterclaims \"*mirrors one of Pakistan's affirmative defenses*.\" Claimant argues that if it succeeds in defeating those defenses, it will also succeed in defeating Pakistan's counterclaims.1594\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1441.\n\nRespondent's counterclaim is based on an alleged violation of Pakistani laws and investment policies and thus a lack of fulfilling the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. In the Tribunal's view, this raises two separate questions: (a) whether Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty can, in principle, give rise to a claim of the host State against the investor if the admission requirement was not satisfied; and if so, (ii) whether Claimant's investment was in fact admitted in violation of Pakistani laws and investment policies.\n\n1442.\n\nAs to the second question, the Tribunal refers to its finding above that the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) does not impose a strict legality requirement on the investment but is rather met if the investment was accepted by the host State at the time the investment was made. The Tribunal further found that, at the time Claimant entered into the 2006 Novation Agreement with the GOB and thereby became party to the CHEJVA, its investment was not only accepted but highly welcomed and encouraged on every level of the Provincial and Federal Governments and therefore satisfied the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a).\n\n1443.\n\nIn particular with regard to the Supreme Court judgment that was rendered seven years after the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement, the Tribunal held that the reasons for which the Supreme Court declared the CHEJVA and its related agreements invalid did not concern any illegal conduct on the part of Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that this judgment does not support Respondent's allegation that any violation of Pakistani laws and investment policies was predicated on Claimant's conduct.\n\n1444.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty cannot give rise to an obligation and a corresponding liability of the investor *vis-\u00e0-vis* the host State. Article 1 is entitled \"*Definitions*\" and states in relevant part:\n\n\"1. *For the purposes of this Agreement:*\n\n*(a)* 'investment' *means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Party and admitted by the other Party subject to its laws and investment policies applicable from time to time.*\"1595\n\n**Exhibit CE-4**, Article 1(1)(a).\n\n1445.\n\nAs per its lead-in, Article 1(1)(a) defines the term \"*investment*\" for the purposes of the Treaty, but such definition in itself does not give rise to an obligation of either the Contracting Parties or the investor. An investment that violates the host State's laws and investment policies and thus does not fulfill the admission requirement is not an \"*investment*\" for the purposes of the Treaty and is thus not subject to the standards of protection under the Treaty. Therefore, the non-fulfillment can be invoked by the host State as a defense against claims of the investor based on a violation of any standard of protection; however, it cannot give rise to a liability of the investor for a loss of opportunity as Respondent claims. In any event, an agreement between the Contracting Parties on a liability of the investor would constitute an impermissible agreement at the expense of a third party to the Treaty, *i.e.*, the investor in the present case.\n\n1446.\n\nAs a result, Respondent's counterclaim based on Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is dismissed because this provision cannot give rise to a liability of the investor and, in any event, Claimant's investment was admitted in accordance with Pakistani laws and investment policies at the time the investment was made in 2006.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1447.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, further to the Tribunal's invitation of 4 February 2015, both Parties submitted their statements of costs on 2 March 2015, reflecting the costs, fees and expenses they incurred up to that date. However, the Tribunal also recalls that it clarified in its e-mail of 16 February 2015 that its request for the Parties' statements of costs was without prejudice to whether the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability would include a decision on the costs of this phase of the proceedings or whether such decision would be reserved for the Final Award.\n\n1448.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision on the costs of the arbitration, *i.e.*, the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, shall form part of the Award. In light of the Tribunal's finding that Respondent has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty and is therefore liable for the losses that Claimant incurred as a result of these breaches, there will be a further phase of the proceedings in which Claimant's losses are to be quantified. The present decision is therefore not an award within the meaning of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and the Tribunal has thus decided to reserve its decision on the costs of this phase of the arbitration for its Award.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n1449.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides as follows:\n\n**I. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted to it by Claimant.**\n\n**II. Claimant's claims are admissible.**\n\n**III. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Respondent has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty.**\n\n**IV. Claimant is entitled to be compensated for all damages and losses resulting from Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding.**\n\n**V. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaim based on the alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear Respondent's further counterclaims.**\n\n**VI. Respondent's counterclaim based on the alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is dismissed.**\n\n**VII. The Tribunal's decision on the costs of this phase of the proceeding is reserved for the Award.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-07-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Table of Selected Abbreviations and Defined Terms** | |\n| 2000 Addendum | 2000 Addendum to the CHEJVA dated 4 March 2000 |\n| 2002 BM Rules | Mineral Rules enacted by Balochistan in 2002 to implement the National Mineral Policy, dated September 1995 |\n| 2006 Novation Agreement | Agreement pursuant to which Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA (replacing BHP) dated 1 April 2006 |\n| 2012 Provisional Measures Request | Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures dated 23 July 2012 |\n| 2018 Provisional Measures Request | Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures dated 15 February 2018 |\n| Anderson | Expert Report of Dr. Corby G.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a legal dispute between TCCA and Pakistan arising out of TCCA's investments in Pakistan submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the *Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investments*, which was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force on 14 October 1998 (the \"**Australia-Pakistan BIT**\", the \"**Treaty**\" or the \"**BIT**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n**Exhibit C-4**.\n\n2.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 10 November 2017 (the \"**Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability**\"), the Tribunal found that, for the reasons set out therein: (i) it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and that the claims are admissible;2 and (ii) by its denial of a mining lease to Claimant's wholly-owned subsidiary, Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (Private) Limited (\"**TCCP**\"), in order to allow the Government of Balochistan (\"**GOB**\") to implement its own project instead, Respondent has breached its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.3\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 688.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1373.\n\n3.\n\nThis Award addresses the question whether as a result of Respondent's breaches, Claimant has suffered damage for which it must be compensated by Respondent and, if so, determines the amount of such compensation.\n\n4.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability as well as the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons) also dated 10 November 2017 are hereby incorporated by reference into this Award.\n\n**A.

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration with the Secretary-General of ICSID (the \"**Secretary-General**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention\"4 (the \"**Request**\"). Article 36 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"*(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General who shall send a copy of the request to the other party.*\n\n*(2) The request shall contain information concerning the issues in dispute, the identity of the parties and their consent to arbitration in accordance with the rules of procedure for the institution of conciliation and arbitration proceedings.*\n\n*(3) The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of registration or refusal to register*.\"\n\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965.\n\n10.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, the Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 July 2012, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was composed of Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, President, appointed by agreement of the parties; Mr. John Beechey, a national of Great Britain, appointed by the Claimant; and Rt. Hon. Lord Leonard Hoffmann, a British national, appointed by the Respondent. Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Mr. John Beechey, Claimant appointed Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria and the Tribunal was reconstituted on 10 September 2012.\n\n**C. Procedural Background Previous to the Quantum Phase**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nAs reflected in Section 14 of Procedural Order No. 1 dated 3 December 2012, it was agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal that the Parties would in a first phase file submissions on jurisdiction and liability and that the need for a second phase of the proceeding, on the quantum of damages, would be determined based on the Tribunal's decision in the first phase or the intervening course of events in Pakistan.\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 October 2015, in the context of discussions on a time schedule to address certain new issues raised in Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2 September 2015, the Tribunal, *inter alia*, informed the Parties of the following:\n\n\"*The Tribunal would like to inform the Parties that it has almost concluded its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with, a draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues raised in Respondent's Application. The Tribunal notes that, while this approach is not provided for by ICSID, it is common practice in the WTO and also provided for in Article 10.20(9) lit. a of the CAFTA. By analogy to the latter provision, the Parties may submit their comments on the draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within 60 days of its transmission by the Tribunal. Any such comments will be duly considered by the Tribunal in its ultimate Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.*\"\n\n15.\n\nOn 3 February 2016 and having given advance notice to the Parties of its intention to do so on 27 October 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with its Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and invited them to provide comments on errors of fact, misprints, etc. within 60 days of the decision's transmission to the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nOn 4 April 2016, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the Tribunal's Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n17.\n\nOn 20 March 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons to follow).\n\n18.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, Respondent submitted a Request for Reconsideration of the Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (\"**Respondent's Reconsideration Request**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 10 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Award. The submissions on jurisdiction and the merits were summarized in that Decision. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, *see* paragraphs 5 to 215 of that Decision.\n\n20.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal for the reasons set out therein (*see* paragraphs 564 to 1374 with respect to Claimant's claims; and paragraphs 1407 to 1446 with respect to Respondent's counterclaims) decided as follows:\n\n*I. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted to it by Claimant.*\n\n*II. Claimant's claims are admissible.*\n\n*III. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Respondent has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty.*\n\n*IV. Claimant is entitled to be compensated for all damages and losses resulting from Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding.*\n\n*V. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaim based on the alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear Respondent's further counterclaims.*\n\n*VI. Respondent's counterclaim based on the alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is dismissed.*\n\n*VII. The Tribunal's decision on the costs of this phase of the proceeding is reserved for the Award.*\n\n21.\n\nAlso, on 10 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons) (\"**Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons)**\"), which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Award, concerning an Application to Dismiss the Claims filed by Respondent on 2 September 2015. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to the Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons), *see* paragraphs 6 to 182 of that Decision.\n\n22.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in the course of that phase of the proceedings concerning Respondent's allegations of corruption as well as, to the extent relevant in that context, the arguments and evidence adduced in the previous phase on jurisdiction and liability, the Tribunal for the reasons set out in paragraphs 209 to 1496 of its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons), decided as follows:\n\n*I. The evidence submitted by Respondent as well as the counter-evidence submitted by Claimant in the present phase of the proceeding are admitted into the record.*\n\n*II. Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2 September 2015 is dismissed in its entirety.*\n\n*III. Respondent has not established any of its individual allegations of corruption that would be attributable to Claimant and that could have become relevant as potential contributory fault in the quantum phase that is now to follow.*\n\n*IV. The Tribunal's decision on the costs of this phase of the proceeding is reserved for the Award.*\n\n**D. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND - QUANTUM PHASE**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 March 2017, Claimant filed a Memorial on Damages, together with: (i) Exhibits CE-890 to CE-1197; (ii) Legal Authorities CA-356 to CA-385; (iii) updated indices of exhibits and authorities; (iv) four witness statements (\"**WS**\"): WS of Carlos Sep\u00falveda, Second WS of Jean-Paul Luksic, Fifth WS of Cassie Boggs and Eighth WS of Timothy Livesey; and (v) the Expert Report (\"**ER**\") of Prof. Graham Davis (\"**Claimant's Quantum Memorial**\").\n\n24.\n\nProf. Davis advised in paragraph 9 of his Report that he was retained as a testifying witness in another matter by a team at Sidley Austin LLP that included Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, and that such engagement was concluded at the time of the Report.\n\n25.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, Respondent filed a Request for Disqualification of Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov (the \"**Disqualification Request**\"). By letter of 8 July 2017, the Secretariat confirmed receipt of the Disqualification Request on behalf of the Secretary-General and informed the Parties that, pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the proceeding was suspended until a decision on the Disqualification Request had been taken.\n\n26.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Claimant filed its Opposition to Respondent's Request for Disqualification of Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov.\n\n27.\n\nOn 18 July 2017, pursuant to Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Dr. Alexandrov furnished explanations in response to the Disqualification Request, which were transmitted to the Parties on the same day.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 July 2017, the Secretariat circulated the Parties' simultaneous further observations on the Disqualification Request that were received from Claimant on 21 July 2017 and from Respondent on 25 July 2017.\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 September 2017, the Unchallenged Members of the Tribunal rendered a Decision on Respondent's Request for Disqualification of Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov in which they rejected Respondent's Disqualification Request. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to the Decision on Respondent's Disqualification Request, *see* paragraphs 5 to 70 of that Decision.\n\n30.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on Quantum, together with the following documentation: (i) Exhibits RE-554 to RE-612; (ii) Legal Authorities RLA-375 to RLA-383; (iii) two witness statements: WS Noor ul Haque and WS Ishad Ali Khokhar; (iv) eleven expert reports: ER of Vladimir Brailovsky and Prof. Louis T.

Holmes and Dr. Marcella Nanni (Water Resource Associates or \"**WRA**\"), together with Exhibits 1-36 (\"**Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum**\")\n\n31.\n\nOn 25 November 2017, Respondent filed a proposal for disqualification of the entire Tribunal (the \"**Disqualification Proposal**\"). On the same date, the ICSID Secretariat (the \"**Secretariat**\") informed the Parties that, pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), the proceeding was suspended until a decision on the Disqualification Proposal had been taken.\n\n32.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Claimant submitted a reply to the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n33.\n\nOn 6 December 2017, pursuant to Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Dr. Alexandrov furnished explanations in response to the Disqualification Proposal. Professor Dr. Sachs and Rt. Hon. Lord Hoffmann did not provide explanations.\n\n34.\n\nWhile the proceeding was suspended, Claimant filed its Reply Memorial on Quantum of Damages on 13 December 2017, together with: (i) Exhibits CE-1205 to CE-1527; (ii) Legal Authorities CA-429 to CA-449; (iii) updated indices of exhibits and authorities; (iv) one witness statement: Ninth WS of Timothy Livesey; (v) nine Expert Reports: Second ER of Prof. Graham Davis, ER of Fiona Cessford-Le Roux, ER of Neil Cusworth, ER of Dr. Leonard Drury, ER of Michael Jones, ER of Anton Mayer, ER of Rex E.

In addition, in response to the WS of Ali Rahim of 10 November 2017, Claimant submitted with the Tribunal's authorization two Witness Statements: WS of Neil Cusworth and WS of Tony Ridley (\"**Claimant's Quantum Reply**\").\n\n35.\n\nOn 15 December 2017, each Party filed further observations on the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n36.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, the Chairman of the Administrative Council issued its decision, declining Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify the entire Tribunal. The proceeding was resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n37.\n\nOn 6 February 2018, Claimant filed a proposal concerning pending matters (\"**Pending Matters Proposal**\"). On 7 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment by 8 February 2018. Following a request from Respondent of 8 February 2018, the deadline was extended by one day until 9 February 2018. On 9 February 2018, Respondent commented on Claimant's Pending Matters Proposal. The Tribunal rendered its decision on these matters in its Procedural Order No. 22 of 21 February 2018.\n\n38.\n\nOn 7 February 2018, Respondent filed a request for leave to comment on Claimant's Pending Matters Proposal, where Respondent also submitted that Claimant had been copying submissions to the Tribunal and that Respondent was not privy to the Tribunal's emails. On the same date the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment by 8 February 2018. On 8 February 2018, Claimant filed a response to Respondent's message of 7 February 2018. On 9 February 2018, Respondent requested further clarifications from Claimant. On 10 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment, which it did on 12 February 2018.\n\n39.\n\nOn 7 February 2018, Respondent filed a request for the exclusion of evidence (of Mr. Craig's witness statement) and spoliation sanctions, (Application for a Ruling *in Limine* and for Spoliations Sanctions) (\"**Application for a Ruling** ***in Limine***\"). At the Claimant's request, on 10 February 2018, the Tribunal granted Claimant leave to file its opposition to Respondent's Application for a Ruling *in Limine* until 23 February 2018. On 23 February 2018, Claimant filed an Opposition to Respondent's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*, requesting the Tribunal to dismiss the Spoliation Application or, in the alternative, defer any decision on matters raised by Respondent's Application until the hearing, together with Mr. Craig's Third Witness Statement. On 26 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant's Opposition by 2 March 2018, and Claimant to submit, if it so wished, additional comments by 9 March 2018. On 28 February 2018, Respondent filed a request for the extension of the deadline to file a reply regarding exclusion of evidence until 5 March 2018, which was granted on 1 March 2018. On 5 March 2018, Respondent filed a Reply in support of Respondent's Application for a Ruling *in Limine*, together with (i) Ali Zahid Rahim's Second Witness Statement and (ii) an index of exhibits and legal authorities.

On the same date, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment by 9 February 2018. On 9 February 2018, Claimant objected to Respondent's Tanjeel Feasibility Study Request. On 12 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21, rejecting Respondent's Tanjeel Feasibility Study Request as untimely and not sufficiently relevant to the case or material to its outcome. The Tribunal further set a procedural calendar for the remainder of the arbitration.\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the \"**2018 Provisional Measures Request**\"), requesting the Tribunal to: (i) order Pakistan to take steps to ensure that Balochistan withdraws the IHC (Islamabad High Court) Application and terminates the IHC Proceeding; (ii) order Pakistan to take steps to ensure that Balochistan seeks an adjournment of the hearing scheduled for 21 Feb 2018 as a temporary measure pending disposition of the request; (iii) establish an expedited briefing schedule and a videoconference for oral argument of this Request; and, alternatively (iv) not admit any supposed new evidence obtained through the Islamabad High Court proceedings. Paragraph 72 of Claimant's Provisional Measures Request included a temporary measure request \"*that the Tribunal order Pakistan to take steps to ensure that Balochistan seeks an adjournment of the hearing currently scheduled for 21 February 2018 as a temporary measure pending disposition of this Request, and establish an expedited briefing schedule and a videoconference for oral argument on this Request*\" (the \"**Temporary Measure Request**\"). On 15 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant's Temporary Measure Request by 19 February 2018. On the same date, Respondent filed an extension request until 21 February 2018. On 16 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment on Respondent's extension request, which it did on the same date. Subsequently, also on 16 February 2018, Respondent reiterated its extension request. On 17 February 2018, the Tribunal rejected Respondent's extension request, noting that Respondent had not yet been asked to comment on Claimant's Provisional Measures Request in its entirety but only on the Temporary Measure Request of adjourning the hearing that was scheduled before the Islamabad High Court on 21 February 2018. In particular, Respondent was invited to explain on what basis it considered that \"*the jurisdictional issue will not be resolved at the next hearing before the IHC*.\" On 19 February 2018, Respondent filed its comments on Claimant's Temporary Measure Request. On 20 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal denied Claimant's Temporary Measure Request and fixed a briefing schedule for written submissions on Claimant's Provisional Measures Request.\n\n42.\n\nOn 16 February 2018, Respondent filed an application requesting the Tribunal to clarify and reconsider Procedural Order No. 21 (\"**Requests concerning PO-21**\").

On 2 March 2018, Claimant filed a Reply on Claimant's Provisional Measures Request. On 5 March 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that Respondent was invited to submit its Rejoinder on Claimant's Provisional Measures Request by 9 March 2018 and noted that the Tribunal would render a decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures only if and when it had been provided with notice to do so from the Parties. On 9 March 2018, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Claimant's Provisional Measures Request together with Exhibit RE-635.\n\n44.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, Respondent filed a Site Visit Report by Prof. Kadri Dagdelen with supporting documentation (the \"**Site Visit Report**\").

On 5 March 2018, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Claimant's letter dated 4 March 2018 regarding Prof. Dagdelen's Site Visit Report, the interim results of the metallurgical testing and the process used to extract and transport water samples from the Fan Sediments, and invited Respondent to comment by 7 March 2018. On 7 March 2018, Respondent filed a response to the Claimant's observations on the Site Visit Report. On 8 March 2018, the Tribunal; (i) provided directions to the Parties on the Site Visit Report related matters, ordering Respondent to submit \"*documentary evidence and/or witness testimony to establish the process used to extract and transport water samples from the Fan Sediments, including a report from any vendor Pakistan employed*\"; and (ii) directed the Parties to refrain from filing further applications and requests in order to allow the Parties and the Tribunal to prepare for the Hearing on Quantum. On 9 March 2018, Respondent filed an extension request, which was followed by objections from Claimant, and, subsequently, by a message from Respondent reiterating its extension request and attaching copy of a letter to Claimant's counsel regarding Lab Costs. On 20 March 2018, Respondent filed a submission concerning the Site Visit and the extraction and transportation of water, together with supporting documents on water collection and a witness statement of Mr. Javaid Ahmed. On the same date, Respondent filed an Expert Report by Prof. Erik Spiller regarding Metallurgical Testing, along with 5 appendices.\n\n45.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which had been provided to the Parties as a draft on 3 February 2016 and was rendered in final form on 10 November 2017 (\"**Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request**\"). For the reasons indicated therein, Respondent's Request dated 6 November 2017 for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was rejected, and the decision on the costs incurred in relation to Respondent's Reconsideration Request was reserved for the Final Award. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to the Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, *see* paragraphs 2 to 13 of that Decision.\n\n46.\n\nAlso, on 28 February 2018, Claimant filed a renewed request for certain orders from the Tribunal regarding Respondent's allegedly deficient production of documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 20 (\"**Claimant's Document Production Request**\"). On 1 March 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment. On 7 March 2018, Respondent filed observations on the Claimant's Document Production Request with a Redfern Schedule and attachments. On 12 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 23 concerning Claimant's Document Production Request, where it allowed Claimant to file, if it so wished, a supplemental reply on quantum*.*\n\n47.\n\nOn 19 March 2018, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to reconsider certain aspects to the Procedural Order No. 23, particularly, the timing fixed for Claimant's supplemental reply on quantum; noting that such supplemental reply on quantum should be filed simultaneously with Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum. (\"**Reconsideration Request concerning PO-23**\"). On the same date, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment by 22 March 2018. On 21 March 2018, Claimant objected to Respondent's request of 19 March 2018 regarding the Tribunal's authorization for Claimant to file a supplemental reply on quantum. On 22 March 2018, the Tribunal decided on Respondent's Reconsideration Request concerning PO-23. For the reasons indicated therein, the Tribunal did not consider it necessary to make any further orders on the scope of the supplemental reply on quantum.\n\n48.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Quantum*,* together with: (i) Exhibits RE-576-3.12 to RE-768; (ii) Legal Authorities RLA-398 to RLA-422; (iii) four (4) Witness Statements of: WS of Ghulam Nabi, WS of Haji Arz Muhammad Badaich, WS of Irshad Khokhar and WS of Rehmat Baloch; and (iv) fifteen (15) Expert Reports: ER of Dr. Jerald S.

Following the Tribunal's invitation, on 5 April 2018, Respondent filed comments on Claimant's letter of 29 March 2018.

These will be addressed as part of the Tribunal's reasoning on the consequences flowing from Respondent's breaches.\n\n**V. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Claimant's Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nClaimant submits that it should be awarded compensation in the amount of USD 8.5 billion plus interest, reflecting the damage that it has incurred as a result of Respondent's wrongful denial of the mining lease application submitted by TCCP to the Director General of the Mines & Mineral Development Department of Balochistan (the \"**Licensing Authority**\") on 15 February 2011 (the \"**Mining Lease Application**\" or the \"**Application**\"), which deprived it of the opportunity to build and operate the mine at Reko Diq.5\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9.\n\n**1. On the Legal Standards Governing Claimant's Claim for Compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal must award compensation equal to the \"*market value*\" of Claimant's investment as of 15 November 2011 and, in assessing that value, it must disregard all of the unlawful acts that Respondent has committed prior to that valuation date.6 In Claimant's view, the Australia-Pakistan BIT does not specify the remedies for Respondent's breaches of the Treaty and the Tribunal must therefore apply the standard of full reparation under customary international law, as established in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory, i.e.,* the award \"*must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that acted had not been committed*.\"7\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 37, *quoting from* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland),* 1928 PCIJ, Series A, No. 17 (Merits), Judgment No. 13 of 13 September 1928 [CA-80], \u00b6 125.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant accepts that it must show that Respondent's Treaty breaches caused its loss but considers that the causal relationship has already been determined by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and all that remains is for that loss to be quantified.8\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 34; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17.\n\n89.\n\nClaimant further accepts that it has the burden of proof as to its loss. As to the standard of proof, Claimant submits that once it has been shown that a loss has been incurred, damages should be awarded even if the specific amount cannot be assessed with certainty.9\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 69; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 30.\n\n90.\n\nClaimant submits that the amount of its loss should be quantified based on the DCF valuation method, more specifically the \"*practical, industry-informed application of well-established principles*\" used in the modern DCF model applied by its valuation expert Prof. Davis which it considers to be \"*the best method to value a development-stage mining project like Reko Diq*.\"10\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 21.\n\n91.\n\nIn Claimant's view, neither a comparables valuation approach nor a cost-based method could capture the value of its investment as it puts the investor in the position as if the investment had never occurred \u2013 rather than the position as if the breaches had not occurred as required by the principle of full reparation. In Claimant's view, the same applies to the valuation method applied by Respondent's valuation expert Dr. Burrows because it is also a backword-looking method and has in any event not been correctly applied.11\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 92-94. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 128.\n\n**2. On the Terms of the Mineral Agreement and the Risks and Issues Raised by Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nClaimant takes the position that if the Governments had continued to negotiate in good faith, the parties would have entered into a \"*mutually beneficial and commercially reasonable*\" mineral agreement, as contemplated by the 2002 BM Rules and the 1995 National Mineral Policy (the \"**Mineral Agreement**\"), and the question remained only on what terms. According to Claimant, the fiscal terms that Prof. Davis used in his model were the terms on which the Governments and TCC would likely have agreed but for the Governments' takeover and abandonment of negotiations: (i) a 2% provincial royalty; (ii) Export Processing Zone (\"**EPZ**\") status for the first 15 years followed by the normal tax regime; (iii) extension of TCCP's mining lease for the life of the mine; and (iv) participation by Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest.12\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 48; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 235-237.\n\n93.\n\nClaimant further argues that neither of Respondent's criticisms on geology and metallurgy affects the value of the project because they are factually incorrect and \"*reveal a profound lack of understanding about mining practices in general and the Reko Diq project in particular.*\" Claimant maintains that its resource estimate is \"*highly reliable*\" and submits that: (i) its metallurgical sampling adequately represented the material to be processed by the mine; and (ii) its metallurgical testing validated \"*consistently high recoveries of copper and gold at marketable concentrate grades*.\"13\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 46.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant submits that it was committed to building the mine at Reko Diq and had developed the necessary plans to do so. According to Claimant, \"*TCC's Feasibility Study covered all the technical aspects required to build a project of this scale, as well as the capital and operating costs required to engineer, construct, and eventually operate both the initial mine and the planned expansion case.*\"14\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 72. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 670.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent's arguments on water ignore the Tribunal's findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Claimant also notes that it had identified: (i) an aquifer that was \"*not only an abundant source of water but which could be utilized without any significant effect on surrounding communities*\"; (ii) three backup sources; and (iii) the possibility to build a sea water pipeline. Claimant further claims that any residual risk that remained as of November 2011 has been accounted for by Prof. Davis.15\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 487-491\n\n96.\n\nClaimant contends that it \"*fully recognized and addressed the relevant security risks, including those associated with transporting the slurry concentrate by pipeline to the port of Gwadar*.\" Claimant refers to the chapters on security and risk included in both the Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study submitted by Claimant to the Government of Balochistan on 26 August 2010 (the \"**Feasibility Study**\") and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study completed in July 2010 (the \"**Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study**\") as well as the \"*comprehensive Risk Register in which risks were catalogued, assigned a mitigation strategy, and tracked with respect to progress*.\" According to Claimant, the costs associated with the security plans were accounted for in the operating and capital cost estimates, with \"*significant contingencies totaling more than half a billion dollars*\" built into the capital expense estimates.16 In any event, Claimant claims that Prof. Davis' model \"*fully accounts for any security costs*.\" In particular, Claimant refers to Prof. Davis' inclusion of a 0.5% annual likelihood of permanent pre-mature mine shut-down of Reko Diq due to acts of extreme political violence, which, according to Prof. Davis, \"*reduces the value of the investment by US$ 1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario where this risk would be absent*.\"17\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 128, 132; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 592-594.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 178.\n\n97.\n\nClaimant submits that its approach to identifying, assessing and managing potential environmental and social risks of the project was consistent with international best practices and in line with what lenders and regulators would have expected for the Reko Diq project at this stage. Claimant considers that none of the criticisms raised by Respondent are material enough to have an effect on the quality of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the Reko Diq Project dated November 2010 (\"**ESIA**\"). It further argues that the ESIA process reflected a dynamic collaboration between Claimant, its owners and third-party consultants and maintains that the final ESIA ensured compliance with the most stringent standards in the industry.18\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 696-699.\n\n98.\n\nClaimant submits that none of the allegations raised by Respondent with regard to permitting established an impact on the valuation of the project beyond the delays that Prof. Davis has already incorporated into his valuation model. Claimant contends that: (i) it did not experience significant problems securing approvals, licenses or permits for the project; (ii) it took appropriate steps to address future permitting needs; and (iii) in any event, Prof. Davis incorporated longer delays into his model than any of the delays posited by Respondent.19\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 186, 188.\n\n99.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that in the absence of Respondent's breaches, the Reko Diq project would have attracted the necessary financing, as it had the full support of its sponsors, Antofagasta and Barrick. According to Claimant, this is confirmed by the fact they the sponsors had invested hundreds of millions of US dollars in the Feasibility Study and were willing to contribute 60% of the project costs. It argues that lenders \"*would have given great weight not only to the sponsors' financial capacity but also to their managerial, technical, and operating expertise.*\"20\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 261, 269-270; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 766, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6 23.\n\n**3. On Prof. Davis' Adjustments for Systematic and Asymmetric Risks**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nClaimant submits that Prof. Davis appropriately discounted the project's future cash flows for both systematic and asymmetric risks as well as for the time value of money. Claimant explains that Prof. Davis applied risk-adjusted cash flows derived from futures and forward prices which are already discounted for systematic risk. It specifically rejects Respondent's allegation that the cash flows and specifically the revenues in Prof. Davis' model are the same as in the DCF model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.21\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 320-325; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 205.\n\n101.\n\nClaimant further rejects the allegation that Prof. Davis' model implies a 4.2% discount rate, which would be only 1.2 percentage points above the risk-free rate. According to Claimant, this implied rate does not fully capture the significant asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis but most importantly does not capture the discount for systematic risk. Claimant further emphasizes that Prof. Davis increased the cost estimates in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility study by a total of 58%.22\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 340-344; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 240-244.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Prof. Davis has also fully accounted for asymmetric risks, including the country risk affecting the project because of its location in Pakistan and in particular Balochistan. Claimant notes that according to Respondent, the most prominent risks associated with the project's location are political violence and security risks and argues that Prof. Davis took these into account in three ways: (i) he incorporated an annual 0.5% probability of a complete and permanent project shutdown; (ii) he included \"*substantial premiums for insurance that would protect against the effects of political violence, terrorist attacks, and other security threats*\"; and (iii) he adjusted various costs and production quantities to reflect the residual risk of various security threats. In addition to country risk, Claimant asserts that Prof. Davis also accounted for further asymmetric risk by incorporating the potential effects of project delays, which reduced the value of Claimant's investment by USD 1.3 billion.23\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 389-394; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 246-250, 255.\n\n103.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent has failed to present any credible valuation which could have been compared with Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation; it only submitted \"*Dr. Burrows's odd and unconvincing* 'prior transaction' *approach*\" which concluded that the project was worth even less than in 2006. Claimant contends that Dr. Burrows' prior transaction analysis is \"*irredeemably flawed*\" because the 2006 transaction is \"*simply not* 'comparable'\" to the 2011 project, as confirmed by the \"*massive adjustments*\" made by Dr. Burrows in his analysis. More importantly, Claimant argues that Dr. Burrows' analysis contradicts the \"*foundational principle*\" of the value curve according to which \"*project value increases exponentially as sponsors' certainty about the underlying mineral resources and about the feasibility of the mine plan increases*.\"24\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 468, 477-478; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 273.\n\n104.\n\nClaimant further emphasizes that Respondent's valuation experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not present any DCF valuation of the project but only stated that the project either had no value, a negative value or the value estimated by Dr. Burrows, without proving actual calculations or supporting evidence for their assertions. According to Claimant, the IRR reported in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, on which they relied, is \"*not a particularly useful indicator of the value of the Project*\" given that it is \"*by definition, a conservative analytical tool*\" which was \"*the result of conservative assumptions*\" and did not reflect the actual rate of return expected for the project. Claimant adds that the IRRs and NPVs are evaluations rather than valuations as they are intended to test the project and determine that it can break even but not to calculate how profitable it can be.25\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 485, 488-489, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6 68; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 334.\n\n105.\n\nClaimant further emphasizes that \"[d]*espite all of this deliberate conservatism*,\" the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study confirmed the robustness of the project, yielding a net present value of USD 1,206 billion at a 10% discount rate. It adds that Prof. Davis' update of the calculation to the valuation date yielded a net present value of USD 4.0 billion; Claimant's 75% share of that NPV would have been USD 3.0 billion.26\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 490; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 369-370, 374-375, 377.\n\n**4. On Pre-Award and Post-Award Interest**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that the principle of full reparation requires that it be awarded pre-award and post-award compound interest to be calculated at either: (i) Respondent's short-term, unsecured, dollar-denominated borrowing rate, which corresponds to an annualized compound rate of 4%; or (ii) \"*another conservative rate*\" such as the US prime rate plus two percentage points, which corresponds to an annualized compound rate of 5.6%.27\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 508-512; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 370-386, 406-407.\n\n**B. Summary of Respondent's Contentions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal should award no damages to Claimant because it has failed to prove the necessary elements of its claim, including the technical and economic feasibility of the project, and has relied on a valuation method that produces artificially inflated results. In Respondent's view, the real value of the project is speculative; in any event, it does not exceed USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date.28\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 361.\n\n**1. On the Legal Standards Governing Claimant's Claim for Compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nRespondent accepts that \"*the proper measure of quantum is the market value of TCC on November 15, 2011*.\" According to Respondent, \"*market value*\" is captured by the compensation standard agreed by the parties to the Treaty, *i.e*., Article 7, which excludes the application of a *lex generalis* taken from customary international law. Respondent notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to assess whether the fair market value of Claimant's investment is \"*readily ascertainable*\" and considers that the valuation presented by Claimant \"*is as far as a method could be from rendering a* 'readily ascertainable' *result*.\" Consequently, Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal must determine a value \"*in accordance with generally recognized principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, and other relevant factors*.\"29\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 49; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 302; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 71, 78, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2).\n\n109.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant bears the burden of proving that the damages it alleges are a direct consequence of the Treaty breaches and that, in order to establish causation, it must prove that: (i) the alleged injury was caused by the wrongful act as a matter of fact; and (ii) the loss is not too remote and speculative. Respondent argues that the Tribunal's finding on the existence of a Treaty breach does not discharge Claimant's burden of proof on causation and maintains that Claimant has failed to prove that the amount of compensation is a direct consequence of the rejection of the Mining Lease Application.30\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, 58; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 53.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant also has the burden of proof on the existence and quantum of the damages it is seeking. It relies on its legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who states that a \"*claimant must prove the losses it has incurred with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant failed to provide reasonably and sufficiently certain information and therefore failed to discharge its burden of proof; Reko Diq \"*faced key challenges that would have prevented it from becoming profitable, which requires the Tribunal to dismiss the compensation claims*.\"31\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 59-62, 69; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 308-311, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 6 and note 2.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent contends that the valuation method applied by Claimant's valuation expert, which it describes as \"*a rather unique variation of a discounted cash flow* ('DCF' *) valuation, which has not been adopted by the mining industry or investment tribunals*,\" cannot help in determining the fair market value of Claimant's investment as of the valuation date. According to Respondent, the \"*modern DCF*\" method does not meet the standard for a \"*readily ascertainable*\" market value but has been fabricated by Claimant and its expert to \"*provide a designer, bespoke methodology allowing TCC to offer the appearance of pseudo-scientific support for its predetermined outlandish valuation*.\"32 More generally, Respondent claims that \"*the weight of authority clearly indicates that, as a general rule, the DCF method is not appropriate for investment projects that have not demonstrated their capacity to generate profits by a track record of performance.*\"33\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 306, 314; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 113.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 319, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 8. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 74 and 77.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent submits that where the market value is not \"*readily ascertainable*,\" the Tribunal should look to a backward-looking approach. Respondent contends that its expert Dr. Burrows derived the best approximation to the fair market value of Claimant's investment by using the prior transaction by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired the shares in Claimant in 2006.34\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 116; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 353.\n\n**2. On the Terms of the Mineral Agrement and the Risks and Issues Affecting the Project**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Tribunal has not made any finding that Claimant had a legitimate expectation to conclude a Mineral Agreement and argues that there was no specific commitment to this effect nor were the Governments under a legal obligation to conclude a Mineral Agreement. Respondent further takes the position that \"[g]*iven the lengthy history or stalled negotiations and distant positions, the most likely outcome would be that no mineral agreement would have been agreed whatsoever*.\" At the same time, Respondent contends that the absence of a finding that a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded would render the value of Claimant's plan to mine Reko Diq speculative.35 As for the fiscal terms put forward by Claimant, Respondent submits that: (i) Pakistan would not have agreed to a royalty rate below the minimum of 5% required by law; (ii) Pakistan never agreed to grant EPZ status and Claimant abandoned this request during negotiations; (iii) the parties \"*were nowhere close to agreeing to the overall fiscal regime*\"; and (iv) the Governments \"*roundly rejected*\" a provision providing for an automatic renewal of the 30-year mining lease.36\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 130-135, 144; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 109\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 27.\n\n114.\n\nRespondent further submits that in order to determine the value of the copper and gold beneath the surface at Reko Diq, Claimant must achieve a level of certainty that it would be able and that it would be economically feasible to turn the rock into recoverable metal. Respondent emphasizes that if any of the issues that might arise poses a cost that is too high for the mineral to be economically extracted, the resources cannot be classified as anything more than inferred and do not have any economic value; they can never become reserves.37\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 193.\n\n115.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show that its resource model is trustworthy given that: (i) it has not provided an independent analysis that admitted flaws were fixed; (ii) it did not rebut the findings of Respondent's mining expert regarding the flaws in the database underlying the resource model; and (iii) the method of Claimant's mining expert and its application are \"*completely unreliable*.\"38\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 75.\n\n116.\n\nRespondent further maintains that Claimant has not \"*completely sampled and tested the deposits from a metallurgical perspective*,\" as the deposit is variable and not sufficiently consistent to rely on the \"*limited sampling and testing*\" conducted by Claimant. In particular, Respondent contends that Claimant did not sufficiently test the deposit at depths below 450 meters and claims that Claimant's metallurgical testing program was insufficient to prove that the ore below that depth was metallurgically consistent with the ore from shallower depths. In its view, \"*the reasonable position is to assume metallurgical variability*,\" as a buyer would have done in light of the lack of testing for the deposits.39\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 81, 95; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 172-173.\n\n117.\n\nRespondent submits that, according to Claimant, Reko Diq is a \"*mega project*\" which would have cost almost USD 3.3 billion in capital expenditures in order to get the mine operational. Respondent claims, however, that the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study \"*failed to quantify sizable costs, adopted an overly aggressive construction schedule that did not prepare for the requirements of building a mine in Pakistan, and adhered to overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost estimates.*\" According to Respondent, the Feasibility Study was \"*a blueprint for another Mega Project failure.*\"40\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 352, Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 108-109.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent argues that \"[w]*ater was a big concern for TCC*\" and emphasizes that the quantities of water needed for the construction and operation of the project would be equal to the level of daily water consumption of approximately 500,000 people. Respondent also points to the additional risks identified in Claimant's Risk Register, which confirms in its view that Claimant was aware that \"*the availability of and right to use water could doom the entire project*.\"41 According to Respondent, Claimant \"*fell far short of proving the size of the aquifer, its plans for mitigation, and the effects of its plans on surrounding areas and countries*.\" Respondent considers it confirmed that the Fan Sediments would likely not have provided sufficient water for the project and contends that there was no feasibility assessment and no cost estimates on transporting the water from other water sources to Reko Diq. Respondent also submits that the solution to pump seawater to Reko Diq was not mentioned in the Feasibility Study and adds that, in any event, this water pipeline would have faced the same risks as the slurry pipeline to Port Gwadar.42\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 134; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 218, 221.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 134, 163-164; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 254-255.\n\n119.\n\nRespondent considers it undisputed that Claimant was planning to build a mine in \"*one of the most dangerous places in the world*\" and that the security situation in Balochistan has worsened from 2006 to 2011 and continuing thereafter. However, Respondent contends that Claimant \"*made little to no effort to identify and address the security risks that the Reko Diq project faced, largely ignored the threat of sabotage on the pipeline, and completely understated the costs to adequately secure the mine's operations*.\"43 Respondent argues that in light of the security risks, a third-party buyer \"*would likely have refrained from going forward*\"; however, if it had decided to proceed, it could not have relied on Prof. Davis' valuation model which, according to Respondent, \"*does not account for the cumulative effect of attacks, the impact of security costs on the financials of the project as management saw it in 2010-2011, and a realistic view of the insurance market*.\"44\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 166; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 288; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 256-257.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 206.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent also claims that Claimant: \"*(1) had no comprehensive plan to mitigate the public's concerns and provide benefits; (2) failed to understand the socio-political conditions in the area and the Resource's role in exacerbating already existing tensions; (3) failed to sufficiently engage the affected communities or involve them in strategic decision making during the consultation process; and (4) underestimated what it would take to obtain a social license and maintain it*.\" Respondent further contends that Claimant's ESIA failed to conform to the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles as well as to its own Environmental Design Criteria (EDC) in various areas, as a result of which it would not have been able to seek funding and would not have been able to obtain political risk insurance.45\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 207; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 290-291; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 313, 320.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant would further have been required to show that it had the necessary permits. By contrast, Respondent claims that \"*TCC did not even know all of the permits it needed, did not appreciate the practical difficulties of operating in Balochistan, and failed to account for the specific difficulties of getting permits for the project*.\"46\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 256; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 350.\n\n122.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that the Reko Diq project would not have been financially feasible from a bankability perspective because there was \"*no financing appetite*\" in the market for the Reko Diq project given the \"*significant flaws in the standards underlying the IMD FS and an array of other problems that made the project not bankable.*\" In addition, Respondent argues that any decision by Claimant's owners to fund the development of the project on an equity basis would have required them to break their internal policies and risk their market reputation.47\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 378.\n\n**3. On Prof. Davis' Adjustments for Systematic and Asymmetric Risks**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nRespondent takes the view that Prof. Davis has not adequately accounted for the systematic risks in his valuation model because he has used \"*inordinately speculative*\" projections of futures prices and even called his projections \"*certainty-equivalent.*\" Respondent considers it \"*simply untenable*\" that a buyer would be convinced by Prof. Davis' explanation of \"*certainty-equivalent*\" cash flows and accept the \"*ridiculously low rate return*\" in order to invest in a non-diversified, non-operational mining project in Balochistan instead of purchasing the same amout in US Treasury bonds.48\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 420, 424, 433; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 333.\n\n124.\n\nRespondent contends that \"[w]*hen properly analyzed*,\" Prof. Davis' valuation is equivalent to applying a discount rate of merely 1.2% above the risk-free rate. According to Respondent, Claimant has thereby ignored over 90% of the risk impact perceived by financial markets and institutions. Respondent also refers to the discount rates of 10% to 12% used by SNC Lavalin in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which led to a value of the project near zero. Respondent alleges that the revenues and costs projected by Prof. Davis are very similar to those in the financial model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which makes it apparent that Prof. Davis made \"*only minor adjustments to the cash flows*\" and that these cash flows are therefore no more \"*certainty-equivalent*\" than those of SNC Lavalin. As a result, Respondent claims that there can be no justification for the application of a risk-free discount rate to the cash flows in Prof. Davis' model.49\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 423-424; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 343-344, 438-439.\n\n125.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the implied discount rate of 4.2% in Prof. Davis' model cannot be an adequate expression of all the risks to which the project's cash flows would have been exposed, in particular the country risk, which has led other tribunals to apply risk premiums between 10% and 20% as part of the discount rate, which would render the net present value of the cash flows estimated by Claimant negative.50\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 349-351.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent submits that the only proper determination of the fair market value of Claimant's interest in Reko Diq has been provided by Dr. Burrows who, \"*following best practices and his long forensic experience, \u2026 identified the existence of a prior transaction that, with some adjustments, would be the best approximation to that fair market value,*\" *i.e*., the acquisition by Barrick of 50% in Claimant in September 2006 for a value of USD 246 million.51 Respondent rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows failed to account for changes in the reported resources of the property, operating costs and mining technology between 2006 and 2011. In Respondent's view, a comparison with Antofagasta's expectations as of 2006 demonstrates that \"*the parties had an accurate understanding of the total mineralization of the Reko Diq project*\" but that \"*additional development after 2006 needed to design the mine led to negative surprises about recovery costs*.\" According to Respondent, there was therefore no need for an adjustment in Dr. Burrows' calculation to account for an increased size of the deposit or economies of scale.52\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 352; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 404-407.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 332-448.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent submits that Dr. Burrows made the necessary adjustments to account for: (i) changes in expectations about metals prices; (ii) inflation of production costs in the global mining industry; (iii) changes in the general cost of capital for metals mines; and (iv) changes in country risk for Pakistan, which results in a fair market value not exceeding USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date. According to Respondent, this valuation shows that Claimant has \"*artificially inflated its claim by billions of dollars, or over 98.2% of the value claimed of USD 8.5 billion*.\"53\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 409-412; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 361-362.\n\n**4. On Pre-Award and Post-Award Interest**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nRespondent submits that under the applicable rules of international law, any interest awarded should be simple and accrue at a risk-free rate such as the one-month US Treasury bills. According to Respondent, any higher rate would reward Claimant for risks to which the assets being valued were not exposed after the valuation date or \"*simply contradict the applicable law*.\"54\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 364; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 416.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIn its Quantum Post-Hearing Brief dated 31 August 2018, Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue an award:55\n\n(i) Ordering Pakistan to pay monetary damages in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Respondent's illegal acts, valued at USD 8.5 billion as of 15 November 2011;\n\n(ii) Ordering Pakistan to pay pre-award compound interest on the above amount for the period from 15 November 2011 through the date of the award at a rate equal to Respondent's short-term cost of borrowing, valued at USD 2.42 billion as of 30 April 2018,56 and subject to updating closer to the date of the award;\n\n(iii) Ordering Pakistan to pay all the costs of the arbitration and all of TCCA's professional fees and expenses on a full indemnity basis, in an amount to be specified in TCCA's application for costs with respect to the entire arbitration, to be filed on 28 September 2018 pursuant to the Tribunal's oral order on the last day of the hearing;\n\n(iv) Ordering Pakistan to pay post-award interest on all of the above amounts until full payment of those amounts is made, at an annually compounding rate equal to Respondent's annualized short-term cost of borrowing, calculated as the sum of: (i) the annualized market yield on one-month U.S. Treasury bills on the date of the award; and (ii) the market one-year credit default swap spread on Pakistan's sovereign debt on that same date;\n\n(v) Ordering Pakistan to pay the full amount due, in U.S. dollars, outside of Pakistan, without any reduction, claim, or offset whatsoever for taxes, any other fiscal obligation, or any other reason; and\n\n(vi) Ordering any such further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 517.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1785**.\n\n**B. Respondent's Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum dated 31 August 2018, Respondent requests that the Tribunal decide as follows:57\n\n(i) TCC has not shown it has any basis to receive compensation;\n\n(ii) There is no basis to award damages with a DCF methodology;\n\n(iii) Any damages should be no more than the 2006 transaction updated to the Valuation Date;\n\n(iv) Any interest should be simple and calculated on the one-month U.S. Treasury bill; and\n\n(v) Pakistan should receive its full costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, update with interest.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, Section VII.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S REASONING**\n---------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nAt the outset of its reasoning, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in the course of the present phase of the proceedings concerning the consequences flowing from Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty as well as, to the extent relevant in the present context, the arguments and evidence adduced in the previous phases on jurisdiction and liability and on Respondent\u2019s Application to Dismiss the Claims. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is structured as follows:\n\n\u2022 First, the Tribunal will recall the main findings it has made in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability which it deems relevant to its assessment of the Parties\u2019 arguments raised in this last phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal will also refer to the findings it has made in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Reconsideration Request and make certain general remarks on the development of Respondent\u2019s position regarding the feasibility of Claimant\u2019s project at Reko Diq.\n\n\u2022 Second, the Tribunal will determine the relevant legal standards governing Claimant\u2019s claim for compensation. As part of this assessment, the Tribunal will address: (i) the applicable standard of compensation; (ii) the requirement of causation between Respondent\u2019s Treaty breaches and the damages alleged by Claimant; (iii) the standard and burden of proof that apply to ascertaining the feasibility of the project and the value of Claimant\u2019s investment; and (iv) the appropriate valuation method to determine the value of Claimant\u2019s investment and the corresponding compensation to which Claimant is entitled. In the context of (iv), the Tribunal will address the different valuation methods used by the Parties\u2019 valuation experts and examine whether Claimant has established, in principle, that it is appropriate to determine the damages it has incurred based on the valuation method relied on by its valuation expert, Prof. Davis.\n\n\u2022 Third, once the Tribunal has determined the relevant legal standards, it will assess whether Claimant has established that it would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Federal and Provincial Governments and, if so, the terms on which such an agreement would likely have been concluded. The Tribunal will further examine whether Claimant has established the feasibility of the project and address the various risks and issues raised by Respondent in this last phase of the arbitration proceedings. Provided that the Tribunal decides, in principle, to follow the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, it will also assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for each of these risks in his valuation of the project.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, and again provided that the Tribunal decides, in principle, to follow the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal will assess whether he has appropriately accounted for all relevant systematic and asymmetric risks affecting the project.\n\n\u2022 Fifth, the Tribunal will verify whether the conclusion it has reached on the amount of damages incurred based on the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis is reconcilable with the results yielded by other valuation or evaluation methods relied on by Respondent\u2019s experts in this arbitration or contemporaneously applied by TCCA.\n\n\u2022 Finally, the Tribunal will address Claimant\u2019s request for an award of pre-award and post-award interest on the amount of compensation owed to it by Respondent.\n\n**A. Relevant Findings Made by the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Decision on Respondent\u2019s Reconsideration Request**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal will: (i) recall the main findings it has made in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability which it deems relevant to its assessment of the Parties\u2019 arguments raised in this last phase of the proceedings; (ii) refer to the findings it has made in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Reconsideration Request; and (iii) make certain general remarks on the development of Respondent\u2019s position regarding the feasibility of Claimant\u2019s project at Reko Diq.\n\n**1. Findings Made in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nAs part of its analysis of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal held that Claimant had an *\"investment\"* within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, which consisted of the following:\n\n*\"Claimant's activities in Pakistan were primarily based on two pillars: (i) TCCA's own direct 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture that was thereby established; and (ii) its 100% interest in its Pakistani subsidiary TCCP, which was established for the exclusive purpose of carrying out Claimant's activities in Pakistan. Through TCCP, Claimant indirectly held all further rights in the Reko Diq Project that were not held by the Joint Venture*.\"58\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 632.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal held that these two pillars constitute \"*assets,*\" which were \"*owned or controlled*\" by TCCA and were \"*admitted by* [Pakistan] *subject to its law and investment policies*\" applicable at the time the investment was made.59\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 633-642.\n\n136.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal made the following findings on liability.\n\n**a. Respondent Has Breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal found that Respondent has failed to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment in violation of its obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations is an important element of the FET standard under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.60 Based on a thorough analysis of the Parties' submissions and the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concluded with regard to the scope of legitimate expectations created by Respondent:\n\n\"*In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that by means of both the contractual and the regulatory framework of Claimant's investment as well as the conduct of the GOB and the GOP during the time period in which Claimant explored the area at Reko Diq, Respondent created the legitimate expectation that Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon submission of an application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules. Even though these requirements contained certain discretionary elements, the Governments created the impression that such discretion had either already been exercised or that it would be exercised in Claimant's favor because they recognized the general principle that, after having invested millions of dollars into the exploration of the area, Claimant should also be the one that would later reap the benefit of its exploitation together with its Joint Venture partner. Finally, both the GOB and the GOP repeatedly assured Claimant that they would support and facilitate Claimant's investment*.\"61\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 812.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 958.\n\n139.\n\nSpecifically, with regard to the role assumed by the GOB in this context, the Tribunal held:\n\n\"*Pursuant to these provisions* [*i.e.*, Clauses 7.2a), 5.7.1, 5.7.2, 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA], *the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole, i.e., to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Diq. It is undisputed between the Parties that the GOB did provide such support for, and thus facilitated, Claimant's investment over a period of many years, including the time period in which the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed*.\"62\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 947.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal then examined whether Respondent breached the legitimate expectations it had created and, based on a thorough analysis of the evidentiary record regarding, in particular, the GOB project at Reko Diq, found that there \"*is sufficient evidence that mining activities formed part of the GOB's project and that the GOB thus did not intend to implement a complementary processing project, but rather a competing mining and processing project (albeit at a smaller scale) that was not compatible with Claimant's project*.\"63 The press coverage in 2010 reinforced the Tribunal's conclusion that \"*that the GOB had decided to take over the project and, accordingly, to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application*.\"64\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1151.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1159.\n\n141.\n\nThis conclusion was not, however, sufficient for a finding that Respondent breached its FET obligation because there might have been, at the same time, legitimate reasons for denying the Mining Lease Application submitted by TCCP to the Licensing Authority on 15 February 2011.65 Consequently, the Tribunal examined each of the ten grounds stated in the Licensing Authority's notice of its intent to reject the Mining Lease Application dated 21 September 2011 (the \"**Notice of Intent to Reject**\").66 The Parties had grouped those grounds into three sets of grounds, *i.e*.: (i) that TCCP was not the proper applicant; (ii) that the Feasibility Study, which formed part of the Mining Lease Application, did not provide for processing, smelting and refining of the ore; and (iii) that TCCP failed to submit a proper/complete feasibility study on the discovered deposits in the exploration area. For the reasons set out in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal concluded that \"*none of the reasons given in the Notice of Intent to Reject could have justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application*.\"67\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1160.\n\n**Exhibit CE-7**.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1126.\n\n142.\n\nIn the first phase of the arbitration proceedings, Respondent further raised four additional grounds which, in its view, justified the Licensing Authority's denial of the Mining Lease Application, *i.e*.: (i) that TCCP failed to prove that the mine could be profitably developed and operated; (ii) that TCCP failed to establish that it had or could obtain the resources to carry out the mining operations effectively; (iii) that TCCP failed to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline; and (iv) that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source for the project.68\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1231.\n\n143.\n\nWith regard to these reasons, the Tribunal first held:\n\n\"*Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject because Respondent would thereby be allowed to ignore the procedural requirements set out in rule 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules and, more generally, this would violate Claimant's right to be heard both during the procedure before the Licensing Authority and the appeal before the Secretary of the MMDD*.\"69\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1232.\n\n144.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considered that \"*none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application in the present case*.\"70\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1233.\n\n145.\n\nAs certain findings made by the Tribunal in the context of these additional grounds are particularly relevant to the arguments raised by Respondent in this last phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal considers it worth recalling these reasons in more detail at this point.\n\n**i. Respondent's Allegation That TCCP Failed to Prove that the Mine Could Be Profitably Developed and Operated**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn the context of the first additional ground, *i.e.*, that Claimant failed to demonstrate in the Feasibility Study \"*that the mine can be profitably developed and operated*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the Mineral Rules enacted by Balochistan in 2002 to implement the National Mineral Policy (\"**2002 BM Rules**\"),71 the Tribunal recalled, *inter alia*, the oral testimony of Antofagasta's chairman Mr. Luksic who explained that \"[e]*ven if you have a start that is tight, your expansions are going to be extremely, extremely profitable*\"72 and held:\n\n\"*In light of this undisputed testimony and further taking into account the fact that two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to invest large amounts of equity into this project, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently established that the mining project as envisaged by Claimant, i.e., consisting of the initial mine development set out in the Feasibility Study and the expansions set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study, could be* 'profitably developed and operated' *as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules*.\"73\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(a)(i).\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 3), p. 695 lines 13-17.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1234, *quoting from*.\n\n147.\n\nWhile taking note of the fact that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study did not form part of the Mining Lease Application and thus was not among the documents considered by the Licensing Authority, the Tribunal added:\n\n\"*In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that the initial mine development as presented in the Feasibility Study would have been unprofitable. While Respondent focused its argument primarily on the allegation that Claimant made wrong assumptions with regard to the tax and royalty regime, Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey explained during the Hearing that the profitability was much more sensitive to the prices of fuel and metals, in particular copper, and further stated that in light of the subsequent rise of the copper prices after the completion of the Feasibility Study, the profitability had increased* 'into high teens to twenties IRR even in the normal tax regime.' *This is reflected in the sensitivity analysis on metal prices conducted in Chapters 28.3.1 and 28.3.2 of the Feasibility Study, which further includes the statement that a* 'conservative base copper price' *was selected for this analysis*.\"74\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1238, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1398 lines 12-22 *and referring to* pp. 1410-1422 *and* **Exhibit RE-133**, pp. 28-20 to 28-26. Specifically, with regard to Table 28.20 entitled \"*Impact of Price on IRR*,\" Mr. Livesey further explained that \"*if you were to take today's prices on copper and gold, you would actually be off the chart another block to the right, down on that bottom line, and your IRR would be somewhat close to 20 percent.*\" Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1415 lines 16-19.\n\n148.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considered Respondent's argument that Claimant had made wrong assumptions regarding the tax and royalty regime:\n\n\"[T]*he Tribunal notes that the applicable tax and royalty rates were still subject to the Mineral Agreement negotiations. While such negotiations had apparently stalled before the Mining Lease Application was filed, the parties may well have decided to revive them after the grant of the mining lease, given that Claimant would then have been the only one allowed to conduct mining operations in the area. There would thus have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant would have been in a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became clear that the Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant made unrealistic assumptions in the absence of which the project would have been unprofitable without any future expansions*.\"75\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1239.\n\n**ii. Respondent's Allegation That TCCP Failed to Establish That It Had or Could Obtain the Resources to Carry Out the Mining Operations Effectively**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAs to the second additional reason that Respondent invoked for the first time in these arbitration proceedings, *i.e*., that TCCP failed to demonstrate that it had or could obtain the \"*technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations effectively*\" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules,76 the Tribunal again referred, inter alia, to Mr. Luksic's testimony that Claimant's shareholders had had meetings with the World Bank but \"*you need to have a fully approved project before you get the financing*.\"He also stated that \"*the World Bank seemed very committed. \u2026* [T]*hey were very committed to Pakistan developing mining. It had a special man in charge of a mining program, and they were very committed*.\"77 The Tribunal then held:\n\n\"*In light of this testimony and again taking into account that Antofagasta and Barrick Gold as two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to contribute large amounts of equity to the project, it appears improbable that they would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank. In the Tribunal's view, the absence of a Mineral Agreement might have made such financing more challenging, but there was no indication that it would have been impossible*.\"78\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(a)(iii).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1243-1244, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 3), p. 635 lines 15-18 and p. 675 lines 6-17.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1245.\n\n**iii. Respondent's Allegation That TCCP Failed to Adequately Address the Security Risks of the Pipeline**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nWith regard to the third additional reason, *i.e*., that TCCP failed to adequately address the security risks associated with transporting the concentrate via pipeline to the Port of Gwadar, the Tribunal referred to Mr. Livesey's testimony on the issue as well as the fact that \"*the Feasibility Study contained separate sections on both security and risk, which identified certain issues and set out the strategies to address them*.\"79 The Tribunal took note of the fact that \"*it is also stated in the chapter on asset evaluation that certain* 'residual risks,' *including security risks, were identified the value of which was not included in the economic evaluation of the project*,\" but the Tribunal did \"*not agree with Respondent that TCCP therefore failed to adequately address security risks.*\"80 It held:\n\n\"*The same section cited by Respondent states that such risks* 'will require further mitigation attention during the subsequent stages.' *In the Tribunal's view, it is plausible that not all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy evolves over time and the further development of the project. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume a failure on the part of TCCP to adequately address security risks in the Feasibility Study*.\"81\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-132** and **RE-134**.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-133**, p. 28-30.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that, as emphasized by Mr. Livesey, \"*at no point until the rejection of the Mining Lease Application did the GOB raise any concerns and that, in fact, the pipeline was not even mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject. He concluded that* 'I don't see why this is all of a sudden become a significant issue.'\"82 The Tribunal added:\n\n\"[T]*he GOB had known about the option to transport the concentrate by means of a slurry pipeline since December 2007 when Claimant presented the transport options as part of its Mineral Agreement Proposals to the Governments in Dubai. While the GOB did express its interest in having built a road to Gwadar in order to improve the infrastructure of the region, there is no indication in the record that it ever raised any security concerns with regard to the pipeline option. Respondent's witness Mr. Yaqoob confirmed during the Hearing that* 'there was no official discussion with the Government of Balochistan on security issues' *and further that, to his knowledge, there was also no internal discussion between the Licensing Authority and the GOB.*\n\n*Further taking into account the fact that the pipeline as such, let alone the allegedly ignored security risks, were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that this additional reason invoked by Respondent in this arbitration played any role in the decision-making process of the Licensing Authority at the relevant time*.\"83\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1254, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1281 line 16 to p. 1282 line 13.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1255-1256, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-219**, pp. 41, 46 *and quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 7), p. 1925 lines 5-12.\n\n**iv. Respondent's Allegation That TCCP Failed to Fully Assess the Water Source for its Project**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turned to the fourth additional reason invoked by Respondent, *i.e*., that TCCP failed to assess the water source that it intended to use for its project to full feasibility level. Based on the evidence in the record, it appeared to the Tribunal that, \"*as far as the Pakistani side of the acquifer is concerned, it is undisputed that Claimant did make a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for the project, i.e., the Baghicha Bore Field*.\"84 The Tribunal further relied on Mr. Livesey's witness testimony regarding the flow of water from Pakistan into Afghanistan as well as the fact that Claimant maintained licenses to the other areas with potential water sources and also noted that the GOB had chosen the same water source for its own mining project.85 It concluded:\n\n\"*Based on this record, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant did in fact make an adequate assessment of the groundwater source it intended to use for its project so that Respondent's fourth additional reason also does not present a justifiable basis for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application*.\"86\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1257-1258, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-410**, pp. 1-1 to 1-2.\n\n*Cf*.

Conclusion on Respondent's Breach of Article 3(2) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nIn its overall conclusion on its assessment of whether Respondent breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal summarized its findings as follows:\n\n\"*In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration justified the Licensing Authority's decision to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal is convinced that the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this motive. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent had created legitimate expectations on Claimant's part that it would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease 'subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements.' Given that Claimant in fact fulfilled all of the requirements under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules in its Mining Lease Application, Respondent's denial, motivated by its desire to mine the area on its own, violated Claimant's legitimate expectations and thereby breached the FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty*.\"87\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1264.\n\n154.\n\nAs a result of this finding, the Tribunal did not have to express an opinion as to whether the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations amounted to a breach of the FET standard.88\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1265.\n\n**b. Respondent Has Breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal found that Respondent has carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal first noted that there had been no direct taking of Claimant's 75% interest in the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 29 July 1993 (\"**CHEJVA**\") and the unincorporated contractual joint venture established under the CHEJVA (\"**Joint Venture**\") or its 100% interest in TCCP and thus no direct expropriation.89 However, the Tribunal held:\n\n\"[T]*he sole purpose of the Joint Venture under the CHEJVA and, likewise, of TCCP was to carry out the exploration and eventual mining operations at Reko Diq. After Claimant had spent more than US$ 240 million on its exploration work and had completed its Feasibility Study on the Initial Mine Development of the area, TCCP filed an application for a mining lease, which would have allowed Claimant to amortize the expenditures it had incurred during the exploration period. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, however, the Licensing Authority rendered it impossible for Claimant to make use of the information and data it had collected and thereby also rendered Claimant's interest in both the CHEJVA and in TCCP useless. Without a mining lease, neither of them could any longer fulfill their exclusive purpose, after the exploration had been completed; thus, following the denial of TCCP's Application, the value of both the CHEJVA and TCCP was effectively neutralized*.\n\n*Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application was a measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation*.\"90\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1325.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1328-1329.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that the GOB's motivation, *i.e.*, to deny the Mining Lease Application because it had decided to implement its own project rather than to continue its collaboration with Claimant, also excluded the classification of the denial as a *bona fide* regulatory measure.91\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1329.\n\n158.\n\nIn terms of legality of the expropriatory measure, the Tribunal considered it common ground that the expropriation was not accompanied by the payment of \"*prompt, adequate and effective*\" compensation.92 Given the GOB's desire to implement its own project rather than to continue collaborating with Claimant, it further held:\n\n\"*Apart from the fact that this finding renders it questionable whether the expropriatory measure served a public purpose, the Tribunal in any event considers that the denial was discriminatory because it favored the GOB's local project over the project of a foreign company*.\"93\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1335.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1336.\n\n159.\n\nIt concluded that \"*Respondent has not complied with (at least) two out of four Treaty requirements and therefore breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty*.\"94\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1336.\n\n**c. Respondent Has Breached Article 3(3) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThird, the Tribunal found that Respondent has impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n161.\n\nIn addition to the conduct leading the Tribunal's finding on a breach of the FET standard, Claimant invoked several additional actions of Balochistan which, in its view, had also impaired its investment.95 The Tribunal did not consider it necessary to assess each of these actions by themselves but held:\n\n\"[I]*f considered together with the denial of the Mining Lease Application, Respondent's conduct clearly impaired, if not prevented altogether, the use of Claimant's investment. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Respondent prevented Claimant from making any use of its exploration work and of any possibility to amortize its expenditures \u2013 much less to realize the benefit of its investment. Given that both the Joint Venture in which Claimant had a 75% interest and Claimant's subsidiary TCCP were established for the sole purpose of carrying out the exploration and, ultimately, the mining operations at Reko Diq, Claimant's investment was rendered useless when the Mining Lease Application was denied*.\"96\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1364.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1365.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal held that several of the additional actions invoked by Claimant, *i.e*.: (i) Balochistan's change of position in the Supreme Court proceedings in early 2011; (ii) the GOB's decision to start denying administrative clearances for TCC's expatriate staff, three days after its own project had been approved and on the same day that the Mines & Mineral Development Department took over as the GOB's representative on the Operating Committee; (iii) Balochistan's use of Claimant's exploration data for its own project; and (iv) the decision of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 \"*not to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP*,\"97 together with the Tribunal's impression from the record that no actual negotiations took place after this decision, supported its previous findings.98 It concluded:\n\n\"[A]*s confirmed by the above mentioned actions, the denial of the Mining Lease Application impaired the use of Claimant's investment. The Tribunal is further convinced that Respondent's measures were motivated by the desire to implement its own project \u2013 without having a justified ground for denying the Mining Lease Application. Therefore, the measures were also* 'arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory' *and thus fulfill even the stricter standard of protection that has been advanced by Respondent*.\"99\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1367-1371.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1372.\n\n**d. Final Remark on Causation**\n--------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nAs a final remark on Respondent's argument on causation, the Tribunal held:\n\n\"*While the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument that Claimant's claim must fail in limine because it has failed to address causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that Respondent's conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings. In the Tribunal's view, any specific questions on whether Respondent's conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant's \u2013 yet unquantified \u2013 claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed as part of the quantum phase of the proceedings*.\"100\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1374.\n\n**2. Findings Made in the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that in the course of this last phase of the proceedings, *i.e*., on 6 November 2017, Respondent filed a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Specifically, Respondent argued that it had recently discovered evidence that, in its view, undermined Claimant's claims regarding the results of the drilling for water and the metallurgical drilling. It requested that the Tribunal reconsider its (Draft) Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and find that there was \"*insufficient water and significant uncertainties regarding mineral recoverabilities that prohibit any award finding that TCCA should have received a mining lease*.\"101\n\nRespondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 41.\n\n165.\n\nIn its Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, the Tribunal found that it had the power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within a certain scope and limits, in particular taking guidance from the requirements of Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.102 On that basis, the decisive question for the Tribunal to determine was whether the allegedly newly discovered facts presented by Respondent were \"*of such a nature as decisively to affect the pre-award decision*.\"103\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 79.\n\n166.\n\nIn its Reconsideration Request, Respondent argued that certain findings made by the Tribunal in the context of the ground invoked by the Licensing Authority that TCCP failed to submit a proper/complete Feasibility Study on the discovered deposits in the Exploration Area (referred to as the third set of grounds) as well as in the context of the additional grounds invoked by Respondent in these proceedings, *i.e*., that TCCP failed to prove that the mine could be profitably developed and operated, and that TCCP failed to assess the water source that it intended to use for its project to full feasibility level.104 Respondent presented two sets of allegedly new facts: (i) the results of studies performed by Claimant's water consultant SMEC, which, according to Respondent and its experts Mr. Holmes and Dr. Nanni, do not support the conclusion drawn by Claimant in the Feasibility Study regarding the size of the Fan Sediments aquifer and the amount of water available; and (ii) the metallurgical sampling and testing performed by Claimant's consultant Ammtec, which, according to Respondent and its experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen, was done improperly and yielded compromised results.105\n\nCf. Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 86-87.\n\nRespondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed both sets of allegedly new facts.\n\n**a. Respondent's Allegation That the Results of the Drilling for Water Merit Reconsideration**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal first assessed Respondent's allegation that the results of the drilling for water merit reconsideration because it had allegedly identified an error in the Feasibility Study regarding the storage coefficient of the water source chosen by Claimant. It held that, even if this allegation were to be proven through further written submissions on the merits, it could not have a decisive, or outcome-determinative, impact on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.106 The Tribunal noted:\n\n\"*Respondent does not allege that the alleged error it has identified in the Feasibility Study was known to the Licensing Authority at the time it rejected TCCP's Mining Lease Application and/or that it formed part of either of the ten grounds invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject. It rather argues that* '[r]egardless of the text of the reasons to deny the mining lease application, a fatally flawed IMD FS cannot create a mining lease application.'\"107\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, 96.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 95, *quoting from* Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 29.\n\n169.\n\nRecalling its finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that \"*Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject*,\" the Tribunal concluded that \"*a potential error in the Feasibility Study that was not known to the Licensing Authority in November 2011 cannot decisively affect the Tribunal's conclusion that the denial of the Mining Lease Application was not justified by any of the reasons that the Licensing Authority invoked and that* 'the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this motive.'\"108\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 96, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1232 and 1264.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal then emphasized the following:\n\n\"[C]*ontrary to what Respondent's submission appears to suggest, it did not make a finding that the Feasibility Study was complete and/or that all assumptions and conclusions presented in the Study were fully accurate. What the Tribunal did find was that none of the reasons invoked by the Licensing Authority and, albeit it would not have been strictly necessary for its liability finding, none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in the liability phase, justified a denial of the Mining Lease Application. The question whether the assumptions made in the Feasibility Study were adequate and realistic will become relevant in the present quantum phase for the purposes of assessing the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled as a result of Respondent's Treaty breach. However, the error alleged by Respondent, even if true, will not affect the Tribunal's finding that there was such a Treaty breach, i.e., that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority at the time served only as a pretext to conceal the GOB's real motive to take over Reko Diq and develop its own project instead of collaborating with Claimant*.\"109\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 97.\n\n171.\n\nAs to the alleged errors identified by Respondent, the Tribunal noted that neither Party had presented any opinions from independent experts in the liability phase and that \"[a]*s Respondent's reference to its experts Mr. Holmes and* [Dr.] *Nanni shows, it was apparently only through their review of the relevant data that the alleged errors were detected. Consequently, the Tribunal will assess the arguments presented by Respondent with regard to the water issue in its analysis on quantum once the Parties have completed their written submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact and expert witnesses during the hearing on quantum on this issue*.\"110\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 99.\n\n**b. Respondent's Allegation That the Results of the Metallurgical Drilling Merit Reconsideration**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed Respondent's allegation that the results of the metallurgical drilling merits reconsideration because Claimant allegedly failed to adequately sample rock from below 450 meters in depth and because the testing was allegedly done improperly and yielded poor recoverability results. Similarly to its analysis of the first allegation, the Tribunal again noted that \"*Respondent does not argue that the alleged absence of proper metallurgy sampling and testing was known to the Licensing Authority at the time it rejected the Mining Lease Application. As a result, the Tribunal's finding that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on any additional reasons in this arbitration in order to avoid liability under the Treaty applies with equal force*.\"111\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 101.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal further did not agree that Respondent's allegation regarding metallurgical sampling and testing affected its findings on liability. It emphasized that it had not yet made any findings on metallurgical sampling or testing and/or whether the assumptions made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were realistic and reflected the true value of the Reko Diq project at the time.112 It concluded:\n\n\"*Similarly to the water issue, neither of the Parties presented any opinions from independent experts on metallurgy in the liability phase as they have now done in the quantum phase. Respondent again primarily refers to the testimony of its experts, in this case Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen, who reviewed the relevant data and detected the alleged errors. Once the Parties have completed their written submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact and expert witnesses during the hearing on quantum, the Tribunal will make a finding on this issue if and to the extent it becomes relevant to determine the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled as aresult of Respondent's Treaty breach that the Tribunal has determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability*.\"113\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 104.\n\n**c. Final Remark on the Scope of Its Decision**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAs a final remark, the Tribunal emphasized:\n\n\"[I]*n line with the scope of the present decision, its findings on the alleged facts presented by Respondent are limited to the relevance, or rather the lack of relevance, of these alleged facts to the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction and liability. The present decision is therefore without prejudice to any future findings that the Tribunal may make in relation to the issues raised by Respondent in the course of the quantum phase of this arbitration for the purposes of determining the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled as a result of Respondent's breach of the Treaty*.\"114\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 107.\n\n**3. Remarks on the Development of Respondent's Position Regarding the Feasibility of Claimant's Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAs a further preliminary point to be made regarding Respondent's allegation that the risks and issues to which it has pointed in this last phase of the proceedings render the project unfeasible, the Tribunal notes that this allegation stands in rather stark contrast to the position its officers expressed during the time period in which the GOB was still collaborating with Claimant on the project and the position taken by Respondent and the evidence on which it relied at the beginning of this arbitration.\n\n176.\n\nIn fact, Respondent stated in its submissions on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, which concerned the Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project initiated by the GOB, that \"*Claimant is right to categorise the RekoDiq deposits as of huge economic importance*\"115 and that \"*Claimant's conduct can be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to conceal the extent of the mineral deposits in the Reko Diq Mining Area*.\"116 According to Respondent, \"*Claimant was actively downplaying its economics before the Governments*\" when referring to the project being \"*relatively skinny in economic terms, pointing out the estimated 13% IRR, too low for any Pakistani business house to invest in the project*.\"117\n\nRespondent's Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 119.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 37.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 37, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-84**.\n\n177.\n\nIn these submissions, Respondent placed particular reliance on the first witness statement from Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, who served as member (Science & Technology) of the Planning Commission and prepared, *inter alia*, a technical feasibility of the GOB's Reko Diq project in the Planning Commission.118 Dr. Mubarakmand stated that he had received a copy of the Feasibility Study before he had to make a statement before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.119 During the Hearing on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, he confirmed that he \"*looked at all the relevant parts in detail*\" and that he \"*had a good look at*\" the Feasibility Study before making that statement.120\n\nMubarakmand I, \u00b6 3 and Annex 5, \u00b6 5.\n\nMubarakmand I, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 and Annex 5.\n\nTranscript Hearing 6 November 2012, p. 102 lines 21-24.\n\n178.\n\nIn his statement before the Supreme Court, Dr. Mubarakmand noted that the value of the deposit H-15 which Claimant planned to develop was reported in the Feasibility Study to be USD 104 billion and added that most of the copper was in other deposits such as H-14, H-13, H-8 and H-27, which he referred to \"*huge deposits of high concentration Copper Ore*.\" In his view, it was \"*likely that the real deposits in EL-5 area are much more than the value of $104 billion as indicated by TCC's Feasibility Study*.\" As for gold, Dr. Mubarakmand similarly stated that \"[h]*ere again the total deposits of Gold in EL-5 have not been revealed in TCC's Feasibility Study*.\"121\n\nMubarakmand I, Annex 5, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.\n\n179.\n\nDr. Mubarakmand then referred to the GOB's own Reko Diq project, which was intended to start with process 15,000 tons per day \"*but as the mine grows wider and deeper with time, more ore is expected per day and therefore every 5-6 years the size of the plant is enhanced*.\" Assuming a processing of 110,000 tons of ore per day, for comparison with Claimant's project, Dr. Mubarakmand estimated a profit of USD 2,354 million per year or a total of USD 131,824 billion over the life of the mine.122 According to Dr. Mubarakman, \"*the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice berg in the EL-5 area*.\"123\n\nMubarakmand I, Annex 5, \u00b6 10.\n\nMubarakmand I, Annex 5, \u00b6 17.\n\n180.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Dr. Mubarakmand confirmed his opinion that \"*the value of the gold and copper in the exploration area was vastly greater than the value in area H-15*.\"124 He further explained that he decided to develop the GOB's project on H-4, *inter alia*, because \"*at the outset H-4 was a better place to mine for technical reasons. H-14 and H-15 have an overburden of 140 metres of rock, which means that rock to this depth has to be removed before mining of the copper mineral can begin. The overburden of H-4 on the other hand is 40 metres, which means it is easier to get to the copper mineral underneath. Further, the mineral at H-14 and H-15 is copper sulphide ore, whereas the mineral at H-4 is copper oxide ore. The refining process for copper sulphide ore takes longer and is more expensive than the refining process for copper oxide ore, which is simpler and less energy intensive*.\"125\n\nMubarakmand I, \u00b6 15.\n\nMubarakmand I, \u00b6 17.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Dr. Mubarakmand did not express any doubts, neither in his statement before the Supreme Court nor in his witness testimony before this Tribunal, that the project envisaged by Claimant was technically and economically feasible. To the contrary, he believed that a mining project at Reko Diq could be commercially much more attractive than reported by Claimant. During the Hearing on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, Dr. Mubarakmand affirmed that it was his testimony that the Feasibility Study was part of a \"*ruse in order to defraud the Government of Balochistan from the real extent of minerals that TCC had presented on its website in 2006*.\"126 Respondent also alleged that Claimant was \"*conceal*[ing] *the extent of the mineral deposits in the Reko Diq Mining Area*\" and \"*actively downplaying its economics before the Governments.*\"127\n\nTranscript Hearing 6 November 2012, p. 120 lines 13-23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 37.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that while Respondent now points to numerous allegedly critical issues that rendered the project unfeasible, neither of these issues was raised by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject. Based on the record of these proceedings, the Tribunal is also not aware that any other agency or official of the GOB or the GOP raised these issues during the time period in which the joint venture partners were still collaborating or even when the GOB had decided to to take over the project and deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application in violation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, it was only during these arbitration proceedings that Respondent started to invoke additional grounds such as an alleged failure to establish the profitability of the planned mine and the ability to obtain financing, security risks regarding the pipeline, and a failure to fully assess the water source.\n\n183.\n\nIn this last phase of the proceedings, Respondent has further raised the argument that Claimant's shareholders, Antofagasta and Barrick, \"*did not have the relevant experience, track record, and personnel to make the project successful*\" and that their participation on this project would therefore have been \"*more of a liability than benefit*.\"128\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 6.\n\n184.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the GOB itself stated in its submission to the Balochistan High Court in 2007 that \"*Antofagasta of Chile, one of the largest copper producers in the world and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada, the number one gold producer in the world*\" purchased Claimant's shares in 2006 and that \"[b]*oth the Federal and Provincial Governments have appreciated and welcomed two big giants from mining industry in Pakistan*.\"129 The GOB further stated:\n\n\"*It is specifically denied that any company has been associated with the project with* 'zero mining experience and zero financial standing'. *It is submitted that the worlds largest copper and gold mining companies have been brought forward to fund the project which is excellent news and will expedite exploration and extraction enabling the Province of Balochistan to make windfall profits*.\"130\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, p. 4.\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, p. 14.\n\n185.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Balochistan's Chief Secretary dated 31 December 2009, the Secretary of the Mines & Mineral Development Department commented that \"[m]*ining is one of the most difficult activities to be carried out requiring huge amount of investment, rich expertise and skills, and very careful planning and proper management to make it a success*.\" He further commented that TCCP had \"*done tremendous efforts in discovering and explring the Reko-Diq Copper & Gold prospects*\" and that \"[t]*he way of working and performance reflect that their attitude is serious and they are committed to develop the project. They appear professional businessmen with the required will, resources and rich expertise in developing such kind of resources*.\"131\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 19.\n\n186.\n\nAgainst this background, it strongly appears to the Tribunal that Respondent's allegation that Barrick and Antofagasta lacked the relevant experience to build and operate the mine at Reko Diq132 has been created *post-hoc* for these arbitration proceedings. While Respondent may have correctly pointed out that Antofagasta had never operated a mine outside of Chile and that Barrick was not operating copper mines itself as of 2006,133 it is apparent that both companies decided in 2006 to become 50% (indirect) shareholders in TCCA and to combine their respective experience in the mining sector. Whereas Antofagasta brought experience in building and operating copper mines, Barrick contributed experience in operating gold mines in several countries with difficult conditions across the globe. Accordingly, contemporaneous statements of the GOB clearly indicate that the participation of Antofagasta and Barrick was considered a significant benefit to the project.\n\n*Cf.* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 29.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal further cannot follow Respondent's criticism that Mr. Livesey, who was leading the preparation of the Feasibility Study, had not managed a feasibility study before. Mr. Livesey explained that before he became Project Director in late 2006, he had worked in the Tethyan belt for four years and before that on the Zambian copper belt for two years and on polymetallic nickel-copper belts in South Africa.134 In addition, Mr. Livesey testified that his team consisted not only of Tethyan staff who were seconded or recruited into Tethyan but \"*for each main discipline* [had] *oversight from both owners, Barrick and Antofagasta*.\" He further explained that he reported to a technical committee which consisted of representatives from both Barrick and Antofagasta with the chairmanship alternating between the two.135\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 344 lines 11-20.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 346 line 16 to p. 347 line 14.\n\n188.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal will certainly not brush off any of the concerns and issues raised by Respondent but will nevertheless assess each of them in detail and determine whether they have an impact on the feasibility of the project and/or the value of Claimant's investment. However, the Tribunal considers that it must also be taken into account in this assessment that neither of these issues was raised by the Governments at the time and that it therefore cannot help the impression that some of these allegedly critical issues were invoked only as a defense in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n**B. Legal Standards Governing Claimant's Claim for Compensation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal will now determine the relevant legal standards governing Claimant's claim for compensation. As pointed out by Claimant,136 the Parties are in disagreement on four issues, which the Tribunal will address in turn: (i) the applicable standard of compensation; (ii) the requirement of causation between Respondent's Treaty breaches and the damages alleged by Claimant; (iii) the standard and burden of proof that apply to ascertaining the feasibility of the project and the value of Claimant's investment; and (iv) the appropriate valuation method to determine the value of Claimant's investment and the corresponding compensation to which Claimant is entitled. In the context of (iv), the Tribunal will address the different valuation methods used by the Parties' valuation experts and determine whether Claimant has established, in principle, that it is appropriate to determine the damages it has incurred based on the valuation method relied on by its valuation expert, Prof. Davis.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 12 *et seq*.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nClaimant submits that there is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal must award compensation equal to the \"*market value*\" of Claimant's investment as of 15 November 2011 and that in assessing that value, it must disregard all of the unlawful acts that Respondent has committed prior to that valuation date.137\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 35.\n\n191.\n\nClaimant argues that the Australia-Pakistan BIT does not specify the remedies for Respondent's breaches of the Treaty. In Claimant's view, the Tribunal must therefore apply the standard of full reparation under customary international law, as established in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* : the award \"*must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that acted had not been committed*.\"138\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 37, *quoting from* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland),* 1928 PCIJ, Series A, No. 17 (Merits), Judgment No. 13 of 13 September 1928 [CA-80], \u00b6 125.\n\n192.\n\nClaimant submits that the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard is widely understood as the prevailing compensation standard for breaches of international law and is also reflected in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Articles**\"), which impose an obligation on States to \"*make full reparation*\" for injuries caused by internationally wrongful acts.139\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 16, *quoting from* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B.

A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2) [CA-1], Art. 31(2).\n\n193.\n\nIn Claimant's view, this standard is particularly appropriate in this case as Respondent rejected Claimant's initial request for specific performance and thereby rendered restitution in kind impossible. Claimant contends that the Tribunal must therefore award \"*a sum corresponding to the value which* [such] *restitution in kind would bear.*\"140\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 13, *quoting from* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, 1928 PCIJ, Series A, No. 17 (Merits), Judgment No. 13 of 13 September 1928 [CA-80], \u00b6 125.\n\n194.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's argument that the Tribunal should apply what Claimant refers to as \"*the compensation condition*\" in Article 7 of the Treaty. According to Claimant, \"*the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation*\" is only one of the \"*conditions*\" for a lawful expropriation and the second and third paragraphs of Article 7 specify how that compensation is to be \"*computed*\" and \"*paid*\" but neither of these provisions intends to specify remedies for Respondent's breaches of Articles 3 and 7.141 Claimant specifically rejects the argument that as Article 7 also refers to indirect expropriations which, according to Respondent, would always be unlawful, it must also apply to unlawful expropriations. It maintains that Article 7 only determines liability; it does not determine what damages are due for the breach.142\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 39; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 15. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 40.\n\n195.\n\nClaimant further notes that any \"*standard*\" in Article 7 would concern only expropriations but could not be applied to determine the remedies for Respondent's breaches of Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of the Treaty.143 Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela*, which held:\n\n\"[T]*he Article VII(1)* 'standard' *is only concerned with expropriation, and not breaches of other BIT standards. Because the Tribunal has found breaches of FET (in addition to an expropriation), the Tribunal considers that the* 'full reparation' *principle under customary international law must be applied as a consequence of its decision on liability. In other words, given the cumulative nature of the breaches that the Tribunal must compensate, and especially in view of its findings on FET that the Respondent's conduct caused all the investments made by Crystallex to become worthless, the Tribunal will apply the full reparation standard according to customary international law*.\"144\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 41.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 876.\n\n196.\n\nClaimant rejects the argument that there is a consistent practice that tribunals would calculate damages for Treaty breaches under the standard of compensation set out in the expropriation provision and claims that \"*the overwhelming weight of authority*\" rather confirms that the customary international law standard of full reparation applies and none of the cases cited by Respondent actually supports its argument. In Claimant's view, this is also confirmed by Respondent's legal expert Dr. Ripinsky, who states in his treatise that \"[a]*n award of compensation for unlawful expropriation is governed by customary international law*.\"145\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, *quoting from Sergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams*, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) [CA-431], p. 88.\n\n197.\n\nIn any event, Claimant notes that even if Article 7 were to be applied to determine the remedies for Respondent's breaches, the first sentence of Article 7(2) provides for compensation equal to the \"*market value of the investment immediately prior to the expropriation*.\" According to Claimant, this sentence is consistent with the full reparation standard and, where neither the valuation date nor the use of the fair market value standard is in dispute, can be seen as satisfying the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard.146 Claimant adds: \"*Here too, payment of fair market value immediately before the expropriation would satisfy the Chorz\u00f3w Factory standard, so long as all consequences of Pakistan's other unlawful conduct before the expropriation date are also excluded from the valuation*.\"147\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\n198.\n\nClaimant notes that Respondent, however, relies on the second sentence of Article 7(2), which applies \"[w]*here that value cannot be readily ascertained*.\" Claimant argues that Respondent has failed to explain why that would be the case and the alternative compensation calculation in Article 7(2) should apply.148\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2); Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 16.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that even if Article 7(2) were to have any relevance, the standard of compensation for a lawful expropriation could only serve as a floor for any damages award for Respondent's willful breaches of the Treaty and it would not support Respondent's proposed alternative valuation methods.149\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 49.\n\n200.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that the Tribunal's determination of compensation \"*must be equitable*,\" proportionate and avoid disparity between the amount invested by Claimant and the compensation awarded, Claimant argues that awarding full reparation in the form of damages equal to the fair market value of Claimant's investment as of 15 November 2011 is also \"*the just result*\" of Respondent's Treaty breaches which have given Respondent \"*total control of the immensely valuable asset it took from TCCA*.\"150\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.\n\n201.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent overstates the role of equitable considerations which, according to Dr. Ripinsky, could \"*be applied only within the boundaries of judicial discretion left by legal rules*.\"151 In Claimant's view, such discretion is eliminated by the clear customary international law legal principle of full reparation, which \"*militates against under-compensation as well as against over-compensation*.\" Claimant emphasizes, however, that the Tribunal must take into account all relevant circumstances of the case and \"*exercise*[] *its judgment in a reasoned manner*,\" to \"*make the best estimate that it can of the amount of the loss*.\"152\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 55, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 56, *quoting from* *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

ARB/05/18 & ARB/07/15, Award of 3 March 2010 [CA-50], \u00b6 594.\n\n202.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that equitable considerations would in any event weigh in favor of TCCA because the compensation must account for the egregiousness of Respondent's breaches which included a secret plan to oust TCCA while repeatedly misrepresenting Respondent's intentions until the feasibility work was complete. Claimant adds that any uncertainty about the fair market value of its investment has been caused by Respondent's Treaty breaches.153\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 57-59.\n\n203.\n\nAs for Respondent's reliance on the principle of proportionality, Claimant argues that this principle is already incorporated in the principle of full reparation because, as noted in the commentary on the ILC Articles, \"[c]*ompensation is limited to damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is indirect or remote*.\"154 In addition, Claimant claims that awarding anything less than fair market value would unjustly enrich Respondent because it now has exclusive control over the asset that it took from TCCA and the fair market value of TCCA's investment represents only 44% of the total value of the resource as of the valuation date.155\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, *quoting from* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B.

To create a business, in addition to money, an investor usually contributes other ingredients such as management skills, know-how and technology, which add value of the investment and are of particular importance in areas such as energy, infrastructure or construction, frequently featuring in investor-State arbitrations. It is not abnormal for a business's FMV to exceed the invested amount several times over*.\"157\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64, *quoting from Sergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams*, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) [CA-431], pp. 229-230.\n\n*Sergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams*, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) [CA-431], pp. 230-231.\n\n205.\n\nClaimant also refers to Irmgard Marboe, who considers in her work on damages in investment law that \"[g]*reat care must \u2026 be taken not to link the amount of compensation or damages closely to the investment actually undertaken, if the investment has good future propsects*\" because the State could otherwise be motivated to expropriate or impair it.158\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 65, *quoting from Irmgard Marboe,* Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6 5,204.\n\n206.\n\nClaimant further notes that there is a correlation between the risk of the investment and the returns an investor would expect, arguing that \"*when a very risky investment succeeds, there* should *be an especially significant* 'disparity' *between the amount invested and the value of the investment.*\" Claimant submits that is precisely the business model of the global mining industry and notes that there is common ground between the Parties that only 1 in every 10,000 exploration projects results in a productive mine. According to Claimant, the Governments knew when they decided to take over the project that Reko Diq is that 1-in-10,000 discovery \u2013 knowledge that was established through the efforts of Claimant and its owners to de-risk every aspect of the project; accordingly, the fair market value must necessary constitute a very high multiple of the amount invested.159\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 66-68 (emphasis in original).\n\n**b. Requirement of Causation**\n-------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nClaimant accepts that it must show that Respondent's Treaty breaches caused its loss. It notes, however, that the Tribunal has already found that Respondent's conduct in taking over Reko Diq \"*deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss*.\" In Claimant's view, the causal relationship has thereby been determined and all that remains is for that loss to be quantified.160\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 34; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1374.\n\n208.\n\nIn particular, Claimant contends that Respondent cannot rely on the absence of a Mineral Agreement because the Tribunal has already found that the Governments abandoned the negotiations in bad faith pursuant to Balochistan's unlawful decision to take over the project. Similarly, Claimant considers that Respondent cannot benefit from the absence of third-party financing commitments or specific permits, which could not have been pursued without the mining lease that Balochistan unlawfully denied.161\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 18.\n\n209.\n\nMore generally, Claimant submits that the Tribunal must establish fair market value in a hypothetical context where Respondent would have fully respected its obligations under the Treaty and must correct for any negative effect that the conduct of the Governments has had on the value of Claimant's investment. Claimant claims that its damages may also not be reduced by the risk of future Treaty violations against which the Treaty is meant to protect.162\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 23-27.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant concludes:\n\n\"*Thus, the Tribunal must assume that Balochistan would have honored (instead of repudiated) all of its obligations under the CHEJVA, including the obligation to be* 'just and faithful' *to TCC and* 'not do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture... are prejudiced.' *The Tribunal must also assume that both Governments would have acted consistently with TCCA's legitimate expectation\u2014 arising directly from the Governments' own representations\u2014that the Governments would support and facilitate TCCA's investment*.\"163\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 29, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1**, Article 24.6.2.\n\n**c. Standard and Burden of Proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nClaimant accepts that it has the burden of proof as to its loss.164\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 69.\n\n212.\n\nAs to the standard of proof, Claimant submits that once it has been shown that a loss has been incurred, damages should be awarded even if the specific amount cannot be assessed with certainty. Claimant quotes from the *Crystallex* tribunal, which held that \"*once the fact of future profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the amount of such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty*.\"165\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 30, *quoting from* *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 875.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant contends that while the fact of the loss is subject to the normal balance-of-probabilities standard, the quantum of the loss can be proven by providing a \"*reasonable basis*\" for the tribunal's assessment.166 On the basis of the record before it, the Tribunal must then \"*make the best estimate that it can of the amount of the loss.*\"167 Quoting from the tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico*, Claimant argues that it \"*would be wrong in principle*\" to deprive it of the value of its investment on \"*lack of evidentiary grounds when that lack of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent's own wrongs*.\"168\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 69, *quoting from* *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 876; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 19, *quoting from Kardassopoulos & Fuchs v.

United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3, Award of 16 June 2010 [CA-104], \u00b6 13-99.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the \"*absolute certainty*\" standard advanced by Respondent is not supported by any case and could never be satisfied.169 Claimant submits that the authorities on which Respondent relies in support of its alleged \"*heightened requirement*\" for proof of damages support only \"*the undisputed proposition that a* 'possibility of damages' *is not enough to establish the fact of the loss, and the tautological proposition that what is sufficient is* 'a sufficiently certain damages case.'\"170\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 70, *quoting from* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 67-69.\n\n215.\n\nClaimant maintains that not only is there no heightened standard of proof but, to the contrary, tribunals have repeatedly held that \"*less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages*.\" In light of the Tribunal's findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimant argues that there can be no doubt that it has suffered a loss and therefore considers it sufficient to provide a reasonable basis to quantify that loss.171 In Claimant's view, the fact of the loss is in any event incontestable as Respondent itself called Claimant's investment \"*a profitable project or national importance*\" and estimated that the Reko Diq deposits were worth more than a hundred billion US dollars.172\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 71, *quoting from* *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award of 28 March 2011 [RLA-82], \u00b6 246.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 32, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-212** and *referring to* **Exhibit CE-111**.\n\n**d. Appropriate Valuation Method**\n-----------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nClaimant submits that the amount of its loss should be quantified based on the DCF valuation method, more specifically the \"*practical, industry-informed application of well-established principles*\" used in the modern DCF model applied by its expert Prof. Davis which it considers to be \"*the best method to value a development-stage mining project like Reko Diq*.\"173\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 21.\n\n217.\n\nClaimant contends that the DCF method is employed by tribunals \"*whenever the claimant has established the fact of future profitability*.\" According to Claimant, the DCF approach is appropriate in the present case for the following reasons: (i) it would have been used by actual buyers and sellers if Reko Diq had been sold in November 2011; (ii) it is endorsed by internationally-recognized standards in the mining industry such as the standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) and the VALMIN Committee established to provide standards for mineral property valuation in Australia; (iii) TCCA has provided ample evidence for the DCF inputs in this arbitration, including the Feasibility Study which proved \"*decades of profitability even under unfavorable market conditions*\" and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which proved Reko Diq's enormous reserves; and (iv) recent ICSID cases featuring similar facts affirmed the suitability of income-based methodologies for valuing projects like Reko Diq.174 In this regard, Claimant points out, *inter alia*, that the tribunal in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* concluded that \"*a DCF method can be reliably used in the instant case because of the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining cash flow analysis previously performed*\" and that the *Crystallex* tribunal concluded that \"*predicting future income from ascertained* [gold] *reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining techniques could be done with a significant degree of certainty, even without a record of past production*.\"175\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 101-111.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 112-121, *quoting from* *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 [CA-177], \u00b6 830, *and* *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 877-880.\n\n218.\n\nClaimant maintains that the tribunals' findings in *Crystallex* and *Gold Reserve*, as well as in *Rusoro v. Venezuela* and even *Khan v. Mongolia* support the application of the DCF method in this case.176 Claimant argues that contrary to Respondent's submission, the respondent State in *Gold Reserve* did raise the argument that the investment was not yet operational but did not succeed on this argument and that the tribunal specifically rejected alternative valuation methods by the claimant's experts, preferring \"*to use the DCF model only*.\"177 Claimant further contends that the *Crystallex* tribunal endorsed forward-looking methodologies and while the claimaint did not advance a DCF valuation, applied another income-based approach which as Dr. Ripinsky agreed \"*resembles*\" DCF.178 As for the *Khan* tribunal's rejection of the DCF method, Claimant argues that it was based on the uncertainties associated with projects run by junior companies and explicitly held to be incomparable to \"*large, producing multi-project comanpies*.\"179 Finally, Claimant notes that in *Copper Mesa*, the claimant itself cited the CIMVal standards \"*to note that income-based approaches are not suitable for properties at an exploration stage*\" and was facing violent local opposition.180 According to Claimant, the latter also applied to the project in *Bear Creek* where the tribunal concluded that the project could not \"*be considered to be viable*\" in the short term due to \"*widespread social unrest*.\"181\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 83, *quoting from* *Crystallex International Corporation v.

It rejects what it refers to as Respondent's \"*bright-line rule*\" that non-operational ventures cannot be valued using a DCF method.182 Claimant quotes from the *Crystallex* tribunal which held that \"*there is no one methodology best suited for determining the fair market value of the investment lost in every situation*\" and that \"*whether a particular method is appropriate to utilize is based on the circumstances of each individual case*.\"183\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 91; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 75, *quoting from* *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 886.\n\n220.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent's \"*bright-line rule*\" is not supported by any of the authorities it cites and not even by its own legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who merely states that a record of profitability is \"*treated \u2026 as the best evidence to support the application of the DCF method*\" and quotes the *Vivendi* tribunal for the proposition that \"*the absence of a history of demonstrated profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF valuation methodology.*\"184 Claimant also refers to Dr. Ripinsky's treatise in which he states:\n\n\"*Consider a situation where an investor obtains a concession for the exploration and exploitation of oil: the investor will carry a risk of not discovering oil and thus losing the totality of its investment. At the same time, once the exploration campaign proves successful, the major risk of the investment is gone, and one should be able to predict with reasonable certainty the range of revenues that the concession will generate, even without a prior record of profitable operations. Perhaps with such situations in mind, it has been suggested that lost profits should be awarded where they can be proven with reasonable certainty and calculated on a* 'rational basis,' *even if the claimant is a new business \u2026 This argument makes sense; however, it remains for a tribunal in each particular case to decide whether the evidence on the record is sufficient*.\"185\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 50.\n\n*Sergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams*, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) [CA-431], pp. 283-284.\n\n221.\n\nClaimant claims that DCF valuation is particularly suited to value development-stage mining projects. Claimant considers that this is confirmed by Respondent's valuation experts who in its view support a forward-looking analysis of the project's future profitability and by Dr. Ripinsky who notes in his expert report that \"*in some respects, the mining sector may be more amenable to application of the DCF methods*.\"186 Claimant also refers to its own expert Prof. Davis who explains that \"*compared with valuing assets in other sectors*,\" in the mining industry, \"*many aspects of the projected cash flows are readily known*\" or ascertainable.187\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1439**, p. 4, *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

It refers to Dr. Ripinsky who states that awarding sunk costs is \"*generally considered to be a conceptually weak method of estimating the fair market value of start-up projects (as opposed to acquisitions of existing, operational enterprises)*\" and puts the investor in the position as if the investment had never occurred \u2013 rather than the position as if the breaches had not occurred as required by the principle of full reparation. Quoting from Dr. Ripinsky, Claimant argues that the costs approach \"*generally does not meet the legal requirement to make the award equivalent to the investment's fair market value*.\"188 In Claimant's view, the same applies to the valuation method applied by Dr. Burrows because it is also a backword-looking method and has in any event not been correctly applied.189\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 87 *and Sergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams*, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) [CA-431], p. 231. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 128.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 94.\n\n223.\n\nFinally, Claimant rejects the argument that Prof. Davis' \"*modern DCF*\" model has never been applied in investment arbitration, emphasizing that it is \"*simply a form of the widely adopted DCF method*\" and properly reflects economic reality in this case.190 According to Claimant, it is in fact the only method capable of accurately valuing a project like Reko Diq.191\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 73; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 122.\n\n224.\n\nClaimant submits that \"[t]*he modern DCF method more accurately discounts future cash flows for both systematic and asymmetric risks, incorporates market information, and incorporates management's flexibility to choose different options in reponse to evolving circumstances*\" which makes it \"*particularly well-suited for the valuation of a long-life mine like Reko Diq*.\"192 Claimant adds that the modern DCF approach has been observed to be \"*particularly useful for valuing mines and other natural resources assets because of the volatility of natural resources prices and the existence of well-developed forward markets that provide reliable market information about risk-adjusted price expectations*.\"193\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 130.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 132.\n\n225.\n\nClaimant further submits that by contrast to treating risk as a constant, annually compounding factor as is done in the traditional DCF model, modern DCF can take into account that \"*the risk associated with late-stage cash flows is more or less constant over time for copper and gold mines*.\" In addition, Claimant argues that modern DCF can separately account for the two types of risk, *i.e*.: (i) systematic risks which are addressed by using risk-adjusted price projections of future prices from markets in forward contracts; and (ii) asymmetric risks for which modern DCF makes individual appropriate adjustments to account for the average effect of each risk on cost and production quantities. As risks are thereby priced at source, the cash flows can then be discounted at the risk-free rate.194\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 134-138.\n\n226.\n\nClaimant submits that the modern DCF method further uses simulation of a large number of scenarios in order to account for the uncertainty regarding, *e.g.,* the fluctutation of copper prices in the future, and permit the incorporation of active management such as the choice whether to expand the mine depending on the development of prices. Claimant refers to its witness Mr. Luksic who explained that the flexibility to adapt productivity to price cycles \"*is immensely valuable*.\"195 Claimant further notes that while the traditional DCF method gives relatively little value to expected cash flows after the first two decades of mine life, Mr. Luksic explained that \"*this flexibility is what makes long-life mines so attractive: they help you manage the volatility of commodity prices. \u2026 Copper prices go through cycles of highs and lows and when you have a long life of mine you can ride those cycles in a way that maximizes value*.\"196\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-147, *quoting from* Luksic II, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 148-149, *quoting from* Luksic II, \u00b6 15.\n\n227.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the modern DCF valuation method is rooted in \"*decades-old work of Nobel Prize-winning economists*\" and is \"*widely taught in business schools and routinely applied in the mining industry.*\" Therefore, even if this method were to be considered \"*new*\" to international arbitration, this would be due to an unsurprising lag of incorporating existing industry practice into arbitral adjudication. In Claimant's view, the same applied to the use of the DCF method in general, which was widely used in the industry before it became established in arbitration.197\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 95-98.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nRespondent accepts that \"*the proper measure of quantum is the market value of TCC on November 15, 2011*.\"198\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 28.\n\n229.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the only issue in dispute between the Parties in this regard is whether \"*market value*\" refers to the standard of compensation in the Treaty or the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard. According to Respondent, \"*market value*\" is captured by the compensation standard agreed by the parties to the Treaty.199 Respondent adds that there is a \"*growing trend*\" to apply the BIT compensation standard regarding expropriation to all Treaty breaches and refers to the tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador*, which found that the claimant's investment had not been accorded fair and equitable treatment and was expropriated and then determined \"*as mandated by Article III of the Treaty, the fair market value of this investment*.\"200 Respondent submits that the BIT standard for expropriation was also applied by the tribunals in *OIEG v. Venezuela*, *CME v. Czech Republic* and *Flughafen v. Venezuela*.201\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 64.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 65, *quoting from* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award of 5 October 2012 [RLA-337], \u00b6 792.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent argues that the compensation standard to be applied to the quantification of damages for all breaches in this case is therefore the standard set out in Article 7 of the Treaty, which applies to direct and indirect, and thus any form of, expropriation. Respondent further argues that if the category of unlawful expropriations existed, all indirect expropriation would fall within that category; as a result, Article 7 would also apply to any expropriations, including unlawful expropriations, and exclude the application of a *lex generalis* taken from customary international law.202\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 302. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49.\n\n231.\n\nRespondent further disagrees with Claimant's reference to *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* as reflecting customary international law and adds that, in any event, Claimant agrees that Article 7 of the Treaty is \"*consistent*\" with what it considers to the customary international law standard.203\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 46, *quoting from* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n232.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that the fair market value standard requires to identify \"*the cash-equivalent amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller to purchase the asset at the Valuation Date, both with reasonable knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the asset and neither being under any compulsion to transact*.\"204 In Respondent's view, this eliminates any use of \"*speculative, feeble or financially or technically unsound bases*\" to determine the fair market value of Claimant's investment.205\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 307, *quoting from* Davis I, \u00b6 5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 307.\n\n233.\n\nRespondent contends that the wording of Article 7(2) of the Treaty, which can be found in 17 of 23 BITs signed by Australia, is \"*not typical of international investment treaties*\" and should therefore be given special consideration by the Tribunal.206\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\n234.\n\nRespondent notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to assess whether the fair market value of Claimant's investment is \"*readily ascertainable*\" and considers that the valuation presented by Claimant \"*is as far as a method could be from rendering a* 'readily ascertainable' *result*.\"207 According to Respondent, Claimant has conceded as much when stating that \"*a claimant in TCCA's position has wrongfully been deprived of the opportunity to prove quantum with certainty*.\"208\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 71.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 77, *quoting from* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 71.\n\n235.\n\nRespondent rejects the argument that the uncertainty is a result of Pakistan's breaches of the Treaty and claims that it rather \"*derives from the infancy of TCCA's project in Pakistan coupled with the multiple hurdles that it faced going forward.*\" Respondent claims that, by contrast, in the *Gemplus* case relied on by Claimant, the lack of evidence was directly attributable to the respondent as the claimants were owning a concession agreement with an operational track record behind it. Respondent further argues that if Claimant's argument were followed, this would apply in all cases in which damages for an unlawful expropriation or other supposed breaches of the treaty are calculated based on the BIT compensation standard.209\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 73-76.\n\n236.\n\nConsequently, Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal must determine a value \"*in accordance with generally recognized principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, and other relevant factors*.\"210\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 49; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 78, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2).\n\n237.\n\nRespondent refers to the separate opinion of Judge Bhandari in *Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)* who considered that \"[i]*n a case such as this, in which the evidence presented to the Court is inadequate to precisely quantify the compensation to be awarded to an injured party, \u2026 the most appropriate decision is to award the injured State a lump sum amount of compensation based on equitable considerations*.\"211\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 79, *quoting from Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)*, Separate Opinion of Judge Bhandari of 2 February 2018 [RLA-399], \u00b6 11.\n\n238.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the only amount factually supported with \"*sufficient certainty*\" would be the sunk costs of Claimant's investment.212\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 80.\n\n**b. Requirement of Causation**\n-------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant bears the burden of proving that the damages it alleges are a direct consequence of the Treaty breaches and that, in order to establish causation, it must prove that: (i) the alleged injury was caused by the wrongful act as a matter of fact; and (ii) the loss is not too remote and speculative. Respondent refers to the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* according to which there must be a \"*sufficient link between the wrongful act and the damage in question*\" and there is \"*a threshold beyond which damage, albeit linked to the wrongful act, is considered too indirect or remote*.\"213\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 49, *quoting from* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award of 24 July 2008 [CA-43], \u00b6 785.\n\n240.\n\nRespondent submits that under customary international law, Claimant must show that its losses were caused by the Treaty breaches as a matter of fact. Respondent refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles as well as the *Gemplus* tribunal, which held that there must be \"*a sufficient causal link between the treaty breach by the state and the loss sustained by the claimant*.\"214 Respondent considers that Claimant has failed to establish factual causation and points in particular to the absence of a Mineral Agreement which left \"*key commercial terms*\" uncertain. Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal did not find that the non-conclusion of the Mineral Agreement constitutes a breach of the Treaty.215\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, *quoting from* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B. INT'L L. COMM'N (2001), VOL. II, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2) [CA-1], Art. 31 *and Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4, Award of 16 June 2010 [CA-104], \u00b6 11.8.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 54.\n\n241.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant must show that its losses were caused by the Treaty breaches as a matter of law. Respondent points to the *Biwater Gauff* tribunal, which held that there was a \"*lack of linkage between each of the wrongful acts of the Republic, and each of the actual, specific heads of loss and damage*\" and concluded that the damage was \"*attributable to other factors*.\"216 Quoting from the Commentary to the ILC Articles, Respondent submits that the test of legal causality is whether damages are directly linked to the breach and not \"*too indirect, remote and uncertained to be appraised*.\"217\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, *quoting from* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award of 24 July 2008 [CA-43], \u00b6 785.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, *quoting from* Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 53rd session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10, Chapter IV, Commentary to Article 31, \u00b6 10, U.N. Doc. A/56/10 (2001) [RLA-339].\n\n242.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant has failed to prove that Respondent directly caused the damages it is seeking and that its alleged losses are not too remote or speculative. Respondent considers that \"*the speculative nature of the damages forms one of the key conclusions*\" reached by its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells.218\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 51.\n\n243.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Tribunal's finding on the existence of a Treaty breach does not discharge Claimant's burden of proof on causation and maintains that Claimant has failed to prove that the amount of compensation is a direct consequence of the rejection of the Mining Lease Application.219\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 53; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 58.\n\n**c. Standard and Burden of Proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant has the burden of proof on the existence and quantum of the damages it is seeking.220 Respondent adds that a claimant must also provide evidence of the damages it alleges and refers to the tribunal in *AES v. Kazakhstan*, which did not award damages because \"*Claimants failed to duly establish their damage*,\" and the tribunal in *Rompetrol v. Romania*, which declined to award damages under a certain head due to a \"*failure by the claimant to produce any reliably concrete evidence of actual losses under this head*.\"221\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 59-62.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 63-66, *quoting from The* *AES Corporation and Tau Power B.V. v. Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/16, Award of 1 November 2013 [RLA-358], \u00b6\u00b6 468-469 *and* *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award of 6 May 2013 [RLA-268], \u00b6 293.\n\n245.\n\nRespondent further relies on its legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who states that a \"*claimant must prove the losses it has incurred with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty*.\"222 Respondent further quotes from Dr. Ripinsky's first expert report:\n\n\"*Claimant bears the burden of proving the losses it has incurred and the amount of damages that is commensurate with these losses. In international investment law, claimant must prove damages with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty. This standard applies to both past as well as future losses. For obvious reasons, the task of meeting this standard is more challenging in relation to future losses and valuation methods based on future projections*.\"223\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 308, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 6.\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6 22. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 67, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 23.\n\n246.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Claimant's reliance on a \"*modern DCF*\" method, Respondent quotes from Dr. Ripinsky's report:\n\n\"[T]*he standard of proof requires the claimant to demonstrate with sufficient certainty that the validity of these assumptions and the critical parameters (*'fundamentals' *) underlying the DCF analysis are \u2013 individually and taken together \u2013 established with sufficient certainty*.224\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 68, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 41.\n\n247.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimant failed to provide reasonably and sufficiently certain information and therefore failed to discharge its burden of proof. In Respondent's view, Reko Diq \"*faced key challenges that would have prevented it from becoming profitable, which requires the Tribunal to dismiss the compensation claims*.\" It refers to Dr. Ripinsky who states that \"[i]*n some investor-State disputes, tribunals have refused to grant compensation, despite finding a treaty breach, where the claimant had failed to prove that it had suffered a loss as a result of the respondent State's unlawful conduct or to provide a reasonable basis for the estimation of damages*.\"225\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 69; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 310-311, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, note 2.\n\n248.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the rule that a claimant, who cannot prove having incurred specific given amounts and the causal link between these amounts and the proven internationally wrongful act, cannot recover these amounts was confirmed by the ICJ in *Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)*.226 In Respondent's view, Claimant has explicitly admitted that it cannot prove quantum with certainty and it cannot shift its evidentiary shortcomings on Pakistan.227 Respondent again refers to Dr. Ripinsky who explains:\n\n\"*The point is sometimes made that where a State is to blame for a project's interruption, the claimant should be given the benefit of doubt in respect of any uncertainty in determining what exactly would have happened in the absence of a breach. This position does not seem to be methodologically correct from the point of view of the burden and standard of proof, nor does it respect the task of determining the FMV as of a certain date (i.e. on the basis of facts available as of that date).*\"228\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 312.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 56.\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6 76 and note 48.\n\n249.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's argument regarding the standard of proof and notes that even the tribunal in *Lemire v. Ukraine* on which Claimant relies endorsed \"*the requirement that speculative losses be excluded from the calculation*\" and ultimately rejected the claimant's future quantum scenario as \"*too uncertain*.\"229\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 54, *quoting from* *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award of 28 March 2011 [RLA-82], \u00b6 261.\n\n250.\n\nRespondent argues that the \"*Modern DCF*\" methodology applied by Prof. Davis requires \"*a high level of certainty*\"; by opting for that \"*fragile model*,\" Claimant opted for the requisite standard of proof.230 Quoting from *ADM v. Mexico*, Respondent argues that \"*lost profits are allowable insofar as the Claimants prove that the alleged damage is not speculative or uncertain \u2013 i.e., that the profits anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated and not merely possible.*\"231 The tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina* stated that \"*compensation is generally awarded only where future profitability can be established (the fact of profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level of certainty*.\"232\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 57.\n\n*Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/5, Award of 21 November 2007 [RLA-345], \u00b6 285.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007) [RLA-398], \u00b6 8.3.3.\n\n**d. Appropriate Valuation Method**\n-----------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nRespondent contends that the valuation method applied by Claimant's valuation expert, which it describes as \"*a rather unique variation of a discounted cash flow* ('DCF' *) valuation, which has not been adopted by the mining industry or investment tribunals*,\" cannot help in determining the fair market value of Claimant's investment as of the valuation date.233\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 306.\n\n252.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the \"*modern DCF*\" method does not meet the standard for a \"*readily ascertainable*\" market value.234 Respondent claims that Prof. Davis only selectively uses market information such as commodity forward rates and interest rates but otherwise uses his own assumptions about long-term price projections, capital and operating costs as well as asymmetric risks. Respondent therefore rejects the argument that this is a \"*true market-based approach*.\"235\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 113.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 115.\n\n253.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the \"*Modern DCF*\" method has been fabricated by Claimant and its expert to \"*provide a designer, bespoke methodology allowing TCC to offer the appearance of pseudo-scientific support for its predetermined outlandish valuation*.\" Respondents considers that Prof. Davis expressly admitted during the Hearing on Quantum that his method was a way to reach a predetermined value that would not be validated by actual valuation methods.236\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 314, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2371 line 8 to p. 2372 line 3.\n\n254.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that there is no arbitration case in which the \"*Modern DCF*\" approach would have been applied and points out that in the only case in which it was raised, *Bear Creek*, it was dismissed by the tribunal as inappropriate in the circumstances of valuing the mining assets.237 Respondent further notes that Prof. Davis was able to point to only one transaction in the mining industry in which it was applied \u2013 which was described in the press as \"*the worst mining deal ever*.\" Respondent adds that neither Claimant nor its shareholders used \"*Modern DCF*\" in their transactions on mining assets.238 Respondent contends that CIMVal also describes the method as \"[n]*ot widely used and not widely understood*,\" which confirms, in Respondent's view that the method cannot reflect \"*generally recognized principles of valuation*\" as required by Article 7(2) of the Treaty.239\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 317-318, *referring to Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/2, Award of 30 November 2017 [CA-432], \u00b6 604. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 119.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 317.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2).\n\n255.\n\nRespondent refers to its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells who consider:\n\n\"*In sum, the* 'modern' *part of the approach used in the Brattle Report boils down mainly to the application of a risk-free discount rate to a project that is extremely risky. The Report does not adjust projected cash flows to account for these risks. This is amply demonstrated when the result is compared to the results obtained in the SNC-Lavalin studies, which are praised by TCC and use methods typical of those applied by real buyers and sellers to value such an asset. \u2026 Similarly, the result in the Brattle Report is grossly out of line with the arm's length purchase price of the identical asset five years earlier.*\"240\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 121, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 87.\n\n256.\n\nMore generally, Respondent claims that, quoting from the expert report of Dr. Ripinsky, \"*the weight of authority clearly indicates that, as a general rule, the DCF method is not appropriate for investment projects that have not demonstrated their capacity to generate profits by a track record of performance.*\"241 Respondent submits that, *inter alia*, the World Bank Guidelines on Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment and the Commentary to the ILC Articles support DCF valuations only for going concerns.242 Respondent also refers to a large number of investment treaty cases in which the application of a DCF method was denied due to a lack of a sufficient operational track record and/or proven profitability.243\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 319, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6 8. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 74 and 77.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, *quoting from* World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, \u00a7 IV.6(ii), (iii) (RE-564) *and* Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 53rd session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10, Chapter IV, Commentary to Article 31, \u00b6 25, U.N. Doc.

Ecuador*, which rejected the methodologies before it to value a copper mining project that had not yet begun production except for a cost-based approach because it considered them \"*too uncertain, subjective and dependent upon contingencies, which cannot be fairly assessed by the Tribunal*.\"246 Respondent also relies on the tribunal in *Khan v. Mongolia*, which rejected the DCF method as \"*too speculative*\" because it considered it \"*far from certain*\" whether the mine would have reached production, on what terms the parties would have participated in the venture and whether theclaimants would have been involved.247\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 98, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 99, *quoting from* *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v.

For this reason, investment treaty tribunals routinely reject the use of DCF valuation for non-producting assets*.\"248\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 320-321, *quoting from Bear Creek Mining Corporation v.

Mexico*, which held: \"*W* [h]*ere the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value. The Tribunal agrees with Mexico that a discounted cash flow analysis is inappropriate in the present case because the landfill was never operative and any award based on future profits would be wholly speculative*.\"249\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 59, *quoting from* *Metalclad Corp. v.

Respondent considers it decisive that Claimant relies on only three cases in support of its argument that DCF should be applied and argues that none of these cases supports Claimant's case.252\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent notes that only the *Gold Reserve* tribunal applied a DCF method, based on an agreement between the parties, and in all cases the damages awarded by the tribunals were \"*roughly equal to the amounts claimed as investments made in the project*.\"253 Respondent further argues that the facts in *Gold Reserve* and *Crystallex* were substantially different from the facts in the present case, in particular as regards the stage of the project, investments made and, in *Gold Reserve*, an agreement on the valuation method, whereas the *Crystallex* tribunal rejected DCF as \"*inappropriate for a gold project*.\"254 The *Rusoro* tribunal also considered a DCF methodology \"*inappropriate*\" given the \"*lack of a proven record of financial performance*\" and set out criteria for its application which, according to Respondent, are not present in Claimant's project.255\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 101.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 86-89; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 92; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 104, *quoting from* *Rusoro Mining Limited v.

Most importantly, Respondent emphasizes that the *Bear Creek* tribunal did not apply \"*Modern DCF*.\"257 Quoting from Dr. Ripinsky, Respondent argues that the tribunal thereby followed \"*the consistent line of earlier decisions that deemed the DCF method to be generally inappropriate for valuing investment projects without a performance track record*.\"258\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 93.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 93-98.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 99, *quoting from* Ripinsky II, \u00b6 26.\n\n266.\n\nRespondent emphasizes its position that Dr. Ripinsky's statements in his expert reports submitted in this arbitration are consistent with his public writings. It draws the Tribunal's attention to the fact that in the quotes relied on by Claimant, Dr. Ripinsky stated that DCF may be considered \"*if the business proves successful*\" and referred to \"*established businesses*.\"259 As for the cost approach, Dr. Ripinsky clarified that \"*if the evidence on the record does not allow for the use of an income-based or market-based method, the historic cost approach may be the only remaining option*.\"260\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 101-105.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107, *quoting from* Ripinsky II, \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.\n\n267.\n\nRespondent submits that where the market value is not \"*readily ascertainable*,\" the Tribunal should look to a backward-looking approach.261 Respondent contends that its expert Dr. Burrows derived the best approximation to the fair market value of Claimant's investment by using the prior transaction by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired the shares in Claimant in 2006. Respondent emphasizes that \"[t]*o clarify, the valuation submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows intends to challenge, and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC's case on quantum, which under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal*.\"262\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 116.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 353.\n\n268.\n\nRespondent maintains that the fair market value would be most accurately determined by Dr. Burrows' reference to the set of prior transactions involving the acquisition of Claimant, including a number of adjustments to account for changes that occurred until the valuation date, *i.e*., changes in metal prices and country risk as well as \"*subsequent efficient, proven investments*.\"263 According to Respondent, neither of the remaining approaches proposed by Claimant nor \"*an uninformed, exaggerated guess on the size of the mineral deposits actually available for mining*,\" whether made by Prof. Davis or Dr. Mubarakmand, would have been taken into account by a willing buyer in determining the fair market value.264 In light of the remaining uncertainties associated with the project, Respondent concludes that no prospective transaction would have been concluded based on a forecast of future profits of the mine as of the valuation date.265\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 354, *quoting from* Burrows I, \u00b6 3.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 355.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 112.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent further argues that if the Tribunal were to find that Dr. Burrows' valuation does not reflect the fair market value of Claimant's investment, \"*the only other valuation that could validly be performed under the Treaty is one based on actual, efficient, proven investments made, adjusted for principles of equity*.\" Respondent adds that not all investments made would be compensable and claims that the Treaty would \"*call for further reductions due to the inefficiencies in TCC's exploration work*.\"266\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 122-125.\n\n270.\n\nIn this context, Respondent notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty also refers to \"*equitable principles*\" and relies on the Commentary to the ILC Articles to argue that the quantification of damages should reach \"*an equitable and acceptable outcome*.\" Respondent also refers to the principle of proportionality and points to the disparity between the amount claimed and the amount that Claimant allegedly invested, which Respondent considers to be \"*completely disproportionate and inequitable*.\"267\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 126-128.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the four issues discussed by the Parties, i.e: (i) the applicable standard of compensation; (ii) the requirement of causation; (iii) the applicable standard and burden of proof; and (iv) the valuation method to be applied to determine Claimant's damages, in turn.\n\n**a. Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties regarding the date as of which the losses that Claimant claims to have incurred have to be quantified. Respondent explicitly \"*accepts, that the proper measure of quantum is the market value of TCC on November 15, 2011*.\"268 The Parties' agreement regarding the date of valuation is based on the Tribunal's finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that Respondent has breached its obligations under Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead.269 The denial was notified to TCCP by the Licensing Authority's letter dated 15 November 2011.270 The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Parties that Claimant's alleged losses have to be quantified as of that date.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 28.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1373.\n\n**Exhibit CE-11**.\n\n273.\n\nThe Parties further agree that in order to quantify Claimant's losses, the Tribunal must determine the \"*market value*\" of TCC or, more precisely, the market value of Claimant's investment in the Reko Diq project as of 15 November 2011. The Tribunal has found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that following the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application, the value of the CHEJVA and TCCP, and thus of Claimant's investment, was effectively neutralized.271 The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Parties that Claimant's losses are equivalent to the (entire) value that its investment would have had if TCCP's Mining Lease Application has not been denied in violation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1328.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with the Parties that the value to be determined is the \"*market value*\" which, as defined by Claimant's valuation expert Prof. Davis and quoted with approval by Respondent,272 represents \"*the cash-equivalent amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller to purchase the asset at the Valuation Date, both with reasonable knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the asset and neither being under any compulsion to transact*.\"273\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 307.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 5.\n\n275.\n\nThere is also common ground that the value has to be determined \"*but for*\" the Treaty breaches that the Tribunal has determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. While the Parties are in disagreement as to the extent to which but-for assumptions have to be made, in particular regarding the conclusion and terms of a Mineral Agreement, the general principle of performing a but-for valuation is undisputed and can be derived from both standards of compensation on which the Parties rely. In fact, this aspect relates to the requirement of causation between Respondent's breaches and the losses incurred by Claimant and will be addressed in more detail below.\n\n276.\n\nAs for the standard of compensation, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal should calculate compensation based on Article 7(2) of the Treaty, as alleged by Respondent, or based on the standard of full reparation under customary international law, as alleged by Claimant. Article 7(1) and (2) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"*1. Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as* 'expropriation' *) the investments of investors of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and under due process of law;*\n\n*(b) the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and*\n\n*(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*2. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be computed on the basis of the market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became public knowledge. Where that value cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined in accordance with generally recognised principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, and other relevant factors.*\"274\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Article 7(1) and (2).\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the wording of Article 7(2) (\"*The compensation referred to in paragraph 1(c)\u2026*\") indicates that the provision is, at least primarily, intended to clarify how the compensation must be calculated in order for an expropriation to comply with the legality requirements set out in Article 7(1). The Tribunal is aware that both Parties have relied on case law supporting their respective arguments regarding the question whether or not the provision should further apply to calculate the compensation for an expropriation carried out in violation of the legality requirements in Article 7(1) and/or compensation for Treaty breaches other than an expropriation.\n\n278.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to express an opinion on this point in the abstract. While Claimant takes the position that the Tribunal should apply the compensation standard set out in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* which it considers to be the relevant standard under customary international law, it also argues that this approach is consistent with Article 7 of the Treaty, in particular the first sentence in Article 7(2) pursuant to which compensation \"*shall be computed on the basis of the market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became public knowledge*.\"275\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 20; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-4**, Article 7(2).\n\n279.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerns the second sentence in Article 7(2), which sets out criteria for determining compensation \"[w]*here* [market] *value cannot be readily ascertained*.\" Respondent argues that the valuation method presented by Claimant to determine the market value of its investment does not produce a \"*readily ascertainable*\" result and therefore leads to the application of the criteria in the second sentence. Claimant, on the other hand, maintains that the market value of its investment can be ascertained based on the valuation performed by its valuation expert Prof. Davis.\n\n280.\n\nConsequently, if the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the market value of Claimant's investment can be \"*readily ascertained*\" based on the evidence and valuation methods before it, there is no need to decide whether this result is based on the compensation provision in Article 7(2) of the Treaty or a compensation standard under customary international law.\n\n281.\n\nAs will be out in more detail below, the Tribunal is convinced that in the specific circumstances of this individual case, the valuation method relied on by Claimant and its valuation expert Prof. Davis is the most appropriate measure to value Claimant's investment in Reko Diq. While it will therefore not be strictly necessary to resort to the additional criteria set out in the second sentence of Article 7(2), the Tribunal will in any event give due consideration to generally recognized principles of valuation and verify whether the result it has reached based on Prof. Davis' method is reconcilable with the amount of capital invested by Claimant in order to ensure that Claimant will be awarded compensation in the amount that truly reflects the damages it has incurred as a result of Respondent's breaches of the Treaty.\n\n**b. Requirement of Causation**\n-------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties and Claimant explicitly accepts that \"*it must show that Pakistan's breaches of the Treaty caused TCCA's loss*.\"276 According to Claimant, however, the causal relationship between Respondent's breaches and its damage has already been determined because the Tribunal has found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that \"*Respondent's conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings*.\"277\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 34; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1374.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that its finding was made as part of its conclusion on Claimant's claims, which may be quoted again at this point:\n\n\"*In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent breached its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.*\n\n*While the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument that Claimant's claim must fail in limine because it has failed to address causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that Respondent's conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings. In the Tribunal's view, any specific questions on whether Respondent's conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant's \u2013 yet unquantified \u2013 claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed as part of the quantum phase of the proceedings*.\"278\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1373-1374.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal affirms its previous finding that Respondent's conduct has deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and has thereby caused a loss that is equal to the value that Claimant's investment would have had if Respondent had not denied TCCP's Mining Lease Application in violation of its obligations under the Treaty. The Tribunal has not, however, made a finding as to specific aspects of causation. In particular, the Tribunal has not yet made a definitive finding as to whether the Reko Diq project would have succeeded in the manner presented by Claimant and/or whether the assumptions made by Claimant and its valuation expert Prof. Davis reflect the true value of the Reko Diq project. As for the assumptions made in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, this was explicitly emphasized by the Tribunal in its Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request.279\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 99, 103.\n\n285.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement, Respondent is correct in pointing out that the Tribunal has not made a finding that the non-conclusion of a Mineral Agreement by the Governments amounts to a breach of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a but-for valuation cannot assume that a Mineral Agreement would have existed as of the date of valuation. On the other hand, the Tribunal recalls its findings that in the absence of Respondent's breaches, once Claimant would have received a mining lease, there would have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues in the Mineral Agreement negotiations.280 The question whether a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded after the valuation date and, if so, on what terms, will be addressed in more detail below.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1239.\n\n286.\n\nAt this point, *i.e*., in the context of causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to recall the Parties' agreement that Claimant must show that Respondent's breaches caused its losses. In other words, Claimant is entitled to compensation in the amount of the value that its investment would have had *but for* Respondent's breaches. If and to the extent the Tribunal is not convinced that a specific risk or downside affecting Claimant's investment would not have existed in the but-for scenario, it will make the appropriate deduction in order to determine those, and only those, losses that were caused by Respondent's breaches of the Treaty.\n\n**c. Standard and Burden of Proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties and Claimant specifically accepts that \"*TCCA has the burden of proof as to its loss*.\"281\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 34. *See also* \u00b6 69.\n\n288.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute, however, as to the standard of proof that applies to the quantification of Claimant's loss. Claimant distinguishes between the fact of the loss, which it considers to be subject to \"*the normal standard of balance of the probabilities*,\" and the quantum of the loss in respect of which it considers it sufficient to provide a \"*reasonable basis*\" for the Tribunal's assessment. Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that Claimant must prove its losses, including the quantum, \"*with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty*.\"\n\n289.\n\nWhile Respondent repeatedly uses the term \"*absolute certainty*\" in its Post-Hearing Brief, it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether it thereby suggests that this is the standard that Claimant has to meet or rather a standard that Claimant purports to meet.282 In its Rejoinder, Respondent contends that the \"*modern*\" DCF method used by Prof. Davis \"*requires absolute certainty*\"283 or \"*a high level of certainty*\" because it is \"*such a fragile model.*\"284 In its Post-Hearing Brief, however, it reiterates its references to Dr. Ripinsky who supports a standard of \"*reasonable, or sufficient, certainty*.\"285\n\n*Cf*. *e.g.* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 106.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 283.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 57.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 308-309, *quoting from* Ripinsky I, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 22.\n\n290.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that a standard of \"*absolute certainty*\" could or should be applied to the quantification of Claimant's damages. Respondent does not cite any authority in this respect and its own legal expert does not support such a strict standard of proof. As pointed out by Claimant, a standard of \"*absolute certainty*\" would mean that damages would \u2013 almost certainly \u2013 never be awarded. There can hardly be absolute proof for a hypothetical situation.\n\n291.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the application of the modern DCF method, if considered appropriate by the Tribunal, would not warrant a different standard of proof. As the Tribunal will discuss in more detail below, the term \"*certainty-equivalent cash flows*\" does not mean that cash flows have to be proven with \"*absolute certainty*\" but rather that existing uncertainties have been quantified and incorporated into these cash flows. Whether or not this has been done in a sufficient manner will form part of the assessment whether Claimant has in fact met its burden of proof. It does not justify raising the threshold of what has to be proven.\n\n292.\n\nRespondent's legal expert Dr. Ripinsky states with regard to the standard of proof in his expert report:\n\n\"*Claimant bears the burden of proving the losses it has incurred and the amount of damages that is commensurate with these losses. In international investment law, claimant must prove damages with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty. This standard applies to both past as well as future losses. For obvious reasons, the task of meeting this standard is more challenging in relation to future losses and valuation methods based on future projections.*\n\n*In a number of cases, arbitral tribunals have held that future losses must be proved with* 'sufficient (degree of) certainty', 'sufficient degree of probability', 'some level of certainty', 'comparative likelihood' *and that they must be* 'probable and not merely possible'. *The Commentaries to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility refer to* 'sufficient certainty' *as a requirement for the anticipated income stream to become a legally protected interest. In the context of the United Nations Compensation Commission,* 'reasonable certainty' *served as the standard of proof*.\"286\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n293.\n\nClaimant does not specifically dispute Dr. Ripinsky's opinion but relies on the tribunal's findings in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* in support of its argument that once the fact of the loss has been proven, the standard of proof for the quantum of damage does not require the same degree of certainty. The Tribunal notes that in its assessment which standard of proof it should apply to lost profits, the *Crystallex* tribunal considered several of the authorities quoted by Dr. Ripinsky and drew the following conclusions:\n\n\"*The ILC Articles recognize that in certain cases compensation for loss of profits may be appropriate. Indeed, Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that* '[t]he compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established'*. The commentary to the ILC Articles further notes that* '[t]tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements' *and* '[i]n cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases, a well-established history of dealings'*.*\n\n*Furthermore, according to an oft-cited authority,* 'in order to be allowable, prospective profits must not be too speculative, contingent, uncertain, and the like. There must be proof that they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible'*. The same idea was expressed by the tribunal in* ADM v. Mexico *which held that* 'lost profits are allowable insofar as the Claimants prove that the alleged damage is not speculative or uncertain \u2013 i.e., that the profits anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated and not merely possible'*.*\n\n*Furthermore, the* Vivendi v. Argentina *tribunal noted that* 'compensation for lost profits is generally awarded only where future profitability can be established (the fact of profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level of certainty'*.*\n\n*In the Tribunal's view, all these authorities show that, once the fact of future profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the amount of such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty. In other words, the Claimant must prove that it has been deprived of profits that would have actually been earned. This requires proving that there is sufficient certainty that it had engaged or would have engaged in a profitmaking activity but for the Respondent's wrongful act, and that such activity would have indeed been profitable.*\n\n*With those principles in mind, the question thus is whether in this case (i) it is sufficiently certain that the Claimant would have made profits; and (ii) if yes, whether the Claimant has provided the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to assess such loss of profits. The two questions will be addressed in turn*.\"287\n\n287 *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 873-876.\n\n294.\n\nClaimant also relies on the tribunal in *Lemire v. Ukraine*, which held:\n\n\"*The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the* in bonis *party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.*\n\n*While the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the* 'but for' *hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings*.\"288\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award of 28 March 2011 [RLA-185], \u00b6\u00b6 246, 248.\n\n295.\n\nThe *Crystallex* tribunal also quoted the first of these paragraphs and added:\n\n\"*The tribunal is of the view that the emphasis should be put on the phrase* 'with reasonable confidence' *which seems to strike a wholesome and pragmatic approach, prone to satisfy common law and civil law minds.*\n\n*Other tribunals have come to similar conclusions. In* SPP v. Egypt, *for example, the tribunal noted that* 'it is well-settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss had been incurred'. *And in* Tecmed, *the tribunal observed that* 'any difficulty in determining the compensation does not prevent the assessment of such compensation where the existence of damage is certain'.\n\n*Thus, an impossibility or even a considerable difficulty that would make it unconscionable to prove the amount (rather than the existence) of damages with absolute precision does not bar their recovery altogether. Arbitral tribunals have been prepared to award compensation on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the loss, where they felt confident about the fact of the loss itself. In the Tribunal's view, this approach may be particularly warranted if the uncertainty in determining what exactly would have happened is the result of the other party's wrongdoing*.\"289\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 869-871.\n\n296.\n\nOn that basis, it appears to the Tribunal that the standards invoked by the Parties are in fact not too far apart. In fact, Dr. Ripinsky acknowledges this jurisprudence and draws the following conclusion from it:\n\n\"*A number of investment tribunals have suggested that once the fact of the damage has been established, a claimant should not be required to prove the actual amount of damages with the same degree of certainty. In the DCF context, I take this to mean that uncertainties remain inherent in any DCF analysis, and the method can still be used despite the impossibility of producing a* 'scientifically precise' *result. After all, value established for a hypothetical transaction is not a fact, but rather an informed opinion of how much an asset is worth. However, for the DCF method to be accepted, the claimant must get over the* 'hump' *of demonstrating its appropriateness and reliability in the specific circumstances of the case*.\"290\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6 42.\n\n297.\n\nThere appears to be no dispute regarding the accuracy of Dr. Ripinsky's conclusion and the Tribunal agrees with it. Whether Claimant has demonstrated the appropriateness of the DCF method, and specifically of the modern DCF method, in the present case will be addressed in more detail below. At this point, it suffices to find that the standard of proof cannot be such as to exclude a valuation because the Tribunal is not \"*certain*\" that the result it produces is correct in terms of \"*scientifically precise*.\" On the other hand, the Tribunal must be convinced that the valuation is appropriate in that it will produce a sufficiently reliable result.\n\n298.\n\nRespondent points out that Dr. Ripinsky also noted in his expert report that \"[i]*n some investor-State disputes, tribunals have refused to grant compensation, despite finding a treaty breach, where the claimant had failed to prove that it had suffered a loss as a result of the respondent State's unlawful conduct or to provide a reasonable basis for the estimation of damages*.\"291 In the Tribunal's view, there is no dispute between the Parties that Claimant has to prove that it suffered a loss and that it has to provide a reasonable basis for the estimation of damages. The dispute therefore appears to concern not so much the standard of proof but rather whether the valuation method used by Claimant and its expert yields results that are not \"*too speculative*\" or \"*too uncertain*\" but rather enable the Tribunal to assess Claimant's damages \"*with reasonable confidence*\" and reach a \"*reliable*\" conclusion.\n\nRipinsky I, note 2.\n\n299.\n\nThere is a dispute, however, as to whether the Tribunal may or even should take into account the extent to which any uncertainties in the valuation result from Respondent's breaches \u2013 because these breaches have prevented the project from going forward and eliminating uncertainties such as the terms of the Mineral Agreement and the terms of third-party financing. The *Crystallex* tribunal indicated that this might be a consideration to be taken into account. The tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico* even went further and explicitly held:\n\n\"[T]*he fact that this exercise is difficult is due directly to the Respondent\u201fs breaches of the two BITs which have made it almost impossible for the Claimants to show how the Concessionaire could or would have made use of that lost opportunity. As already decided by the Tribunal above, it would be wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of the monetary value of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent's own wrongs. This is not therefore a case where the burden of proof lay exclusively on the Claimants: and, in the Tribunal's view, it was also for the Respondent to prove the contrary. It did not do so*.\"292\n\n*Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A., and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3, Award of 16 June 2010 [CA-104], \u00b6 13-99.\n\n300.\n\nDr. Ripinsky, on the other hand, states in his expert report:\n\n\"[F]*undamental uncertainties existing at the date of valuation cannot be resolved by a tribunal by predicting* 'how things would have evolved in the absence of the breach.' *Rather, the task of ascertaining the fair market value at a given date of valuation requires arbitrators to view these uncertainties as the part of the factual matrix existing as of that date. If these fundamental uncertainties cannot be resolved in favour of the claimant on the basis of the applicable standard of proof, this should preclude reliance on the DCF method.*\n\n[Note 48] *The point is sometimes made that where a State is to blame for a project's interruption, the claimant should be given the benefit of doubt in respect of any uncertainty in determining what exactly would have happened in the absence of a breach. This position does not seem to be methodologically correct from the point of view of the burden and standard of proof, nor does it respect the task of determining the FMV as of a certain date (i.e. on the basis of facts available as of that date).*\"293\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6 76 and note 48.\n\n301.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not sensible to discuss this point in the abstract. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal considers that, in principle, the information and evidence presented by Claimant provide a reasonable and sufficient basis to determine the value of Claimant's investment using an income-based valuation method. In other words, the Tribunal does not consider that there are \"*fundamental uncertainties*\" that would preclude the application of a DCF method or, more precisely, the application of the modern DCF method used by Prof. Davis. This does not yet mean that the Tribunal agrees with each of the individual assumptions and risk estimates made by Prof. Davis in the course of his valuation. Should the Tribunal reach the conclusion that certain risks or uncertainties have not been sufficiently accounted for, it will also assess whether, in that specific context, there is an evidentiary uncertainty which has been caused by Respondent and might therefore justify alleviating Claimant's burden of proof.\n\n302.\n\nIn general, however, the Tribunal finds that these considerations may not serve to reverse the fundamental principle that Claimant bears the burden of proving its damage, including the quantum of its damage, and therefore also bears the consequences if and to the extent it is not able to meet this burden of proof.\n\n**d. Appropriate Valuation Method**\n-----------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nHaving set out the applicable legal standards in general, the Tribunal will now turn to the valuation methods presented by the Parties and assess whether it is appropriate to rely on any of these methods in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n304.\n\nClaimant has presented a valuation from its expert Prof. Davis, which has been referred to throughout these proceedings as the \"*modern DCF*\" method \u2013 a term that the Tribunal will therefore adopt in the following analysis. Respondent has relied on two sets of valuation experts: (i) Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells who were instructed to discuss the appropriateness of a DCF valuation in general and the valuation presented by Prof. Davis in particular but did not present a valuation of their own of the Reko Diq project; and (ii) Dr. Burrows who valued the Reko Diq project based on the past transactions through which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired their (indirect) shares in Claimant in 2006.\n\n305.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has two valuations before it, *i.e*., the income-based modern DCF valuation performed by Prof. Davis and the past-transactions-based valuation performed by Dr. Burrows. The Tribunal further takes note of Respondent's statement that \"*the valuation submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows intends to challenge, and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC's case on quantum, which under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal*.\"294\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 353.\n\n306.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal will first and foremost assess whether Claimant has established that it is appropriate to use a modern DCF valuation in the circumstances of the present case. If and to the extent the Tribunal follows Claimant and its expert on this point, it will further assess, once the Tribunal has drawn its own conclusion on the value of the Reko Diq project based on that method, whether there are reasonable grounds for any remaining deviation to the result produced by Dr. Burrows' method.\n\n307.\n\nAs for the modern DCF method applied by Prof. Davis, there are two main aspects in dispute between the Parties: (i) whether it is appropriate in general to use an income-based DCF valuation for a development-stage mining project in the circumstances of Reko Diq; and (ii) whether it is appropriate to use the modern DCF method, which is in principle also a DCF valuation but, as explained by Prof. Davis, uses at-source pricing of risk and simulates certain project variables to incorporate managerial flexibility while then discounting cash flows at a risk-free rate.295\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 83, 85.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal will address these two aspects in turn.\n\n**i. Whether It Is Appropriate to Value the Reko Diq Project Based on a Projection of Future Cash Flows**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis regarding the appropriateness of using a DCF valuation in this case, the Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties that this question cannot be answered in the abstract, *i.e*., for any given development-stage project at a certain defined stage. In response to Claimant's denial of a \"*bright-line rule*\" that Respondent allegedly invoked,296 Respondent agreed with the \"*truism*\" that \"*the applicability of DCF methodology is decided on the facts of each case*\" but argued that Claimant had failed to establish the facts leading to the applicability of a DCF analysis, *i.e*., facts proving \"*profitability or sufficient certainty of the viability of the project into the future*.\"297\n\n*Cf. e.g*. Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 77; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22.\n\nCf. Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the analysis which valuation method is appropriate to value a project can only be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the case and the evidence that the Parties have brought before this Tribunal. As stated by the *Crystallex* tribunal:\n\n\"[T]*here is no one methodology best suited for determining the fair market value of the investment lost in every situation. Tribunals may consider any techniques or methods of valuation that are generally acceptable in the financial community, and whether a particular method is appropriate to utilize is based on the circumstances of each individual case. A tribunal will thus select the appropriate method basing its decision on the circumstances of each individual case, mainly because a value is less an actual fact than the expression of an opinion based on the set of facts before the expert, the appraiser or the tribunal*.\"298\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 886.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this statement and can therefore assess no more and no less than whether it is appropriate to determine the value of the Reko Diq project as of 15 November 2011 based on a projection of the project's future cash flows. At the same time, the Tribunal still considers it useful to take guidance from the findings made by other tribunals faced with the question how to value a non-operational mining project. In their submissions, the Parties relied, *inter alia*, on four recent cases concerning non-operational mining projects which, as assessed by Dr. Ripinsky, \"*are to some extent comparable to the Tethyan case in terms of their factual background*\" as they were \"*stopped due to government intervention before entering the exploitation stage or shortly thereafter*.\"299\n\nRipinsky I, \u00b6 59.\n\n312.\n\nClaimant relies in particular on the findings made by the tribunals in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* and *Crystallex v. Venezuela*. In *Gold Reserve*, the tribunal held:\n\n\"*Although the Brisas Project was never a functioning mine and therefore did not have a history of cashflow which would lend itself to the DCF model, the Tribunal accepts the explanation of both Dr Burrows (CRA) and Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) that a DCF method can be reliably used in the instant case because of the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining cashflow analysis previously performed. The Tribunal also notes that the experts agreed on the DCF model used, and it is only the inputs that are contested*.\"300\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 [CA-177], \u00b6 830.\n\n313.\n\nIn that case, the claimant had also presented a comparables valuation which was contested by the respondent. In that context, the *Gold Reserve* tribunal added:\n\n\"*The Tribunal notes that the DCF method is a preferred method of valuation where sufficient data is available. This conclusion is supported by the CIMVal Guidelines \u2026 to which both experts referred. In the present cases, many of the arguments in favour of a DCF approach (a commodity product for which data such as reserves and price are easily calculated) mitigates against introducing other methods such as comparable transactions or market capitalization, unless close comparables can be found. On several occasions in this Award, the Tribunal has rejected a comparable with other mines on the basis that many variables are specific to each mine (such as climatic and geological conditions) all of which have an impact on value. \u2026 Although the Tribunal appreciates Claimant's concern that the DCF model can be over-sensitive to changes in inputs, the Tribunal is not convinced that the comparables offered are sufficiently similar to enable then* [sic] *to be used in a weighted valuation calculation. Because of this uncertainty, the Tribunal prefers to use the DCF model only*.\"301\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 [CA-177], \u00b6 831.\n\n314.\n\nThe tribunal did not, however, decide to ignore the comparables approach but used it as \"*a cross-reference as to the reasonableness of the DCF valuation*.\" It noted that \"*the comparables were in a close range, suggesting the DCF value was reasonably accurate*\" and also referred to other valuations from independent analysists, which it considered \"*useful references to ensure that the compensation awarded is reasonable*.\"302\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 [CA-177], \u00b6 832.\n\n315.\n\nDr. Burrows, who had also appeared as the respondent's expert in *Gold Reserve*, had presented a negative valuation of the project. The *Gold Reserve* tribunal did not consider this valuation convincing because \"[t]*his would essentially mean that the mine was completely uneconomic to operate \u2013 a highly unlikely proposition given the effort and expense to which Gold Reserve had committed to get the mine operational. The detailed feasibility study and various impact studies all demonstrated that the level of analysis that had gone into the mine was significant*.\" The tribunal further noted that the claimant's valuation was consistent with other indendent valuations and bore \"*reasonably proximity to the comparables methodologies*.\" The tribunal also considered it unlikely that the claimant would have proceded with the venture if it had become uneconomic. In addition, it took note of the fact that financing had been arranged for the project, \"*indicating that a convincing business case had been made to obtain the debt*.\"303 On that basis, the tribunal decided to generally prefer the methodology and evidence advanced by the claimant's expert.\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 [CA-177], \u00b6 830, \u00b6\u00b6 833-834.\n\n316.\n\nIn *Crystallex*, the tribunal found that the claimant had \"*established the fact of future profitability, as it had completed the exploration phase, the size of the deposits had been established, the value can be determined based on market prices, and the costs are well known in the industry and can be estimated with a sufficient degree of certainty*.\" The tribunal made reference to the feasibility studies produced by the claimant and noted that it saw \"*no reason to cast into doubt the accuracy of the studies that those well-known consultants prepared contemporaneously for the Claimant throughout the years*.\" It further held that \"*gold, unlike most consumer products or even other commodities, is less subject to ordinary supply-demand dynamics or market fluctuations, and, especially in the case of open pit gold mining as in Las Cristinas, is an asset whose costs and future profits can be estimated with greater certainty*.\" The tribunal therefore accepted that \"*predicting future income from ascertained reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining techniques\u2014as is the case of Las Cristinas\u2014can be done with a significant degree of certainty, even without a record of past production*.\"304\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 878-880.\n\n317.\n\nIn a second step, the *Crystallex* tribunal assessed whether the claimant had provided it with a reasonable basis to assess the loss of profits and noted that the claimant had presented several forward-looking methodologies whereas the respondent had presented a backward-looking cost approach. It then held:\n\n\"*The Tribunal considers that in this case only forward-looking methodologies aimed at calculating lost profits are appropriate in order to determine the fair market value of Crystallex's investment. By contrast, a backward-looking methodology such as the cost approach, while susceptible of being utilized in certain instances where there is no record of profitability and other methodologies would lead to excessively speculative and uncertain results, cannot be resorted to in this case. The cost approach method would not reflect the fair market value of the investment, as by definition it only assesses what has been expended into the project rather than what the market value of the investment is at the relevant time*.\"305\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 881-882.\n\n318.\n\nThe *Crystallex* tribunal considered that \"[t]*he appropriateness of choosing, at least for a case like this one, a method which aims at determining lost profits and, by contrast, of discarding methods that are purely based on the computation of sunk costs*,\" was confirmed by the \"*Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties*\" issued by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIMVal), which it described as \"*important standards in the industry*.\" The tribunal referred to the definition of \"*development property*\" in the CIMVal Guidelines and noted that for these properties, the CIMVal Guidelines \"*advise in favor of the application of income- and market-based methodologies, and against the use of cost-based methodologies*.\"306 On that basis, the tribunal decided to consider the four methodologies presented by the claimant and decided to rely on a stock-market approach and a market multiples approach while discarding the other two valuation methodologies \u2013 none of which was a DCF methodology.307\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6\u00b6 883-884.\n\nThere is common ground that the \"*P/NAV method*\" presented by the claimant \"*resembled the conventional DCF approach*.\" Ripinsky I, \u00b6 65; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 87. While the *Crystallex* tribunal dismissed this method, it noted that \"*conceptually it would have not difficulties in accepting it as a method* per se\" but then dismissed it due to its disagreement with the valuation date selected by the claimant and its experts*, i.e*., on grounds specific to the facts of the case. *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 [CA-360], \u00b6 896.\n\n319.\n\nClaimant further relied on the tribunal in *Rusoro v. Venezuela*, which noted that \"[v]*aluations based on the DCF method have become usual in investment arbitrations, whenever the fair market value of an enterprise must be established*.\" It agreed that \"*where the circumstances for its use are appropriate, forward looking DCF has advantages over other, more backwards looking valuation methods*\" and held that \"*DCF works properly if all, or at least a significant part, of the following criteria are met*\":308 \"- *The enterprise has an established historical record of financial performance;*\n\n*- There are reliable projections of its future cash flow, ideally in the form of a detailed business plan adopted in tempore insuspecto, prepared by the company's officers and verified by an impartial expert;*\n\n*- The price at which the enterprise will be able to sell its products or services can be determined with reasonable certainty;*\n\n*- The business plan can be financed with self-generated cash, or, if additional cash is required, there must be no uncertainty regarding the availability of financing;*\n\n*- It is possible to calculate a meaningful WACC, including a reasonable country risk premium, which fairly represents the political risk in the host country;*\n\n*- The enterprise is active in a sector with low regulatory pressure, or, if the regulatory pressure is high, its scope and effects must be predictable: it should be possible to establish the impact of regulation on future cash flows with a minimum of certainty*.\"309\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6\u00b6 758-759.\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 759.\n\n320.\n\nThe *Rusoro* tribunal emphasized that DCF did not work in all circumstances and noted that \"[i]*f the estimation of those parameters is incorrect, the results will not represent the actual fair market value of the enterprise. Small adjustments in the estimation can yield significant divergences in the results*.\" It therefore considered it necessary that DCF valuations \"*be subjected to a* 'sanity check' *against other valuation methodologies*.\"310\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 760.\n\n321.\n\nThe *Rusoro* tribunal considered that neither of the parties' experts had in fact presented a \"*real DCF valuation*\" and considered the absence of such a DCF valuation \"*not an oversight, but rather the result of the very special characteristics surrounding Rusoro, which make the use of DCF approach inappropriate*.\"311 The tribunal referred to the following circumstances: (i) the claimant lacked a proven record of financial performance; (ii) the price of gold was very volatile and the expropriation occurred when gold was of its two historic peaks, which made it difficult to recreate market expectations on the expropriation date; (iii) there was no certainty whether the claimant would have been able to secure the financing for the required investment projected in its business plan; (iv) the country risk advocated by the claimant's expert was \"*clearly too low*\" and the WACC proposed by the respondent's expert was considered too high; (v) the Venezuelan gold sector had suffered increasing regulatory pressure which made it impossible to predict \"*with any certainty*\" the impact on future cash flows; and (vi) the claimant's mining rights had a definite term and while the DCF model assumed renewal, the tribunal had \"*significant doubts*\" whether that would be the case \"*given the uncertainty surrounding Venezuela*.\"312\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 785.\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 785.\n\n322.\n\nThe *Rusoro* tribunal therefore concluded that the DCF valuation was \"*not an appropriate basis for calculating the* 'genuine value' *of Rusoro*.\"313\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 786.\n\n323.\n\nIn *Khan Resources v. Mongolia*, the tribunal was presented with three different methodologies by the parties' experts, including a DCF valuation advocated by the claimants. The tribunal first agreed with the claimants that \"*in the case of a mine with proven reserves, the DCF method is often considered an appropriate methodology for calculating fair market value*\" but then held that \"*a number of additional factors and uncertainties*\" made the use of the DCF method \"*unattractive and speculative*\" in the case before it.314 The *Khan Resources* tribunal then specified that these \"*uncertainties*\" included: (i) how the project would have been financed; (ii) whether a strategic partner would have been brought in or whether the claimant would have been able to bring the project into production by itself; (iii) whether the claimant would have taken the project to production or sold it; (iv) when and how certain additional property would have been merged into the joint venture; and (v) the signing of various agreement such as an investment agreement and a new joint venture agreement \"*to finalise the commercial terms*\" of the project.315\n\n*Khan Resources Inc, Khan Resources BV and CAUC Holding Company Ltd v. Mongolia,* PCA Case No. 2011-09, Award on the Merits of 2 March 2015 [RLA-375], \u00b6 391.\n\n*Khan Resources Inc, Khan Resources BV and CAUC Holding Company Ltd v. Mongolia,* PCA Case No. 2011-09, Award on the Merits of 2 March 2015 [RLA-375], \u00b6 392.\n\n324.\n\nThe *Khan Resources* tribunal did not agree with the respondent that these factors rendered the project worthless in the claimant's hands but held that \"[t]*he combination of these factors \u2026 does mean that the level of certainty required for the DCF method to be used has not been attained*.\" In particular, the tribunal considered it \"*far from certain: (i) whether the mine would actually have reached production; (ii) if it did, on what terms the parties would have participated in the venture; and (iii) whether the Claimants would still have been involved in the Dornod Project at all*.\" It therefore concluded that \"*the DCF method is inappropriate and that any damages calculated through it would be too speculative.*\"316\n\n*Khan Resources Inc, Khan Resources BV and CAUC Holding Company Ltd v. Mongolia,* PCA Case No. 2011-09, Award on the Merits of 2 March 2015 [RLA-375], \u00b6 393.\n\n325.\n\nThe *Khan Resources* tribunal did not adopt any of the three methodologies presented by the parties' experts but considered that \"*the true value of Khan's investment is better reflected by the offers made for the mine or for Khan Canada's shares in and around the relevant period than by the more traditional methodologies advanced by the Parties*.\"317\n\n*Khan Resources Inc, Khan Resources BV and CAUC Holding Company Ltd v. Mongolia,* PCA Case No. 2011-09, Award on the Merits of 2 March 2015 [RLA-375], \u00b6 390.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties also made repeated reference to the award rendered in *Bear Creek v. Peru*. In that case, the claimant had also presented a valuation calculated by the DCF method and the tribunal assessed whether \"*having regard to the factual circumstances of this case, a willing buyer might have been found who would have paid a price calculated by the DCF method, as Claimant alleges*.\" It answered this question in the negative, stating:\n\n\"*The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant has provided sufficient evidence in support of its claim that a hypothetical purchaser of the Santa Ana Project would have been able to obtain the necessary social license to be able to proceed with the Project, if it had been provided an opportunity to invest the necessary time and resources. Given the extent of the opposition, and the reasons for it, the Tribunal doubts that the Project could, in the short term at least, be considered to be viable by the time Supreme Decree 032 [i.e.,* the measure which the tribunal found to be in violation of the respondent's obligations under the treaty] *was adopted.*\n\n*The Tribunal notes that the Santa Ana Project was still at an early stage and that it had not received many of the government approvals and environmental permits it needed to proceed. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal concludes that there was little prospect for the Project to obtain the necessary social license to allow it to proceed to operation, even assuming it had received all necessary environmental and other permits. The Tribunal notes that no similar projects operated in the same area, and there was no evidence to support a track record of successful operation or profitability in the future*.\"318\n\n*Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/2, Award of 30 November 2017 [CA-432], \u00b6\u00b6 599-600.\n\n327.\n\nThe *Bear Creek* tribunal also made reference to the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina*, which held:\n\n\"*In the Tribunal's view, the likelihood of lost profits must be sufficiently established by Claimants in order to be the basis of compensable damages. The Tribunal also recognises that in an appropriate case, a claimant might be able to establish the likelihood of lost profits with sufficient certainty even in the absence of a genuine going concern. For example, a claimant might be able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances*.\"319\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007 [RLA-398], \u00b6 8.3.4.\n\n328.\n\nThe *Vivendi* tribunal found that the claimant had failed to establish \"*with a sufficient degree of certainty*\" that the concession in question would have been profitable because the claimant had \"*never made a profit whilst it had operational control of the concession.*\" It again noted that \"*the absence of a history of demonstrated profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF valuation methodology. But to overcome the hurdle of its absence, a claimant must lead convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced*.\"320 It concluded that the evidence adduced by the claimants in this regard was deficient because in the absence of a record of demonstrated profitability of the project itself, the claimants would have been required \"*to present a thoroughly prepared record of its (or others) successes, based on first hand experience (its own or that of qualified experts) or corporate records which establish on the balance of the probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in question in the face of the particular risks involved, other than those of Treaty violation*.\"321\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007 [RLA-398], \u00b6\u00b6 8.3.5, 8.3.7, 8.3.8.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

The first key question is whether, based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is convinced that in the absence of Respondent's breaches, the project would have become operational and would also have become profitable. The second key question is whether the Tribunal is convinced that it can, with reasonable confidence, determine the amount of these profits based on the inputs provided by the Parties' experts for this calculation. If the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that there are \"*fundamental uncertainties*\" due to which it is not convinced that the project would have reached the operational stage and would have been able to generate profits, it cannot apply the DCF method. If it reaches the conclusion that no such \"*fundamental uncertainties*\" preclude reliance on the DCF method but is not convinced by the inputs provided by the Parties' experts, it may conclude that it cannot apply the DCF method or it may conclude that certain deductions have to be made to account for additional risks or uncertainties faced by the project.\n\n331.\n\nAs for the first question, the Tribunal considers that for the reasons to be set out in more detail below, Claimant has established that if Respondent had not denied TCCP's Mining Lease Application in violation of Respondent's obligation under the Treaty, the Reko Diq project would have gone forward and become operational and profitable in due course. More specifically, the Tribunal is convinced that based on the Feasibility Study that Claimant delivered to the GOB on 26 August 2010 and the commitment shown by Claimant as well as its two owners, Antofagasta and Barrick, Claimant would have been able to obtain the necessary funds and would also have brought the necessary experience to successfully execute the project in Balochistan.\n\n332.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's allegation that the Feasibility Study \"*was a blueprint for another Mega Project failure*.\"324 In the Tribunal's view, the fact that the Feasibility Study was produced at a time when Claimant and its owners were determined to proceed with the project and the fact that its owners combined their impressive experience in operating copper mines and in operating gold mines across the globe, had been sponsoring and overseeing the project during its exploration stage, and were willing to contribute large further amounts of equity into the project, are very strong indications that they believed that this project would become operational and profitable. The Feasibility Study itself was the result of several years of intensive work on the ground, which was overseen by both of Claimant's owners and in which numerous outside consultants and companies participated. To suggest that the team conducting the exploration work and compiling the Feasibility Study had no idea what they were doing is not credible, in particular considering that Antofagasta and Barrick were investing large amounts of equity as well as seconding their own personnel for the project.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 108.\n\n333.\n\nThis does not mean that the Tribunal intends to brush off the risks and issues pointed out by Respondent, in particular the risks associated with water, security and a social license to operate, or that the Tribunal necessarily follows each assumption made by Claimant and its expert on the costs associated with these risks. The Tribunal also takes note of a remaining uncertainty whether and, if so on what terms, Claimant would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Governments. However, the Tribunal considers it established that neither of these risks or uncertainties constitutes a \"*fundamental uncertainty*\" that would have stopped the project or rendered it unprofitable.\n\n334.\n\nConsequently, the second question is whether the inputs for a DCF calculation presented by the Parties' experts provide the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to determine the future cash flows of Claimant's investment with a reasonable amount of confidence. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that while Respondent's experts have criticized numerous assumptions and inputs used by Prof. Davis, they have in most cases not provided the Tribunal with what they would consider adequate inputs and they have not performed their own DCF calculation. While they purported to convert Prof. Davis' analysis to a traditional DCF to demonstrate that the internal rate of return would be too low for an investor,325 the Tribunal is not convinced that this was an adequate conversion and could be used for comparison purposes.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, Section VI.\n\n335.\n\nAs will be set out in more detail below, the Tribunal considers that certain adjustments have to be made to the inputs used by Prof. Davis in his calculation. In the Tribunal's view, however, none of these adjustments warrants the conclusion that the DCF method cannot produce a sufficiently reliable result. To the contrary, the Tribunal is convinced that in the particular circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to assume that Claimant's investment would have become profitable and to determine these future profits by using a DCF method.\n\n**ii. Whether It Is Appropriate to Value the Reko Diq Project Based on the Modern DCF Method Presented by Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nHaving reached a conclusion on the appropriateness to determine the value of Claimant's investment by using a forward-looking DCF methodology, the Tribunal will now assess whether Claimant has also established that the Tribunal should use the modern DCF approach used by its expert Prof. Davis.\n\n337.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that neither Party has presented a valuation based on a traditional DCF analysis conducted for the purposes of this arbitration with inputs as of the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells merely referred to the \"*conventional DCF calculations of the SNC-Lavalin analyses*\" completed in 2010 and, without updating them to the valuation date, concluded on their basis that \"*the project would not attract a rational private investor and therefore has a Fair Market Value of zero*.\"326 In the Tribunal's view, the conclusion that the project did not have any value is simply not credible. The Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study had confirmed that Reko Diq contained enormous mineral resources and had further demonstrated how these could be extracted and processed to be sold on the metals markets. Contemporaneous statements made by Government officials as well as by Dr. Mubarakmand who led the GOB's own project demonstrate that the Governments shared the belief at the time that the mine was going to be very lucrative and attractive commercially. Based on the results of the Feasibility and Pre-Feasibility Studies, Claimant and its owners were willing to commit substantial financial and personnel resources in order to bring this project into operation.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 166.\n\n338.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the only reliable indication of the result that a traditional DCF analysis might have produced if it had been performed is Prof. Davis' update of the calculation included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility. According to Prof. Davis, his update of prices and costs to reflect conditions as of the valuation date yielded a net present value of USD 3.02 billion for Claimant's share of the project.327 By contrast, the modern DCF method he applied resulted in a net present value of USD 8.5 billion.328\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 302.\n\nDavis II, Table 5.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it established that a traditional DCF calculation conducted for this arbitration would have necessarily produced the same result as the updated calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which was performed for a different purpose and did not aim at calculating the fair market value of the project. However, given that the Tribunal has not been provided with a traditional DCF calculation, or any other income-based calculation for that matter, it will bear the result of this calculation in mind when verifying whether its conclusion on the value of Claimant's investment is reasonable and reconcilable with other indications of value at the time.\n\n340.\n\nAs for the modern DCF valuation presented by Claimant, the Tribunal takes note of Prof. Davis' explanation as to why he considers that the modern DCF method is superior to the traditional DCF method specifically for long-life projects in the mining sector. In his view, there are \"*four main shortcomings of the traditional DCF method when applied to to calculating the fair market valuation of mining projects*\": (i) there is no market-based information for the main price and cost drivers of the project for 50 years or more into the future; (ii) there is no reasonable way of knowing how the market would discount the risk in each cash flow for a specific mining project but the standard approach uses market signals from the industry as a whole and uses a constant risk-adjusted discount rate which compounds over the years even though the risk of long-life mining projects is more or less constant over time; (iii) the method underestimates the project's tax cash flows and therefore overestimates net cash flows; and (iv) there is no simulation accounting for the possibility of the project's managers to respond to changing conditions by making appropriate operational decisions.329\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 71-80.\n\n341.\n\nIn particular with regard to the second alleged shortcoming, Prof. Davis illustrated the effect of using a risk-adjusted, compounding discount rate for a project that expects to receive cash flows over 50 years into the future as follows:\n\n342.\n\nProf. Davis then explained the advantages of the modern DCF method as follows:\n\n*\"The modern DCF method overcomes these limitations in cash flow estimation and cash flow risk discounting through two innovations. First, it uses forward market transactions as a signal of market participants\u2019 expectations about future mining prices and costs along with their risk preferences over the uncertainty in those prices and costs. Second, it simulates over a wide range of possible cash flow outcomes in order to correctly capture the varying impacts of taxes and managerial actions on the project\u2019s expected net cash flows. The use of forward markets to assess project cash flow risk is the most profound change, doing away with the overall, exogenously imposed and often highly contentious project level discount rate. In this sense it is a true market-based approach that provides a market asset valuation, exactly what is desired for a FMV.\"330*\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 82.\n\n343.\n\nIn short, Prof. Davis stated that he applied at-source pricing of risk using forward markets, thereby avoiding the use of a constant risk-adjusted discount rate, and simulated key project variables to capture the impact of taxes and of active management decisions on cash flows and thereby project value. As he considers to have included all relevant risks in the cash flows themselves, he discounts the cash flows at the risk-free rate.331\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 83.\n\n344.\n\nRespondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells recognized that \"*there are elements of the model that are useful, like the probability distributions of several key indicators*.\" In their view, however, the model conceals the \"*fragility*\" of the project because it uses an average of all simulations and ignores, for example, the significant probability of a negative NPV.332 They also question whether the model actually performs a risk adjustment at source and deny that the projections made by Prof. Davis based on futures prices actually result in risk-adjusted prices and argue that these are in fact higher than non-adjusted price forecasts made by Consensus Economics. On that basis, they also consider it inappropriate to discount the calculated cash flows based on a risk-free rate.333 In their view, the lack of adequate risk adjustments is confirmed by a comparison to the studies conducted by SNC Lavalin, in particular the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which undisputedly does not contain at-source risk adjustments.334 Following further explanation, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells conclude that \"*the valuation presented by Claimant as* 'modern' *is really very little more than the traditional DCF approach with an inflated price of output and a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate*.\"335\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 76-80.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 82-84; Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 87 and Figure 1; Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 59.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 175.\n\n345.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the main issue in dispute between the Parties' experts is whether the modern DCF method accurately accounts for all the risks associated with a project and whether it is therefore reasonable to discount the risk-adjusted cash flows only for the time value of money, *i.e*., by using a risk-free rate.\n\n346.\n\nProf. Davis explained that the modern DCF model permits to distinguish between: (i) systematic risks, such as production quantities and copper, gold and oil prices which may go up but may also go down; and (ii) asymmetric risks, such as a terrorist attack on the project which may affect the project without any upside potential. According to Prof. Davis, the modern DCF method accounts for asymmetric risks by adjusting the cash flow components affected by these risks such that they reflect the statistically expected outcome, *e.g*., a certain probability that a terrorist attack will occur. As for systematic risk, he explained that production quantities in mines generally do not require an adjustment for uncertainty and that for copper and gold prices, the modern DCF can resort to \"*very good market signals as to how the market values such risks*.\"336\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 40-48. Prof. Davis also referred to a third category of risk, i.e., unsystematic risk, but explained that it is a \"*fundamental principle of valuation*\" that diversification eliminates the need to adjust discount rates for unsystematic risks. Davis II, \u00b6 45. This category of risks did not form the subject of dispute between the Parties' experts.\n\n347.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that the modern DCF method is not used in the mining industry, Prof. Davis referred to a letter sent by the Special Committee of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral Properties (CIMVal) to the International Valuation Standards Council in response to certain questions the latter had raised in a discussion paper in 2012.337 The Tribunal considers it common ground that CIMVal, which is comprised of experts in mineral project valuation, and that the Standards and Guidelines it issues, reflect international best practices.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 1.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal attaches importance to the CIMVal opinion because it is good evidence of the valuation methodology likely in practice to have been used by an actual buyer in the limited market for large-scale mining enterprises at the relevant time. The Tribunal would observe that it is not engaged in applying rules of valuation claimed to be derived from decisions in other cases. Nor is it concerned with what an expert, however eminent, considers would have been the best method of valuation. Its task is to make the best estimation of what, on the assumption that Respondent had honored its Treaty obligations, would actually have happened if Reko Diq had been offered for sale in the open market. If in practice a buyer was most likely to have adopted the methodology recommended in the CIMVal opinion, it is irrelevant that an expert considers that some other methodology would have been better. The Tribunal therefore considers it worth reviewing the CIMVal opinion on the modern DCF approach in more detail.\n\n349.\n\nAs for general valuation methods to be used, CIMVal confirmed that for \"*Reserves undergoing development*,\" it most commonly uses or encounters the income approach. For \"*Reserves and resources subject to exploration*\", it distinguished between early stage exploration properties and more advanced stage exploration properties \"*where there is at least a preliminary information on mine design, technical feasibility, and geological information on structure, material amount and metal concentration of the deposit*.\"338 In the Tribunal's view, the Reko Diq project would satisfy at least the definition of an advanced stage exploration property, for which CIMVal most commonly uses or encounters market or income approaches.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 4-5.\n\n350.\n\nCIMVal then described two types of income-based approaches: (i) a \"*standard*\" DCF approach; and (ii) a \"*Certainty-Equivalent*\" DCF approach, which corresponds to what Prof. Davis has labelled the \"*modern DCF*\" approach:\n\n\"*We generally use the income approach where there is sufficient information available to estimate future cash flows generated by a metals-related investment. \u2026*\n\n*An income-based valuation framework is applied across all of these asset-types in a manner that conforms to generally accepted valuation principles and, depending on the situation, is consistent with valuation principles in accounting guidelines such as IFRS. The Discounted Cash Flow ('DCF') method is used to adjust cash flow for risk and timing. However, these adjustments may be applied in one of two means. The first follows a standard DCF adjustment where net cash flow is adjusted for risk and time through a discounting process that relies on an aggregate discount rate. The second is a Certainty Equivalent ('CeQ DCF') approach where a risk-adjusted net cash flow is calculated by applying a targeted risk adjustment to particular cash flow component (e.g., a pure copper risk adjustment applied to a copper based revenue stream). This risk-adjusted net cash flow is then adjusted for the time value of money and possibly a residual risk adjustment for uncertainties not explicitly accounted in the cash flow model. \u2026 We may then augment our cash flow model by modelling metal price and other uncertainties with a numerical technique (e.g., lattice techniques or simulation) to correct for biases created in a cash flow estimate by contingent cash flow structures the result of risk management, management flexibility, financing and taxation considerations.*\n\n*We note that the CeQ DCF approach was not discussed in the Exposure Draft of the IVSC Technical Information Paper titled* 'The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method - Real Property and Business Valuations' *even though this method is a recognized DCF method for fair value estimates under accounting guidelines and well supported in valuation and finance theory literature. CeQ DCF is one of the approaches described in IFRS 13. We would highlight that the structure of the CeQ DCF approach is comparable to derivative valuation methods used to value many financial assets and is used for select types of real assets such as natural resource projects*.\"339\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 5-6.\n\n351.\n\nFollowing a description of other approaches, CIMVal concluded:\n\n\"*Our experience has been that all of these methods provide valuation results that are supportable when applied with professionalism and discipline. We generally do not use a particular method in isolation and generally confirm the results from one approach with the results from a second approach.*\n\n*We commonly use DCF and comparable transactions (market approach) for producing reserves, reserves undergoing development and for reserves subject to exploration (whatever that means). For resources, we generally use comparable transactions and for exploration properties without reserves or resources, we use comparable transactions and the cost approach. As a valuator, these methods make the most sense and provide reasonable valuations that seem to reflect the market*.\"340\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 6.\n\n352.\n\nIn the context of a more detailed description of its practice in using inputs for a DCF calculation, CIMVal noted that \"[v]*ery long-life base metal asset may require that long-term cash flows be explicitly modeled with a CeQ DCF approach because of price reversion in base metal prices (i.e. the tendency of metal price to revert to a long-term equilibrium level). This approach may be used if in the particular situation a standard DCF model with aggregate risk adjustments to the net cash flow has difficulty recognizing the explicit risk characteristics of a cash flow stream*.\"341\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 7-8.\n\n353.\n\nAs for the use of forward price curves that Prof. Davis used to derive price inputs for his model, CIMVal stated:\n\n\"*We believe that in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast may be derived from its forward price curve. A forward price is the price at which two parties agree to sell or buy a set amount of commodity at a specific time in the future. The forward price is considered a risk-adjusted expected price since a party choosing to buy or sell a commodity in the future would first need to estimate what the spot price might be and then adjust this estimated price for variance around the forecast (i.e., applying a risk adjustment). The risk adjustment is used to back out a forecast commodity price from a forward curve based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (*'CAPM' ).\"342\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 8.\n\n354.\n\nCIMVal noted that \"*some mining professionals oppose the use of forward curves in metal price forecasts. This opposition is often supported by citing concerns about liquidity, incomplete forward curves, or the observation that a forward price is a mathematical calculation*.\" It explained, however, that \"*these reasons do not prevent the use of forward curves in generating a price forecast since they would also invalidate the use of derivative methods when generating cash flows and estimating value in a wide range of valuation problems*.\" It noted that the decision on which information should be used is made on the facts and circumstances of the valuation problem. It further confirmed that \"[m]*etal price forecasts based on the forward curve may be extended beyond the publicly quoted prices based on the characteristics of the metal (base metal or precious metal) and the market characteristics of the forward curve*.\"343\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 8.\n\n355.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the statements made by CIMVal in its detailed response to the International Valuation Standards Council are a strong indication that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, the certainty-equivalent or modern DCF method applied by Prof. Davis is a recognized valuation method which is used in the industry for valuing mining properties in the appropriate circumstances. The Tribunal also considers that the explanation provided by CIMVal confirms Prof. Davis' statement as to why the application of the modern DCF method is reasonable and preferable over a traditional DCF method for the valuation of the Reko Diq project in the present circumstances. The Feasibility Study envisaged a 56-year life of the mine.344 As indicated in Prof. Davis' illustration of cash flows calculated under the traditional DCF method, cash flows to be generated fourty years into the future would have almost no net present value if they were discounted by a constant, compounding discount rate incorporating all types of risk that may affect the project. This issue, *i.e*., that this treatment of risk does not capture the actual amount of risk because cash flows actually do not become more risky over time but the risk level remains more or less constant over the life of the mine because base metal prices tend to revert to a long-term equilibrium level, was specifically identified by CIMVal as one of the reasons that \"*may require*\" the use of a certainty-equivalent or modern DCF approach as it was applied by Prof. Davis in the present case.\n\n**Exhibit CE-97 / RE-576/1**, p. 1-2 and Table 1.2.\n\n356.\n\nFrom the Tribunal's perspective, it further makes sense to distinguish between different types of risk and adjust each cash flow component directly for the risks that affect this particular cash flow. While this approach may be associated with some uncertainties, *e.g*., regarding the projection of future metals prices, CIMVal pointed out that these uncertainties also affect the traditional DCF method and therefore do not justify rejecting this method or the use of risk-adjusted prices. In the Tribunal's view, any remaining uncertainties associated with the adjustment of risks at source are controllable by making reasonable, and perhaps conservative, assumptions and they are preferable to applying a discount rate that results in almost no net present value for cash flows that would be generated in the second half of the mine's life.\n\n357.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Prof. Davis' oral testimony in response to the question whether the approach he had presented would actually have been used in the market at the relevant time, *i.e*., at the valuation date. Mr. Davis responded that it is a known problem in the industry that the traditional income approach produces results which the valuer knows to be wrong and that the discount rate is therefore lowered or the result multiplied if the number is biased low or the other way around if the number is biased high. He explained that the industry had a demand for valuing an asset of whose value they had an idea but did not have a tool to get to that value.345 Prof. Davis concluded his answer by stating:\n\n\"*So, I believe these market participants get to their $8.5 billion just in this case by looking at, perhaps, the traditional and perhaps, the modern. The modern just is a more direct, I would say, an accurate way of getting to that number without having to do these little fixes\u2026 -- as opposed to the traditional*.\"346\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum, p. 2371 line 8 to p. 2372 line 14.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum, p. 2372 line 16 to p. 2373 line 2.\n\n358.\n\nWhile Respondent takes the position that this testimony confirms that the modern DCF approach permits Claimant to arrive at a predetermined value, the Tribunal considers that the opposite is in fact the case. Prof. Davis explained that the methodology he uses has been developed precisely in order to avoid the practical \"*fixes*\" that are sometimes used the industry in order to arrive at a value within the range of what they consider reasonable. Specifically in the present case, the method does away with the need to \"*fix*\" the fact that a compounding risk-adjusted discount rate eliminates any net present value of cash flows in the second half of the mine's life by instead using a scientific approach to adjust the risk at source.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument, which appears to be undisputed by Claimant, that the certainty-equivalent or modern DCF approach has so far not been adopted by any investment arbitration tribunal in determining the amount of damages owed to a claimant that suffered an expropriation of a mining project. It further appears to be undisputed that there was only one case in which a modern DCF approach was presented by one of the parties, *i.e*., by the respondent in *Bear Creek v. Peru*. In that case, it was presented as a comparison to the traditional DCF calculation presented by the claimant. As the tribunal in that case did not consider it appropriate to value the claimant's investment based on an income-based methodology, it did not express an opinion on the modern DCF approach.\n\n360.\n\nIn any event, however, the Tribunal considers that the absence of investment treaty jurisprudence \u2013 affirmative or negative \u2013 does not in itself constitute a valid ground for rejecting a valuation method if the Tribunal is otherwise convinced that it is sound to apply it in the present case. As valuation practices for mineral properties develop in the industry itself, the assessment of damages may likewise evolve in investment treaty arbitration. As correctly pointed out by Claimant, the use of the traditional DCF method was even rejected in early jurisprudence but then became more and more common and established for the assessment of damages in investment treaty arbitration. The Tribunal also recalls that the appropriate valuation method can only be selected in the circumstances of each individual case and based on the submissions and evidence brought before the respective tribunal.\n\n361.\n\nBased on its review of the evidentiary record, the Tribunal concludes that it is appropriate to value Claimant's investment in the Reko Diq project by using the modern DCF approach presented by Claimant and its expert Prof. Davis. This does not yet mean that it also agrees with Prof. Davis that each of the risk adjustments he has made is sufficient to account for the risks and uncertainties raised by Respondent. These aspects will be addressed in more detail below.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal will also assess whether Prof. Davis has used reasonable inputs to account for systematic risks, in particular regarding the development of copper and gold prices. The Tribunal notes that CIMVal generally supports the use of forward curves, including their extension beyond publicly quoted prices. The Tribunal therefore does not follow Respondent's general rejection of using forward curves as a basis for projecting risk-adjusted prices. However, the Tribunal will assess whether it is established that the risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis is sufficient. In that context, the Tribunal will also address the comparison drawn by Respondent's experts to the DCF calculation in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which undisputedly used non-adjusted prices.\n\n363.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal will address the argument raised by Respondent and its expert that it was incorrect for Prof. Davis to use a risk-free rate to discount the cash flows because these cash flows are not, or at least not fully, adjusted for risk. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of CIMVal's explanation in the context of selecting discount rates for valuing reserves and resources that the certainty-equivalent DCF approach \"*does not make use of an aggregate discount rate though an implied aggregate discount rate can be derived*\" but instead \"*uses targeted risk-adjustments for select cash flow components. These adjustments are done within the CAPM framework. Market related uncertainties such as metal and energy prices are risk-adjusted with the CAPM while project-specific uncertainties may be modelled directly with no risk-adjustment.*\"347 At the same time, CIMVal stated:\n\n\"*A residual risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk-adjusted cash flows for risk not explicitly recognized in the model before a final adjustment for the time value of money. The residual risk adjustment is similar in nature to a Credit Valuation Adjustment applied in derivative valuation for counter-party risk*.\"348\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 10-11.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 11.\n\n364.\n\nAs confirmed by CIMVal, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Davis that it is, in principle, consistent to use a risk-free rate which discounts cash flows only for the time value of money, if they have already been fully adjusted for risk. However, in line with the explanation provided by CIMVal, the Tribunal will assess whether it may be necessary to apply a residual risk adjustment for risk not explicitly or not sufficiently recognized in Prof. Davis' model.\n\n365.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal maintains and considers its opinion confirmed by CIMVal, which explained that generally a valuation method should not be used in isolation but should be confirmed by the results of a second approach. As already noted above, the Tribunal has not been presented with many alternatives for this purpose. It will nevertheless verify at the end of its analysis whether the conclusion it has reached based on the modern DCF approach used by Prof. Davis is reconcilable with the other valuations and/or indications of value of the project that have been brought before this Tribunal.\n\n**C. Impact of the Risks and Issues Raised by Respondent on the Feasibility of the Project and/or the Value of Claimant's Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nHaving determined the relevant legal standards, the Tribunal will now assess whether Claimant has established that it would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Federal and Provincial Governments and, if so, the terms on which such an agreement would likely have been concluded. The Tribunal will further examine whether Claimant has established the feasibility of the project and address the various risks and issues raised by Respondent in this last phase of the arbitration proceedings. As the Tribunal has decided, in principle, to follow the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, it will also assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for each of these risks in his valuation of the project.\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these issues in turn.\n\n**1. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Would Have Concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Governments on the Terms Assumed in the Valuation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will assess whether Claimant has established that it would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Provincial and Federal Governments and, if so, whether this Agreement would have been concluded on the terms that Prof. Davis was instructed to assume in his valuation.\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nClaimant takes the position that if the Governments had continued to negotiate in good faith, the parties would have entered into a \"*mutually beneficial and commercially reasonable*\" Mineral Agreement and the question remained only on what terms.349 According to Claimant, an agreement would most likely have been reached in 2009 but, in any event, \"*almost certainly*\" after Claimant had secured the mining lease because, as found by the Tribunal, it would have been in \"*a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining lease over the area than it was before*\" and there would have been \"*a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues.*\"350 Claimant further claims that the fiscal terms included in Prof. Davis' model are \"*a fair basis for estimating the terms that would have applied to the Reko Diq project*\" in the absence of Balochistan's unlawful decision \"***not** to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholders agreements with TCCP*.\"351\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 48; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 235.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 58, *quoting from* Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1235 (Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1239).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 156, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16 (emphasis in original).\n\n370.\n\nClaimant notes that before the takeover decision, the parties made progress in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and all three parties were committed to reaching \"*a mutually agreeable deal*.\" Claimant points out that \"*Pakistan's key negotiator*,\" Mr. Khokhar, stated in March 2009 that \"*about 85% work on* [the draft Mineral Agreement] *has been completed*.\"352 Claimant also rejects the allegation that TCCA backed away from negotiations in October 2008, which it considers to be contradicted by the contemporaneous record, and points to a number of proposals, which it continued to make in 2009, such as: (i) an enhanced sliding-scale royalty; (ii) \"*a custom suite of tax concessions*\" instead of the EPZ regime; (iii) restructuring of Balochistan's interest as a net profit interest; (iv) payment of USD 1 million towards a feasibility study for Balochistan's proposed smelter; and (v) a Social Investment Plan involving an investment of USD 100 million.353\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 47; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 157, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-338**.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 158.\n\n371.\n\nClaimant adds that that while it continued to engage with the Governments and make updated proposals until October 2010, the Governments had decided to develop their own project and, as the Tribunal already found, after the takeover decision, \"*no actual negotiations took place but only high-level meetings in which Claimant was assured that there was no competing project*.\"354 According to Claimant, \"[t]*he documentary record thus leaves no doubt that the failure of the negotiations is directly attributable to Balochistan's illegal takeover decision*.\"355\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 159-161, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1148.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 162.\n\n372.\n\nClaimant rejects the argument that it impaired the negotiations through \"*its own heavy-handed actions*\" or that it asked federal officials to force the GOB into an agreement or that it sought to \"*push the GoB aside*.\" It also denies that the concessions it was seeking were aimed at eliminating the application of the 2002 BM Rules. In addition, Claimant rejects the allegation that it had abandoned the negotiations or did not expect a Mineral Agreement given the uncertainty recognized in the Feasiblity Study, arguing that this risk assessment was made after Balochistan had already decided to take over Reko Diq.356\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 163-167.\n\n373.\n\nClaimant argues that at the time the negotiations were abandoned due to the takeover decision of the GOB, the parties had already reached agreement \"*on the most fundamental issue, namely that the fiscal regime could and would be stabilized*.\" Claimant bases this argument on contemporaneous statements made by the Steering Committee for the Development of Reko Diq Gold-Copper Project (the \"**Steering Committee**\") as well as by Mr. Khokhar and contends that \"[t]*here is no evidence that Balochistan ever changed its position on stability following that agreement*.\"357 According to Claimant, entering into a stability agreement would also have been consistent with assurances received by Claimant from \"*the highest levels of Government*\" as well as the Governments' history and policy of entering into similar agreements with other investors.358\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-717**, \u00b6 4(i) *and* **Exhibit CE-942**, pp. 10, 3. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 59, *quoting from* **Exhibits RE-64**, p. 2 *and* **RE-145**, p. 2\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 49-52\n\n374.\n\nClaimant also submits that its proposals were based on the understanding that the Governments intended to further modernize their regulatory regime and notes that the amendments it had proposed in the negotiations were in fact implemented in the 2013 National Mineral Policy which declared that mineral agreements should have \"*overriding effect in case anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules subsequently amended*\" and provided that \"[t]*he existing Mineral Rules will be amended to remove any conflict/overlapping with or other effect on, and to give effect to, the rights and obligations of the mining company under the mineral agreement in line with best international practices*.\"359 Claimant points to the Tribunal's previous finding that in the negotiations, Claimant desired \"*to correct a* 'defect' *in the 2002 BM Rules*,\" which was then \"*identified and corrected \u2026 in* [the] *2013 NMP*.\"360\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 54; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 231, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-416**, \u00b6 7.8.2.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 165, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 961.\n\n375.\n\nAccording to Claimant, stabilization of the fiscal regime \"*was its primary objective and was far more important than any single concession.*\" Claimant argues that once it had secured stability, it was willing to compromise on specific tax and royalty rates and would therefore have reached a \"*mutually beneficial agreement*\" with the Goverments.361\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 232.\n\n376.\n\nClaimant adds that once it would have received a Mining Lease, the Governments would have had \"*a strong incentive*\" to negotiate and refers to the Tribunal's finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in this regard.362 Claimant further refers to its financial expert Mr. Pingle who testified that \"[t]*he involvement of the Development Finance Institutions and the Export Credit Agencies \u2026 facilitates resolutions of some of the outstanding issues \u2026 like the tax regime*.\"363 In Claimant's view, the absence of a Mineral Agreement on the valuation date would therefore not have been fatal to the project.364\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 233, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1239.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 234, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2126-2127. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6\u00b6 216, 213.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 169.\n\n377.\n\nClaimant rejects the argument that under rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules, its right to negotiate a mineral agreement would have expired three months after the issuance of the Mining Lease. It argues that the three-month period starts only once the Mineral Agreement is \"*present*[ed] *for signature*,\" regardless of when the Mining Lease is issued.365\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 168, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 46(2).\n\n378.\n\nAs for the fiscal terms of the Mineral Agreement that its expert Prof. Davis used in its model, Claimant contends that these were the terms on which the Governments and TCC would likely have agreed but for the Governments' takeover and abandonment of negotiations: (i) a 2% provincial royalty; (ii) EPZ status for the first 15 years followed by the normal tax regime; (iii) extension of TCCP's mining lease for the life of the mine; and (iv) participation by Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest. Claimant argues that these terms are supported by the progress that the parties had already made in the negotiations and the concessions granted to other projects in Balochistan.366\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 236-237.\n\n379.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the parties had already agreed in the negotiations that the mining lease would be renewed for the life of the mine. Claimant refers to Balochistan's proposal to constrain its discretion under the 2002 BM Rules such that a second term \"*shall not be unreasonably withheld*.\"367 In Claimant's view, the GOB gave no indication that the first term would be shorter than thirty years and that it would not extend the lease for the life of the project \"*absent good reason*,\" thereby creating a presumption in favor of renewal.368 It claims that in subsequent face-to-face negotiations, Balochistan \"*went a step further*\" and agreed to renew the mining lease for the life of the mine as confirmed by contemporaneous correspondence and negotiation minutes as well as the witness testimony of Ms. Boggs.369 In addition, Claimant refers to the GOB's obligation under the CHEJVA to provide \"*appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining all leases \u2026 being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture Activities*\" and considers that a refusal to renew the Mining Lease would also have been contrary to the GOB's contractual obligations as well as to Claimant's legitimate expectation that the license would be renewed.370 Claimant further submits that mining lease renewal is common in the mining industry because a lack of security of tenure would disincentivize the lease holder from making further investments and the bidding process for a new operator can be time-consuming and costly \u2013 without any guarantee of finding a suitable candidate willing to enter into an agreement more favorable to the Government. According to Claimant, Governments therefore generally allow investors the option for renewal.371 Claimant further argues that it would have been \"*entirely reasonable*\" for Balochistan to agree to the renewal \"*to ensure an uninterrupted flow of revenue to the Province from the project*.\"372\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 190; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 238-239, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-226**, clause 14.2.1(iii).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 191-193.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 239, *quoting from* **Exhibits CE-238**, p. 3 *and* **CE-942**, p. 13; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 72; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 194, *quoting from* Boggs V, \u00b6 48.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 73, 76, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1**, clause 24.6.2.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 195, *quoting from* Boggs V, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 240, *quoting from* Boggs V, \u00b6 49. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 74, *quoting from* Boggs V, \u00b6 50.\n\n380.\n\nClaimant further considers it likely that the Reko Diq project would have received EPZ status \"*or its functional equivalent*,\" at least during the \"*initial capital-intensive*\" years of the project. Claimant emphasizes that each of the other mining projects in the region had received EPZ status: the Tanjeel project proposed by Mincor Resources NL (\"**Mincor**\") in 2004; the Duddar and Saindak projects in 2001 and 2004, respectively (both extended beyond their initial ten-year term); and Balochistan's competing Reko Diq project. Claimant rejects the argument that it abandoned its request for EPZ status in negotiations and argues that it was willing to explore alternatives but continued to believe that it would receive \"*certain of the benefits of an EPZ regime.*\"373 According to Claimant, the final package of concessions could have been \"*a custom suite of modifications to the normal tax regime rather than an EPZ designation*,\" but maintains that the \"*combined tax regime*\" assumed by Prof. Davis is \"*a reasonable approximation*\" of the fiscal terms on which the parties would likely have agreed.374 Claimant further argues that if Balochistan had remained \"*a true partner to TCC*,\" it would have advocated for EPZ status because it stood to gain from it, as Balochistan itself argued in its submissions before the Balochistan High Court.375 As for Pakistan, Claimant points out that the Federal Government was interested in encouraging foreign direct investment in the extractive industry as well as in improving relations with Balochistan. In addition, it would have received significant tax revenues after the expiration of the EPZ term \u2013 according to Prof. Davis' calculations nearly 30% of the project's cash flows. Furthermore, Claimant considers that the EPZ regime was specifically intended for projects like the Reko Diq project, which it considers to be \"*ideal candidate for EPZ status*\" as it \"*promised to provide employment and a boost to Pakistan's exports*.\"376 Claimant also submits that granting EPZ status would have been consistent with specific assurances it received from the highest levels of the GOP.377\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 241-243, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-145**, p. 3; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 66-68; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 176, 178.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 777.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 70; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 179; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 244, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-212**, p. 12, \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 68, 71; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 180; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 245-246, *referring to* Davis II, Table 5.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 69.\n\n381.\n\nFinally, Claimant claims that the parties would most likely have agreed on a stabilization of the provincial royalty at a rate of 2%. In Claimant's view, Mr. Khokhar confirmed during the Hearing on Quantum that while the royalty rate was raised to 5% in 2009, the Duddar project continued to pay 2% because Balochistan was \"*getting something good*\" in exchange.378 According to Claimant, the offer it made to Balochistan in the negotiations, *i.e*., to replace its equity interest under the CHEJVA by a Net Profit Interest while capping the royalty at 2%, was \"*expressly modeled on the arrangement that existed between Balochistan and Duddar*,\" and if Balochistan had been acting in good faith, it would have agreed to this offer.379 Claimant claims that, like its earlier sliding scale proposal which was made before the parties turned to restructuring Balochistan's interst, its net profit interest (\"**NPI**\") proposal was \"*a good deal for Balochistan*\" because the Net Profit Interest would have increased its economic return, eliminated the financial risks associated with its equity interest under the CHEJVA and provided it with advance minimum payments from the outset of production. It further points out that Balochistan could have rejected the proposal and opted not to participate in the project, thereby receiving only an \"*enhanced royalty*\" of 5%, which would have diminished its revenue from nearly USD 5 billion to less that USD 2.2 billion.380 Claimant also notes that, like all of its proposals, the NPI proposal was \"*up for negotiation*\" and in case some of its terms were unacceptable to Balochistan, it could have requested adjustments. In Claimant's view, it is therefore reasonable to assume that Balochistan would either have accepted the proposal or, \"*at the very least, responded to it with a reasonable counter-proposal*.\"381\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 247-248, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 667.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 249. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 181, *referring to* \"[c]*omparison of existing, Duddar and TCC proposal*\" in **Exhibit C-236**, p. 8, which refers to a \"*Cap at 2%*\" for the provincial royalty.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 251-252, *referring to* Davis II, Table 10; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175.\n\n382.\n\nIn response to Respondent's additional challenge to the manner in which Claimant has calculated the royalty, Claimant refers to rule 102 of the 2002 BM Rules which provides that royalty shall be charged on \"the fair market value of any mineral\" which is in turn defined as \"*the sale price \u2026 determined by reference to the first point at which* [the mineral] *was disposed of* [in a sale at arm's length], *without allowing for any deductions from the gross amount so determined.*\"382 According to Claimant, this corresponds to the net smelter return used as a basis by Prof. Davis, which is calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the smelter at the Port of Gwadar which reflects the smelter's transportation costs but none of Claimant' costs.383 Claimant also points to the definition of \"*Sales Proceeds*\" in the drafts of the Mineral Agreement exchanged by both sides.384\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 186, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 102.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 186.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 187, *quoting from* **Exhibits CE-216**, Article 17.1 *and* **CE-226**, Article 17.1 and quoting from the definition of \"Sales Proceeds\" as being \"*calculated after deducting all costs incurred in connection with the sale and excluding any octroi, sales or other indirect Taxes relating thereto*.\"\n\n383.\n\nClaimant concludes that it is for the Tribunal to determine what the outcome of the Mineral Agreement negotiations would have been and points to a series of sensitivity analyses conducted by Prof. Davis that include alternative fiscal regimes and a non-renewal of the Mining Lease.385 Claimant maintains, however, that it would be inconsistent with the Tribunal's finding that the Mineral Agreement negotiations failed as a direct consequence of Balochistan's unlawful takeover decision if the Tribunal were now to conclude that no agreement would have been reached.386\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 201-203; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 253-255, *referring to* Davis II, Tables 10 and 11.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 256.\n\n384.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that any uncertainty regarding the fiscal terms should be resolved in favor of TCCA because it is due to the Government's unlawful conduct and, in addition, Respondent's \"*procedural misconduct regarding these very issues, in particular Pakistan's deliberate defiance of the Tribunal's disclosure orders*\" regarding documents concerning the Saindak and Duddar mines. Claimant maintains its request for appropriate adverse inferences and adds that, even without specifically drawing these inferences, the Tribunal \"*should at the very least take into account Pakistan's misconduct and its thwarting of the evidentiary process when it evaluates the record and determines what fiscal terms the parties would have agreed but for Pakistan's and Balochistan's unlawful acts*.\"387\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 257-260, 170. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Tribunal has not made any finding that Claimant had a legitimate expectation to conclude a Mineral Agreement and argues that there was no specific commitment to this effect nor were the Governments under a legal obligation to conclude a Mineral Agreement. Respondent submits that rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules prohibited the parties from entering into a mineral agreement inconsistent with \"*any other law*\" and argues that Claimant therefore could not expect to gain exemptions from legal requirements such as permitting or approvals. In addition, Respondent claims that by raising unreasonable demands, Claimant \"*undermined any ability to reach a deal on a mineral agreement*\" and \"*created the problems it now bemoans*.\"388\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 135, 144, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 9(5); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n386.\n\nRespondent further takes the position that \"[g]*iven the lengthy history or stalled negotiations and distant positions, the most likely outcome would be that no mineral agreement would have been agreed whatsoever*.\" It notes that a Mineral Agreement was not necessary to operate a mine in Balochistan and submits that it was within the discretion of both Governments, independently from one another, whether to grant certain benefits in return for benefits to the State.389 At the same time, Respondent contends that the absence of a finding that a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded would render the value of Claimant's plan to mine Reko Diq speculative.390\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 109.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 130.\n\n387.\n\nRespondent argues that at the relevant time, Claimant was aware of the risk that no Mineral Agreement would be concluded and categorized the \"*Inability to Negotiate Mineral Agreement*\" as a \"*high risk*\" with a likelihood of 0,375 in the risk register of the Feasibility Study, which would have resulted in \"*NO PROJECT*.\" According to Respondent, this shows that the failure to obtain a Mineral Agreement would not only have made the project less valuable but rather \"*could doom the entire project*.\"391\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 136; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 110; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 26, *quoting from* **Exhibits RE-576-20.01**, p. 22 *and* **RE-576-30**, p. 30-13.\n\n388.\n\nAs for the terms put forward by Claimant, Respondent submits that: (i) Pakistan would not have agreed to a royalty rate below the minimum of 5% required by law; (ii) Pakistan never agreed to grant EPZ status and Claimant abandoned this request during negotiations; (iii) the parties \"*were nowhere close to agreeing to the overall fiscal regime*\"; and (iv) the Governments \"*roundly rejected*\" a provision providing for an automatic renewal of the 30-year mining lease.392 In addition, Respondent submits that the Governments focused on Claimant presenting a value addition in the form of downstream processing facilities. According to Respondent, the terms of a Mineral Agreement \u2013 if one had been concluded at all \u2013 would have been \"*far more favorable to Pakistan.*\"393\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 27.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 149; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 29.\n\n389.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent emphasizes that the Governments were not willing to accept whatever terms Claimant suggested but they \"*wanted a fair deal, and they were willing to walk away from the table if TCC would not give it to them*.\" According to Respondent, the Governments were also conscious of creating precedents for other investors that would request similar exemptions or concessions if these were granted to Claimant.394 Further, Respondent emphasizes that the differences between the parties arose already in 2008, *i.e*., before the alleged takeover decision taken by the GOB.395\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 139.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 148.\n\n390.\n\nRespondent submits that the 5% royalty rate was codified in June 2009 and Barrick acknowledged in its annual report of 2009 that Claimant would have had to pay this rate by law. In Respondent's view, this shows that both Pakistan and Claimant expected that it would have to pay the 5% rate.396 Respondent submits that other companies were also \"*assessed the 5% rate*\" and Claimant failed to show that Saindak paid any lower rate while Respondent showed that it paid the 5% rate. Similarly, Respondent considers that it provided information on the royalty rate paid by Duddar.397 Respondent also considers it confirmed by Ms. Boggs' testimony as well as contemporaneous meeting minutes that no agreement had been reached on the application of a 2% royalty rate and that Claimant never expected that it would pay less than the legal rate.398 Respondent further maintains that the Governments \"*were unwilling to accept anything below a 5% royalty*\" which, according to Respondent, represented the floor rather than the ceiling of their position because a higher royalty rate was necessary to \"*defuse political unrest and resistance to the project in Balochistan.*\" In this regard, Respondent points to Mr. Lehri's proposal in October 2008 that the royalty rate increase from 5% during the first ten years to 5.5% for the next ten years and ultimately 6% for the remainder of the project.399 According to Respondent, Claimant was aware at the time that there was no room for its NPI proposal including a 2% royalty rate because it internally acnowledged a need \"*to refocus away from the 25% and 2%.*\"400 Respondent also points to Ms. Boggs' testimony that she \"*assumed that we would probably end up with something between what we had originally proposed, 2 percent, what they had proposed, 5 percent and a sliding scale*\" but maintains that the offer of a sliding-scale royalty came from Claimant and was never accepted by the Governments.401 Respondent notes that according to Claimant's contemporaneous estimate, the difference between the 2% and 5% royalties amounts to USD 37.5 million annually and, according to Respondent, thus to USD 2.1 billion over a 56-year life of the mine.402 In Respondent's view, these royalties were necessary for the GOB to receive any money from the Reko Diq project within a reasonable timeframe, taking into account its obligation to make a 25% contribution to the funds of the project under the CHEJVA as a Participating Party and a lack of participation in the project's future cash flows as a Non-Participating Party.403\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 116; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 31, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-141**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 141; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-582** *and* **RE-714**; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 455 lines 11-13, p. 466 lines 19-20 and p. 424 lines 3-12 *and* **Exhibit CE-942**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 156, Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 115; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 35, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-942**, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 114; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 45, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-366**, p. 15.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 114; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 and note 59, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 476 lines 17-20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 38, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-942**, p. 6.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160.\n\n391.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that Claimant's expert Prof. Davis wrongly calculated the royalties by applying the royalty rate to revenues net of smelter charges. According to Respondent, this contradicts rule 102(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that royalties are to be calculated based on the mineral's \"*fair market value*\" which is in turn defined in rule 102(2) as the sale in an arms-length transaction, a price in the mineral agreement or on the international market. Respondent rejects the argument that net smelter return is consistent with \"*fair market value*\" and points to rule 102(4), which provides that the calculation does not allow \"*for any deductions of the gross amount so determined*.\" Respondent considers its understanding confirmed by the reports of its taxation expert Dr. Haq as well as the Feasibility Study which refers to a \"*2% royalty on gross revenues by the Government of Balochistan*.\"404\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 288-289, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 102 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-27** *and referring to* Haq I, \u00b6 16; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 363, *referring to* Haq II, \u00b6 6.\n\n392.\n\nRespondent further rejects the argument that it would have benefitted from Claimant's NPI proposal and refers to \"*millions of dollars in revenue*\" that it would forfeit by granting Claimant free surface rights as well as \"*unpredictable losses and risks that might attend the extended commencement period that TCC would impose*\" and future losses from the tax exemptions sought by Claimant. Also taking into account that Claimant was requesting an extension of the mining lease for the life of the mine, free surface rights and a 2% royalty rate, Respondent considers that there was \"*no basis for Pakistan to accept the NPI Proposal*.\"405 According to Respondent, the NPI proposal would have provided the GOB with less revenues than the CHEVJA structure with a 5% royalty and, while \"*eliminating some risk to the GoB, it would also require relinquishing further control over Reko Diq as well as any dividends it would have received as a shareholder under the Mining Venture*.\"406\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 121-123.

According to Respondent, Claimant's \"*mega-project*\" could not be compared to other projects such as Saindak and Duddar which Respondent describes as \"*failing projects*\" which were supported in the aim to train locals within Balochistan and improve the relationship to China as they were operated by China Metallurgical Group Corporation (\"**MCC**\").410 Respondent adds that so far Pakistan had not accepted any of Claimant's proposals regarding the tax regime and argues that there is no evidence that Claimant expected to succeed on EPZ or any other concrete tax benefits.411\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 163-164.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 39, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-145**, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 688 lines 17-19 *and referring to* p. 711 line 22 to p. 712 line 6.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, 46; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 141.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 120.\n\n394.\n\nIn response to Claimant's argument that 85% of the issues had already been agreed, Respondent refers to Mr. Khokhar's testimony that the remaining 15% were no less important and that while some issues could be solved in the fall of 2008, \"*there were also remaining certain terms which we could not resolve*\" which included the fiscal regime and stability, royalty rate, stamp duty exemptions and amendments to the 2002 BM Rules.412 Respondent also points to the testimony of Ms. Boggs who confirmed that the fiscal terms had not yet been agreed and that they were using the terms they had proposed for the purposes of the Feasibility Study even though \"*those terms had not yet been agreed by the Government*.\"413\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 587 lines 13-17 and p. 590 lines 6-7 *and referring to* p. 594 lines 1-4. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 160-161, *quoting from* Khokhar IV, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 45, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 472 lines 11-17. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 153.\n\n395.\n\nRespondent further rejects the argument that the parties had agreed on a renewal of the mining lease and claims that, instead, the parties had agreed that the matter was to be decided independently by the Licensing Authority under the 2002 BM Rules. Respondent notes that it repeatedly rejected Claimant's request for an automatic renewal and questions Ms. Boggs' testimony that mining leases are commonly renewed in the industry, noting that there is no such history in Pakistan and that other mining leases in the area have much shorter terms and are subject to substantial changes upon renewal.414 In addition, Respondent considers it a \"*leap of faith*\" to assume that the mine would have been operational in thirty years and that Balochistan would have wanted to renew the mining lease, given the \"*extraordinary shortcomings*\" in the Feasibility Study, the \"*hazards of TCCA's operations on the surrounding areas*\" and the history or its owners' projects which included \"*some of the most prominent disasters and scandals in the modern mining world*.\"415\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 126; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50, *referring to* Boggs V, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 128-129.\n\n396.\n\nRespondent also argues that, as a matter of law, a valuation should not assume renewal of a lease when there is discretion on the part of the State and refers to various cases in which the tribunals considered the extension \"*far too contingent, uncertain and unproven*\" or that it was conditional upon the fulfillment of numerous substantive and procedural steps.416\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186, *quoting from Gemplus, S.A., et al. v.

Respondent refers to Mr. Khokhar who testified that after the Feasibility Study had been submitted, \"*any chance of reaching an agreement on the remaining terms of the mineral agreement diminished*\" because \"*TCC had no respect for the decisions made by the Parties through a mutually agreed process of negotiations and proceeded to include the terms that most benefited itself*.\"422 Respondent also contends that Claimant even used assumptions of concessions which it had already abandoned such as EPZ status or did not expect to receive from the Governments such as the 2% royalty.423\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 154-156, *quoting from* Khokhar III, \u00b6 47.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 177-180.\n\n399.\n\nRespondent asserts that a likely option was that Claimant would not have achieved a Mineral Agreement. Respondent contends that Claimant abandoned negotiations and refers to Mr. Khokhar's testimony that Claimant's CEO Mr. van Borries advised him in October 2010 that Claimant was \"*no longer interested in a mineral agreement*\" but only a mining lease.424 According to Respondent, Claimant did not expect a Mineral Agreement and \"*knew the effect would be catastrophic*.\"425\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 159; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 57, *quoting from* Khokhar III, \u00b6 48.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 58.\n\n400.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that, contrary to Claimant's argument and the Tribunal's finding, obtaining a mining lease would not have improved Claimant's bargaining power because the Government \"*had little to gain from changing the tax and royalty structure*\" and Claimant had \"*the obligation to construct the mine and live up to the numbers in its IMD FS*.\"426 Respondent further refers to rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which an investor's right to negotiate a mineral agreement expires three months after the approval of the mining lease. Respondent rejects Claimant's interpretation that the three-month period starts to run only from the submission of a mineral agreement to the provincial authorities and maintains that the provision aims to drive the company to begin construction which does not require a mineral agreement and therefore does not permit for any further delays. In Respondent's view, the mining lease would therefore have strengthened Pakistan's position and Claimant failed to show that it would have been able to reach agreement on the Mineral Agreement and obtain the relevant approvals within \"*the dwindling time left to it*.\"427\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 174.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 175; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 130-134; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-1**, rule 46(2).\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are in dispute as to: (i) whether a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded at all; and, if so (ii) the commercial terms on which the parties would have agreed. The Tribunal will address these two aspects in turn.\n\n**i. Whether the Parties Would Have Concluded a Mineral Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of whether Claimant has established that the Parties would have concluded a Mineral Agreement at all, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that a Mineral Agreement was not a strictly necessary requirement for constructing and operating the mine. However, as demonstrated, *inter alia*, by Claimant's contemporaneous evaluation in the Feasibility Study of the risk that no mineral agreement would be concluded,428 it was considered highly desirable and relevant to reach an agreement on the commercial terms and in particular the fiscal regime that would apply to the project. Consequently, the Tribunal also considers it common ground that the question whether a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded or, from the perspective of a willing buyer in November 2011, whether it was likely that a Mineral Agreement would be concluded following the approval of TCCP's Mining Lease Application is relevant to determining the value of the project as of the valuation date.\n\nIn Chapter 30 of the Feasibility Study entitled \"*Risk*\", Claimant identified as a risk with the highest risk rating \"*H5*\" the \"*Inability to negotiate Mineral Agreement as a result of political circumstances at Federal and/or Provincial level resulting in NO PROJECT.*\" **Exhibit RE-576-30**, p. 30-13.\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that while the Mineral Agreement negotiations \"*had apparently stalled before the Mining Lease Application was filed, the parties may well have decided to revive them after the grant of the mining lease, given that Claimant would then have been the only one allowed to conduct mining operations in the area*.\" The Tribunal found that \"[t]*here would thus have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues*\" and considered that \"*Claimant would have been in a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became clear that the Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease.*\"429\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1239.\n\n404.\n\nRespondent disputes this finding and refers to rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides:\n\n\"*If the mineral Agreement in case of L.S.M and the lease deed in case of Small Scale Mining is not executed within three months of the communication of the approval of the application for a mining lease and the presentation of the mineral agreement / lease deed for signature, the right of the applicant to such lease shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the licensing authority is satisfied that the delay in execution was not caused by the applicant or was due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control*.\"430\n\nExhibit RE-1, rule 46(2).\n\n405.\n\nIn Respondent's view, granting the mining lease would in fact have weakened Claimant's position because its right to negotiate a mineral agreement would have expired three months after receiving the mining lease. In the Tribunal's view, this position is not supported by the wording of the provision nor the economic intent of agreeing on a mineral agreement. As pointed out by Claimant, rule 46(2) refers to a time period of three months starting from \"*the communication of the approval of the application for a mining lease and the presentation of the mineral agreement \u2026 for signature*.\" In addition, the provision refers to a lapse of \"*the right of the application to such lease*,\" *i.e*., the mining lease, rather than a lapse of the right to negotiate a mineral agreement. The Tribunal is therefore not convinced that rule 46, which bears the heading \"*Duration of mining lease*,\" was intended to place a time limit on the negotiations of a mineral agreement. It rather appears that the intention was to provide for a timeframe within which the Mineral Agreement, once negotiated and presented for signature, would have to be executed.\n\n406.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules, a mineral agreement can be concluded to address various matters relating to mineral operations as the Government or the parties to the agreement may consider necessary. There is no indication that such a mineral agreement would have to be negotiated and concluded before or shortly after the mining lease is granted and that it would in turn not be possible to negotiate and conclude a mineral agreement providing for certain terms regarding mineral operations at any point thereafter.\n\n407.\n\nRespondent further argues that the Governments would have little interest to make any concessions regarding the tax and royalty structure and that Claimant would have been under an obligation to realize the project regardless of any concessions to be made. In the Tribunal's view, this argument is detached from reality. Claimant and its owners as well as possible third-party financing institutions would have had to commit large amounts of money into the project and it is plausible that they would have done so only if they were able to reach some form of agreement on the fiscal terms that would apply to the project and thus to make a reasonably reliable projection regarding the future profitability of the mine. In addition, the Governments would also have had an interest to provide the project sponsors with some form of security or stability regarding the fiscal regime in order to ensure that the project would be developed with all the monetary and non-monetary benefits that this would bring to Balochistan and Pakistan.\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to emphasize that is not assuming that the Governments were under a legal obligation to conclude a Mineral Agreement or that they did not have any discretion as to the terms that they would negotiate with Claimant. However, as the Tribunal already held in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and as it maintains in this Award, it would have been in the mutual interest of the negotiating parties to reach an agreement in order to ensure that the project would in fact be financed, constructed and become operational.\n\n409.\n\nRespondent points out that the negotiations had stalled before TCCP filed the Mining Lease Application and claims that this was due to Claimant's unreasonable demands and its own delaying tactics when copper prices fell in 2008. It also claims that Claimant in fact informed Respondent after it had submitted the Feasibility Study to the GOB that it was no longer interested in a Mineral Agreement. As for the latter allegation, the Tribunal notes that it is based exclusively on the witness testimony of Mr. Khokhar who testified that he recalled that \"*in a meeting taking place in October 2010 in* [his] *office, Mr. Gerhard von Borries, Chief Executive of TCC, stated,* 'we are no longer interested in a mineral agreement, We are only interested in a mining lease. Forget the mineral agreement.'\" Mr. Khokhar further stated that he understood this message to have been conveyed to other Governments officials as well.431\n\nKhokhar III, \u00b6 48.\n\n410.\n\nWhile it is true that Claimant did not present Mr. von Borries as a witness in these proceedings, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Khokhar's testimony is contradicted by the contemporaneous record which shows that Claimant was still pursuing a Mineral Agreement. As pointed out by Claimant, Mr. von Borries himself sent a letter to the Chief Secretary, Mr. Lehri, on 4 October 2010 containing a revised offer regarding the Reko Diq project, which included, *inter alia*, a term sheet for the Mineral Agreement \"*for further discussion*.\"432 In addition, on 5 October 2010, the Chairman of Claimant's Board of Directors wrote to Chief Minister Raisani where he also presented Claimant's new offer and explicitly stated that they \"*trust*[ed] *this letter now sets the stage for full discussions and agreement on the proposed Project and Mineral Agreements, on which this offer is contingent*.\"433\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(X)(b)**, pp. 61, 66.\n\n**Exhibit CE-257**, p. 3.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the negotiations had stalled already in 2009 and it is not convinced that this was caused by Claimant not pursuing the negotiations or raising demands that made any further negotiations pointless. As for the first point, the Tribunal again considers Respondent's allegation contradicted by the record which demonstrates that Claimant was continuously making efforts to reach an agreement on the outstanding negotiation items and was presenting various new proposals for the Governments to consider. As to the second point, the Tribunal has not been provided with any indication that the Government were considering further negotiations pointless at the time.\n\n412.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Claimant's statement in its Post-Hearing Brief that its primary objective was to reach stabilization of the fiscal regime and that, once that was obtained, it was willing to \"*compromise on the specifics of the tax and royalty in order to secure the stability it had been promised*.\"434 In the Tribunal's view, this willingness to consider a compromise, which is confirmed by the contemporaneous proposals and efforts made by Claimant towards the Governments, shows two things. On the one hand, it was likely that the parties would have reached some form of agreement on the fiscal terms that would apply to the project. On the other hand, Claimant would likely not have insisted on each of the fiscal terms which it had proposed and which, in the absence of any agreement by the time the Feasibility Study was delivered to the GOB, it had also included as a basis for its evaluation of the project in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. This second point will be addressed in more detail below in determining the fiscal terms on which the parties would most likely have agreed.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 232.\n\n413.\n\nAs for the question who may have been responsible for the stalling of the negotiations in 2009, the Tribunal also recalls that the present assessment is based on a but-for scenario in which Respondent had not breached its obligations under the Treaty. Respondent is correct in pointing out that the Tribunal did not have to express an opinion in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability as to whether the Governments' conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations in itself or together with other actions impugned by Claimant amounted to a breach of Respondent's Treaty obligations. However, the Tribunal did find that the Licensing Authority denied TCCP's Mining Lease Application because the GOB had decided to develop its own mining project rather than to continue collaborating with Claimant.435 The minutes of the GOB cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 explicitly state that the agenda item \"*Taking over of Rekodiq Copper & Gold Project from TCCP by the Government of Balochistan*\" was approved in principle and that it was \"*further decided **not** to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP*.\"436 In the Tribunal's view, this is a strong indication that the GOB's decision to take over the project was directly linked to the fact that there were no actual negotiations after this cabinet meeting but only high-level meetings in which assurances were given to Claimant which turned out to be false.437\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1264.\n\n**Exhibit CE-31**, p. 16 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1144-1159.\n\n414.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the Tribunal's but-for assessment must eliminate the fact that the GOB had decided not to go ahead with the Mineral Agreement negotiations because it had decided to take over the project and develop its own project instead. For the same reason, the high risk rating assigned by Claimant in the Feasibility Study delivered in August 2010 to the risk that it would not be able to conclude a Mineral Agreement with the GOB and GOP, which was based on the actual situation in which negotiations had stalled due to the GOB's decision not to go ahead with them, cannot form the basis for the Tribunal's but-for assessment of the likeliness that a Mineral Agreement would be concluded in the absence of Respondent's Treaty breaches.\n\n415.\n\nWhile the Tribunal does not wish to go as far as finding that a Mineral Agreement would already have been concluded as of the valuation date, it maintains the view that if the GOB had not decided to take over the project from Claimant, it would have continued to negotiate with Claimant and an agreement would likely have been reached between the negotiating parties, including the GOB, regarding the terms and in particular the fiscal regime that would apply to the project.\n\n416.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also notes that Claimant's financing expert Mr. Pingle stated in his expert report that fiscal stability agreements are rarely \"*pre-agreed*,\" *i.e*., concluded before financing is secured for the project, but they are usually among the last items agreed at the request and insistence of financing institutions willing to provide funds for the project. He added that \"[t]*here is a point in almost every large project when the foreign governmental institutions meet with the host government, without private parties present. At that point, the foreign governmental institutions lay out their minimum requirements for them to make their loans or investments. It makes a significant difference to a host government when it realizes that massive FDI and a loan package worth billions of US$ turn on its unwillingness to agree to standard documentation*.\"438\n\nPingle, \u00b6 213.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this statement convincing and considers that it supports its finding that a Mineral Agreement providing in particular for fiscal stability would have been concluded after the mining lease was granted to TCCP.\n\n**ii. The Commercial Terms on Which the Parties Would Likely Have Agreed in the Mineral Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nAs a second step, the Tribunal will assess the commercial terms and in particular the fiscal regime on which the parties would likely have agreed for the project in the Mineral Agreement.\n\n419.\n\nIn this regard, the dispute between the Parties concerns four issues: (i) the royalty rate, including the base for calculating the royalties; (ii) EPZ status or a \"*functional equivalent*\" of tax concessions vs. normal tax regime; (iii) renewal of the mining lease after the first 30-year term; and (iv) participation of Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest vs. participation or non-participation as provided in the CHEJVA.\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Claimant's offer in May 2009 to restructure the GOB's interest in the project as a net profit interest was made subject to certain conditions regarding royalties and taxes as well as surface rights. In particular, Claimant's offer at the time was \"*available only with 2% royalty.*\"439 It further appears to the Tribunal that, with all other fiscal terms being equal, a Net Profit Interest would undisputedly have been more beneficial to the GOB than the initial 25% equity interest under the CHEJVA, in particular during the first decade of mining operations.440 In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore appropriate to discuss the nature of the GOB's interest not in isolation but together with the question of the royalty rate on which the parties would likely have agreed.\n\n**Exhibit CE-236**, pp. 5-6.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-236**, p. 6.\n\n**(a) The Royalty Rate and Claimant's Net Profit Interest Offer**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe first issue concerns the questions on which royalty rate the parties would have agreed. While Claimant has instructed its expert Prof. Davis to assume a 2% royalty rate, Respondent maintains that the GOB would not have accepted anything below the statutory rate of 5%.\n\n422.\n\nClaimant initially submitted that the amendment to the 2002 BM Rules of 17 July 2009 by which the statutory royalty rate was increased from 2% to 5% for both copper and gold never came into effect and referred to its witness Ms. Boggs, who testified that there was opposition to the increase from the local mining community and that they discovered that the notification had never been gazetted.441 However, as pointed out by Respondent, Ms. Boggs' recollection is contradicted by Barrick's annual report for 2009 which reported for the Reko Diq project a royalty of \"*5% N*[et] *S*[melter] *R*[eturn].\"442 Claimant did not pursue this argument any further but focuses on the argument that other mining projects in the region were not paying the statutory rate but had agreed with the GOB on lower royalty rates. In particular, Claimant considers it confirmed by Mr. Khokhar's testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that the owner of the Duddar project continued to pay a 2% royalty rate after the rate was raised in 2009 and further requests adverse inferences regarding Respondent's refusal to produce documents regarding the agreements reached with the owners of the Duddar and Saindak projects.\n\n**Exhibit RE-579**, p. 4; Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 61, *referring to* Boggs V, \u00b6 46.\n\n**Exhibit RE-141**.\n\n423.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Mr. Khokhar's oral testimony indicates that the Duddar project may have continued to pay a 2% royalty443 and that Respondent's decision not to produce the mineral agreement with Saindak despite the Tribunal's orders indicates that Saindak may also have paid less than the 5% statutory rate, the Tribunal is not convinced that this in itself establishes that Claimant would also have agreed on a 2% royalty with the GOB. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project was not comparable to these projects in terms of size or profitability. According to Mr. Khokhar, the Duddar project had been shelved because it was not economical and it was then revived. He added that \"[m]*aybe Government have compensated \u2026 to revive this Project, make this Project economically healthy, the Government may have given certain concessions*.\"444 According to Claimant's own position, based on the sensitivity analyses provided by Prof. Davis, the viability of the Reko Diq project did not depend on an agreement on a 2% royalty rate and Claimant itself states that it was willing to consider a compromise if it obtained the desired stability for the fiscal regime that would apply to the project.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), pp. 664-668.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), pp. 666-667.\n\n424.\n\nAs Respondent pointed out, there is no indication in the record that the GOB had expressed a willingness to accept a rate lower than 5%. As recorded in the meeting minutes of the negotiation committee on 22 October 2008, Chief Secretary Lehri had even proposed a rate increasing from 5 to 6% over the life of the mine.445 Ms. Boggs also confirmed in her oral testimony that the parties had not agreed on the royalty rate to be applied to the project.446 She further testified that she \"*assumed that we would probably end up with something between what we had originally proposed, 2 percent, what they had proposed, 5 percent, and a sliding scale*.\"447 According to Ms. Boggs, the request for a sliding scale had come from the Government, and she \"*thought we would arrive at something that we would be able to tie to the various economic periods of the Project so that increases in the Royalty wouldn't affect the viability of the Project*.\"448 In those circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced by the evidence in the record that the parties would have agreed on a royalty rate of 2%.\n\n**Exhibit CE-942**, p. 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 455 lines 11-13, p. 466 lines 19-20.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 476 lines 17-20.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 476 line 21 to p. 477 line 3.\n\n425.\n\nWhile Respondent denies that the proposal for a sliding scale came from the Government, the meeting minutes of 20 November 2008 show that Chief Secretary Lehri had understood that a royalty rate increasing over the life of the mine could make economic sense. In addition, the Tribunal notes that as of May 2009, Claimant was combining its request for a 2% royalty rate with an offer to restructure the GOB's interest as a net profit interest, which would be more beneficial to the GOB than its equity interest under the CHEJVA particularly in the first decade of mining operations.449 In the Tribunal's view, this does not suffice as evidence that the GOB would have agreed on the 2% royalty rate. However, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that in return for an arrangement under which the GOB would not have been required to make any equity contributions and would have received guaranteed annual minimal payments during the initial payback period,450 the GOB would have agreed to a lower royalty rate during this period. At the same time, the GOB may well have maintained its request for a higher royalty rate in subsequent years and the Tribunal therefore considers it likely that the parties would have agreed on a sliding scale.\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit CE-236**, p. 6.\n\n**Exhibit CE-236**, p. 4.\n\n426.\n\nAs testified by Ms. Boggs and confirmed by the contemporaneous documents, Claimant proposed in October 2008 that the royalty rate would start at 2.5% for the first decade, increase to 3% for the second decade and not exceed 4% for the time thereafter.451 Ms. Boggs also testified that they \"*never received confirmation from Balochistan that this scale was acceptable*.\"452 To the contrary, pursuant to the record note prepared by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources of the GOP on the October 2008 negotiations, \"[t]*he GOB team showed reservation towards the proposal floated by the TCC team*.\"453 However, this offer was made before Claimant proposed to restructure the GOB's interest in the project as a net profit interest. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that if taken together, the proposal of a sliding scale increasing from 2% to 4% over the life of the mine and the net profit interest proposal would have been acceptable to the GOB.\n\nBoggs V, \u00b6 43; **Exhibit RE-64**, p. 1.\n\nBoggy V, \u00b6 43.\n\n**Exhibit RE-77**, p. 4.\n\n427.\n\nAccording to the sensitivity analysis provided by Prof. Davis, the impact of assuming a time-varying royalty as proposed by Claimant in October 2008 while retaining the net profit interest proposal results in a reduction of the value of Claimant's share in the project of USD 287 million.454\n\nDavis II, Table 8.\n\n428.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent disputed Prof. Davis' calculation of royalties which is based on the net smelter return. Respondent relies on rule 102 of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides in relevant part:\n\n\"*(1) Subject to this Part, royalty shall be charged on the fair market value of any mineral specified in Part I of the Third Schedule \u2026 at the rate specified in Part II \u2026 or at such other rate as may be notified by the Government from time to time in the Official Gazette.*\n\n*(2) For the purposes of sub-rule (1), the fair market value of a mineral or group of minerals is \u2013*\n\n*(a) where the mineral or group of minerals is disposed of in a sale at arm's length, the sale price;*\n\n*(4) For the purposes of this Rule, the fair market value, in respect of any mineral or group of minerals which has been disposed of, shall be determined by reference to the first point at which it was disposed of, without allowing for any deductions from the gross amount so determined.*\"455\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 102.\n\n429.\n\nClaimant takes the position that the net smelter return is consistent with the fair market value royalty calculation under rule 102 and explains that net smelter return corresponds to the sale price paid by the smelter to Claimant, which reflects the costs incurred by the smelter for transportation from the port to the smelter but none of Claimant's costs. Respondent does not dispute that Prof. Davis has applied the sale price paid by the smelter but relies on its taxation expert Dr. Haq who takes the view that \"*NSR does not reflect* 'fair market value' *as defined under the BM Rules, since NSR includes certain deductions to account for* 'costs incurred by the smelter' *(i.e. buyer).*\"456\n\nHaq II, \u00b6 5.\n\n430.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Prof. Davis has correctly used the sale price paid by the smelter to Claimant as the base for calculating royalties. As stated in Barrick's annual report for 2009 on which Respondent relies in the context of the royalty rate, \"[t]*he primary type of royalty is a net smelter return (NSR) royalty. Under this type of royalty we pay the holder an amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value of gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining and transportation costs*.\" For Reko Diq, the report records \"*5% NSR*.\"457 The definition in Barrick's annual report confirms Claimant's explanation that the term \"*net*\" does not mean that any costs incurred by the mining company are actually deducted from the market price but rather that it refers to costs incurred by a third party for smelting, refining and transporting the concentrate. These third-party costs are naturally reflected in the sale price paid by that third party to the mining company. In the Tribunal's view, this type of royalty is consistent with rule 102 of the 2002 BM Rules, which defines \"*fair market value*\" primarily based on the sale price in an arms-length transaction which reflects the costs incurred by the buyer in that transaction. In particular, rule 102(4), which does not allow for any deductions from the gross amount, refers to the fair market value determined at the first point at which the concentrate was disposed of and, thus, to the (gross) sale price that a third party pays to the mining company.\n\n**Exhibit RE-141**.\n\n431.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that Prof. Davis has correctly applied the royalty rate to the net smelter return, *i.e*., the sale price that Claimant would have received from the smelter at Port Gwadar.\n\n**(b) EPZ Status or a \"*****Functional Equivalent*****\" of Tax Concessions vs. the Normal Tax Regime**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe second point in dispute between the Parties concerns the question whether the Reko Diq project would have received EPZ status or a \"*functional equivalent*\" of tax concessions for the first fifteen years followed by the normal tax regime for the remainder of the life of the mine, as alleged by Claimant, or whether it would have been subject to the normal tax regime from the start of operations, as alleged by Respondent.\n\n433.\n\nIt is undisputed that Respondent was not under a legal obligation to grant EPZ status, *i.e*., declare the area to an \"*export processing zone*,\" or similar tax concessions to the Reko Diq project. Claimant rather argues that EPZ status was specifically intended for projects such as Reko Diq, \"*which promised to provide employment and a boost to Pakistan's exports*,\"458 and claims that all other substantial mining projects in the region had also been granted EPZ status.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 245.\n\n434.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, points out that Claimant itself noted in a letter to Mr. Khokhar dated 29 January 2009 that \"*the EPZ regime is no longer politically viable*\"459 and considers that Claimant thereby dropped its request for EPZ status. However, as Claimant points out, it stated in the same sentence of that letter that they were advised by the Negotiating Committee that \"*certain benefits of an EPZ regime would be available to us under the normal tax regime, such as import tax and duty exemptions*.\"460 In addition, the net profit interest proposal made by Claimant in May 2009 was also made conditional upon receiving exemptions from stamp duties, local taxes as well as sales taxes.461\n\n**Exhibit RE-145**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-145**, p. 3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-236**, p. 5.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant's position is that while it would not necessarily have succeeded in obtaining EPZ status for the Reko Diq project, it is reasonable to assume that it would have received a \"*functional equivalent, at least during the initial capital-intensive years of the project*.\"462 Claimant further argues that \"[w]*hile it is conceivable that the final package of concessions agreed between the parties would have been a custom suite of modifications to the normal tax regime rather than an EPZ designation, the* 'combined tax regime' *\u2014fifteen years of the EPZ regime followed by the normal tax regime for the remaining decades of the mine's life\u2014is a reasonable approximation of the applicable fiscal terms for purposes of assessing TCCA's damages*.\"463\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 241.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 177.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, when taking into account that Claimant's initial Tanjeel project at Reko Diq, the Saindak project, the Duddar project and the GOB's own Reko Diq project had received EPZ status, which was destined for the type of investment that Claimant intended to bring to Pakistan, it is reasonable to assume that Claimant's Reko Diq project would either also have been granted EPZ status or would have received similar tax concessions from the Government during the first years in which the large amount of capital investments had to be made.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal finds further support for this finding in the fact that the GOB was a partner in the project and would have received, under the net profit interest proposal, 25% of the project's net profits after the payback of investment (until that time, it would have received annual minimum payments).464 Consequently, the GOB, which was moreover required under the CHEJVA to provide administrative support and perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture,465 would have had a strong interest to obtain EPZ status or (equivalent tax concessions) for the Reko Diq project. That this was in fact the case before the GOB decided to take over the Reko Diq project for itself, is confirmed by the GOB's submission before the Balochistan High Court in 2007 in which it argued that \"[t]*he fact that the Reko Diq area has been declared as an Export Processing Zone (*'EPZ' *) is beneficial to the Province of Balochistan and will increase its potential to make more money from the project*.\"466\n\n**Exhibit CE-236**, p. 4.\n\nSee in more detail on this point Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 944-947.\n\n**Exhibit CE-212**, p. 12.\n\n438.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the GOB's support for obtaining EPZ status or equivalent tax concessions would also have been in line with the Tribunal's finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that the assurances provided to Claimant and its owners by officials at various levels of both Governments contributed to the legitimate expectation that both Governments would support and facilitate Claimant's investment.467 According to the testimony of Claimant's witnesses Mr. Luksic and Ms. Boggs in the liability phase of these proceedings, which remained undisputed by Respondent, these assurances also referred to tax benefits that the project would obtain from the Governments in return for their investment in the country. Mr. Luksic specifically testified in his first witness statement that in a meeting with Prime Minister Aziz in January 2006, *i.e*., shortly before Antofagasta acquired shares in Claimant, the Prime Minister \"*recommended that TCC seek an EPZ (*'Export Processing Zone' *) for the Project*.\" Mr. Luksic further referred to a meeting with President Musharraf in April 2006 in which \"*the President also assured as of the Government's support for obtaining an EPZ status for the Project and for concluding a Mineral Agreement.*\"468 The Pakistani press reported on both of these meetings and the assurances provided by the Prime Minister and the President to Claimant's future owners on these occasions.469\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 955, 958.\n\nLuksic I, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13.\n\n**Exhibits CE-95**, **CE-246**, **CE-317** and **CE-318**.\n\n439.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Claimant has not instructed Prof. Davis to assume that EPZ status would be granted for the life of the mine but rather only for the first fifteen years of the project and that the project would then be subject to the normal tax regime thereafter. As demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis performed by Prof. Davis on this point, granting EPZ status for the first fifteen years of the project would still have provided the Federal State with 29.6% of the project's total cash flows (compared to 42.6% if no EPZ status were granted). At the same time, the additional profits that would have gone to Claimant and the GOB would also have benefitted the GOB, increasing its share of the profits from 22.4% under the normal tax regime to 26.1% under EPZ status (*i.e*., on Claimant's calculation, a difference of USD 740 million).470\n\nDavis II, Table 9.\n\n440.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that it was likely that the GOP would have granted EPZ status or similar tax concessions to the Reko Diq project for the first fifteen years of the project, as it has been assumed by Prof. Davis.\n\n**(c) Renewal of the Mining Lease for the Life of the Mine**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address the dispute between the Parties as to whether the Mineral Agreement would have included a provision pursuant to which the mining lease, which would have been granted for an initial term of 30 years, would have been renewed for the life of the mine.\n\n442.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, rules 46(1) and 50(3) of the 2002 BM Rules provide as follows:\n\n\"***46. Duration of mining lease**. (1) Subject to these rules, a mining lease shall be valid for an initial term of mining lease shall not be less than ten years and shall not exceed thirty years but the lease may contain a clause permitting renewals at the discretion of the licensing authority or Government for further period not exceeding thirty years at a time on such terms and in such form as may be in force on the day on which the renewal is sanctioned.*\n\n\u2026\n\n***50. Application for renewal of mining lease**. \u2026*\n\n*(3)* [O]*n application duly made, the lease may be renewed in accordance with Rule 48(1)(b) with or without a variation of the conditions of the lease*.\"471\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rules 46(1) and 50(3).\n\n443.\n\nRespondent further points to the testimony of Mr. Khokhar, who testified that \"[t]*he issue of granting or renewing mining leases was not a focus of the negotiations as this matter was to be decided independently by the Licensing Authority as per provisions of the BM Rules.*\" Mr. Khohkar further stated while the issue was not within the competence of the GOP, he \"*expressly recall*[ed] *telling TCC during the negotiations that they should not expect anything automatic, but should follow our laws and procedures in Pakistan*.\" Mr. Khokhar further referred to the Governments' counterproposal for a Mineral Agreement dated 7 August 2008 which in his view \"*disagreed with TCC's proposal to secure an automatic mining lease and restored the primacy of the BM Rules*\" and \"*shows that the issue of whether or not TCC would obtain a mining lease was, in our view, not a valid topic of discussion during the negotiations.*\"472\n\nKhokhar II, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Mr. Khokhar confirmed this testimony in Khokhar III, \u00b6 32.\n\n444.\n\nThe Governments' counterproposal referred to by Mr. Khokhar indeed did not accept the provision proposed by Claimant in its initial draft of 9 July 2007, which had provided, *inter alia*, that a Mining Lease \"*shall \u2026 (ii) be for a period of 30 (thirty) years; and (iii) be renewable for a further period of 30 (thirty) years at the request of the holder thereof, but otherwise such Mining Lease shall be on the terms and conditions set out in the BMR.*\"473 The Governments' draft instead provided that the Mining Lease \"*shall \u2026 (ii) be for a period not exceeding 30 (thirty) years; and (iii) be renewable for a further period according to Article 86 BMR at the request of the holder thereof, but otherwise such Mining Lease shall be on the terms and conditions set out in the BMR approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld*.\"474\n\n**Exhibit CE-216**, clause 14.2.1(ii) and (iii).\n\n**Exhibit CE-226**, clause 14.2.1(ii) and (iii). As rule 86 contains provisions regarding the duration and renewal of a mining lease but is part of Part IV \"*Special Provisions Relating to Small Scale Mining*\" and it is otherwise undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project would be subject to the regular provisions in Part III \"*Mineral Titles and Mineral Concessions*,\" the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that this reference was made by mistake and not specifically intended to deviate from the provisions on duration and renewal of mining leases under rules 46 and 50 quoted above.\n\n445.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Governments' draft confirms Mr. Khokhar's testimony that the GOB did not accept at that time that the Mining Lease should be renewed without any qualification merely \"*at the request of the holder*\" but instead introduced a reference to the provision in the 2002 BM Rules on the duration and renewal of the mining lease. On the other hand, the GOB proposed to add that the approval of the renewal \"*shall not be unreasonably withheld*.\" In the Tribunal's view, this proposal does not accord with Mr. Khokhar's testimony that the question of renewal was \"*not a valid topic of discussion*\" but instead indicates that the GOB was willing to provide some form of assurance to Claimant that the mining lease would be renewed if there was no valid ground for refusing to do so.\n\n446.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also recalls that the GOB was required under clause 7.2(a) the CHEJVA to provide \"*appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of all leases, licenses, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of the Joint Venture Activities*.\"475 Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 further provided that \"[t]*he Parties shall be just and faithful to one another and will not do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture contemplated herein as a whole are prejudiced*\" and that \"[e]*ach Party shall execute all necessary additional documents and do all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of this Agreement.*\"476 In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal held that \"[p]*ursuant to these provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole, i.e., to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Diq*.\"477\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, clause 7.2(a).\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 947.\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal does not wish to go as far as Claimant's suggestion that a refusal to renew the mining lease would in any circumstances have \"*prejudiced*\" the interests of the Joint Venture and therefore have been contrary to the GOB's obligations under the CHEJVA. However, the Tribunal does agree that the GOB's contractual obligations are relevant in determining whether it is reasonable to assume that a willing buyer in this but-for assessment would have factored in the expectation that the mining lease would be renewed.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant takes the position that the GOB had in fact already agreed in the negotiations that the mining lease would be renewed for the life of the mine. It relies on a letter sent by Ms. Boggs to Chief Secretary Lehri in on 10 August 2009 in which she explained the benefits as well as the conditions of the net profit interest proposal Claimant had made in May 2009 and summarized the points on which they had agreed with the Steering Committee, including, \"*that Mining lease will be extended for the life of the mine on same terms and conditions*.\"478 Ms. Boggs further testified in this regard that while the initial draft had provided for discretion of the Government, \"*it was clear from subsequent negotiations that this was not, indeed, a major point of contention and that Balochistan was willing to agree to renew the license*.\"479 She added:\n\n\"*Balochistan's willingness to agree to extend the mining lease term was unsurprising. If the project was successful, as we expected it would be, and if we determined, at the end of the initial thirty-year term that we wanted to continue mining, it would be in Balochistan's interest to renew our license to ensure an uninterrupted flow of revenue to the Province from the project. The Government also had good reason to provide us with security of tenure for the entire life of mine. Our intention was to be at Reko Diq for a long time\u2014 long beyond the initial mine development. We planned to make a series of expansions, including the one described in our Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, and we also planned to do further exploration within our mining lease area. We had already identified several additional targets that we wanted to explore and I remember that Tim Livesey and his team were itching to do more drilling. Because drilling is expensive, we stopped drilling once we had sufficient resources to support the initial mine development feasibility study but we expected to resume after the mine was operational. By agreeing to extend the mining lease for the life of the mine, the Government was signaling to us that we would have security of tenure over any deposits we discovered through additional exploration. Because the Government stood to gain from the exploitation of these additional deposits, it was in their interest to ensure we had every incentive to continue drilling.*\"480\n\n**Exhibit CE-238**, p. 3.\n\nBoggs V, \u00b6 48.\n\nBoggs V, \u00b6 49.\n\n449.\n\nMr. Khokhar, on the other hand, maintained in his testimony that \"*the mining lease renewal was not a focus of the negotiations, because it was an issue to be decided by the Licensing Autority independently under the BMR 2002*\" but at the same time that he explained to Claimant that \"*they should not expect automatic renewal and that any renewal would need to follow the existing laws and procedures*.\"481\n\nKhokhar III, \u00b6 32.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there appears to be common ground between the Parties' witnesses to the extent that the issue of mining lease renewal did not form one of the major points of contention during the negotiations, but they fundamentally disagree as to the conclusion or agreement reached by the parties on that point. In the Tribunal's view, it is not plausible to assume that Claimant accepted without any major discussion that the matter would be entirely within the discretion of the Licensing Authority, without any form of assurance that Claimant would be entitled to continue operating the mine after the initial 30-year term.\n\n451.\n\nMs. Boggs' summary in her letter to Chief Secretary Lehri in August 2009 of the points on which the parties had reached agreement indicates the contrary and Respondent did not point to any contemporaneous evidence in the record that the GOB disagreed with that summary. Claimant further pointed to the minutes of the Negotiation Committee meeting on 15 October 2008 according to which \"*TCC has requested in regards to assurances as to its mining title and access*\" and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Chaudry, who are referred to as participants from Pakistan's side with Mr, Chaudry being the Chairman of the Negotiating Committee, \"*do not think this is a problem and these rights should be incorporated into the overall agreement*.\"482\n\n**Exhibit CE-942**, p. 13.\n\n452.\n\nBased on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal considers it likely that the GOB would have agreed on a provision in the Mineral Agreement pursuant to which the Mining Lease would be renewed after its initial 30-year term. As pointed out by Ms. Boggs, it would also have been in the interest of the GOB that the mine would continue to operate without interruption and provide it with revenues from its 25% interest in the project and the royalties it would be collecting. Likewise, it would have been in the GOB's interest to provide Claimant with security in return for Claimant's continued commitment to further develop and expand the mine as exploration activities continued in parallel to the construction and operation of the initial mine. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Ms. Boggs' further testimony:\n\n\"*Even in the absence of an explicit written agreement from Balochistan to renew our lease, however, I believe we would have been able to secure a lease renewal. In my experience, governments always renew mining leases unless there has been a major rift in their relationship with the investor, such as an environmental disaster or serious mismanagement. If a project is going well, it is clearly in the government's interest to renew the lease. With some very few exceptions, governments, particularly those without a long history of domestic mining, do not have the capacity to run large mines like this one and they therefore have no choice but to partner with a major mining company and there are just not that many of them. The bidding process to find a new partner is time-consuming and potentially very costly and there is no guarantee that the government will be able to reach an agreement that is more favorable than the one they already have in place with the original investor*.\"483\n\nBoggs V, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\n453.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers this testimony plausible and therefore agrees with Claimant that it is reasonable to assume in the present but-for assessment that the GOB would have agreed to renewing the Mining Lease after its initial 30-year term, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced that the GOB would have agreed to a completely unconditional renewal, *i.e*., a renewal without retaining any possibility to re-negotiate any of the terms to account for, *e.g*., a change of circumstances.\n\n454.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers it plausible that a willing buyer valuing the project in November 2011 would have factored in a certain risk that the GOB might not agree to a completely unconditional renewal and/or that the Mining Lease might not be renewed, or at least not on the exact same terms, thirty years into the future. For that reason, the Tribunal finds that the valuation of Claimant's investment in this arbitation may not simply assume that the Mining Lease would be renewed, without making any deductions for an inherent risk that the renewal of the Lease by the provincial Government might not be forthcoming as originally planned.\n\n455.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also agrees with Respondent that, contrary to Claimant's suggestion in its Quantum Memorial which it did not pursue further in its subsequent submissions,484 the Tribunal did not make a finding that Respondent had created a legitimate expectation on Claimant's part that it would be entitled to a renewal of the Mining Lease for the life of the mine without any changes to the commercial terms that would apply to the project for 56 years into the future. In particular, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant's argument that a finding made by the tribunal in *CME v. Czech*\n\n*Republic* that the \"*possibility of non-renewal of the* [broadcasting] *license \u2026 must be disregarded as a matter of fact*\" because \"*generally, broadcasting licenses in Europe are renewed as a matter of ordinary administrative practice*\"485 would be transferrable to the present case. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project would have been the first mining project of this scale in Pakistan. Consequently, there can be no general practice in Pakistan to renew a mining lease for a project such as Reko Diq \"*as a matter of ordinary administrative practice*.\"\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6 67\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Final Award of 14 March 2003 [CA-129], \u00b6 605.\n\n456.\n\nAs noted above, Ms. Boggs' testimony that mining leases are commonly renewed in the industry because most governments do not have the capacity to run large mines and because they have no guarantee of finding an alternative operator with whom they would be able to reach a more favorable agreement is perfectly plausible. In the Tribunal's view, this does not eliminate, however, the risk that the Government might request an adjustment of the commercial terms in return for renewing the Mining Lease or might even refuse to renew the Mining Lease based on certain legitimate policy considerations that could not be known in November 2011. In the Tribunal's view, it further cannot be assumed that any request for re-negotiations or the refusal to renew, regardless of the reasons for such refusal, would necessarily have to be deemed a breach of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty that must be assumed away for the purposes of this but-for assessment.\n\n457.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that: (i) a willing buyer would have included the value associated with a mining lease renewal in its valuation because it was likely that the GOB would have agreed on such a provision in the Mineral Agreement; but (ii) the buyer would also have factored in the risk that the GOB might not have agreed on an unconditional renewal or that, in any event, the mining lease might not be renewed or at least not be renewed on the same terms thirty years into the future. In the Tribunal's view, this finding, *i.e*., that a buyer would have accounted for the value but would also have accounted for the risk that this value might not materialize, is also supported by the significant value that Claimant's expert Prof. Davis calculated for the renewal.\n\n458.\n\nAccording to the sensitivity analysis provided by Prof. Davis, the impact of an assumption that the Mining Lease would not be renewed would lower the value of Claimant's share in the project by USD 2,978 million.486 For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it most likely that a willing buyer would have factored in a risk of 25% that the value of the renewal would not materialize or that the renewal would not be on the same commercial terms and thus would have been prepared to pay 75% of that value, which therefore represents the fair market value of the renewal for the present but-for assessment. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the amount requested by Claimant must be reduced by 25% of the difference between the value including the renewal and the value excluding the renewal, *i.e*., by USD 744.5 million.\n\nDavis II, Table 7.\n\n**(d) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n459.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it is most likely that Claimant and the Governments would have reached an agreement on the terms of a Mineral Agreement. It further finds that those terms would most likely have included: (i) a sliding scale increasing from 2% to 4% over the life of the mine, on the basis that the GOB's interest in the project would have been restructured to a 25% net profit interest; (ii) EPZ status or similar tax concessions for the first fifteen years of the project while returning to the normal tax regime for the remainder of the mine's life; and (iii) a provision regarding the renewal of the Mining Lease. As for the renewal, the Tribunal finds, however, that a willing buyer would have factored in the risk that the value of the renewal would not materialize or that the renewal would not be on the same commercial terms and would thus have been prepared to pay 75% of the value associated with a renewal of the Mining Lease.\n\n460.\n\nOn that basis and based on the sensitivity analyses provided by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal concludes that the amount requested by Claimant as damages must be reduced by: (i) USD 287 million to account for the assumption that the parties would not have agreed on a 2% royalty but rather a sliding scale of royalties increasing from 2.5% to 4% over the life of the mine; and (ii) USD 744.5 million to account for the assumption that a buyer would have factored in a risk of 25% that the Mining Lease might not be renewed or might not be renewed on the same terms.487\n\nDavis II, Tables 8 and 7.\n\n**2. Whether Claimant Has Established the Estimation and Classification of the Resources Reported in the Feasibility Study**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will address the question whether Claimant has established the accuracy of the estimation and classification of the resources that were reported in the Feasibility Study and also formed the basis of Prof. Davis' calculation of the project's future cash flows.\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nClaimant submits that TCC conducted multiple drilling campaigns extending over 350,000 meters and thereby established that Reko Diq had proven and probable reserves (the reserve base reflecting measured and indicated resources) of nearly 13 million tonnes of copper and nearly 23 million ounces of gold, which as of 2011 made it the sixteenth largest copper deposit in the world.488 Claimant adds than an additional 1,759,309,557 ore tonnes of inferred resources had been identified but were not assigned any value by Prof. Davis even though a willing buyer would have expected to be able to mine a significant portion of those inferred resources during the life of the mine.489\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 430.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 430.\n\n463.\n\nClaimant argues that neither of Respondent's criticisms on geology and metallurgy affects the value of the project because they are factually incorrect and \"*reveal a profound lack of understanding about mining practices in general and the Reko Diq project in particular.*\"490\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 36.\n\n464.\n\nClaimant maintains that its resource estimate is \"*highly reliable*\" and refers to its geology expert, Mr. Mario Rossi, who concluded that TCC's resource estimate \"*was conducted professionally and in accordance with widely accepted industry practices. It provides a reliable estimate of Reko Diq's resources, an estimate of the kind that buyers and sellers regularly use when transacting in mining properties*.\"491 Claimant considers that neither Respondent nor its experts have challenged the result of Mr. Rossi's \"*targeted due diligence specifically for this arbitration*\" which \"*independently corroborated TCC's work*\" and notes that Respondent's experts have not offered any alternative resource estimate. In Claimant's view, Respondent's case on geology does not concern resource estimation but only the classification of those resources and TCC's compliance with reporting standards.492\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 37, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 443.\n\n465.\n\nClaimant contends that the classification of Reko Diq's resources into the relevant levels of geological confidence, *i.e*., measured, indicated and inferred resources, followed sound industry practice and was done \"[w]*ith no incentive other than getting it right*.\" Claimant submits that its owners had initially adopted different methods, with Barrick applying the geometric method reflecting the current industry standard and Antofagasta applying the less common and more complex probabilistic method; they then called on Mr. Rossi to propose a common methodology for TCC. Mr Rossi advised them to adopt \"*a rigorous version of the tried-and-tested geometric method, using a separate probabilistic check*\" which improved on the model that had been used by Barrick and implemented a probabilistic view of the classification so obtained, in line with the most advanced industry standards.493 Claimant further points out that this methodology was also endorsed in a contemporaneous independent audit by the consultant Behre Dolbear, which noted that \"[t]*he Rossi scheme, moving from probabilistic to geometric methods, has enforced a focus on continuity in grade and geology. The precepts and steps to be implemented are endorsed*.\"494\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 433-439; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 441, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1331**, p. 25; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 40.\n\n466.\n\nIn response to the argument of Respondent's expert, Prof. Dagdelen, that Mr. Rossi's method led to a result that \"*is 41.5% higher than the Measured and Indicated tonnes estimated by Antofagasta's geologists*,\" Claimant notes that he failed to take into account Antofagasta's results yielded by the probabilistic method under an expansion scenario, which were in fact higher than the results yielded by Mr. Rossi's method used in the Feasibility Study.495 Claimant also points out that the results were lower than those produced by Barrick's initial classification of measured and indicated resources.496\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41, quoting from Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 211; Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 170.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 442.\n\n467.\n\nClaimant further rejects the argument that Mr. Rossi's method would be \"*highly unusual and unprecedented*,\" noting that Prof. Dagdelen agreed with Mr. Rossi that the geometric method is the leading classification method used by about 95% of the industry and conceded that \"*probably zero*\" mining companies follow the probabilistic technique.497 Claimant points out that Prof. Dagdelen did not identify any reason why TCC should have adopted a probabilistic method but merely referred to \"*the advantages that Mario* [Rossi] *came up with*.\"498 Claimant notes that Mr. Rossi also described risks and shortcomings of this method which makes it less robust than the geometric method but suitable as a check.499 According to Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen does not have the relevant professional expertise on resource estimation because, unlike Mr. Rossi, he has not worked as a Qualified Person (QP) on any of the world's 10 largest copper mines and could not identify any copper porphyry deposit on which he worked as a QP.500\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 42, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 915. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 438.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 43, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 925.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 43, *referring to* Rossi, \u00b6 56 and Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), pp. 727-730.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44.\n\n468.\n\nClaimant also contends that, even though considering it \"*strictly irrelevant to Reko Diq's market value*\" whether formal reporting requirements were met, TCC and its owners complied with the applicable reporting standards. While the Canadian reporting standard NI 43-101 does not apply to the private Australian company TCC, Claimant argues that in any event it contains language in its Section 5.3 pursuant to which producing issuers, such as Barrick and Antofagasta, are exempted from the requirement than an independent QP approve technical reports (not the feasibility study itself, which usually remains confidential because it contains trade secrets and commercially sensitive information) which were instead reviewed and signed off by QPs employed by both companies.501\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 45; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 444-448.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nRespondent submits that in order to determine the value of the copper and gold beneath the surface at Reko Diq, Claimant must achieve a level of certainty that it would be able and economically feasible to turn the rock into recoverable metal. Respondent emphasizes that if any of the issues that might arise poses a cost that is too high for the mineral to be economically extracted, the resources cannot be classified as anything more than inferred and do not have any economic value; they can never become reserves.502\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 193.\n\n470.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant regarding the classification of resources into inferred, indicated and measured resources and adds that inferred resources, which cannot be ascribed any value, can only be moved to a category of increased certainty based on studies evaluating all relevant factors if these studies show that \"*at the time of reporting, that extraction of the metals from the deposit can be economically justified*.\"503 According to Respondent, Claimant made \"*unwarranted assumptions that moved resources into more valuable categories*\" and while it may have been able to measure the total size of the ore bodies, \"*it did not have the drilling to show that it could classify the resources as indicated or measured on the scale claimed by TCC*.\"504\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 196, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owen I, p. 25.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 198.\n\n471.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant's owners initially performed independent analyses of Claimant's drilling, which reached \"*far different conclusion*[s].\" According to Respondent, the model applied by Antofagasta based on statistical assumptions is a \"*newer model*\" but \"*tends to produce more accurate results*\" than the \"*block model*\" applied by Barrick; it resulted on a \"*much more conservative figures with a lower economic value*.\" According to Respondent, the third-party consultant hired by the owners, Mr. Rossi, \"*essentially selected the best parts of both methodologies, even though the methodologies depart from different premises, and decided to move a large portion of the inferred resources into the indicated category and add more resources to the inferred category*.\" Respondent considers that there is not scientific support for this method and its conclusion is not sufficient for NI 43-101 regulations.505\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 211-214.\n\n472.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's claims must fail because it has failed to maintain the information underlying the database to create the resource model or method to interpret it and because Mr. Rossi's classification of the resources \"*lacks significant indicia of reliability*.\" In addition, Respondent considers that there is no dispute regarding the amount of metallurgical sampling in testing and maintains that the deposits are not sufficiently certain \"*to merit the scant sampling and testing done*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant's \"*excuses*\" regarding the lack of a signature by a QP further show that a buyer would not have trusted in a feasibility study that Claimant's owners would not stand behind.506 According to Respondent. \"*the entirety of the resource model and its calculations are uncertain and speculative*.\"507\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 168.\n\n473.\n\nRespondent argues that since 2006 the size and grade of the resource at Reko Diq have deteriorated \"[w]*ith almost every update.*\" According to Respondent, Claimant's drilling campaign revealed \"*a low-grade copper deposit that continued the drop in quality*.\" Respondent also points out that the audit conducted by Behre Dolbear in September 2009 mentions a reduced size of the resource.508\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 73; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1331**, p. 7.\n\n474.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show that its resource model is trustworthy given that: (i) it has not provided an independent analysis that admitted flaws were fixed; (ii) it did not rebut Prof. Dagdelen's findings regarding the flaws in the database underlying the resource model; and (iii) Mr. Rossi's method and its application are \"*completely unreliable*.\"509\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 75.\n\n475.\n\nRespondent claims that Prof. Dagdelen identified \"*several key flaws in the drill hole database*\" for Tanjeel, H-13 and also the Feasibility Study, such as \"*grade-related issues*\" and \"*information gaps*\" in the alterations and lithologies as well as collar coordinates.510 According to Respondent, the audit referred to by Claimant in response to this criticism does not address any corrective measures for Tanjeel and H-13.511 Respondent also refers to Prof. Dagdelen's review of the project records in Islamabad which in its view revealed missing information and made it impossible to confirm or recreate data.512\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 76, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 157, 162.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 77, *referring to* **Exhibit C-1331**, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 77.\n\n476.\n\nRespondent further contends that it is doubtful whether Claimant used the method devised by Mr. Rossi, given that he was not aware whether it was applied, there was no QP making a decision regarding the appropriate classification method, and Claimant's final resource calculation was \"*far better*\" than the results predicted by Mr. Rossi.513 In addition, Respondent argues that the results yielded by his method are unreliable because \"*none of the key conclusions in his memorandum proved true*.\" Respondent considers it irrelevant whether the method produces identical results at 110,000 tonnes and 220,000 tonnes of production per day and maintains that it is \"*highly unusual*\" that the resource calculations of Antofagasta and Barrick were so far apart. According to Respondent, the fact that Mr. Rossi's method yielded results \"*roughly similar to Barrick's resource calculation*\" shows that Barrick was \"*controlling the process and pushing for unscientic conclusions*.\"514\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 78; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 181.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 78-80.\n\n477.\n\nRespondent submits that, unlike Mr. Rossi who was recruited to review his own work in the past, Prof. Dagdelen, is \"a *QP with no prior interest in the project*\" and he has identified several criticisms of Mr. Rossi's method which was never adopted by an independent QP.515\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 181-185.\n\n478.\n\nRespondent submits that by contrast to the Feasibility Study which Claimant kept confidential, a feasibility study compliant with with NI 43-101 regulations is made available to the public person and signed by a QP.516 Respondent maintains that Claimant's Feasibility Study had to be signed by an independent QP, in compliance with the relevant reporting standard NI 43-101, arguing that the statement of resources came from a joint venture where one partner is not a \"*producing issuer*\" for purposes of Canadian law. Respondent also argues that Barrick has filed technical reports signed by a QP for every resource calculation since 2009; however, there was no resource calculation done at feasibility level which would have included all available information. Respondent claims that Claimant failed to show that its Board of Directors or either of its owner had \"*signed off*\" on the Feasibility Study.517\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 216.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 216; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 186-189; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 104-106.\n\n479.\n\nRespondent contends that the audit conducted by Behre Dolbear was done at pre-feasibility stage and \"*does not look at the resource model in the IMD FS from the perspective of the heightened accuracy requirements*\" at feasibility level.518 Respondent also points to statements in the audit that data from an additional 63 drill holes had to be integrated \"*before the figures can be accepted for input to feasibility studies*\" and \"*other deposits also need to be re-estimated over the coming months*.\"519 Respondent notes that Mr. Rossi does not make reference to adding data from these additional drill holes or re-estimation of other deposits and therefore concludes that Claimant \"*did not do the work to take its resource estimation from the pre-feasibility stage to the feasibility stage*.\"520\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 190-192; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 74.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 193, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1331**, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 193.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n480.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis on whether Claimant has established the accuracy of the estimation and classification of the mineral resources reported in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal notes that the estimation and classification performed for the Feasibility Study was not conducted for the purposes of a damages valuation in contentious proceedings but rather for the purposes of determining whether the resources available could form the basis of successful mining operations at Reko Diq. As a general matter, the Tribunal therefore does not consider it plausible that Claimant and its owners would apply a \"*haphazard resource estimation technique to inflate the value of the mine*,\" as Respondent alleges.521 Why would these companies and their employees as well as the independent consultant they instructed to devise a method for estimating and classifying resources be interested in \"*inflating*\" the value of a mine that they intended to build and operate? In the Tribunal's view, these general considerations should be borne in mind when evaluating the criticisms raised by Respondent and its experts in these arbitration proceedings.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 211.\n\n481.\n\nAs a further preliminary matter, the Tribunal understands that a distinction must be drawn between: (i) \"*resource estimation*\" which aims at determining the tonnage and grade (concentration) of metal in a deposit; and (ii) \"*resource classification*\" which describes the level of confidence in the predicted resources, with the commonly used categories being measured resources (high level of confidence), indicated (reasonable level of confidence) and inferred resources (low level of confidence).522 While the Parties take different views as to whether inferred resources can be attributed some economic value, Prof. Davis has not attributed any value to the inferred resources for Reko Diq in his valuation,523 which means that there is no need to express an opinion on this point.\n\n*Cf*. Rossi, \u00b6\u00b6 45-49.\n\n*Cf*. Davis I, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\n482.\n\nWhile Respondent initially argued that Claimant applied \"*improper resource estimation techniques*\" in the Feasibility Study,524 Respondent clarified in its subsequent submissions that its objection relates to the \"*resource model*\" devised by Mr. Rossi and whether it was (correctly) applied in the Feasibility Study.525 As explained by Mr. Rossi in his expert report, this model did not concern the estimation of the resource available at Reko Diq but rather its classification into the categories of confidence.526 It therefore appears that Respondent's challenge does not aim at the resource estimate as such or how it was obtained. The Tribunal is aware that this may not be entirely correct as Respondent has challenged Claimant\u2019s approach to determining the geo-metallurgical domains of the ore body which are also relevant in the estimation of the overall available resource.527 However, as the Parties have addressed this issue in the context of the question whether Claimant has conducted adequate metallurgical sampling and testing to determine the economical extractability of the metals, the Tribunal will also analyze this aspect in that context. For the present purposes, it suffices to note that, as will be set out in detail below, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant\u2019s approach to determining the geo-metallurgical domains was sound and in accordance with industry practice.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 211 *et seq*.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 166 *et seq*.; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 73 *et seq*.\n\n*Cf*. Rossi, \u00b6 62.\n\n*Cf* Rossi, \u00b6 45 lit. c.\n\n483.\n\nAt the same time, Respondent\u2019s challenge to the classification of the resources is relevant to the present analysis of Claimant\u2019s damages because, as Prof. Davis explained, only the two categories reflecting a high or reasonable level of confidence, *i.e.,* measured and indicated resources, are taken into account in his valuation. Consequently, the Tribunal must be convinced that the classification of the resources in the Feasibility Study was reasonable and in line with what a willing buyer would have accepted in November 2011.\n\n484.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Barrick and Antofagasta initially applied different methods to classify the resources at Reko Diq and that these methods produced deviating results. In a Memorandum dated March 2009, Mr. Rossi of GeoSystems International (GSI), who was consulted by Claimant to determine the best approach to classifying the resources, noted that the different resource classification methods applied by Barrick and Antofagasta *\"have resulted in very different proportions and tonnages of measured, indicated and inferred material for these deposits,\"* which he depicted in the following table:528\n\n**Table 1: Initial Resource Classification of H14 and H15, based on Barrick\u2019s and****AMSA\u2019s method.**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Cutoff****Cueq725** | **Barrick methodology** | **AMSA's classification based on 100 KT/d** |\n| MT | **Cueq725 (%)** | **Cut (%)** | **Au (ppm)** | MT | **Cueq725(%)** | **Cut (%)** | **Au (ppm)** |\n| **Measured** | **0.3** | **93** | **0,668** | **0,519** | **0,302** | **881** | **0,681** | **0,532** | **0,301** |\n| **Indicated** | **0.3** | **2,315** | **0,653** | **0,510** | **0,289** | **657** | **0,644** | **0,506** | **0,278** |\n| **M+Ind** | **0.3** | **2,408** | **0,654** | **0,511** | **0,289** | **1,539** | **0,665** | **0,521** | **0,291** |\n| **Inferred** | **0.3** | **364** | **0,659** | **0,506** | **0,311** | **2,578** | **0,645** | **0,496** | **0,301** |\n| **MIl** | **0.3** | **2,772** | **0,654** | **0,510** | **0,292** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** |\n| **Unclass** | **0.3** | **1,344** | **0,651** | **0,498** | **0,307** |  |  |  |  |\n| **Mll+U** | **0.3** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** |\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Cutoff Cueq725** | **Barrick methodology** | **AMSA's classification based on 200 KT/d** |\n| MT | **Cueq725 (%)** | **Cut (%)** | **Au (ppm)** | **MT** | **Cueq725 (%)** | **Cut (%)** | **Au (ppm)** |\n| **Measured** | **0.3** | **93** | **0,668** | **0,519** | **0,302** | **1,406** | **0,668** | **0,523** | **0,293** |\n| **Indicated** | **0.3** | **2,315** | **0,653** | **0,510** | **0,289** | **964** | **0,626** | **0,494** | **0,268** |\n| **M+Ind** | **0.3** | **2,408** | **0 654** | **0511** | **0 289** | **2,370** | **0 651** | **0 511** | **0 283** |\n| **Inferred** | **0.3** | **364** | **0,659** | **0,506** | **0,311** | **1,746** | **0,654** | **0,498** | **0,317** |\n| **MIl** | **0.3** | **2,772** | **0,654** | **0,510** | **0,292** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** |\n| **Unclass** | **0.3** | **1,344** | **0,651** | **0,498** | **0,307** |  |  |  |  |\n| **Mll+U** | **0.3** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** | **4,116** | **0,653** | **0,506** | **0,297** |\n\nAppendix 4 - memo\\_rep\\_rd\\_class.doc 1\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, Table 1.\n\n485.\n\nMr. Rossi noted that Antofagasta's method depended on the production rate, which he considered \"*difficult to reconcile with mining engineer's standard practices*\" and \"*better suited for advanced projects, when the production rate is not variable*.\"529 Following a description of the geometric method applied by Barrick and the probabilistic method applied by Antofagasta, Mr. Rossi considered:\n\n\"*Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and both methods (as are all resource classification methods) are inescapably subjective. Although well understood by most people, the reader is reminded that we should not believe there is an* 'objective' *or* 'true' *classification method; the best we can aspire for is reasonableness and consistency*.\"530\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, pp. 2, 6.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, p. 6.\n\n486.\n\nMr. Rossi discussed the advantages and disadvantages of probabilistic and geometric methods and examined the results of sensitivity analyses conducted on each method and then proposed an alternative method:\n\n\"*GSI proposes a method based on a combination of geological and grade continuity, data density, and understanding of the deposit. The method is in essence an attempt to gain the advantages of the two concepts originally proposed by the JV partners. It is geometric in the definition of the resource categories, but with a probabilistic check to assess whether the original definitions of measured, indicated, and inferred result in an acceptable level of confidence*.\n\n*Most of these steps were completed in Santiago, with the exception of the final smoothing and the probabilistic characterization of the classified resources (see below). Also,* [Antofagasta] *stated that there were further drill holes that could be added into the database (not currently available) which should be considered before the final classification runs were completed*.\"531\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, p. 9.\n\n487.\n\nMr. Rossi then presented a step-by-step plan of his proposed method and concluded that \"[a]*fter completion of the initial resource classification using the proposed method, it is expected that total resources for H14 and H15 will be split approximately evenly into Measured, Indicated, and Inferred*.\" He further expected that the total measured plus indicated resources would drop from 2.37 billion tonnes to about 2 billion.532\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, p. 12.\n\n488.\n\nRespondent argues that it is uncertain whether the method proposed by Mr. Rossi in March 2009 was implemented by Claimant, given that the results produced by its method were higher than those predicted by Mr. Rossi in the conclusions of his memorandum. During the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rossi testified that he did not know at the time whether Claimant would follow his recommendation but that based on a due diligence that he was asked to perform for this arbitration, he stated that \"*I know that they followed the recommendations in the main points that I made, and I know that they also made modifications to the parameters I had originally proposed, which I found appropriate during my due diligence last year.*\" He added that \"*these* [modifications] *were minor in the context and actually affected only the Measure for some grade domains*.\"533 In response to the question whether his expectation that the measured and indicated resources would drop to 2 billion tonnes corresponds to the actual results reported in the Feasibility Study, Mr. Rossi acknowledged that this was not the case. He added that \"*remember that this was an exercise based on a different model that had not yet been prepared*\" and emphasized that there had also been a \"*significant number of tonnage in the unclassified category*\" and clarified that his expectation of a drop in resources had referred to an expected reclassification of resources.534\n\nTransscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 743 lines 8-16.\n\nTransscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 747 line 12 to p. 748 line 8.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal considers Mr. Rossi's testimony credible. Based on his due diligence of the resource classification work for the Feasibility Study, Mr. Rossi confirmed that Claimant had implemented the method he had proposed with certain minor modifications that he considered appropriate. The Tribunal does not have any reason to believe that, contrary to Mr. Rossi's testimony, Claimant significantly deviated from the recommendations given by Mr. Rossi in March 2009. Neither of Respondent's experts has testified to this effect. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that certain of Mr. Rossi's expectations did not materialize does not indicate that Claimant did not follow his proposed method; neither does it indicate that Mr. Rossi's method is generally unreliable, as Respondent also alleges. As Mr. Rossi testified, the model he was proposing had not yet been prepared and he was therefore only providing expectations. His expectations were further based on the data available as of March 2009, *i.e.,* more than a year before the Feasibility Study was completed. It is undisputed that during this time period, Claimant continued its drilling program and continued to receive updated data that would then be incorporated into the resource classification model. Mr. Rossi noted already in his March 2009 memorandum that Antofagasta had stated that \"*there were further drill holes that could be added into the database (not currently available) which should be considered before the final classification runs were completed*.\"535\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-3.08**, p. 9.\n\n490.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that the remaining issue to be addressed is whether the resource classification method devised by Mr. Rossi, as implemented by Claimant in the Feasibility Study, produced accurate results on which a willing buyer would have based its valuation of the Reko Diq project. In this regard, the Tribunal takes note of the following statement in Mr. Rossi's expert report regarding the choice of a method for classifying resources:\n\n\"*There is no single right answer, and the appropriate method must be decided by the CP. International standards, which I discuss in more detail below, give significant leeway to the CP to make these decisions and do not prescribe rigid criteria or precise implementation methods to be used at the time of resource classification. A common misconception is that resource classification provides an objective measure of the confidence with which a mineral resource estimate has been obtained. In fact, resource classification is simply the expression of an experienced and competent opinion, that of the CP. The CP's good judgment is crucial. For this reason, the JORC Code (and other, similar standards) stipulate that* '[a] '*Competent Person*' must have a minimum of five years' experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which that person is undertaking.'\"536\n\nRossi, \u00b6 57.\n\n491.\n\nMr. Rossi emphasized in his report that he was never asked to act as a Competent Person (CP) for Claimant or any of its owners but that he was rather asked to advise their own CPs on what would be the most reasonable approach for the classification of the resources at Reko Diq.537 According to Respondent, the absence of a resource estimation at feasibility level signed by an independent QP/CP, who exercised the \"*good judgment*\" referred to by Mr. Rossi, means that Claimant's classification of resources lacks the necessary validation and is therefore unreliable.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 79.\n\n492.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to whether the Canadian reporting standards NI 43-101 on which Respondent relies with regard to the requirement of an independent QP signing off on technical reports applies to the resource estimate included in the Feasibility Study and, if so, whether an exemption applies to the independence requirement because Claimant's owners are producing issuers. In the Tribunal's view, however, the decisive question is whether, as decribed by Mr. Rossi in the excerpt quoted above, \"*an experienced and competent opinion*\" was given and \"*good judgment*\" was exercised by a person with the necessary experience to determine the appropriate resource classification method for Reko Diq.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal understands Mr. Rossi's testimony to mean that he was not the one making the judgment call that he described above. Barrick's and Antofagasta's teams had the necessary experience themselves but given the debate among them regarding the appropriate classification method, they sought advice from a third party and decided to act on that advice with certain minor modifications. As pointed out by Claimant, Barrick's and Antofagasta's annual reports for 2011 reported on Reko Diq's resource estimate and included references to their respective QP/CPs.538 This was also noted by Prof. Davis in his second report.539\n\n**Exhibtits CE-1040**, pp. 183, 188 and **CE-1023**, pp. 146, 149. Antofagasta's 2011 annual report specifically notes: \"*The information on ore reserves and mineral resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC Code. The Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. The Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears. The Competent Person for Exploration Results and Mineral Resources is Orlando Rojas (MAusIMM), Assistant Manager of Mineral Resource Evaluation for Antofagasta Minerals S.A.. The Competent Person for Ore Reserves is Murray Canfield (P.Eng. Ontario), Technical Manager Operations for Antofagasta Minerals S.A*.\"\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 216.\n\n494.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that a Competent Person from each of Claimant's owners made the judgment call referred to by Mr. Rossi and reached the conclusion that the method devised by Mr. Rossi was appropriate for Reko Diq.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that as part of his due diligence conducted for this arbitration, Mr. Rossi also applied an alternative method, defining alternative geological domains and applying different statistical parameters to estimate grades, to estimate and classify the resources at Reko Diq and concluded that this method confirmed the reliability of Claimant's resource estimation, including the classification as measured and indicated resources. Specifically, his alternative method resulted in an estimate of measured and indicated resources that was roughly 0.8% higher than Claimant's estimate. In his opinion, both methods are \"*scientifically sound and could be adopted by a CP to estimate Reko Diq's resources*\" and he explained that close estimates yielded by the two alternative methods confirm that the underlying data is sufficient and accurate.540\n\nRossi, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 70-75.\n\n496.\n\nClaimant also points out that the method proposed by Mr. Rossi in March 2009 formed part of an audit by the mining industry consultant Behre Dolbear in September 2009 on which both Parties relied in various parts of their submissions. On resource classification, the audit report notes:\n\n\"*The Rossi scheme, moving from probabilistic to geometric methods, has enforced a focus on continuity in grade and geology. The precepts and steps to be implemented are endorsed*.\"541\n\nExhibit CE-1331, p. 28.\n\n497.\n\nRespondent points out that the audit was conducted in September 2009 and therefore did not pertain to the final resource estimate included in the Feasibility Study in 2010. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that the audit does not confirm the correct implementation of Mr. Rossi's proposed method by Claimant in the Feasibility Study. It confirms, however, that the auditor endorsed the method as such and contradicts Respondent's allegation that the method was \"*haphazard*\" or \"*scientifically bogus*.\"542\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 211, 214.\n\n498.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that while Prof. Dagdelen has criticized the method proposed by Mr. Rossi, he has not specified which classification method should have been applied nor has he provided an alternative resource estimate or classification. The Tribunal is also not convinced by Prof. Dagdelen's opinion that Mr. Rossi's method was \"*highly unusual and unprecedented*\" because a resource classification method cannot be \"*somehow modified or amalgamated with other methods*.\"543 Mr. Rossi clarified in his report that he did not amalgamate the two methods but rather proposed to apply a geometric method and then perform a separate probabilistic check to test the robustness of the initial geometric classification.544 Prof. Dagdelen did not dispute or address this explanation in his second report.\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 171.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 81.\n\n499.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Dagdelen confirmed that he considered it \"*unusual*\" to have a probabilistic check on a geometric method and that he had not seen this being done in his experience. He stated that \"*95 percent of the companies use geometric method, and probably not many of them\u2014probably zero\u2014follow it by the probabilistic technique*.\" Prof. Dagdelen first confirmed Mr. Rossi's testimony that 95% of companies use the geometric method rather than probabilistic methods but then testified that Claimant should have used the probabilistic method because he considered Antofagasta \"*a very experienced copper mining company*\" and one should \"*pay attention*\" to the method proposed by its geologist.545\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 915 line 1 to p. 917 line 9.\n\n500.\n\nBased on Prof. Dagdelen's oral testimony, the Tribunal considers it agreed between the Parties' experts that a geometric method as Mr. Rossi proposed to use as a primary classification method is commonly used in the mining industry and would therefore also have been considered sound and in line with industry practice by a buyer. The Tribunal is further not convinced by Prof. Dagdelen's suggestion that it would be less reasonable to perform an additional, probabilistic check on the result obtained by the primary classification method. In particular taking into account that Prof. Dagdelen agreed that it was important to give consideration to Antofagasta's probabilistic approach given its experience in copper mining, the Tribunal fails to see how a probabilistic check validating the geometric approach should render the classification less reliable than an isolated geometric approach or an isolated probabilistic approach.\n\n501.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has established that the estimation and classification of the resources reported in the Feasibility Study, which formed the basis for Prof. Davis' valuation of Claimant's damage, is in accordance with industry practice and corresponded to an exercise of \"*good judgment*\" by the relevant Competent Persons within Barrick and Antofagasta who adopted and implemented the method, which Mr. Rossi had proposed upon his review of the methods previously applied by Claimant's two owners in March 2009.\n\n**3. Whether Claimant Has Established That Sufficient Metallurgical Testing Was Conducted to Confirm That the Minerals Could Be Economically Extracted**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nClaimant submits that: (i) its metallurgical sampling adequately represented the material to be processed by the mine; and (ii) its metallurgical testing validated \"*consistently high recoveries of copper and gold at marketable concentrate grades*.\" Claimant refers to its metallurgy expert, Dr. Corby Anderson, who confirmed that \"*the Reko Diq Feasibility Study is robust. The underlying methodology and metallurgical testing are of excellent quality. TCC conducted many phases of metallurgical testwork on many tonnes of Reko Diq material originating from thousands of samples, which are representative of the orebody's relevant lithologies and alterations, or as we called them,* 'domains.'\"546\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1112.\n\n503.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that initial tests using water from Reko Diq produced lower recoveries but emphasizes that \"[a]*s a result of the poor site water result, a new program of site water test optimization was implemented*\" which identified an improved flotation process.547 Claimant argues that by using an improved chemical recipe, it was able to obtain consistently high recoveries above 90% for all ore types found at Reko Diq, including the tests using water from the Fan Sediments; these recoveries were confirmed by subsequent pilot tests validating the proposed technology.548 Claimant notes that Respondent's expert Prof. Dagdelen acknowledged that \"*AMMTEC was able to come up with a flotation process that gave high copper and gold recoveries*\" and adds that Prof. Dagdelen stated during Hearing on Quantum that \"*if a QP had signed* [TCC's studies], *then* [he] *would be totally happy with* [them].\"549 Dr. Anderson in turn testified that, being a QP with relevant experience himself, he would have signed off on the studies \"*without hesitation*.\"550 Claimant also points to the confirmation by Respondent's expert Prof. Spiller that Claimant's optimized reagent scheme produced \"*very, very good results*.\"551\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 482-484, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-28.06**, p. 50.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 472-473, 484-485 *referring to* Rossi, Figure 10.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 35 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1008.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1128.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1199.\n\n504.\n\nClaimant contends that the samples taken by Prof. Dagdelen during his site visit were much too small to provide meaningful data and the tests conducted on them by RDi laboratory failed to account for numerous variables such as mineralogy and liberation or likely oxidation, as Dr. Anderson pointed out in his report.552 In any event, Claimant claims that the results of the RDi laboratory confirmed the quality of the AMMTEC results; according to Dr. Anderson, they \"*tend to corroborate that TCC's proposed flotation flowsheet was robust and adequately de-risked the project*.\"553 Claimant also points to Prof. Spiller's report which noted that AMMTEC's tests \"*produced a slightly higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs 22.8).*\"554\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50, *quoting from* Anderson, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 50, *quoting from* Spiller I, \u00b6 14.\n\n505.\n\nClaimant further rejects the argument that \"*TCC built its entire design criteria for the mine around 21 tests from shallow depths with the highest grades*.\"555 Claimant emphasizes that its metallurgical program was not limited to 21 tests but rather consisted of several phases of testing in which roughly 85,000kg of materials and 120,000kg of water were used and contends that \"*thousands of metallurgical tests*\" were run, including \"*hundreds of tests just to optimize and perfect Reko Diq' ultimate metallurgical flowsheet*.\"556 Claimant points out that Prof. Spiller admitted during the Hearing on Quantum that \"*AMMTEC did many, many, many tests*\" and stated that \"*there* [were] *21 tests that, you know, followed a vast amount of locked-cycle tets, open-cycle tests, mineralogy, very, very in-depth looking at it*.\"557\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50, *quoting from* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 167.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 52;

As noted in the Feasibility Study, \"[d]*ue to the amount of recategorization in Phase 1, this second phase of sampling and test work was designed to provide a complete and sound basis for the PFS*.\"560\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 475-480, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-6**, p. 6-14.\n\n508.\n\nClaimant rejects the argument that its metallurgical sampling was insufficient because most of the samples tested for metallurgical response came from depths of 450 meters or less from the surface.561 According to Claimant, its metallurgical sampling was representative of the deposit's geo-metallurgical domains and thus the pit as a whole.562 Claimant considers it agreed between the Parties' experts that domains \"*reflect the classification of the deposit's material into different units which, based on their mineral composition and other relevant characteristics, are expected to respond in the same way to metallurgical processes*.\"563 It further refers to Mr. Rossi who testified that \"[b]*efore you send the first sample to the metallurgical test lab, you have an understanding of what the geology is because you have all this other drilling that you have done. And it's that drilling that is actually defining the domains*.\"564 Again referring to Mr. Rossi, Claimant submits that based on the previous drilling campaigns, it \"*had adequately characterized the orebody from a metallurgical standpoint*,\" which allowed the metallurgical sampling program to \"*target those domains*.\"565\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 450, 456.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 474, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 105.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1685**, p. 3, Transcript Hearing on Qantum (Day 4), p. 1001, *and* Rossi, \u00b6 94. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 457-459, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 772.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6\u00b6 91, 96.

While material from earlier drilling also provided it with test samples for metallurgical testing, Claimant also drilled specific metallurgical holes carrying down \"*well below 450m*\" given that one domain had been identified that existed only deep within the orebody. Claimant quotes from Mr. Richard H. Sillitoe, an expert on porphyry deposits who reviewed the project's geological data in June 2009 and confirmed that \"*no further deep drilling is necessary and none need to be contemplated*.\"566\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 463-467, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-3.19**, p. 8.\n\n510.\n\nClaimant points out that two of the main litholigies in Reko Diq's domains are horizontal layers of rock one of which (VIN) occurs at above roughly 350 meters from the surface while the other (VFL) occurs below this depth. By contrast, the third main lithology (PFB, porphyries) consists of vertical intrusions which are over 1,000 meters in depth. Claimant submits that, as acknowledged by Prof. Dagdelen, it sampled VFL material from the bottom of the pit.567 As for the vertical PFB domain, Claimant argues that it could select samples from any depth because these would show, \"*within accepted levels of variance, similar metallurgical response*.\" Claimant refers to Mr. Rossi who testified that \"[i]*n larger porphyry systems like Reko Diq, a few hundred meters in vertical depth within the porphyry formation will not substantially change the rock's metallurgical properties*.\"568\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 998.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 59, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 35. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 469-470.\n\n511.\n\nClaimant adds that the classification of the PFB domain was confirmed by \"*numerous variability tests*\" testing material from different depths and emphasizes that neither Prof. Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller challenged Claimant's definition of Reko Diq's domains. Claimant submits that: (i) Prof. Dagdelen confirmed during the Hearing that he did not perform any variability tests to support his assertion that the domains showed \"*variability*\";569 and (ii) Prof. Spiller also admitted that he did not do any statistical test of variance or variability to support his initial assertion that AMMTEC's tests showed \"*internal variability*.\"570\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 992-993.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 61, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1251.\n\n512.\n\nClaimant also rejects Prof. Dagdelen's assertion that it did not collect sufficient samples from below 250 meters and refers to examples of what it considers misleading testimony: (i) Prof. Dagdelen referred to a particular cross-section while omitting that in the immediately adjacent cross-sections TCC drilled to the lower depths; and (ii) Prof. Dagdelen had to admit that a sample of the very cross-section (RD-118) he referred to was taken from below 350 meters and shipped to AMMTEC for metallurgical testing.571 Claimant also refers to Mr. Rossi who confirmed that \"*drill holes were carried down at full density to the bottom of the ultimate pit*.\"572\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 65, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 99.\n\n513.\n\nClaimant further argues that even if it had focused on the \"*top half*\" of the mine as Respondent phrased it, this would have been \"*perfectly acceptable and consistent with industry practice*\" given that this \"*top half*\" of the cone shaped pit in fact corresponds to 85% of the rock that Claimant was planning to mine and mining at below 450 meters would only have started for H-14 and H-15 at the earliest in year 13 - with mining at Tanjeel and H-13 not going below 450 meters at all.573 According to Claimant, investors typically do not require metallurgical sampling of ore that will be mined that long after the payback period which would have been 7 to 8 years in the present case.574 Claimant submits that metallurgical test work is an interative process and would have continued in the mining stage so that, as Mr. Livesey testified, \"*it did not make sense for us to be concerned at this early stage with material below 450 meters that was only going to be mined two and a half decades later*.\"575 Claimant considers the soundness of prioritizing the earlier years of production, in particular those of the payback period, in a metallurgical program confirmed by Prof. Spiller's admission regarding his work as QP on other projects that \"*you prioritize in your intensity of focus the stuff that is going to be mined during the payback period*.\"576\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 451-452; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 66, *referring to* Rossi, \u00b6\u00b6 115-116 and Livesey IX, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 453, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6 98.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 455; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 67, *quoting from* Livesey IX, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 68, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1245. See also Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 453-454.\n\n514.\n\nClaimant further maintains that it also performed tests on material below the cut-off grade. In any event, Claimant considers it acknowledged by Prof. Dagdelen that the bottom of the pits in fact contains relatively higher grade ore and a focus on shallower parts of the deposits would therefore, if anything, have underestimated head grades.577\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69.\n\n515.\n\nFinally, Claimant rejects the assertion that it failed to establish the required recoveries for an expansion to Tanjeel and emphasizes that phase 4 of its metallurgical program on which the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study reports, was focused on optimizing the flotation process for ore from Tanjeel which was to be blended with the ore from H-14 and H-15.578 Claimant further submits that it sent approximately 7,000kg of H-13 samples to laboratories from June to August 2009.579\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 70.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 468.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nRespondent submits that for metallurgical testing, a mining company has to drill holes \"*at a depth and frequency to sample the entirety of the proposed mine*\" because the metallurgical samples must \"*fully represent the ore body*.\" In addition, Respondent refers to the method and analysis of the testing done on the samples from the metallurgical drilling holes which are important for determining the cost of production and identifying the type of processing required for extracting the copper or gold.580\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 199-204.\n\n517.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant has not \"*completely sampled and tested the deposits from a metallurgical perspective*,\" as the deposit is variable and not sufficiently consistent to rely on the \"*limited sampling and testing*\" conducted by Claimant.581 According to Respondent, Claimant did not sufficiently test the deposit at depths below 450 meters and in its last set of tests, *i.e*., the only tests to generate higher, more consistent results, it even focused on material largely coming from the top 250 meters of the ore body and material with \"*the best grades*\" in the ore body.582 Specifically with regard to samples from lower depths to which Claimant pointed Prof. Dagdelen during the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent claims that Claimant had not tested these samples, even though it had failed to establish that the domains were sufficiently consistent.583\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 81.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 172-173.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 82, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 1011-1012.\n\n518.\n\nRespondent claims that Claimant took only 20 metallurgical samples, all from above 400 meters, for the pilot plant test of its Feasibility Study and refers to Prof. Dagdelen who concluded that \"*without any pilot plant work involving material that will be mined below the 400 meter depth when a significant amount of material is mined in the feasibility study mine plans from 400 meters to 780 meters depths, this feasibility study is metallurgically very uncertain and unreliable*.\"584\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 208, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 139.\n\n519.\n\nRespondent also asserts that Claimant sent only 3 out of 9 rock types it had identified for testing to AMMTEC and argues that even those results showed that recoveries \"*dropped dramatically*\" when using water from Panangaz, a water source south of Reko Diq, and \"*were uneven and experienced a range of results*\" when using water from the Fan Sediments. According to Respondent, these were \"*crucial errors*\" showing that Claimant had not done the work to find out how the rock would respond in its contemplated scenario.585\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 209.\n\n520.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that Claimant \"*compromised the vast majority of the samples, rendering them (and their results) useless*\" because it wrongly categorized the lithology of the samples and sent them under the wrong label for testing. Respondent refers to Prof. Dagdelen who stated that Claimant incorrectly blended the materials to characterize the ore type, like flour and sugar instead of flour and salt. According to Respondent, this affected almost 60% of the samples from the scoping study and pre-feasibility study.586\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 206-207, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 121.\n\n521.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant and Mr. Rossi base their conclusion regarding the alleged consistency of the entire ore body on 16 metallurgical tests (excluding 5 ore-type tests done around the same time). According to Respondent, however, Claimant's metallurgy expert Dr. Anderson rejected this conclusion and testified that he would need to see more.587\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 83-86, referring to Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1165 lines 1-8.\n\n522.\n\nRespondent claims that Reko Diq was a project with \"*skinny*\" economics which allowed only for a small margin of error. In Respondent's view, Claimant's testing program did not come to understand this margin of error because it used composites blended from rock of different depths which could not reveal potential variability.588\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.\n\n523.\n\nRespondent further contends that the mine plan used in the Feasibility Study including the flotation process that Claimant planned to apply was based on only 21 tests, 60% of which come from the upper 250 meters of depth, and did not include the pilot plant tests or mineralogy tests. In addition, Respondent argues that even if the 14 mineralogy tests are added to the 21 tests, a total of 35 samples, none of which was at cut-off grade, is \"*plainly insufficient*\" and it is an \"*absurd proposition*\" that these tests would accurately reflect the entire deposit.589 In any event, Respondent claims that even these tests showed that material from deeper depths provided lower recoveries.590\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 90-91; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 170.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 167, 174.\n\n524.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to Prof. Spiller's explanation that the composites used in the pilot plant tests do \"*not represent what the plant will see in any given day and may encompass years of production*\" and considers it confirmed by Dr. Anderson's testimony that a composite spanning over ten years of production could produce results of a significant variance.591 Respondent criticizes that Claimant did not do \"*point tests*\" testing a specific, limited portion of a given domain and that it changed the process within the last set of tests conducted, with the results varying with each of the changes.592\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 92, *referring to* Spiller III, p. 3 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 1144-1146.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1203 lines 14-18 *and referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-6**, pp. 6-52, 6-58 and 6-63.\n\n525.\n\nRespondent concludes that Claimant's metallurgical testing program was insufficient to prove consistency and considers that \"*the reasonable position is to assume metallurgical varability*,\" as a buyer would have done in light of the lack of testing for the deposits.593\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 95.\n\n526.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reference to the total number of tests it conducted, Respondent notes that failed tests or tests using different metallurgical processes cannot serve to prove Claimant's mine plan and argues that \"*the issue is not a magic number of tests but rather the total number of tests in relation to the size of the deposit and its variability so that the mining company can arrive at a reasonable conclusion*.\" Referring to Prof. Spiller, Respondent claims that Claimant would have been required to conduct at least 435 tests using the metallurgical process it anticipated to test \"*the widest range of deposit characteristics*\" in the entire ore body, including point test and tests on different composites. By contrast, Respondent maintains that Claimant conducted \"*a total of 35 tests, out of which a sizable percentage failed to reach the accepted range of recoverabilities and none of which tested material at cut-off grade*.\"594\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97, *referring to* Spiller II, pp. 2, 3, 6 and Table 1; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 175.\n\n527.\n\nRespondent further considers that its independent analysis has \"*conclusively shown*\" that Reko Diq has variable recoverabilities and that the 21 tests performed by Claimant are not reliable, as demonstrated by the samples that Prof. Dagdelen took from his site visit to Reko Diq. Respondent contends that the results of the tests conducted by RDi laboratory on samples from the same composites as Claimant had tested, which are shown in Tables 3 and 4 in Prof. Spiller's second report, show variability between the samples when the same process is applied to all of them. According to Respondent, any buyer would have proceeded in the same manner as Pakistan did, *i.e*., by sampling and testing certain material to verify the consistency within a given set of samples, and it would have discovered as Respondent did that it could not duplicate Claimant's results because, instead, these tests show variability.595\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100, *referring to* Spiller II, Tables 3 and 4 and p. 10. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 166, *referring to* Spiller I, Section VI.\n\n528.\n\nRespondent refers to the conclusion drawn by Prof. Spiller:\n\n\"*Based on the comparative sampling and testwork, it is apparent that the various ore samples, both ore type and variability type samples, produce inconsistent results when following the same procedures. The inconsistencies are independent of feed sample lithology/alteration and grade. The flotation response variability, both internally to the RDi results and the AMMTEC results, cast doubt on the feasibility study and the ability to achieve consistently high value-recovery at marketable concentrate grades*.\"596\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 176, *quoting from* Spiller I, Section VI.\n\n529.\n\nIn response to the argument that the samples in the core shed used for Pakistan's testing have oxidized in the meantime, Respondent \"*maintains that the core was competent for the purposes of its testing.*\" However, Respondent claims that if the Tribunal were to follow Claimant's argument that it is not, it should find that Claimant did not adequately preserve the core and destroyed any value in that core for a future buyer, resulting in additional costs and uncertainty and another reason to reject any DCF valuation.597\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 101.\n\n530.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Claimant also claims damages deriving from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study even though, according to Respondent, Claimant's testing program shows that \"*any attempt to mix ore from Tanjeel with ore from H14 and H15 produced very poor results*,\" with the one test conducted showing recoverabilities at 60%. Respondent further submits that no tests were conducted with H-13 ore. Noting that none of Claimant's experts referred to the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Respondent concludes that \"[t]*here is no technical basis to arrive at any conclusion regarding the processing necessary for the EXP PFS, meaning the costs have no foundation, the mine plan is baseless, the pit limits are a guess, and every other element associated with the processing of EXP PFS is no more than speculation*.\"598\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n531.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerns two issues: (i) whether Claimant collected adequate and sufficient metallurgical samples which are representative of the different types of rock contained in the ore body at Reko Diq; and (ii) whether the metallurgical testing conducted by the laboratory assigned by Claimant, AMMTEC, was adequate and showed the consistent high recoveries reported in the Feasibility Study.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal will address these two issues in turn.\n\n**i. Whether the Metallurgical Samples Were Representative of the Ore Body**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will analyze Respondent's allegation that the metallurgical samples collected by Claimant do not adequately represent the entire ore body. In this regard, Respondent argues in particular that the number of metallurgical samples was too low and that the samples were largely taken from depths above 450 meters and, for the final set of tests, even from depths above 250 meters.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties and their experts that the metallurgical samples should be representative of the geo-metallurgical domains found at Reko Diq. As defined in the Glossary of Terms used in the CIM Best Practice Guidelines for Mineral Processing, domains are \"*commonly known as geometallurgical units or end members defined as mineral assemblages that have a common mineralogical feature that is expected to have a specific metallurgical response*.\"599 Mr. Rossi provided the following description of geo-metallurgical domains:\n\n\"*A geo-metallurgical domain is essentially a group of rocks that have statistically similar metallurgical properties in that they are of the same rock type, have similar alteration styles and the like. Since the rocks within a domain are alike, they will exhibit similar metallurgical characteristics and respond in the same way to the recipes used to extract the metals from the rock \u2013 regardless of where in the ore body they are located*.\"600\n\n**Exhibit CE-1685**, p. 3.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 30.\n\n535.\n\nRespondent and its expert Prof. Dagdelen do not appear to challenge the validity of identifying domains or the identification of a total of 12 domains in Reko Diq. However, their argument is that Claimant has not conducted sufficient tests to verify the consistency of the domains it has identified at Reko Diq. In particular, Prof. Dagdelen takes the view that there are not sufficient metallurgical samples coming from depths below 450 meters that would allow Claimant to assume that the rock at those depths would provide the same metallurgical response as the rock closer to the surface. Prof. Dagdelen stated in his first report:\n\n\"*After reviewing the shipments of all the metallurgical test samples from the Reko Diq Project between May 2007 and December 2009, it was found that almost all of the metallurgical samples tested for the comminution work as well as for the flotation process at H14 and H15 come from the upper 450 meters of pit depth. As a result, these samples are not sufficient and representative of ore types to be mined and processed from these deposits because these pits extend to the depths of 780 meters and 765 meters during the life of the mine.*\"601\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 172.\n\n536.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen referenced in this context an interim report prepared by AMMTEC in March 2009 rather than AMMTEC's final report.602 These reports will be addressed in further detail below.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.14**, pp. 13-14. The final report was not submitted by either Party into the record. **Exhibit RE-576-28.29** was \"*Intentionally Left Blank*\" according to the Cumulative Index of Respondent's Documents Filed in the Proceedings.\n\n537.\n\nIn response to Prof. Dagdelen's opinion, Mr. Rossi explained in his report that \"*metallurgical sampling is not independent of all other geological data and drilling. Rather, it relies on exploration and resource definition drilling to build the geo-metallurgical domains, which are based on a geologic model and an understanding of the impact of certain geologic vaiables on the overall beneficiation process*.\"603 He further stated:\n\n\"*Once you understand the relevant geological properties and build the geo-metallurgical domains, the metallurgical sampling can then target those domains, irrespective of the depth from which the material comes. This is standard practice in the industry and is also justified by economic considerations. Metallurgical test work, especially if done at a pilot plant scale, requires large volumes of samples that are often drilled using larger and more expensive drilling equipment*.\n\n*Where material closer to the surface fairly represents the relevant domain, you do not need to collect further samples from deeper within the deposit, as you know the metallurgical response of those samples will be similar. You only need to do further sampling at certain depths if the geology shows that material found at specific depths represents a different domain and, further, that domain is expected to be subjected to mineral processes in the future*.\"604\n\nRossi, \u00b6 95.\n\nRossi, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n\n538.\n\nMr. Rossi explained that such a different domain, which exists only at a certain depth, was in fact found at Reko Diq, referred to as lithology VFL. Claimant illustrated the domains at Reko Diq, including lithology VFL in blue at the bottom of the pit, as follows:605\n\nClaimant's Closing Presentation, p. 25.\n\n539.\n\nProf. Dagdelen described in his first report that samples from the VFL lithology had been taken from depths between 400 and 700 meters:\n\n*\"As part of Shipment 4, TCCA also shipped 15 samples of finely laminated volcanic rock samples with SCC type alteration (VFL - SCC ore type samples) in blue drums. Since the very finely laminated volcanic rocks is located close to the sandstone layers towards the bottom of the volcanic layers, 8 of these holes representing this ore type at the intervals between 400m and 600m depths while one hole went down to 700m depth.*\"606\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 123, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-28.14**, pp. 5-6.\n\n540.\n\nIn his second report, Prof. Dagdelen referred to the metallurgical domains identified in the Wester Porphyries at H-14 and H-15 which are based on: (i) the three lithologies VFL, VIN (depicted in green above) and PFB (depicted in orange above); and (ii) alteration types, as illustrated by Claimant through the following matrix:607\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opening Presentation, p. 44.\n\n541.\n\nProf. Dagdelen described the depths from which the metallurgical samples for each domain had been taken with the following chart:\n\n542.\n\nProf. Dagdelen's chart confirms that the samples for domains including the VFL lithology were taken from depths ranging between 250 and 600 meters. On that basis, the Tribunal considers it undisputed the metallurgical samples were taken from depths below 450 meters for the domains including the VFL lithology.\n\n543.\n\nAs illustrated by Claimant, the VIN domains exist only on top of the VFL domains and were therefore taken from depths ranging between 0 and 300 meters. There appears to be no dispute regarding the depth from which samples for the VIN domains were or should have been taken.\n\n544.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the remaining question is therefore whether it was reasonable for Claimant to conclude based on the available data that the vertical PFB domains, *i.e*., the porphyries, ranging from the surface to the bottom of the ore body were sufficiently consistent to allow for metallurgical samples to be taken from shallower depths.\n\n545.\n\nProf. Dagdelen referred to the PFB domains in his second report when stating that \"*significant ore type domains characterized by the porphyry lithologies, alterations, and*\n\n*mineralization zones were only represented by one or two metallurgical samples coming from mostly near surface samples. As such, the metallurgical floatation test results that are based on samples coming from near surface are insufficient and not representative of many of the ore types that extend from surface to 800m below surface containing more than 100 millions of tonnes of material in these ore types*.\"608\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 40.\n\n546.\n\nProf. Dagdelen considered it contradictory for Mr. Rossi to argue on the one hand that it was irrelevant whether the rock within the porphyries was coming from 200 meters or 600 meters below the surface but to state on the other hand that the samples for metallurgical testing are composites comprised of rock from many different holes so as to reasonably represent the domain even if the specific metallurgical samples are not taken from deeper portions of the mine.609 Prof. Dagdelen therefore maintained his conclusion: \"*Since there are not many metallurgical tests done on samples representing the many ore types coming from ore type domains below the 450m from the surface, no one can predict the metal recoveries of the flotation process in these rocks reliably, except by speculating that their performance will be the same as the rocks in the domains that are located near surface to above the 450m depth. In other words, the composites created lacked the samples from the lower part of the mine, meaning that the composite is no better than its inputs.*\"610\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, *quoting from* Rossi, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 43.\n\n547.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Prof. Dagdelen to the extent that it would not appear plausible to test the metallurgical consistency of a domain by using samples from only the upper part of the mine, *i.e*., in order to verify whether the upper and lower parts of the mine even constitute a common domain as defined by the CIM Guidelines or to test for any remaining variability within the domain. However, the Tribunal does not believe that this is the case here. As explained by Mr. Rossi, the domains were identified before the samples were taken for the specific purpose of metallurgical testing. The Tribunal finds his explanation plausible that, as metallurgical testing requires large volumes of material, the domains and thus the types of material that will have to be tested are narrowed down and identified beforehand. The Tribunal also considers it plausible that once domains have been identified and it has also been verified that no more than a reasonable variance exists within these domains, the large volume of samples required for metallurgical testing can then be taken from shallower depths.\n\n548.\n\nMr. Rossi has shown that Claimant's previous drilling campaigns extended to 900 meters below the surface with an average distance of 70 meters (except for depths below 800 meters where the average density extended to 100 meters):611\n\nRossi, Figure 5.\n\n549.\n\nMr. Rossi explained that an average distance of 70 meters commonly appears in other copper porphyry deposits to classify resources as *\"indicated\".* In his opinion, the density of the data obtained through these drilling campaigns is *\"very high\"* compared to other deposits, in particular because the same level of data density extended to the entire life of the mine.612 Mr. Rossi explained:\n\n*\"While the drilling density shown in Figure 5 is used mostly for resource estimation, it is also relevant to metallurgical test work in two ways:*\n\n*(a) The geologic model, the geological domains, and the geometallurgical domains are all supported by that data. To be clear, the geo-metallurgical domains are NOT defined from metallurgical holes, but from the resource definition holes shown in Figure 5.*\n\n*(b) The composites used for at least some of the metallurgical testing can also contain material partially taken from those SAME exploration drill holes. This will happen mostly in the initial phases of testing, which are performed at bench scale, with specific intervals chosen from different drill holes to reflect the geo-metallurgical domains. Later in the life of the project, as knowledge of the domains gets refined, specific metallurgical holes are drilled, usually at a much larger diameter (*'PQ,\u2019 *or approximately 85mm in diameter) than that of the resource drill holes (*'HQ,\u2019 *or 61mm in diameter). The large-diameter (PQ) holes are a convenient method to extract from the relevant domains the significant tonnages required for pilot plant testing (typically, a final metallurgical testing step prior to detailed plant design in a Feasibility Study). This sequence was basically what happened at Reko Diq*.\"613\n\nRossi, \u00b6 101.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 102.\n\n550.\n\nNeither Respondent nor its experts specifically challenge Mr. Rossi's explanation that the definition of geo-metallurgical domains was made before the specific metallurgical holes were drilled and is thereby based on data obtained from previous drilling campaigns which extended to the full depth of the ore body. In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore not convincing to look only at the depths from which the metallurgical samples were taken when analyzing whether Claimant has adequately classified the domains and/or whether it has verified that the rocks classified into a certain domain do not exceed a reasonable variance in terms of their metallurgic response.\n\n551.\n\nThis does not yet answer the question, however, whether Claimant has, based on the data it had collected through its previous drilling campaigns, adequately classified and verified the domains at Reko Diq or whether there is any indication of variability as alleged by Respondent and its experts.\n\n552.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Dagdelen did \"*not necessarily*\" agree with the proposition that materials coming from a certain domain, once appropriately defined, will respond the same way metallurgically but maintained that \"[t]*hey have a lot of variability down a given domain*.\" In response to the question whether he had tested the variability within domains on the samples he had obtained during his site visit to Reko Diq, he testified that it \"*wasn't* [his] *job or* [his] *expertise area to test the variability of the material performance recoveries within these domains*\" and confirmed that he had not done any tests to this effect.614\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 992 line 2 to p. 993 line 6.\n\n553.\n\nProf. Spiller, who reviewed the samples used for testing to establish the design criteria used in the Feasibility Study, also referred to a \"*variability*\" of the test results produced by AMMTEC. In his second report, he concluded that these tests showed \"*significant lower copper recovery on domain samples taken from below 250 meters in the deposit*\" and that the design criteria are therefore unreliable.615 Prof. Spiller based this conclusion on recoveries measured by AMMTEC for the samples listed in the two tables from Prof. Dagdelen's second report, which he illustrated as follows:\n\nSpiller II, Section VII lit. C.\n\n554.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller confirmed his opinion that these tables *\"tend to indicate* [lower recoveries with depth].\"616 At the same time, however, he also confirmed that he had not done any tests to show that within a certain domain there was any difference in metallurgical recovery and acknowledged that what he had shown in the tables above was that recoveries varied between the different domains rather than within a given domain.617 He maintained that *\"those samples did come from deeper, and they were more difficult to process*\" but confirmed that variability within any one domain had \"*not been tested because no one has looked at recoveries within a domain with depth... because there was no test done.\"* It became clear during Prof. Spiller's oral testimony that he had not found any information in the available data that would positively confirm or indicate variability of recoveries within a given domain. Prof. Spiller was rather complaining that there was no data to show that no such variability existed:\n\n\"*Q. Is there anything in the data? Can you point us to anything in the data that would give you reason to think that somehow the domaining was so wrong that you can't actually trust it?*\n\n*A. I have nothing in the data. It is just not there. There is just no metallurgical test in the deeper parts of the orebody in each domain*.\"618\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1248 lines 11-13.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1251 lines 1-15.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1253 lines 8-14.\n\n555.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls Mr. Rossi's explanation that the definition of domains took place before the metallurgical sampling and testing and is based on data obtained from previous drilling campaigns. Neither Prof. Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller have analyzed previous drilling data but maintained that the relevant samples were only those taken from the metallurgical drill holes. At least as far as the process of defining geo-metallurgical domains is concerned, the Tribunal is not convinced by this opinion. It appears to contradict economic and common sense to assume that data from previous drilling could not be used to identify domains and verify whether these were reasonably consistent before starting to extract the large volumes required for metallurgical testing for each of the identified types of material.\n\n556.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument that Claimant used only samples from shallower depths for the purposes of identifying and verifying the consistency of the ore body. Regardless of the precise number of samples collected for metallurgical testing, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it is inaccurate to look at these samples in isolation, without taking into account the large amount of data collected through previous drilling and the corresponding knowledge about the ore body and its domains that Claimant already had when starting its metallurgical sampling and testing.\n\n557.\n\nIn the absence of any specific challenge on the classification of domains based on data from previous drilling and given that Prof. Spiller did not find any indication of variability in the data he had reviewed, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that the classification of domains was not made in accordance with industry standards. Consequently, the Tribunal also does not agree with Respondent that the collection of metallurgical samples for the PFB domains from depths above 450 meters rendered them inadequate and not sufficiently representative of the ore body.\n\n558.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal takes note of Mr. Rossi's opinion that the drilling conducted by Claimant at Reko Diq exceeded industry standards because it covered the entire body rather than \"*only a significant or financially relevant portion of the deposit* [which] *is usually covered.*\" He explained that \"[c]*ommon indicators that determine the depth to which sampling is usually done include: (a) the initial five to 10 years' operation; (b) the project's payback period; or (c) the project's payback period plus a discrete number of production years.\"619* He further pointed out that the envisaged payback period in the Feasibility Study was 7.1 years.620\n\nRossi, \u00b6 98.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 116, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-1**, Table 1.2.\n\n559.\n\nRespondent and Prof. Dagdelen repeatedly criticized the sampling as inadequate, asserting that most of the metallurgical samples had been taken from depths above 450 meters. In response, Mr. Rossi pointed out in his report that, while the deposits at H-14 and H-15 extended to approximately 800 meters in depth, about 70-75% of the rock to be mined at those two deposits would come from depths above the 450-meter line. For Tanjeel and H-13, which would become relevant in the expansion scenario, all mining was to occur above that depth. If taken together, 85% of the rock to be mined at those four deposits would come from depths above the 450-meter line.621 Both Mr. Rossi and Mr. Livesey explained that it would have taken at least 13 years of operations (under the expansion scenario) before drilling would have first \"*hit*\" the depth of 450 meters.622 Mr. Livesey further explained that \"*even then, the material from or above 450 meters would still be the bulk of our operation\u2014 in year 13, in fact, it was still 100% of the operation (as the deepest bench being mined in year 13 was at, and not below, 450 meters below the surface).\"* Based on the mine plan data from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Mr. Livesey illustrated \"*the proportion of the overall tonnages that would come from above 450 meters until year 25 of our operations\"* as follows:623\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Year of Mining Operation** | **Tonnes From** **Above** **450 meters (as a % of total tonnage)** |\n| 1 through 13 | 100% |\n| 14 | 97% |\n| 15 | 100% |\n| 16 | 90% |\n| 17 | 82% |\n| 18 | 64% |\n| 19 | 84% |\n| 20 | 90% |\n| 21 | 54% |\n| 22 | 75% |\n| 23 | 85% |\n| 24 | 83% |\n| 25 | 10% |\n\nRossi, \u00b6 115. *See also* Livesey IX, \u00b6 7 *and* **Exhibit CE-1498**.\n\nRossi, \u00b6 116; Livesey IX, \u00b6 8.\n\nLivesey IX, \u00b6 8.\n\n560.\n\nNeither the timing of mining operations illustrated by Mr. Livesey nor Mr. Rossi's statement that initial sampling usually covers \"*only a significant or financially relevant portion of the deposit*\" have been specifically challenged by Respondent or its expert. Respondent maintains that Claimant had to sample the entire ore body in order to be certain that the ore would provide the recoveries it needed to economically extract the minerals from the rock. The Tribunal takes note, however, of Mr. Livesey's explanation, which was confirmed by Mr. Rossi, that throughout the initial years of mining operations, Claimant would have continued to learn about the resource and would have been able to make adjustments to the metallurgical process if needed. Mr. Livesey described \"[t]*he ongoing review and adjustment of mining and processing techniques* [as] *a normal part of the mining business*\" and also \"*good financial practice*\" given that revenues from the project can be used to fund additional drilling and testing.624 Mr. Livesey testified that apart from the fact that they \"*knew that the material below 450 meters was also going to respond similarly to the physical and chemical processes of comminution and metallurgical recovery*,\" even if that had not been the case, \"*it did not make sense for* [them] *to be concerned at this early stage with material below 450 meters that was only going to be mined two and a half decades later.*\"625\n\nLivesey IX, \u00b6 12.\n\nLivesey IX, \u00b6 10.\n\n561.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller agreed that at the stage of metallurgical testing, the payback period and first several years of mine operation \"*are the most important*.\"626 He then testified:\n\n\"*Q. So, do you know how long it would take to penetrate down to even touch the area below 450 meters?*\n\n*A. I'm guessing it's 12 years or something like that.*\n\n*Q. Okay. So it would be reasonable, at least, to concentrate your metallurgical testwork on the part that you're going to reach in the first 10 years, let's say; right?*\n\n*A. Not if you're creating a value, a sale price. You need to be able to figure out what the value of that orebody is and how much of that copper and gold is going to be recovered through the whole entire deposit.*\n\n*Q. Yeah. But you don't need as much testing. I mean, otherwise, what would be the point of this rule, this general principle that you should prioritize the early years of the deposit in your metallurgical testing? It's got to be that it means that you focus on that, and that you don't need to do the same level of metallurgical testing on the stuff that you're not going to reach for more than a decade; right?*\n\n*A. That's not the principle that I follow. I think you need to sample the whole entire orebody*.\"627\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1240 lines 4-9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1240 line 10 to p. 1241 line 12.\n\n562.\n\nIn the context of a subsequent discussion on Prof. Spiller's involvement in a different project as \"*Qualified Person*,\" *i.e*., \"*Principal Metallurgist*,\" responsible, *inter alia*, for the section on \"*Mineral Prcessing and Metallurgical Testing,*\" of the NI 43-101 Technical Report Updated Feasibility Study,628 Prof. Spiller was pointed to a sentence on \"*Sample Selection*\" which stated, *inter alia*, that \"[p]*articular focus was made on material likely to be mined in the first five years*.\"629 In that context, Prof. Spiller testified:\n\n\"*Q. \u2026 And so I think you probably do--\u2026, that principle up before, that one of the things you do when you do metallurgical work is you prioritize in your intensity of focus the stuff that is going to be mined during the payback period, during the early years; right?*\n\n*A. Yes, I agree with that.*\n\n*Q. And you do follow that principle in practice; right?*\n\n*A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. Okay. Now, and that makes perfectly good economic sense because, of course, once you're operating a mine and once you're there and you're digging, you will just continue to keep--I mean, it's an iterative process all the way through, and you'll continue to keep understanding and exploring the Resource; right?*\n\n*A. Yes. You always are exploring, yeah*.\"630\n\n**Exhibit CE-1678**, p. 309.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1678**, p. 66.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1244 line 21 to p. 1245 line 17.\n\n563.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Prof. Spiller's oral testimony confirmed that even if Claimant had limited metallurgical sampling to a depth of 450 meters, without having verified whether the rock below 450 meters would provide a reasonably consistent metallurgical response as Respondent and its experts allege, this would not have been unusual or below industry standards because 450 meters would have fully covered at least 13 years of mining operations during which additional drilling and testing could have occurred. The Tribunal is aware that Prof. Spiller's agreement with this approach concerned a different project and that he appeared to take a different opinion with regard to the Reko Diq project because this was about \"*creating a value, a sale price*.\" The Tribunal is not convinced, however, by this distinction. When Claimant was preparing the Feasibility Study, it was not contemplating to sell its investment to a third party but intended to build and operate the mine itself. Neither Respondent nor its experts have argued that an approach which is in accordance with industry standards when planning to build and operate a mine based on a feasibility study would not be sufficient for the purposes of selling the same mine to a third party.\n\n564.\n\nConsequently, and in addition to its conclusion reached above that the collection of metallurgical samples for the PFB domains from depths above 450 meters did not render them inadequate or not sufficiently representative of the ore body, the Tribunal further concludes that even if the results of the metallurgical testwork had been representative of only the portion of material above 450 meters, this would have been in accordance with industry standards and sufficient for a willing buyer in November 2011.\n\n565.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is also not convinced that the number of metallurgical samples collected by Claimant was below industry standards. Prof. Spiller stated in his second expert report that \"*an expected minimum number of sample/tests would be in the range of 435, based on 1 sample for each 5 million tonnes or ore*\" and therefore \"*far more than the 21 tests used in the feasibility*.\"631 While it appears to be undisputed that Claimant conducted more than one test on each of the metallurgical samples, the Tribunal understands Prof. Spiller's opinion to be that at least 435 samples should have been collected in order for the samples to be representative of the ore body. In support of his opinion, Prof. Spiller referred to the Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice, and Control issued by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME) in 2002, which states that \"*the number of samples should bear some correlation to the size, value and variability of the deposit. Medium to large deposits typically have a sample of each 1-5 million tonnes of ore*.\"632\n\nSpiller II, p. 6.\n\nSpiller II, p. 2, *quoting from* **Exhibit ES-1.**\n\n566.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller was pointed to a section on \"*Practical requirements*\" in the document issued by SME, which notes that \"*the best sample(s) for testwork are composite samples*\" and that \"*it is generally recommended that the team create four to six composites.*\"633 In response to the proposition that this indicated that when the source relied on by Prof. Spiller referred to samples, it was talking more about the point samples rather than the number of composites, Prof. Spiller testified that \"[t]*hat's a fair reading of this document. I don't agree with that*.\"634 Prof. Spiller agreed that the 21 metallurgical samples he was referring to were composite samples. He then testified:\n\n\"*Q. Okay. Now, in fact, if you look at samples in the way I've described it, if it's point samples, you would agree with me that TCC and AMMTEC, in the 87,000 kilograms of material, had a lot more than 435 samples that they analyzed; right?*\n\n*A. They did. They took a lot of samples. I mean, they put the material together*.\"635\n\n**Exhibit ES-1**, p. 148.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1215 lines 13-22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1216 lines 10-16.\n\n567.\n\nMr. Rossi explained in his report that for the first two phases of metallurgical testwork, approximately 32 tonnes of material were shipped to AMMTE; for phase 3 (Feasibility Study) and phase 4 (Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study), approximately 56 tonnes of material were shipped to AMMTEC.636 While Respondent initially alleged that \"*the vast majority of the samples*\" was \"*compromised*\" due to a wrong categorization of lithologies,637 it did not dispute Claimant's explanation that the re-logging concerned only phase 1 testwork for the scoping study and did not affect any subsequent test work in phases 2 through 4. Therefore, the Tribunal considers this point moot.\n\nRossi, \u00b6\u00b6 142, 144.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 206.\n\n568.\n\nBased on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal is not convinced that the number of composite samples used for metallurgical testing was too low. Prof. Spiller acknowledged that, on a \"*fair reading*\" of the SME recommendation, the number of at least 435 samples he calculated referred to point samples rather than the composite samples which in turn are composed of several point samples. The Tribunal also notes that the Feasibility Study summarized the process to achieve representative composite samples as follows:\n\n\"*In summary, the samples chosen for the FS metallurgical test work were based on relative proportions of lithology and alteration types in the mine plan V10 and within pit limits. The samples were also chosen to approximate grades over the life of mine for each lithology/alteration ore type, and maintain a broad distribution throughout the ore body.*\n\n*Based on both lithology and alteration, the ore types for deposits H14 and H15 form a sound basis for differentiating metallurgical ore types, and assessing the representivity of metallurgical samples and composites.*\n\n*Composite construction was based on selecting, wherever possible, multiple intervals of similar lithology/alteration ore types throughout the deposit, compositing to achieve Cu and Au grades roughly proximal to anticipated mine plan grades, as well as compositing pilot plant samples via mine plan based proportions of ore types.*\n\n*Samples collected for FS pilot plant test work were found to be reasonably representative. Composites were blended to reflect the proportions of each lithology and alteration type according to the V10 mine plan. HPGR samples collected represent the dominant ore types.*\n\n*Flotation Locked Cycle (LC) composites used to assign recovery and concentrate grades to the block model represent the full suite of main Western Porphyries ore types in both the H14 and H15 deposits*.\"638\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6**, p. 6-12.\n\n569.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is apparent that each composite sample consisted of a considerable number of point samples and, based on data obtained through Claimant's previous drilling campaigns, was compiled with the specific aim to be representative of actual mining operations at Reko Diq.\n\n570.\n\nProf. Dagdelen's only and Prof. Spiller's main criticism regarding the composition of the samples concerned the depths from which the material for the composite samples was taken. This aspect has been addressed in detail above.\n\n571.\n\nProf. Spiller further criticized that the samples did not include material at cut-off grade. Claimant pointed out, however, that Prof. Spiller did not rely on AMMTEC's final report dated December 2009 but rather on an interim report dated March 2009. According to Claimant, AMMTEC's final report shows that it in fact did perform tests at cut-off grade.639 To the Tribunal's knowledge, the final report is not in the record of this arbitration.640 During the Hearing on Quantum, Claimant's metallurgy expert Dr. Anderson confirmed, however, that \"[w]*ithin the testing campaign and in actuality in the final test used to define the design criteria, \u2026 there were tests done at exactly the cutoff grade*.\"641 He was not cross-examined on this point.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 69, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-28.29**, p. 5.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.29** was \"*Intentionally Left Blank*\" according to the Cumulative Index of Respondent's Documents Filed in the Proceedings.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1127 lines 17-20.\n\n572.\n\nProf. Spiller's criticism on cut-off grade was raised together with his opinion that material from deeper parts of the deposit showed lower recoveries than material from shallower depths.642 The Tribunal has already concluded above that Prof. Spiller's analysis underlying his conclusion that material from deeper parts of the deposit showed lower recoveries did not show variability of recoveries within a certain domain. In addition, the Tribunal is also not convinced that across the domains, material coming from the deeper part of the mine generally showed lower recoveries than material from shallower depths.\n\n*Cf*. Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1206; Prof. Spiller's Presentation, p. 22.\n\n573.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller was pointed to the results of DWT-14 and DWT-12 on the tables he had used, which did not show a correlation between lower recoveries and increasing depth. He responded that Claimant was \"*appreciating or lending too much credence to the details of this*\" but maintained that \"[w]*hat we're looking at is, in general, where those samples came from, and they came--they are shallow samples, and there's a couple that are deeper, and I think it's quite obvious that as you go deeper, you get lower recoveries*.\"643 Prof. Spiller further agreed that the highest gold recovery had occurred in the second deepest hole but pointed out that \"*gold analyses are quite irregular, and they are notoriously different, based on the ability to analyze the tailings accurately or the throwaway*\" and maintained that \"*again, what I'm saying is, just look at this table in general*.\"644\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1248 line 22 to p. 1249 line 22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1250 lines 4-21.\n\n574.\n\nIn addition to the fact that Prof. Spiller had to recognize during the Hearing that his conclusion did not prove to be valid on each of the composites, he further confirmed that he was aware that DWT-8, *i.e*., the composite comprising material from the deepest hole with the lowest recoveries in H-15 according to the table he had presented, was later retested and achieved an improved recovery once Claimant and AMMTEC had further tweaked the process. While he could not confirm the precise recovery of 93.5% that was put to him, he acknowledged that \"[i]*f that's exactly what happened, it would* [undermine his analysis in these charts].\"645\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1253 line 15 to p. 1254 line 14.\n\n575.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Spiller did not rely on the final report prepared by AMMTEC for his analysis but rather on an interim report dated March 2009. While the final report is not in the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller acknowledged and had apparently been aware prior to his oral testimony that certain recoveries improved following the interim report on which he had relied for his analysis. Also taking into account the fact that his analysis did not prove valid on certain drill holes even on the data from the interim report, the Tribunal considers that it cannot give much weight to his conclusion that recoveries were lower for material from deeper parts of the mine.\n\n576.\n\nRespondent and Prof. Spiller further criticized Claimant for not having done tests on point samples instead of or in addition to the tests of composite samples. However, the Tribunal recalls that the SME on which Prof. Spiller relied considers that \"*the best sample(s) for testwork are composite samples*.\" The SME further states that \"[e]*xcessive compositing (i.e. production of large, overall composites) can mask valuable metallurgical response information and can give misleading conclusions about the actual plant performance. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the team create four to six composites*.\"646 Given that, even on Respondent's case, Claimant conducted tests on a total of 21 composite samples, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that this approach was not in accordance with industry standards.\n\n**Exhibit ES-1**, p. 148.\n\n577.\n\nFinally, Respondent criticized Claimant for having relied on composites to test variability but, as has also been addressed above, the classification of domains and verification that they were reasonably consistent had been done before the metallurgical tests on the composite samples.\n\n578.\n\nIn the absence of any further specific challenge on the composite samples, the Tribunal is convinced that the metallurgical sampling conducted by Claimant was adequate and in line with industry standards.\n\n**ii. Whether the Metallurgical Testing Produced Variable Recoveries**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nRespondent further argues that the metallurgical testing carried out by AMMTEC in 2007-2009 produced variable recoveries and considers this confirmed by the results of tests performed by RDi laboratory on samples taken by Prof. Dagdelen during his site visit to Reko Diq. Respondent refers to its expert Prof. Spiller who reviewed both AMMTEC's and RDi's test results and concluded in his first report:\n\n\"*Based on the comparative sampling and testwork, it is apparent that the various ore samples, both ore type and variability type samples, produce inconsistent results when following the same procedures. The inconsistencies are independent of feed sample lithology/alteration and grade. The flotation response variability, both internally to the RDi results and the AMMTEC results, cast doubt on the feasibility study and the ability to achieve consistently high value-recovery at marketable concentrate grades*.\"647\n\nSpiller I, Section VI.\n\n580.\n\nIn his second report, Prof. Spiller maintained his conclusion.648\n\nSpiller II, Section VI.\n\n581.\n\nDr. Anderson disagreed with Prof. Spiller's conclusion:\n\n\"*In my opinion, the Reko Diq Feasibility Study is robust, and the underlying methodology and metallurgical testing are of excellent quality. TCC conducted many phases of metallurgical test work on many tonnes of Reko Diq material, originating from thousands of samples, which were representative of the orebody's relevant lithologies and alterations (or* 'domains' *). This included not only laboratory testing (open- and locked-cycle, as well as variability, tests), but also pilot-plant test work*.\"649\n\nAnderson, \u00b6 15.\n\n582.\n\nDr. Anderson pointed out that neither Prof. Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller had referred to AMMTEC's metallurgical test reports of July 2009 or September 2009 but had compared the RDi results only to Claimant's March 2009 tests.650 According to Dr. Anderson, however, \"[t]*hrough both the laboratory and pilot-plant tests, TCC validated the technologies it would use at Reko Diq, obtaining recoveries above 90% Cu and concentrate grades of approximately 30%*.\"651\n\nAnderson, \u00b6 16, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-675-28.15** *and* **RE-576-28.16**.\n\nAnderson, \u00b6 32.\n\n583.\n\nIn Dr. Anderson's opinion, RDi had, by contrast to AMMTEC, not been presented with representative quantities of samples and both the samples and the testing had \"*many shortcomings*,\" which rendered the results \"*not directly comparable*\" to AMMTEC's results.652\n\nAnderson, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 34-87, 88.\n\n584.\n\nIn any event, Dr. Anderson pointed to Prof. Spiller's statement that \"[o]*n average the AMMTEC results produced a slightly higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs 22.8) [i.e., slightly higher grades for RDi's tests].*\" In his opinion, where RDi's results are compared to comparable tests performed by AMMTEC, the results are in fact \"very similar\" and \"*tend to corroborate that TCC's proposed flotation method was robust and produced consistent recoveries across the various relevant metallurgical domains*.\"653\n\nAnderson, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 92-98, *quoting from* Spiller I, p. 14.\n\n585.\n\nIn response, Prof. Spiller stated that \"*the pilot plant results, often referred to by Dr. Anderson, were not used to establish copper and gold recovery data used as the basis of the feasibility study and economics of the project presented therein*.\" He explained that \"*pilot plants are conducted on composite samples representative of large swaths of the ore and are not representative of ore that the production plant is likely ever to be fed on a given day, over a week, or month, or often even a year*\" and that \"[t]*herefore, appropriately, the basis for feasibility design is based on locked-cycle tests conducted on individual alteration units, and should have included tests on un-composited variability samples characterized as representing extremes in grade and alteration*.\"654 On that basis, Prof. Spiller continued to discuss the results of AMMTEC's March 2009 interim report, which he considered to be the only relevant tests for determining the design criteria used in the Feasibility Study.\n\nSpiller III, pp. 2-3.\n\n586.\n\nWith respect to Dr. Anderson's report, he considered:\n\n\"*Many of the criticisms in the Expert Report of Dr. Anderson are directed at comparisons with the pilot plant testing and the representativeness of the RDi samples in relation to the entire set of testwork done at Reko Diq. It is important to return to the results in Spiller March 20, 2018. Those tests and the results showed variability, which formed the basis for my conclusions. In reviewing Dr. Anderson's report, there is little challenge to the variability of the results, which was the focus of the tests done for my first report. Because the criticisms do not go to variability, I do not see the need to respond in-depth to each of Dr. Anderson's criticisms*.\"655\n\nSpiller III, pp. 5-6.\n\n587.\n\nHe further maintained his conclusion that \"*after considering the arguments of Dr. Corby G. Anderson, the variability of flotation response demonstrated in the AMMTEC work and the RDi work does not support the Design Basis establishing a minimum performance of 91.3 percent copper recovery and 64.2 percent gold recovery throughout the life of mine as presented by the August 2010 TCC Reko Diq Feasibility Study*.\"656\n\nSpiller III, p. 6.\n\n588.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Anderson testified in direct testimony that the design criteria for the Feasibility Study were established based on \"*the whole body of work from 17 May 2007 up until December 2009, including the three pilot-plant runs, as well as further understanding and optimization of some of the earlier testwork that was done and reported in March*.\" Dr. Anderson explained that \"*in March, these results came out and AMMTEC and TCC decided that they need to work on a few areas*\" and specifically identified the result of composite DWT-8, which had a low recovery of 87.6 in March 2009 and, after the pilot work and locked-cycle test, reached a recovery of 93.5%.657\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1116 lines 14-20, p. 1119 line 11 to p. 1120 line 11.\n\n589.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller made it specifically clear in his third report that his conclusion that the AMMTEC results had shown variability was based exclusively on the test results of the 21 composite samples reported in the March 2009 interim report. He dismissed Dr. Anderson's reference to subsequent tests and in particular the pilot plant test results by arguing that these results were \"*not used to establish copper and gold recovery data used as the basis of the feasibility study and economics of the project presented therein*.\"658\n\nSpiller III, pp. 2-3.\n\n590.\n\nDr. Anderson disputed this statement by stating:\n\n\"[T]*his early work from March that's portrayed here led them to do more work that led into three pilot campaigns. So, you do a pilot plant to, one, confirm what you're doing, and then take it up to the next level so that you can see at an operational level rather than just a bench scale that the equipment you're going to choose and the parameters, your key process indicators, are correct.*\n\n*And so, the best thing you can have in a pilot plant is to try it out and find out a little bit is wrong or something is wrong because you can fix it before you get in the operation. So, you see through the pilot plant, progressively, they got better.*\n\n*If you look in the Feasibility Study, they compared their results from the pilot plant to the locked-cycle projections they had, and they correlated quite well*.\"659\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1121 lines 6-22.\n\n591.\n\nIn response to Prof. Spiller's statement that \"*pilot plants are conducted on composite samples representative of large swaths of the ore and are not representative of ore that the production plant is likely ever to be fed on a given day, over a week, or month, or often even a year,*\" Dr. Anderson testified:\n\n\"*I don't understand that exactly because you're just taking it up to the next step, and you're using materials from the same orebody, but you're using them on a larger scale in the proposed equipment and flow sheet that you plan on using. So, it's a good way to test out your design and then modify if there's issues.*\n\n*And in the mining process--having actually run a copper flotation circuit--you're always receiving wide swaths of ore that you have to deal with. So, you can learn in the pilot plant, if you run an open-cycle test--it's a batch process--you have a one-shot deal. Right? And if you run locked-cycle testing on the bench, you may go anywhere from six to ten cycles to see if you get it closed, but it's still on the bench. So, you haven't actually applied any engineering or operational input or output.*\n\n*So, when you run the pilot plant on material from the same deposit, over a period of time, you can see how you're operating, you're learning. And, also, it is quite common that people will blend ores in order to--in operations, blend them so that they can have a more consistent feed. You know, it allows you to learn and understand and make your design that much better*.\"660\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1123 line 1 to p. 1124 line 3.\n\n592.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties' experts disagree on which of AMMTEC's test results formed the basis of the process design criteria and the recovery data reported in the Feasibility Study. Prof. Spiller referred in his third report to the Executive Summary of the Feasibility Study, which reported:\n\n\"*Metallurgical results used as the basis of the FS are obtained from locked cycle tests using samples representing the various lithology/alteration rock types. Copper recovery is consistently high, ranging from 91.3% to 93.1%. Gold recovery varies from 64.2% to 73.1%, being higher in the early years. Concentrate grade is generally in the 28-31% range and gold grades are generally in the 10 to 15 g/t range until the last few years of run-of-mine ore production*.661\n\nSpiller III, p. 2, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-1**, p. 1-33.\n\n593.\n\nProf. Spiller concluded from this quote that the pilot plant results were not used to establish the copper and gold recovery data. He then presented the recovery data from the 21 composite samples reported in the March 2009 reports.662 Dr. Anderson pointed out in his direct testimony, however, that the recovery and ore grade data and thus the design criteria used in the Feasibility Study is contained in Tables 6.46 to 6.48 of Chapter 6 on Metallurgy and Process Development.663 He further confirmed that the data in these tables are different from the data presented by Prof. Spiller.664\n\nSpiller III, pp. 4-5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1116 lines 6-9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1118 line 18 to p. 1119 line 4.\n\n594.\n\nAs pointed out by Dr. Anderson, the copper recoveries presented by Prof. Spiller in his third report indeed do not match the recoveries reported in Table 6.46 of the Feasibility Study. Specifically, the copper recoveries in the test results presented by Prof. Spiller range between 87.6% (for DWT-8 discussed above) and 93.8%;665 Table 6.46 reports copper recoveries ranging between 90.1% and 95.8%.666 As for the gold recoveries, there is only a slight difference in the overall recovery range. However, individual test results also differ. For example, the recovery for the domain VIN-SCC at H-15 was at 54.8% in March 2009;667 in the Feasibility Study, it was reported to be at 70.2%.668 Similarly, the recovery for the domain VIN-MIX at H-14 was at 57.4% in March 2009;669 in the Feasibility Study, it was reported to be at 68.1%.670\n\nSpiller III, pp. 4-5.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6**, Table 6.46.\n\nSpiller III, p. 4. DWT Composite No. 15 corresponds to the domain VIN-SCC at H-15. *See, e.g.,* Spiller II, Table 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6**, Table 6.47.\n\nSpiller III, p. 4. DWT Composite No. 6 corresponds to the domain VIN-MIX at H-14. *See, e.g.,* Spiller II, Table 3.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6**, Table 6.47.\n\n595.\n\nAs for the range of recoveries included in the Executive Summary of the Feasibility Study on which Prof. Spiller based his conclusion that the design criteria in the Feasibility Study rely exclusively on the results of the March 2009 report, it appears to the Tribunal that the paragraph quoted by Prof. Spiller does not report the range of individual recoveries but rather an average of recoveries over time, given its note that \"[g]*old recovery varies from 64.2% to 73.1%, being higher in the early years.*\"671 In any event, these recovery ranges would also not match the recoveries of the March 2009 tests that Prof. Spiller presented as the alleged exclusive basis for the Feasibility Study's design criteria.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-1**, p. 1-33.\n\n596.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fact that the recoveries reported in Chapter 6 on Metallurgy and Process Development of the Feasibility Study are higher than those presented by Prof. Spiller not only confirms that the Feasibility Study was not based exclusively on the tests presented and analyzed by Prof. Spiller. It also corroborates Dr. Anderson's testimony that after these test results in March 2009, \"*AMMTEC and TCC decided that they need to work on a few areas*\" and improved, for example, the recovery of composite DWT-8 based on further tests conducted by AMMTEC until December 2009.\n\n597.\n\nAs Prof. Spiller specifically confirmed that his analysis of variability of the AMMTEC test results is based entirely on the results of AMMTEC's March 2009 interim report,672 the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot attach much weight to this analysis, which does not take into account subsequent testing conducted by AMMTEC until December 2009. In addition to the fact that the recoveries relied on by Prof. Spiller do not match those reported in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal also finds Dr. Anderson's testimony plausible that the design criteria were established based on the entire test work conducted by Claimant and AMMTEC on the metallurgical process rather than only the 21 tests pointed to by Prof. Spiller. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Prof. Spiller that tests preceding the optimization of the process in early 2009 may not be as decisive at this point because they did not form the basis for the reported recoveries, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that tests following the March 2009 report, which resulted in further improved recoveries until December 2009, would not be incorporated into the Feasibility Study.\n\nProf. Spiller stated in his third report that \"[i]*t is important to return to the results in Spiller March 20, 2018. Those tests and the results showed variability, which formed the basis for my conclusions* Spiller III, p. 5.\n\n598.\n\nIn addition and while Prof. Spiller maintained that pilot plant tests could not be used for the definition of design criteria, Dr. Anderson explained that after March 2009 AMMTEC conducted not only the pilot plant tests but also an additional 30 locked-cycle tests whose results were incorporated into the recoveries reported by AMMTEC in December 2009. He further explained that \"*they were vetting their pilot-plant results with locked-cycle testing*.\"673 As pointed out by Dr. Anderson, the results of this vetting were summarized in Table 6.31 of the Feasibility Study:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ore Types Tested | Final Concentrate |\n| Mass Pull % | Copper | Gold |\n| % | % Distribution | ppm | % Distribution |\n| Commissioning | Average locked cycle results | 1.7 | 29.5 | 93.8 | 11.9 | 76.0 |\n| Sample | Best pilot plant survey | **1.9** | 30.3 | **91.0** | **9.6** | 72.2 |\n| Pilot survey, average from optimum conditions | 1.7 | 30.5 | 90.6 | 8.2 | 68.1 |\n| FS2 composite | Average locked cycle results | 1.4 | 29.9 | 94.0 | 16.3 | 81.3 |\n| Best pilot plant survey | 1.7 | 28.7 | 93.4 | 8.1 | 71.1 |\n| Best pilot plant shift composite | 2.1 | 30.5 | 93.4 | 10.6 | 72.3 |\n| Pilot survey, average from optimum conditions | 1.7 | 28.9 | 92.8 | 8.9 | 72.5 |\n| FS1 composite | Average locked cycle results | 1.5 | 28.5 | 93.6 | 14.2 | 77.1 |\n| Best pilot plant survey | 1.6 | 27.6 | 94.1 | 8.1 | 76.9 |\n| Best pilot plant shift composite | 1.5 | 28.3 | 92.5 | 10.8 | 73.6 |\n| Pilot survey, average from optimum conditions | 1.6 | 28.3 | 92.8 | 8.2 | 72.8 |\n\n\\* FS2 results are presented ahead of FS1 results in order to follow the order of testing\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1116 line 21 to p. 1117 line 7.\n\n599.\n\nBased on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concludes that it would not be correct to look at the test results reported in AMMTEC's March 2009 interim report in isolation and to ignore the additional test work done by Claimant and AMMTEC on the metallurgical process until December 2009. As neither Respondent nor Prof. Spiller have addressed the final test results reported by AMMTEC in December 2009, the Tribunal also cannot follow the argument that AMMTEC's test results show metallurgical variability in a manner that would affect the value of Claimant's investment.\n\n600.\n\nAs an additional argument, Respondent claims that the test results produced by RDi laboratory on samples collected by Prof. Dagdelen during his site visit to Reko Diq have \"*conclusively shown \u2026 that Reko Diq has variable recoverabilities*.\"674\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 99.\n\n601.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Dr. Anderson has raised several detailed criticisms regarding the testing conducted by RDi, such as that the quantities of material were, in his opinion, not sufficient to be representative samples and that there were what he considers to be shortcomings in the technical processes employed by RDi. In addition, Dr. Anderson criticized Prof. Dagdelen and Prof. Spiller for their comparison of open-cycle tests with locked-cycle tests.675\n\nAnderson, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19; 21-87.\n\n602.\n\nIn response, Prof. Spiller expressed the opinion that \"*what is important is the variability of results for the contemporary testing at RDi when tested following duplicated procedures in the same laboratory conducted by the same personnel. Whether the tests are Locked Cycle or Open Cycle, any variability will be present, and it is not necessary to conduct only Locked Cycle tests to judge the variability of the recoveries*.\" Prof. Spiller emphasized that the samples collected by Prof. Dagdelen \"*came from drill core generally expected to represent material previously (historically) tested at AMMTEC. In fact, all the samples contained copper and gold values within the expected ore grade for the project. Further, all the samples responded to the crush/grind/float process following the same protocol, including the same reagents*.\" He then stated that \"[w]*hat was not similar was the variability of performance*.\" In his view, Dr. Anderson's criticisms did not go to variability and he therefore did not see the need to respond in-depth to each of Dr. Anderson's criticisms.676\n\nSpiller III, pp. 5-6.\n\n603.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the argument raised by Respondent and Prof. Spiller appears to be two-fold: (i) the test results produced by RDi allegedly show that AMMTEC's test results could not be duplicated by a buyer;677 and (ii) the test results produced by RDi allegedly show variability among themselves so that even if the test conditions at RDi were not identical to those at AMMTEC, the RDi test results alone show a variable deposit.678\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 166.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of Quantum, \u00b6 100.\n\n604.\n\nAs for the first argument, the Tribunal takes note of Dr. Anderson's opinion that open-cycle tests cannot be directly compared with locked-cycle tests and that the only valid comparison drawn by Prof. Spiller with the locked-cycle tests reported by AMMTEC in the March 2009 interim report therefore concerns the locked-cycle tests of RDi.679 In the Tribunal's view, the lack of comparability is confirmed by Prof. Spiller's first report in which he noted that \"*RDi conducted open cycle flotation tests following the standard procedure with site water on six variability samples provided from Professor Dagdelen's site visit. The AMMTEC reports did not show directly comparable test results for what were termed Drop Weight Test (DWT) composite samples. Instead, AMMTEC conducted locked cycle tests on the DWT samples and modified the procedure to include aeration.*\"680 Prof. Spiller then compared the results of RDi's open cycle tests \"*a*[s] *well as possible*\" to AMMTEC's locked cycle test results and concluded that \"[i]*n virtually every test the AMMTEC results produced higher recovery and higher concentrate grade results*.\"681\n\nAnderson, \u00b6 19.\n\nSpiller I, p. 14.\n\nSpiller I, p. 14, *referring to* Appendix 5, Table 4.\n\n605.\n\nAs pointed out by Dr. Anderson, RDi also conducted locked-cycle tests and Prof. Spiller stated in his report that he had compared those to \"*similar tests by AMMTEC*.\" For this comparison, he concluded that \"[o]*n average the AMMTEC results produced a slightly higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs 22.8). Differences in recovery and grade results were similar with respect to Au, Ag, Fe and S*.\"682\n\nSpiller I, p. 14, *referring to* Appendix 5, Table 3.\n\n606.\n\nGiven that Prof. Spiller himself considered the open-cycle tests not \"*directly comparable*\" with AMMTEC's test results, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to refer only to the comparison of locked-cycle tests. There, Prof. Spiller did not find any large differences between the AMMTEC and RDi results but only what he described as \"*a slightly higher Cu recovery*\" while the copper average grade was \"*virtually the same*.\" He reached the same conclusion for the other minerals found in these samples.\n\n607.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is not convinced by the first argument that a buyer would not have been able to duplicate the results achieved by Claimant. It would contradict common sense to expect that the results would be identical and the fact that they are within a close range rather corroborates the robustness of AMMTEC's results. The Tribunal therefore also does not consider it necessary to express an opinion on Dr. Anderson's criticisms regarding the representativeness of the material collected by Prof. Dagdelen or the differences in methodology employed by RDi. The same applies to the discussion between the Parties regarding an oxidation of the ore kept in the core shed at Reko Diq from which Prof. Dagdelen collected the samples during his site visit.\n\n608.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Tribunal is also not convinced by Respondent's second argument, *i.e*., that the RDi results in themselves are proof of a variable deposit. If RDi's results of locked-cycle tests produced results showing that, across all minerals tested, recoveries and grades were similar to those reported by AMMTEC, the Tribunal fails to see why a willing buyer would have concluded from these results that the deposit was variable, *i.e*., that recovery ranges deviated from those on which the economics of the Feasibility Study are based.\n\n609.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the comparison drawn by Prof. Spiller between RDi and AMMTEC test results concerned exclusively AMMTEC's March 2009 test results. In the Tribunal's view, it is much more likely that a willing buyer wanting to verify the recoveries relied on in the Feasibility Study would have looked at AMMTEC's final tests which actually formed the basis for the figures in the Feasibility Study. No such comparison has been made and the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that a willing buyer would have drawn any conclusion from a comparison with interim test results which were superseded by subsequent locked-cycle tests as well as pilot plant test work.\n\n610.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to believe that the metallurgical testing conducted by AMMTEC was inadequate or that such tests showed variability that would have affected the value attributed by a willing buyer to Claimant's investment.\n\n**4. Whether Claimant Has Established That Its Plans for Project Execution Were Adequate for a Project at the Development Stage of Reko Diq**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nClaimant submits that it was committed to building the mine at Reko Diq and had developed the necessary plans to do so. According to Claimant, \"*TCC's Feasibility Study covered all the technical aspects required to build a project of this scale, as well as the capital and operating costs required to engineer, construct, and eventually operate both the initial mine and the planned expansion case.*\"683\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 72. *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 670.\n\n612.\n\nClaimant refers to its expert Mr. Neil Cusworth, who conducted an independent peer review of the Feasibility Study in 2011 and an additional detailed review in the context of this arbitration and concluded that \"*TCC's studies are in the top 10% of feasibility studies in terms of content, quality and accuracy*,\" that they would have \"*allowed TCC, and its owners Barrick and Antofagasta, to make a well-informed financial investment decision*,\" and, finally, that the studies \"*were of bankable quality*.\"684\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 73, *quoting from* Cusworth, \u00b6 60.\n\n613.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's allegations regarding a \"*high likelihood of cost overruns and delays*\" as well as \"*overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost estimates*\" and refers to both Ms. Cusworth and Mr. Livesey as well as various sections of the Feasibility Study which show in its view that \"*TCC's mine plan included not only the nature and location of the mine, but also identified the specific mining equipment and processing facilities that would be used, how much and what kind of labor would be required, and how the eventual concentrate would be stored and eventually transported*.\"685\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 672, *referring to* Cusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 60-65; Livesey IV, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54; Livesey IX, \u00b6\u00b6 21\u201339 *and* **Exhibits RE-576-5, RE-576-6, RE-576-9, RE-576-22, RE-576-22, RE-576-23** and **RE-576-24**.\n\n614.\n\nClaimant submits that teams from Claimant, Antofagasta and Barrick, together with 13 expert groups conducted 46 trade off studies during feasibility stage and thereby determined how to design, construct and operate the mine. As examples, Claimant points to the pit design, drilling, hauling and mining support equipment, design of processing facilities and the detailed drawings and process flow diagrams for key elements of the mine.686 It further refers to a forward work plan which identified and provisionally budgeted for the next steps of the project and a section in the Feasibility Study on project execution \"*detailing its eventual strategy on procurement, engineering, construction, commissioning and eventual handover*\" and argues that \"*the company was ready and able to actually build* [the mine].\"687\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 672-675, *referring in particular to* **Exhibit RE-576-14.02**.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 676, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-32** and **RE-576-22**.\n\n615.\n\nClaimant notes that the forward work plan provided for a 48-month schedule from commencement of project engineering through to completion of construction, which Mr. Cusworth reviewed and considered reasonable and in line with other large copper projects.688 Claimant emphasizes that this schedule did not include the project commitment phase preceding project engineering during which it would have moved ahead with certain steps such as the purchase of milling equipment for the processing plant.689 Claimant further points to ten main areas identified in the forward work plan, which relate to project financing and project readiness, with preliminary plans to address these areas after the feasibility stage.690\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 682, *referring to* Cusworth, \u00b6 57.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 683, *referring to* Livesey IX, \u00b6 66.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 684.\n\n616.\n\nClaimant considers that Respondent's allegations of cost overruns and delays are ill-founded and, in any event, would not affect Prof. Davis' valuation.691\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 677.\n\n617.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the opinion of Respondent's expert Mr. Owen should be attached no weight because he started to offer opinions on various issues beyond the construction aspects on which he initially was to comment and provided a \"*laundry list of conclusions*\" none of which was based on any analysis or specific or material enough to affect the value of the project. Claimant considers that following Mr. Cusworth's analysis of the alleged issues, Mr. Owen abandoned his allegations and notes that he even admitted at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*as far as constructing goes, there* [were] *no big issues there at Reko Diq*.\"692\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 74-77, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1077.\n\n618.\n\nClaimant considers that from a technical point of view, the location of the site was \"*far from challenging*\" and refers to Mr. Cusworth who considered that the \"*site of the mine is ideal in terms of available areas for the project needs*\" and compared the location to another project with several similarities regarding \"*topography, distances from ports and infrastructure* [and] *weather conditions*\" which was delivered on time and on budget.693\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 680, *quoting from* Cusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\n619.\n\nClaimant further points to Mr. Owen's testimony that he would be \"*the guy that has to stand in front of the Board and help them make the Decisions, and then \u2026 to go out and execute in the field*\" and considers it confirmed that he had not undertaken the work required to advise the Tribunal on Reko Diq given that Mr. Owen testified that he \"*took the care and diligence that* [he] *would have* on a first basis *to talk to a Board of Directors about whether they should* move forward with thinking about investing *in this Project*.\"694\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 903 and pp. 1026-1027 (emphasis added by Claimant).\n\n620.\n\nClaimant rejects Mr. Owen's \"*refrain*\" that it dit not have its \"*eye on the ball*\" and his criticism that the Feasibility Study was allegedly missing a project execution plan. In Claimant's view, Mr. Owen conceded during the Hearing on Quantum that only a preliminary project execution plan is required at feasibility stage and failed to provide any reason why Claimant's plan would not meet or even exceed what was required at that stage of the project. Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Owen did not identify or criticize any specific sections of the Feasibility Study in his second report but merely stated during the Hearing on Quantum that he had \"*referred to the Project Execution Plan as being woefully inadequate*.\"695\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 80-84, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 1092, 1093, 1094 and p. 1067 *and referring to* p. 1063.\n\n621.\n\nIn response to the allegedly missing \"*critical*\" components that Mr. Owen identified for the first time in his presentation during the Hearing on Quantum, Claimant provides a list of references to those parts of the Feasibility Study in which, according to Claimant, each of the items identified by Mr. Owen is addressed.696\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 85, *responding to* Dagdelen-Owen Presentation, pp. 30-31.\n\n622.\n\nClaimant further considers that, despite Respondent's assertion that Claimant's ramp up assumptions were \"*wildly unrealistic*,\" there is no dispute between the Parties that Reko Diq would be able to ramp up in the fastest category of mines. Claimant points to Mr. Owen's testimony that he would expect a ramp up time in the range of 12 to 24 months and emphasizes that Prof. Davis even modeled a ramp up time in the range of 16 to 24 months in his revised model.697 Claimant notes that Prof. Davis' original model already included an average delay of 2.3 years before construction starts and that his revised model includes an additional delay of 21 months in ramp-up to full production after the end of construction.698\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 87-89, *quoting from* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 216 *and referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 1046-1047 *and* Davis II, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 671, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6 193 *and* Davis II, \u00b6 84.\n\n623.\n\nClaimant also refers to the residual risk value of USD 105 million in the Feasibility Study to which Respondent and Mr. Owen pointed during the Hearing on Quantum. According to Claimant, the residual risk value was \"*a measure of the Project's sensitivity to capital cost overruns, and one that proved that the project was sufficiently robust to withstand such overruns*.\"699 Claimant then points to the following sections of the Feasibility Study: (i) the Capital Cost contingency summary in which Claimant ascribed an individual contingency amount to each discipline and category, which resulted in an overall contingency of USD 326 million (corresponding to 11% of total capital cost); (ii) the Capital Cost Section in which Claimant refrred to a residual risk assessment of USD 105 million and noted that \"[t]*he residual value has been recommended, but is not included in the CAPEX or Sustaining Capital*\"; and (iii) the Residual Risk Assessment showing the financial analysis used to determine this value and stating that its purpose is to show the project's owners that \"*there exists an 85% probability that threats materializing will cost the project less than $105M*.\"700\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-46 *and quoting from* p. 23-48 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, p. 6.\n\n624.\n\nClaimant adds that the residual risk value was derived from the risk register that Prof. Davis fed into his model and submits that \"*Prof. Davis, however, made even more conservative assumptions about those risks than those made by the TCC team at the time of the Feasibility Study and then incorporated those more conservative assumptions into the valuation he has presented*.\" Therefore, if Claimant's work had been inadequate, Claimant contends that this would not affect Prof. Davis' valuation.701 Claimant points in particular to Prof. Davis' increase of the initial mine development capital costs by 58% to account for the risk of cost overruns, which exceeds the amounts that Respondent's experts considered necessary.702\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 671, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6 155.\n\n625.\n\nClaimant also refers to Respondent's reliance on a \"*rule of thumb*\" that a cost contingency for a project in the developing world equals 20% of the project's total expenditures and maintains that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis exceed that number given that he included a 21.4% cost increase due to escalation and a 10% contingency from Claimant's studies.703\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 686-687, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6 160.\n\n626.\n\nAs for the overall contingency rate of 11% presented in the Feasibility Study, Claimant explains that it is a blend of different contingencies varying from 5% to 25% depending on the level of certainty that Claimant had regarding the various cost estimates.704 It refers to Mr. Cusworth who explained:\n\n\"[T]*he amount of contingency, therefore, varies according to the degree of engineering design definition achieved. For example, mining equipment prices are now sourced from existing fixed price global contracts with selected suppliers. As a result, it is appropriate to reduce the level of contingency for mining equipment to around 5%. Because of the level of certainty, a lower contingency can be used*.\"705\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 688-689.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 89.\n\n627.\n\nFinally, as for Respondent's allegation that Claimant overestimated productivity of its workforce and should have made use of the Gulf Coast Factor, Claimant contends that the approach it took was more appropriate than \"*Pakistan's arbitrary approach*\" because no specific construction labor productivity factor existed for Pakistan when Claimant prepared its studies. Claimant explains that it instead drew on productivity assumptions and manpower estimates from local contractors and SNC Lavalin, which was familiar with Pakistani labor from previous experience and obtained no less than three bids for each major construction package, analyzing and comparing them to other projects in the region.706 Claimant notes that according to Mr. Cusworth, the Feasibility Study \"*provided the estimates of labour hours and costs in painstaking detail*\" and that he further testified that \"[t]*his comprehensive methodology goes well beyond the normal practices at feasibility study stage and is a more accurate method that that suggested by Mr Owen*.\"707\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 690-694, *referring to* Cusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120, 124, Livesey IX, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-21**.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 695, *quoting from* Cusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 123-124.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nRespondent submits that, according to Claimant, Reko Diq is a \"*mega project*\" which would have cost almost USD 3.3 billion in capital expenditures in order to get the mine operational. Respondent claims, however, that the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study \"*failed to quantify sizable costs, adopted an overly aggressive construction schedule that did not prepare for the requirements of building a mine in Pakistan, and adhered to overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost estimates.*\"708\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 352.\n\n629.\n\nRespondent contends that the Feasibility Study was \"*a blueprint for another Mega Project failure*\" and refers to the statistic presented by Mr. Owen at the Hearing on Quantum pursuant to which \"*Mega projects*\" in the Asia-Pacific region frequently experience significant cost and schedule overruns. According to Respondent, Claimant has not challenged Mr. Owen's years of \"*research, experience, and studied analysis*\" showing that \"*Mega-projects are undeniably prone to failure*.\"709 Referring to independent studies, Respondent submits that of the projects built in the mining industry, \"*85% come in over budget, 75% fail to start up one time, and 75% do not meet operation specifications*\" and adds that the \"*propensity for failing to meet feasibility studies is even worse with* 'Mega' *Projects*,\" *i.e*., projects with a capital investment of over USD 1 billion.710 Respondent submits that industry analysts have identified three \"*key factors*\" in large project failures, *i.e*., not adhering to industry practice, management turnover, and overly aggressive scheduling, and claims that Reko Diq \"*exhibited all the warning signs of becoming a failure*.\"711\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 108-109, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen Presentation, p. 22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 194, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44, 78.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 353, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-610** *and* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\n630.\n\nRespondent argues that a \"*primary driver of these failures*\" are \"*over-eager Project Advocates*\" which are solely concerned with getting the project approved and intend to resolve issues in the future. According to Respondent, successfully delivered projects require not only a feasibility study but also a fully detailed project execution plan (as opposed to a single chapter in the feasibility study) and employ third parties to review the feasibility study and confirm the project execution plan.712\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 195.\n\n631.\n\nRespondent argues that the \"*real work*\" begins after the feasibility study where \"*numerous unknowns arise during execution*\" and refers to Mr. Owen who testified that there are significant problems where the feasibility study has \"*a determined Project Advocate*\" who might lower the capital costs, use the best results for metal recovery, minimize risk facts and lower the contingency in order to show a better IRR and hopefully get board approval for the project.713 According to Respondent, project advocates are unreliable and \"*TCCA and its vendors fall solidly into this camp*\" as the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study \"*display all of the problems of a Mega Project*.\"714\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 197-200, *quoting from* Dagdelen/Owern II, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 53.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 201-202.\n\n632.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant either under-spent on the Feasibility Study or failed to present any capital expenditures for the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and points to what it considers identical tables of expenditures in both studies.715 According to Respondent, Mr. Cusworth conceded that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility table is a \"*cut and paste*\" which, in Respondent's view, is a \"*sign of hopelessly inadequate work by TCC in overseeing this element of the EXP PFS*.\"716 In any event, Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to prove its expenditures in the project given that it only offered a table \"*without any detailed breakdown and support*\" despite Respondent's challenge that \"*TCC duplicated many of its costs by having full teams from both owners where only one team was necessary*.\"717\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 111, *comparing* **Exhibit RE-576-31**, Table 31.3 *with* **Exhibit RE-577-30**, Table 30.3.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 112, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 876 lines 13-17.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 112.\n\n633.\n\nRespondent claims that spending USD 204 million on the Feasibility Study is \"*a rather low number for a Megal Project*\" in comparison to the overall CAPEX and refers to Mr. Own who testified that buyers would be looking for more than 2-3% of the project value in expenditures and in fact would be expecting 3-5% to avoid the \"*overwhelming frequency of cost blow-outs and developmental failures*\" in mega projects.718\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 204; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 113, *referring to* Dagdelen Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 77, 85 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1083 lines 11-22.\n\n634.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant had not carried out any detailed engineering which, according to Respondent, forms a \"*key element of any feasibility study for a mega project*.\" Respondent refers to Mr. Owen who testified that a mega project requires at least 80% of the basic engineering and 15% of the detailed engineering before the decision to go forward with instruction. He further explained that detailed engineering shows how the different pieces of the project will work with each other when the project is executed. According to Respondent, the absence of detailed engineering, despite the absence of any experience of working in Pakistan, was \"*an important blind spot in TCC's preparations that it could not quantify.*\"719\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 114-115, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1084 lines 1-14; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 88.\n\n635.\n\nAs for the requirement of having a project execution plan, Respondent considers that the dispute between the Parties relates to the detail required of this plan and contends that the \"*section on project execution*\" is not comparable to the \"*full, detailed execution plan*\" without which a mega project \"*is primed to fail*\" due to cost overruns, scheduling flaws and design failures.720 Respondent argues that during the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Owen described the missing elements such as a resource plan describing where people will come from and what they will do, the 300 pages describing what an EPCM company would do, the lack of operations readiness in the procurement plan or the lack of a plan for seeking agreement with the tribes along the pipeline route and the actions of the owner at project execution stage.721 Respondent claims that \"*TCC did not know what it needed in a Project Execution Plan*\" and therefore had no documents or questions to put to Mr. Owen in response to his criticisms.722\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 207-209, *quoting from* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 685 *and referring to* Dagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 79, 88, 93-95.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 116, 118, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1066 lines 1-7, p. 1086 lines 5-17, p. 1067 lines 5-7, p. 1068 lines 20-22, and p. 1063 lines 11-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 117.\n\n636.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Mr. Livesey's testimony supported the absence of a project execution plan by confirming that Section 32 of the Feasibility Study describes a future project execution plan and that numerous high-value items in the execution portion were not finished even though the Feasibility Study described them as \"*essential*.\" Respondent contends that \"*Reko Diq was not ready for execution and the costs and time that would come with the work*.\"723\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 118, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 394 lines 8-14, pp. 391-393 and p. 397 lines 3-12.\n\n637.\n\nAs for the ramp-up time of the project, Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Owen correctly identified that the ramp up was \"*wildly unrealistic*\" because even those mines in the fastest category (28% of the projects in the world) reach steady state production in no less than 12-16 months and Claimant failed to provide any evidence that its project should be classified in that category. Respondent further points out that Mr. Cusworth \"*didn't see*\" in its review of the Feasibility Study the unreasonably short ramp-up time to which Claimant then ascribed hundreds of millioms of dollars. In Respondent's view, this confirms a lack of seriousness in his review and \"*dubious quality*\" of Mr. Cusworth's testimony.724 Respondent points out that the average ramp-up time is 16-18 months and that mines on average achieve less than 70% of design capacity in the first year of production and require more than two years to achieve 90% but maintains that Claimant has failed to show that Reko Diq would achieve this performance.725\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 215-217; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 124, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 834 line 6.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 373, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-611**.\n\n638.\n\nRespondent further considers it confirmed by Mr. Cusworth that there were no productivity factors or other means to estimate the productivity of the workforce in the Feasibility Study. Respondent also refers to Mr. Cusworth's confirmation that it would be difficult to predict how productive laborers might be in \"*unique*\" countries such as Pakistan and his testimony that \"[i]*t's very hard to get reliable productivity figures which you can rely on. They can give you an indication, but you wouldn't rely on them*.\" In Respondent's view, the Tribunal must therefore conclude that Claimant did not have the detail available to reasonably estimate its ability to execute the project.726\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 119, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 837 line 15 to p. 838 line 4.\n\n639.\n\nRespondent submits that the mining industry uses the \"*Gulf Coast Factor,*\" which uses the US Golf Coast as a baseline for productivity, to adjust the estimated man-hours for the project. Respondent submits that there was a shortage of qualified labor in Balochistan and contends that \"[i]*n all likelihood, the Gulf Coast Factor would have been high*.\" By not using a Gulf Coast Factor and instead relying on estimates prepared by Pakistani contractors, Respondent claims that Claimant failed to provide a realistic estimate of construction time and cost. Respondent notes that Claimant acknowledged an increased capital expenditure over over USD 130 million to account for the high risk of not finding adequate labor due to the lack of technical skills but maintains that Claimant failed to consider the possibility of delays in the construction schedule. According to Respondent, Claimant also failed to include a productivity curve in the Feasibility Stusy to model productivity over the life of the mine.727\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 363-366, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-611** *and* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 193-196.\n\n640.\n\nRespondent further asserts that Claimant \"*did not have the right people in charge*\" because in particular Mr. Livesey, in its view, did not have the necessary experience and his supervisor was, according to Respondent, engaged in a securities fraud in another project. Respondent contends that Barrick was pushing the project forward even though it \"*did not know how to run a copper project and could not even keep its gold mines remotely close to their budget*.\" Respondent claims that \"*leadership failures at TCC would have given any buyer further concern in purchasing Reko Diq*.\"728\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 210-211.\n\n641.\n\nRespondent further argues that the contingency calculated by Claimant was based on \"*known-unknowns*\" and did not account for \"*unknown-unknowns*\" even though it had not done the detailed engineering to identify these unknowns and therefore failed to include at least 10-15% of project costs.729 Respondent contends that for a project in the developing world, \"*the rule of thumb is a cost contingency that equals 20% of the project's total capital expenditures*.\"730 As for the \"*supplemental overrun facility*\" described by Mr. Cusworth, which would include \"*unkown-unknowns*,\" Respondent contends that Mr. Cusworth had no means to calculate the number which remained secret and was based on \"*crude*\" estimates. According to Respondent, Claimant thereby failed to provide the necessary certainty to apply modern DCF as no buyer would have had the tools to calculate the future costs as the basis for its investment decision.731\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 212-214\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 361, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 189.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\n642.\n\nRespondent also claims that Claimant failed to budget for \"*key items*\" such as a reverse osmosis plant to treat the water from the Fan Sediments, which is relied on in Claimant's studies but does not appear as a purchase item, and many of the risks contained in the residual risk assessment, which are identified but not quantified and therefore do not appear in the capital expenditures or operating expenses.732 Respondent submits that its experts took the missing components of capital expenditures recommended in the Feasibility Study and adjusted the cost contingency to 20%, which raised the total capital expenditure estimate from USD 3,299 million to USD 3,667 million and, according to Respondent, shows the magnitude of the errors made by Claimant but does not yet include security costs, the \"*inevitable cost overruns*,\" or costs of bringing the mine to meet the environmental standards.733\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 356-357.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 375, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 189.\n\n643.\n\nRespondent further alleges that Claimant decided to leave out USD 105 million in \"*owner's cost*\" and points to Mr. Cusworth's testimony that it was in the \"*supplemental overrun facility*\" whose number was unknown. According to Respondent, the likely increase of costs by having to change from Light Sulfur Fuel Oil to Heavy Fuel Oil could also not be found in the operating expenses, contingency or the risk register and would therefore amount to \"*another case of millions of missing dollars*.\"734\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 125, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 850 lines 1-6 *and referring to* p. 846 line 19 to p. 848 line 13.\n\n644.\n\nAs for the risk register of the Feasibility Study, Respondent claims that it has \"*hardly any value*\" given that Claimant itself referred to further \"*adjustments*\" made by Prof. Davis for items not listed in the risk register and therefore accepted that it had failed to \"*de-risk*\" the project in respect of numerous areas of unknown costs such as security costs. Respondent contends that: (i) Claimant failed to correctly add up the cost of the risk it had identified which resulted in an error amouting to \"*hundreds of millions of dollars*\"; and (ii) Claimant failed to include high-risk items such as theft for explosives which were also worth \"*hundreds of millions of dollars*.\" According to Respondent, Prof. Davis has also not assigned any value to this risk and in any event, Respondent maintains that the project cannot be \"*de-risked*\" by Prof. Davis by adding costs to a model that relies on an allegedly already \"*de-risked*\" project.735\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 126-128, *quoting from* Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 147; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 218-221.\n\n645.\n\nRespondent also refers to the highly likely risk of a \"*direct violent attack in-country by any hostile force,*\" which was again not assigned any risk in the risk register and could not be explained by Mr. Cusworth who merely referred to the \"*risk specialists*\" and gave shifting answers as to why the risk was not quantified.736 Respondent further contends that Claimant has failed to properly account for the risk of terrorism in its supply routes by excluding the pipeline and only assigning a value to operating expenses but not the capital expenditures to protect the supply routes before an attack occurred.737 According to Respondent, Claimant also failed to quantify other risks such as \"*criminal extortion and kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel harm, reputation and financial loss*,\" not signing a Mineral Agreement or port approvals, all of which were identified as a high risk.738\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 857 lines 15-16 *and* p. 858 lines 11-12 *and referring to* pp. 858-860. *See also* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 356.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 357, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, p. TCCA042250.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 357-358, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, pp. TCCA042249 and TCCA042245.\n\n646.\n\nRespondent further contends that the risk register inappropriately reduced the risk for items such as the absence of trained geologists even though Claimant had no plan in place to mitigate this risk. According to Respondent, \"[n]*o after-the-fact mathematical calculations can repair this kind of shoddy work*.\"739 Respondent concludes that the risk register prepared prior to 2012 \"*contains millions, if not billions in missing values*\" and \"*Davis/Brattle should not be able to turn a blind eye to these deficiencies*.\"740\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 131.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 132, Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 221.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n647.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the Feasibility Study was not silent on project execution but that it contained a Chapter 22 entitled \"*Project Execution*\" as well as a Chapter 32 entitled \"*Forward Work Plan*\".741 Claimant further points to a section containing detailed piping and instrumentation drawings for the various processing steps of the mine.742\n\n**Exhibits RE-576-22** and **RE-576-22**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-14.02**.\n\n648.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal to determine is whether the plans that Claimant had prepared as of November 2011 were, from the perspective of a buyer, adequate for a project at the development stage of Reko Diq.\n\n649.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Respondent and its expert, Mr. Owen, have repeatedly referred to studies showing that a considerable percentage of large-scale mining projects experiences cost overruns and/or delays in their construction and ramp-up schedule. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Mr. Owen that this information is relevant to the extent that it shows that reasonable contingencies have to be factored into a plan to build and operate a mine, such studies cannot, in and of themselves, serve as evidence that Reko Diq would have experienced these cost overruns and/or delays. In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's general allegation that the Reko Diq project \"*exhibited all the warning signs of becoming a failure*.\"743\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 353.\n\n650.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that Respondent itself makes the argument that \"*TCC duplicated many of its costs by having full teams from both owners where only one team was necessary*.\"744 Mr. Owen also noted that \"*it normally requires 10-12 people to prepare a feasibility study. The IMD FS had 23 people from TCC, showing that Barrick and Antofagasta each wanted their own pair of eyes on everything*.\"745 Respondent thus does not dispute Claimant's submission that the preparation of the Feasibility Study was supervised by teams from both Antofagasta and Barrick. The Tribunal therefore also cannot follow the suggestion that the team preparing the Feasibility Study was inexperienced and was not aware of the necessary components of a feasibility study in terms of planning project execution. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to engage with Respondent's allegation that Claimant \"*did not have the right people in charge*.\"746 Apart from the fact that the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's criticisms aimed specifically at the expertise of Mr. Livesey, the Tribunal also recalls Mr. Livesey's testimony in response to the question whether he thought that they had the right team at TCC to help him lead the Feasibility Study:\n\n\"*Absolutely. We had a very well-developed structure, both below me and above me. What you have to remember is the structure of the team was not only the Tethyan staff themselves, either seconded or recruited into Tethyan, but for each main discipline oversight from both owners, Barrick and Antofagasta.*\n\n*And then below me--above that group and interfacing to me immediately was a study manager, an experienced mining engineer. And then above me was the technical committee.*\n\n*Now, the technical committee was representatives of both Barrick and Antofagasta, and the chairmanship of the technical committee alternated between Barrick and Antofagasta. It was predominantly technical people, and it included the Senior Vice President of capital projects for Barrick and for Antofagasta.*\n\n*So, there was a good, solid team below, capable in their divisions and in their various specialties. And there was oversight above them and then above me as well. \u2026*\n\n*And then we had the Board, obviously, beyond that*.\"747\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 112.\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 208.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 120.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 346 line 16 to p. 347 line 17.\n\n651.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it credible that a buyer would have had concerns regarding \"*leadership failures at TCC*\"748 while being aware that the team, including Mr. Livesey, was supervised by a technical committee comprising representatives of Antofagasta and Barrick, who combined the experience of building and operating copper companies as well as building and operating gold mines in various locations across the continents.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 121.\n\n652.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by the general argument that Claimant did not have the necessary expertise to conduct a feasibility study, including the relevant plans to be made for construction and execution of the project, this does not yet exclude the possibility of potentially justified criticisms on individual parts of the Feasibility Study. The Tribunal will therefore turn to the specific criticisms raised by Respondent and Mr. Owen with regard to the plans for the construction and execution of the project.\n\n653.\n\nMr. Owen criticizes, *inter alia*, that the cost spent on the Feasibility Study was too low which, in his view, demonstrates that the level of engineering was not adequate. In his opinion, the total amount spent on feasibility studies for \"*Mega Projects*\" is \"*normally*\" 3% to 5% of the total capital cost estimate.749 Mr. Owen does not identify any source for this statement. Claimant's expert Mr. Cusworth, on the other hand, considers that the cost for the studies conducted by Claimant, *i.e*., USD 81.37 million or 2.47% of the total capital cost estimate, exceeded the industry benchmark, which he considered to be 1% to 2%.750 In support of his opinion, he refers to an excerpt from the AIMM Cost Estimation Handbook, which identifies an expected range of study costs depending on the complexity and/or size of the project. For a feasibility study, the Handbook identifies the following percentages: low (1-2%); moderate (1.5-2.5%) and high (2.5-3.5%).751\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 85.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 61.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1219**.\n\n654.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the range referred to by Mr. Cusworth in fact corresponds to the percentages identified in the Handbook for projects of low size and/or complexity. In addition, the number he relies on is presented in the Feasibility Study but in fact identifies the cost for project expenditures on the studies since inception of the project in June 2006, *i.e*., including scoping and pre-feasibility studies.752 On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the same chart of the Feasibility Study identifies significant other cost items such as \"*Resource Geology*\" which are listed separately and result in a total amount of project expenditures from inception of USD 204,261, *i.e*., approximately 6.2% of the total capital cost estimate. As for the total percentages of costs to be expected over the study stages, the AIMM Cost Estimation Handbook gives an overall range of 1.3% to 6%.753 Consequently, while the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by the comparison drawn by Mr. Cusworth, it appears that the expenditures made by Claimant would be well within the range of expected costs even for a project of high complexity and/or size.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-31**, p. 31-3.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1219**.\n\n655.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the amount of cost spent cannot in and of itself be evidence of whether the Feasibility Study included adequate plans for construction and execution of the project. Mr. Owen states that the total expenditures should have been higher because a \"*Mega Project*\" requires a higher amount of upfront engineering and development to execute than a \"*normal*\" project. In his opinion, \"*Mega Projects*\" should have a substantial amount of basic engineering done in the feasibility study, which should amount to at least 15% to 20% of the overall engineering.754 In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Respondent's allegation that at least 80% of the basic engineering and 15% of the detailed engineering should be completed755 and its criticism for lack of detailed engineering in the Feasibility Study756 is not supported by Mr. Owen. To the contrary, he confirmed in his presentation during the Hearing on Quantum that detailed engineering starts only after the feasibility level:757\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 86, 96.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 205.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 206. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 114: \"\" [D]*etailed engineering forms a key element of any feasibility study for a mega project*.\"\n\nDagdelen/Owen Presentation, p. 27.\n\n656.\n\nMr. Owen criticizes Mr. Cusworth for not identifying the percentage of basic engineering completed in the Feasibility Study.758 On the other hand, Mr. Owen himself does not specifically identify which aspect of the basic engineering was not adequate in his opinion. He states that basic engineering includes Process Flow Diagrams and Process & Instrument Diagrams but does not address the Annex pointed to by Claimant, which contains a considerable number of highly detailed drawings and diagrams.759 As an example, Claimant pointed to the following drawing:760\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 97.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-14.02**.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-14.02**, p. 9.\n\n657.\n\nMr. Cusworth also refers to these drawings, which were validated through a process testing for hazards and operability issues, as an example that the level of engineering was further advanced than would be required to comply with normal practices at feasibility study stage.761 Mr. Owen does not address any of these drawings in his report and does not specify why or how they would not satisfy the level of basic engineering that he would have expected in a feasibility study. He merely raises general criticisms that the level of basic engineering was inadequate.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 50.\n\n658.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Owen presented a list of components that should be included in a project execution plan and took the view that a project execution plan with these \"*key components does not exist*.\"762 In response, Claimant has identified the sections of the Feasibility Study, which address the components listed by Mr. Owen. While Claimant makes reference to Chapter 22 on Project Execution for some of the components, it also refers to various other Chapters, such as Chapter 20 on Operations, Chapter 21 on Contracts, Procurement and Logistics, Chapter 10 on Information Technology, Chapter 17 on Communications, Chapter 18 on Safety & Health and Chapter 19 on Security.763\n\nDagdelen/Owen Presentation, pp. 30-31.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 85, *referring, inter alia, to* **Exhibits RE-576-22, RE-576-20, RE-576-21, RE-576-10, RE-576-17, RE-576-18** *and* **RE-576-19**.\n\n659.\n\nThe Tribunal understands Mr. Owen's criticism to be, *inter alia*, that Claimant did not have a single document entitled \"*Project Execution Plan*\", which comprised all of the elements he was looking for. As for the Chapter on Project Execution in the Feasibility Study, Mr. Owen considers this to be \"*a boilerplate chapter \u2026 on EPCM project execution*\" and maintains that \"*a fully detailed and costed*\" Project Execution Plan would have been required.764 However, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have expected to find all of the relevant information in one document rather than in the Chapters of the Feasibility Study setting out the individual aspects of the project. More specifically, neither Respondent nor Mr. Owen have pointed to any authority which would support the suggestion that only a \"*Project Execution Plan*\" comprising the elements listed by Mr. Owen in a single document would satisfy the level of basic engineering or the level of accuracy that a buyer would expect in a feasibility study.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 102.\n\n660.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal takes note of the fact that Claimant's expert Mr. Cusworth identified a total of four \"*deltas*\" in respect of which the Feasibility Study, in his opinion, \"*was not at best practice, but rather more in line with normal industry standards for a feasibility study*\" and could have provided further detail. Specifically, he identified funding arrangements which had been considered only on a preliminary basis, the timetable contained in the Forward Work Plan, the transportation of large quantities of freight to the site during construction and the strategy and timing of selecting the EPCM contractor.765 In Mr. Cusworth's opinion, these \"*deltas*\" did not, however, affect the \"*bankable quality*\" of the Feasibility Study, which would have allowed Claimant and its owners to make a well informed financial investment decision.766\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 54-59.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 60.\n\n661.\n\nMr. Owen does not address these \"*deltas*\" and in particular does not present a different opinion regarding their potential effect on the quality of the Feasibility Study. Therefore, the Tribunal has no reason to assume that these would have affected the value of the project from the perspective of a buyer.\n\n662.\n\nMr. Owen rather addresses a variety of different subjects, which in his opinion are not or not adequately dealt with in the Feasibility Study. First, as to the question of the construction and ramp-up schedule, the Tribunal notes that in his first report, Mr. Owen criticized an \"*overly aggressive construction schedule*\" which he considered to be \"*at least 10-12 months too aggressive*.\" In addition, he considered that Claimant took an \"*unrealistic approach to its ramp up assumptions,*\" by assuming that ramp up would be completed in three months, and opined that the average ramp up was 16 to 18 months, with up to 24 months in \"*remote difficult locations*.\"767\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 206-207.\n\n663.\n\nIn response, Mr. Cusworth assessed first the construction schedule and concluded based on an analysis of the project and recent benchmarking that the construction period of 48 months put forward in the Feasibility Study was \"*readily achievable, and indeed even more conservative than what has recently been achieved on similar mining projects*.\"768 Mr. Cusworth then examined the ramp-up time to be expected for Reko Diq based on a normalized benchmarking of copper mine and concentrator projects over the past 40 years and concluded that Reko Diq would have qualified as a \"*Category 1*\" style ramp up using simple, mature methodology because it: (i) was \"*technically straight forward*\"; (ii) had \"*high quality sponsors with relevant expertise*\"; (iii) had \"*with a degree of certainty a continuous, consistent ore body*\"; and (iv) had SNC Lavalin as an experienced EPCM contractor. On that basis, Mr. Cusworth presented a production forecast for Reko Diq projecting that it would achieve its design capacity of throughput and recovery after 24 months of operations.769\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 96-101.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 102-113.\n\n664.\n\nOn that basis, Prof. Davis decided in his second report to maintain the 48-month construction schedule but to adjust his valuation model to reflect the ramp-up schedule provided by Mr. Cusworth. This adjustment from the 3-month ramp up estimated in the Feasibility Study to the ramp-up schedule presented by Mr. Cusworth reduced the value of the project by USD 0.6 billion.770\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 172-175.\n\n665.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Owen questioned whether Mr. Cusworth was in a position to give an independent opinion given his previous involvement with the project through his firm, Enthalpy, and in particular his review of the Feasibility Study in 2011 in which he did not point out the \"*improbable ramp-up time*\" of three months.771 Mr. Owen did not, however, raise any specific criticisms regarding Mr. Cusworth's assessment and benchmarking of the construction schedule in the Feasibility Study. In the absence of any such criticism, the Tribunal sees no basis for a conclusion that a buyer would not have considered the construction schedule contained in the Feasibility Study adequate.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\n666.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Owen's suggestion that Mr. Cusworth, by providing an analysis on the ramp-up schedule in his expert report for this arbitration that he apparently did not perform during his contemporaneous review of the Feasibility Study in 2011, would not be in a good position to give an independent opinion on either aspect of the project. During the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Cusworth testified that he \"*didn't look at that technical issue*\" during his three-day review of the Feasibility Study in 2011 and readily acknowledged that he \"*didn't see it at the time* [he] *did the review in 2011*.\"772 In the Tribunal's view, the fact that Mr. Cusworth performed an additional analysis in response to Mr. Owen's criticisms and reached a different result for one aspect of the project does not in itself raise any doubts as to the independence of his opinion.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 833 line 13 to p. 834 line 7.\n\n667.\n\nAs for Mr. Cusworth's analysis on the ramp-up schedule, Mr. Owen questioned his opinion that Reko Diq would qualify as a \"*class one*\" ramp up and noted that only 28% of the projects \"*are truly class one startups, so the vast majority of startups will not be class one*.\" Mr. Owen further considered that achieving a class one startup requires \"*extensive experience in this specific task*,\" adding that in his opinion Antofagasta and Barrick did not have the requisite experience because they had never worked in Pakistan and were planning to use a \"*rather a new technology*\" for crushing the rock. He therefore considered it more likely that Reko Diq would have a \"*normal 12 to 16 month startup*\" in the \"*Series 1 or Series 2 range*.\"773\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n\n668.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen does not engage with the four reasons provided by Mr. Cusworth in support of his opinion that Reko Diq would classify as a \"*Category 1*\" ramp up. The Tribunal also cannot follow the rather general argument that Claimant's owners did not have the required expertise of building and operating a mine at Reko Diq. While they may not have worked specifically in Pakistan, Barrick had built and was operating mines in various remote locations across the continents and, therefore, more specific arguments would be required to convince the Tribunal that the personnel from Barrick did not bring the necessary expertise to develop a mine in Pakistan.\n\n669.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen himself does not specify what he means by \"*Series 1 or Series 2 range*\" and, most importantly, considers that a ramp-up over 12 to 16 months would be \"*normal*.\" The Tribunal recalls that Mr. Cusworth's production forecast for Reko Diq assumes that the ramp-up would be completed after 24 months and Prof. Davis incorporated this analysis into his valuation model. On that basis, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that the adjusted ramp-up schedule include in Prof. Davis' revised model would not be considered adequate by a buyer.\n\n670.\n\nMr. Owen continued to emphasize during his presentation at the Hearing on Quantum that Claimant had estimated a ramp-up of three months, which he considered \"*totally unrealistic*\" and evidence of \"*the team's lack of experience in leading projects in real ramp-ups*.\"774 The Tribunal considers, however, that even on the assumption that a buyer would have reached the same conclusion as Mr. Cusworth regarding a reasonable ramp-up time, the buyer would presumably have done the same exercise as Prof. Davis, *i.e*., it would have quantified the impact of making the necessary adjustments for what it considered a reasonable ramp-up time and it would have deducted that amount from the purchase price it would have been willing to pay. The Tribunal is not convinced that, as Mr. Owen suggests, the buyer would have used this as a basis for questioning the expertise of Claimant's team or the validity of the Feasibility Study in general.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 907 lines 6-14.\n\n671.\n\nIn his first expert report, Mr. Owen further criticized that the Feasibility Study did not use productivity factors to evaluate its estimate of the man-hours required for the project and explained that Claimant should have used the Gulf Coast Factor, which calculates productivity as a multiple of the Gulf Coast Rate, *i.e*., a standard based on productivity in the Gulf Coast area. Mr. Owen noted that he did not know what the Gulf Coast Factor would be for Pakistan but considered that \"*4 is a minimum*.\" He added that he was not able to calculate the factor due to the lack of a productivity analysis in the Feasibility Study.775 As for the estimates from local contractors on which Claimant had relied, Mr. Owen considered these \"*likely to be understated, and schedules based on those estimates \u2026 not reliable*.\" Mr. Owen further criticized the lack of a productivity curve showing the amount of work done over time as well as the absence of a benchmarking effort. In his opinion, the Feasibility Study \"*recognizes this shortcoming*\" by stating that this will be done during the engineering phase and puts into question the estimate's reliability for forecasting construction.776\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 193-195.\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 196-199, *referring to* **Exhibit DO-38**, p. 22-105.\n\n672.\n\nIn response to this criticism, Mr. Cusworth provided several reasons why, in his opinion, an application of the \"*Gulf Coast Rate*\" would have been \"*inappropriate*\" for Reko Diq: (i) absence of reliable, relevant data on productivity for Pakistan; (ii) general unreliability of data developed based on the Gulf Coast standard due to the absence of a specific baseline to which appropriate factors can be applied and its high subjectivity; and (iii) Claimant and SNC Lavalin's use of a \"*detailed and rigorous plan to obtain accurate estimates of the labour costs*\" which comprised obtaining a minimum of three bids from local and international contractors for all major construction packages, preparing a bid analysis and comparison against recent and ongoing projects in the region by SNC Lavalin's estimators who had experience with sourcing labor for construction projects in Pakistan. Mr. Cusworth noted that it would be \"*unrealistic to expect that these in-house benchmarks would be disclosed in a third party document such as the Reko Diq Feasibility Study*.\"777 In the opinion of Mr. Cusworth, the Feasibility Study \"*provided the estimates of labour hours and costs in painstaking detail*\" and he pointed to estimates for every item of the scope of work in the Appendices of the Feasibility Study and the curves of labor hours and number of personnel required for construction. On that basis, Mr. Cusworth concluded that \"[t]*his comprehensive methodology goes well beyond normal practices at feasibility study stage and is a more accurate method than that suggested by Mr. Owen.*\"778\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 115-122, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-10.13**, p. 6.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 123-124, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-10.02, RE-576-10.08, RE-576-22**, pp. 22-75 \u2013 22-76 *and* **RE-576-23**, pp. 23-13 \u2013 23-15.\n\n673.\n\nMr. Owen did not provide any substantive response to Mr. Cusworth's opinion in his second report. While acknowledging that Mr. Cusworth's report \"*does touch on the issues of labor productivity*,\" Mr. Owen did not address any of the reasons provided by Mr. Cusworth in support of the methodology used by Claimant. He did not again refer to the Gulf Coast rate but only generally criticized a \"*lack of details on productivity*.\"779 The Tribunal therefore agrees with Claimant that Mr. Owen appears to have abandoned his specific criticism of not using the Gulf Coast Factor. In any event, the Tribunal finds Mr. Cusworth's explanation credible as to why it was more appropriate to rely on bids and estimates from local and international contractors rather than the Gulf Coast Factor, in particular taking into account the apparently undisputed absence of sufficient data for Pakistan.\n\nOwen/Dagdelen II, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n\n674.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent points to Mr. Cusworth's oral testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that \"[i]*t's very hard to get reliable productivity figures which you can rely on. They can give you an indication, but you wouldn't rely on them*.\"780 Respondent draws the conclusion that \"[w]*ith this level of uncertainty regarding the productivity of any future work force, this Tribunal must side with Pakistan and conclude that TCC did not have the detail available to reasonably estimate its ability to execute the project*.\"781\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 837 lines 19-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 119.\n\n675.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it worth recalling Mr. Cusworth's testimony on this point in more detail. In response to the question whether the distinction between what \"*can be done*\" and what \"*might be done*\" also applies to the productivity of employees, Mr. Cusworth responded as follows:\n\n\"*A. I think so, yeah. Well, let's put it this way: I couldn't see that. What I could see was a good training program, a good site culture, in terms of ensuring productivity was the best that could be done in the circumstance. I didn't see details of people doing very detailed evaluations of a particular contractor doing this piece of work, achieving this productivity. These projects, they're special.*\n\n*Q. Because these projects are special, is it difficult to predict how productive laborers might be?*\n\n*A. In countries where it's--and locations that are unique, the answer is yes. It's very hard to get reliable productivity figures which you can rely on. They can give you an indication, but you wouldn't rely on them.*\n\n*Q. Would you have considered Pakistan to be a unique location, like the one you just referenced in your prior answer?*\n\n*A. I would say so, yes. In the location, I think in around the major cities and ports, there would be a lot more capability, mainly related to infrastructure; so roads and things like that. And there's roads on Reko Diq. But putting in crushes and mills, the answer is, they've got some cement industries where there might be capability there, but as far as a single copper project put in this area, they have limited experience.*\n\n*Q. With that limited experience, would it have made it harder to keep the Project on schedule?*\n\n*A. No. Possibly the other way around. The reason is that the resources are readily available. The ability to bring people in and throw them at a bottleneck in construction would be very high; whereas, in Australia or North America, getting the people and getting them onto the job can be a lot more difficult.*\n\n*So, I would say there is some advantages.*\n\n*Q. Even though the people you would be bringing in would not have any experience in large-scale copper mining; right?*\n\n*A. If you're looking for a good carpenter's assistant, it doesn't matter. Someone putting up scaffolding or that sort of thing doesn't matter. Someone doing an instrumentation and control system for a copper project, there may be very limited supply in Pakistan, but there is good supply worldwide*.\"782\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 837 line 6 to p. 839 line 10.\n\n676.\n\nBased on the evidence in the record, including Mr. Cusworth's oral testimony, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's conclusion that Claimant was not able to prepare a reasonable estimate of the productivity of its workforce. While Mr. Cusworth indeed confirmed that it is hard to get reliable productivity figures for a place such as Reko Diq, he did not agree with Respondent that Reko Diq's location would have made it harder for the project to stay on schedule. In addition, Mr. Cusworth explained that Claimant did \"*the best that could be done in the circumstance*\" in terms of ensuring productivity and the Tribunal has not been provided with any specific argument from either Respondent or Mr. Owen as to why it should doubt that testimony. Consequently, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that a buyer would have taken a different view and/or that it would have considered the productivity estimates prepared based on the methodology explained by Mr. Cusworth inadequate.\n\n677.\n\nMr. Owen further considered the cost estimates for the construction of the plant \"*too aggressive*\" and first expressed the opinion that USD 30,000 per ton of installed capacity was low. Specifically, he noted that the capital costs for a project he had worked on in Canada had been USD 25,000 per ton of capacity and considered a premium of 20% for Reko Diq \"*low considering the location, potential manpower issues, security, and general construction costs*.\"783 Mr. Owen did not provide any support for his opinion that a cost estimate corresponding to USD 30,000 per ton of installed capacity is too low.\n\nDagdelen(Owen I, \u00b6 187.\n\n678.\n\nMr. Cusworth noted in his expert report that the Feasibility Study presents a benchmarking of capital costs of 16 \"*sufficiently similar*\" projects, which showed that Reko Diq was slightly above the average cost rate but \"*reasonably comparable in cost to similar sized remote projects*\":784\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 84.\n\n679.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Owen did not address this benchmarking exercise reported in the Feasibility Study, nor did he repeat his previous criticism regarding a cost of USD 30,000 per ton of installed capacity. The Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the cost estimate presented by Claimant was generally too low.\n\n680.\n\nIn his first report, Mr. Owen further raised the following specific criticisms: (i) pipeline cost estimate over 50% estimated from other jobs rather than qualified contractors; (ii) no CAPEX or OPEX assigned to several high risk items in the Residual Risk Assessment, specifically regarding the pipeline; (iii) no true line item for the Reverse Osmosis plant; (iv) labor estimates (which have already been addressed above); and (v) an 11% cost contingency, which Mr. Owen considered to be \"*unrealistic*\" and below the expected 15 to 20%.785\n\nDagdelen(Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 187-189.\n\n681.\n\nIn response to the criticism under (iii), Mr. Cusworth pointed out that, contrary to Mr. Owen's suggestion, the capital cost for the Reverse Osmosis plant (or rather both contemplated water treatment plants) is included in Appendix 10.5 of the Feasibility Study.786 Mr. Owen did not again refer to this point in his second report and the Tribunal therefore considers this criticism moot.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 77, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-10.05**, pp. 349, 487.\n\n682.\n\nAs for the criticism under (i), Mr. Cusworth noted that the feasibility of the pipeline had been assessed in a thorough 600-page report prepared by experts at slurry pipelines (PSI) and considered that the level of detail in this report is \"*greater than one would normally expect in a Feasibility Study*.\" Mr. Cusworth therefore expressed \"*a high level of confidence in the definition of the pipeline, the estimates of the costs associated with sourcing the materials of the construction, and associated works.*\"787\n\nCusworth, \u00b6 78, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**.\n\n683.\n\nIn response, Mr. Owen maintained that \"*pipeline security remains a concern*\"788 but did not again refer to his previous criticism that Claimant's cost estimate was not based on estimates of qualified contractors. The Tribunal notes that the aspect of pipeline security has been addressed in detail by the Parties' security experts and will form subject of a separate analysis on security aspects of the project below. Therefore, the Tribunal will not address this criticism in any further detail at this point.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.\n\n684.\n\nAs for the criticism under (v) regarding the 11% cost contingency, Mr. Cusworth explained that the amount of contingency, *i.e*., the judgment of the costs of \"*Known Unknowns*\" in an estimate, varies according to the degree of engineering design definition achieved and pointed to the varying amounts of contingency applied in the Feasibility Study for different components of the project, ranging from 5% for mining equipment to be sourced from existing fixed-price global contracts with suppliers to up to 25% for piping. In particular, Mr. Cusworth noted that the contingency for labor and pipeline material, *i.e*., 20%, was in line with what Mr. Owen had required and was, in Mr. Cusworth's opinion, \"*higher than necessary*.\"789\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 85-92, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-23**, Table 23.20.\n\n685.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Owen maintained that the project should have a higher contingency \"*due to its size, complexity, location and risks*.\" He acknowledged the \"*basic feasibility contingency calculation*\" in the Feasibility Study but considered that \"*this is only part of the calculation*.\" In his opinion, \"[t]*he second, and critical component is taking the feasibility study contingency value, a fully developed and costed risk assessment, and then use a company like ARES Risk Management \u2026 to conduct a statistical analysis utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation that provides significantly more confidence as to what the schedule timeline should be and the total cost of the project should not exceed.*\"790 Mr. Owen explained that this exercise would provide the owner with a contingency value providing a 80-90% confidence that the project should not exceed that value. According to Mr. Owen, Claimant did not fully engage in this exercise but was driven by \"*Project Advocates*\" trying to minimize the contingency in order to get board approval for the project. He then noted that the Feasibility Study actually includes a supplemental calculation of what an 85% confidence factor would add to the project, *i.e*., a \"*contingency of 105 million USD for Capex cost overruns*,\" but emphasized that the number was not included in the CAPEX.791\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 91-93, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, p. 6.\n\n686.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Owen referred to the following statement in the Feasibility Study: \"*A residual risk value of $105 000 000 has been identified, and it is recommended that TCC carry the costs as part of owner's costs. Details of the risks and calculations are provided in Section 30, Risk. The residual value has been recommended, but is not included in the CAPEX or Sustaining Capital*.\"792\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-48.\n\n687.\n\nIn Chapter 30 of the Feasibility Study, the section on \"*Residual Risk*\" states, *inter alia*, the following:\n\n\"*Based on the results of the risk review held in Toronto on October 6 and 7, 2009 the Reko Diq Project is considered to be a well thought out and low financial risk project. A review of the risk register contained in Appendix 20 will show that the major challenges for the project reside in the areas of Security, Community Relations and Human Resources.*\n\n*The residual risk for the project CAPEX has been calculated taking into account all of the threats identified and reviewed during this phase and the PFS using a statistical Monte Carlo approach. It is recommended that a risk allowance of $105 M be added to the IMD estimate to account for risk which may materialize between now and commissioning. This compares very favourably with the figure of $135 M which was recommended following at the end of the PFS*.\"793\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-30**, p. 30-14.\n\n688.\n\nAppendix 20.01 containing the \"*Residual Risk Assessment*\" presents in the section on \"*Capex Residual Risk*\" a figure comprising \"*the distributions of all Monte Carlo outcomes*\" as well as a figure representing \"*the risk allowance required for any desired level of confidence that the risk allowance will not be exceeded*.\" It then provides a table summarizing the Capex risk allowance required for different levels of confidence:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Mean | P70 | P75 | P80 | P85 |\n| All Threats | $79M | $84M | $89M | $96M | $105M |\n\n689.\n\nFinally, Appendix 20.01 recommends \"*that a Risk Allowance of $105M be added to the Capex estimate, which will give an 85% probability of not exceeding the budget*.\"794\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, p. 7.\n\n690.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as specifically stated in Chapter 30 and Appendix 20.01, \"[t]*he residual risk for the project Capex has been calculated taking into account all of the threats identified and reviewed during this phase and the Pre-Feasibility study using a statistical Monte Carlo approach*\"795 and thus in line with what Mr. Owen considered to be the \"*critical component*\" of a contingency calculation. However, as pointed out by Mr. Owen, Chapter 23 states that the residual risk value of USD 105 million was \"*recommended, but is not included in the CAPEX or sustaining capital.*\"796\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, pp. 1-2.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-48.\n\n691.\n\nClaimant argues that the residual risk value is not a missing contingency but rather a measure of the Project's sensitivity to capital cost overruns.797 In any event, Claimant submits that \"*this residual risk value of US$ 105 million was derived from the same Risk Register that Prof. Davis fed into his model. Prof. Davis, however, made even more conservative assumptions about those risks than those made by the TCC team at the time of the Feasibility Study and then incorporated those more conservative assumptions into the valuation he has presented. Thus, even if Pakistan could establish that TCC's work was inadequate, which it cannot, this could not possibly have any effect on the valuation presented by TCCA*.\"798\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92.\n\n692.\n\nMr. Cusworth testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the USD 105 million does not form part of the Capex or sustaining capital but \"*will be in the supplemental overrun facility that the companies will approve on the investment decision point.*\" He confirmed that the decision about whether or not to assume the risk of this USD 105 million would be made at the investment decision point: \"*Correct, which is standard practice if you go to BHP or Rio or any of the big mining companies. This is the way they handle these sorts of things in their investment decisions*.\"799\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 850 lines 4-13.\n\n693.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the question whether Claimant should have included the residual risk value in its contingency or whether that amount would have had to be approved separately at the point of making the investment decision is not decisive at this point. In any event, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that a buyer would have considered the calculation of the residual risk value relevant and would have factored it into its calculation of the purchase price it would have been willing to pay.\n\n694.\n\nThe Tribunal understands both from Claimant's submission and from Prof. Davis' explanations in his second report that he did not directly include the USD 105 million residual risk value in his valuation model. Rather, he looked at the risks in the risk register on which the calculation of the residual risk value was based, formed his own assumptions as to the appropriate adjustments for these risks and then included these assumptions in his valuation model.\n\n695.\n\nProf. Davis noted in his second report that the 11% contingency presented in the Feasibility Study was intended to account only for \"*items which are included in the scope of work, but which cannot be adequately defined at this time due to lack of accurate detailed design information*.\" It was \"*not intended to cover such items as labour disputes, changes in scope or price escalation*.\"800 In Prof. Davis' opinion, the 15-20% contingency that Mr. Owen would have considered adequate is therefore not comparable to the 11% figure. In any event, he noted that Mr. Owen did not address Prof. Davis' estimate of capital costs, \"*which reflects substantial additional adjustments relative to the numbers in the feasibility study for cost escalation and delays*.\"801 Prof. Davis explained that while feasibility studies typically estimate capital costs without allowance for future cost increases, all of the potential causes of cost overruns (including inflation caused by delays) are reflected in his model, resulting in a capital cost estimate which is 58% higher than in the Feasibility Study and therefore well above the figures that Mr. Owen as well as Respondent's valuation experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered necessary.802 Specifically with regard to the cost increases he estimated in order to account for risks identified in Claimant's residual risk register, Prof. Davis explained:\n\n\"*I further increased capital costs to account for asymmetric risks evaluated by TCC in its residual risk register that, if realized, would result in cost overruns relative to those initial estimates. My research, which Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells cite, shows that the effect of these risk factors on cost overruns is typically small for large projects, and this is the case here. A possible explanation for this is that large projects are more flexible, making it easier for managers to take mitigating actions to control budgets and overruns. Large projects are also more subject to scrutiny. Certainly, TCC's residual risk analysis is consistent with this: Reko Diq is a large project which was subjected to extensive engineering work and scrutiny. Therefore, I would not expect significant overruns arising from residual risks and due to imprecision in capital cost estimates*.\"803\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 161, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-577-23**, Section 23.11. The same statement is included in **Exhibit RE-576-23**, Section 23.11.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 155, 160, 163.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 159.\n\n696.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by Prof. Davis, neither Mr. Owen nor Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells raised specific criticisms regarding the adjustments made by Prof. Davis to the capital cost estimate of the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. In particular, they did not raise the allegation that either the 11% contingency or the residual risk value of USD 105 million would not be adequately reflected in the 58% capital cost increase included by Prof. Davis in his valuation model. In the absence of any specific criticism regarding the contingency and residual risk value accounted for by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal sees no basis for a finding that Prof. Davis has not sufficiently accounted for them in his valuation.\n\n697.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen also suggests that the Monte Carlo simulation was not done properly and that a \"*better developed*\" risk assessment would have resulted in a higher amount than USD 105 million.804 However, in light of the fact that the Feasibility Study does make reference to \"*using a statistical Monte Carlo approach*,\"805 the Tribunal considers that a more specific explanation would have been necessary in order to cast into doubt the adequacy of the methodology used by Claimant and SNC Lavalin in the residual risk assessment. In any event, the fact remains that Mr. Owen did not express any opinion on the additional risk adjustments included by Prof. Davis in the valuation that forms the basis for the claim raised by Claimant in this arbitration.\n\nDagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6 95.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-30**, p. 30-14.\n\n698.\n\nFinally, Mr. Owen raised as criticism (ii) that the residual risk register included risks to which Claimant had assigned no CAPEX or OPEX impact, in particular with regard to the pipeline. Mr. Cusworth responded to this criticism by pointing out that out of seven identified risks relating to the pipeline, there were only four such items without an assigned CAPEX or OPEX impact and considered that these \"*would not have any quantifiable financial impact on the project*\" as they relate to either community or health and safety where financial impact is either difficult to quantify (reputational damage) or financially insignificant. He therefore concluded that \"*the treatment of risk has been addressed in accordance with good practice across the project, particularly for the pipeline*.\"806 In addition, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis analyzed each of the previously unquantified risks and either placed them in one of the three risk categories he identified for his valuation or rated them as \"*not material*.\"807 This approach will be discussed in further detail in the Tribunal's assessment of whether it is convinced that Prof. Davis has adequately accounted for all risks affecting the project in his valuation model. At this point, it suffices to note that Mr. Owen again did not address the adjustments for risk made by Prof. Davis but only focused on the Feasibility Study. Consequently, even if his criticism were accurate and Claimant inadequately failed to assign an impact to these risks, the Tribunal still has no basis for a finding that Prof. Davis inadequately accounted for these risks.\n\nCusworth, \u00b6\u00b6 93-95, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**.\n\n*Cf*. Davis I, Workpaper 27.\n\n699.\n\nAs a final note, the Tribunal has taken note of Mr. Owen's repeated argument that the project was pushed forward by \"*Project Advocates*\" who were trying to get board approval by including unrealistic assumptions in the Feasibility Study.808 During the Hearing, Mr. Owen also used the expression that Claimant and its owners did not have their \"*eye on the ball*\" because \"*SNC* [Lavalin] *was running this whole show*.\"809 The Tribunal is not convinced by either of these arguments but in fact considers them contradicted, *inter alia*, by Respondent's own submissions. As noted at the beginning of this section, Respondent specifically recognized that Claimant had \"*full teams from both owners*\" working on and supervising the Feasibility Study.\"810 Mr. Owen noted that \"*it normally requires 10-12 people to prepare a feasibility stud. The IMD FS had 23 people from TCC, showing that Barrick and Antofagasta each wanted their own pair of eyes on everything*.\"811 Mr. Livesey also testified as to the structure subject to whose supervision the Feasibility Study was prepared.\n\n*See* Dagdelen/Owen II, \u00b6\u00b6 92-94, 106, 111; Dagdelen/Owen Presentation, pp. 24, 27, 31.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), pp. 1092-1094.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 112.\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 208.\n\n700.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Barrick and Antofagasta's attention to the Feasibility Study appears entirely reasonable given the large amounts of equity that Barrick and Antofagasta were planning to invest in the project. At the same time, the Tribunal does not find it credible that these \"*full teams*\" comprised only what Mr. Owen referred to as \"*Project Advocates*,\" who were allegedly willing to ignore substantial risks in order to get the project approved. The Tribunal also notes that, in addition to Claimant and its owners, the Feasibility Study was reviewed by numerous third-party consultants, several of which have appeared as experts before this Tribunal and, as will be set out in more detail below, have provided convincing explanations on individual aspects of the project that were criticized by Respondent and its experts.\n\n701.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore cannot follow Mr. Owen's argument but wishes to emphasize that its impression is quite to the contrary, *i.e*., that Barrick and Antofagasta were significantly involved in the preparation of the Feasibility Study and had every interest to prepare a thorough Feasibility Study including plans on project execution and appropriate cost estimates accouting for the relevant risks affecting the project. Also taking into account that Prof. Davis made additional risk adjustments in his valuation model which were not criticized by Mr. Owen, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to believe that Claimant's plans for executing the project and the capital cost estimate, as adjusted by Prof. Davis, would have been considered inadequate by a buyer in November 2011.\n\n**5. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for the Supply of Water to the Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's arguments on water ignore the Tribunal's findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that \"*Claimant did make a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for the project*\" and that its alleged failure to do so did \"*not present a justifiable basis for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application*.\"812\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 487-488, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1258, 1263.\n\n703.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent relies on a single phrase in the executive summary of the 2007 Scoping Study Report observing that the improper or incomplete identification of a water supply can become a \"*kill point*\" for a mining project. Claimant maintains, however, that after the Scoping Study, it performed \"*an enormous amount of work to satisfy itself that it had sufficient water for the project*\" and to eliminate the risk that existed in 2007.813 Claimant refers to its expert Mr. Mayer, Barrick's senior hydrogeologist during the relevant time period, who testified that Claimant and its owners were \"*confident that TCC could supply enough water to sustain mining at Reko Diq*\" for the life of the mine. In this regard, Claimant notes that it had identified: (i) an aquifer that was \"*not only an abundant source of water but which could be utilized without any significant effect on surrounding communities*\"; (ii) three backup sources; and (iii) the possibility to build a sea water pipeline.814\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 489-490, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-153**, p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 490, *quoting from* Mayer, \u00b6 27.\n\n704.\n\nClaimant further claims that any residual risk that remained as of November 2011 has been accounted for by Prof. Davis and refers in particular to the following risks: (i) \"*Draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project needs*\"; (ii) production interruptions and/or additional expenses caused by the available water resource being \"*insufficient to supply operating requirements*\"; (iii) water usage at one of the alternative sources \"*causes drawdowns that impact locals... resulting in negative perceptions re. the project and additional compensation costs*\"; and (iv) a lender would require Claimant to engage in cross border consultation with either Afghanistan or Iran.815\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 491, *quoting from* Davis I, Workpaper 26.\n\n705.\n\nClaimant submits that its assessment of the groundwater sources in the Feasibility Study drew on the experience of hydrologists employed by both owners, such as Mr. Mayer, as well as several outside consultants, such as Dr. Drury of SMEC and Mr. Jones of John Shomaker and Associates, Inc. (JSAI), who prepared numerous reports several of which were appended to the Feasibility Study and have appeared as experts in this arbitration.816 Claimant explains that while it initially investigated eight potential water sources, it narrowed them down to four in the Pre-Feasibility water study and ultimately decided to focus on one primary source, *i.e.*, the Fan Sediments, because the water is brackish, not potable, not suitable for irrigation and not even suitable for making cement without treatment, which would have rendered Claimant to be \"*virtually the only entity pumping water from this source*\" and outweighed \"*less favorable characteristics, such as the high mineral content and the distance from the site*.\" At the same time, Claimant notes that it continued to perform feasibility-level studies for the three alternative water sources all of which were confirmed by SMEC to be viable options to supplement the Fan Sediments.817\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 492-493.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 494-496, 506.\n\n706.\n\nClaimant submits that in order to obtain information about the extent of the Fan Sediments as well as its capacity to store and release groundwater, SMEC performed a 21-day pumping test during which it extracted a total of 200,000 cubic meters of water, which corresponds to 4% of the water demand for the construction phase. According to Claimant, this test exceeded typical pump-out tests which usually take place over three to seven days and allowed SMEC to sufficiently stress the system to test for any barriers to the flow of water and to monitor the groundwater-level decline as well as its recovery to the previous level after the pump-out, which was completed within 21 days.818 Claimant explains that based on the data obtained during this pump-out test, JSAI developed a groundwater flow model, which created a detailed reconstruction of the Fan Sediments and aimed at predicting the behavior of the aquifer over the life of the mine, showing that there was sufficient water to meet the demands of the project, including in the expansion scenario. Claimant further notes that both the JSAI model and the SMEC Water Resource Assessment were subject to peer review by Mr. Mayer and independent consultants from Douglas Partners who concluded that \"[g]*roundwater investigations outlined in SMEC (2009) are comprehensive and have been undertaken to a high standard*\" and that\"[t]*he conclusions and recommendations outlined therein are reasonable and can be supported*.\"819\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 497-500.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 501-504, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1221**, p. 8.\n\n707.\n\nClaimant rejects the criticisms raised by Respondent regarding SMEC's drilling and pump-out tests and refers to the explanations provided by Dr. Drury regarding the team's equipment and experience as well as certain problems noted by SMEC, which are typical for drilling projects and did not affect the final results.820 Claimant also refers to Dr. Drury's explanation regarding the depth of the drilling, which covered the extent by which the water level would be lowered pursuant to the JSAI model, and SMEC's additional reliance on a geophysical survey which allowed it to make a reasonable estimate regarding the aquifer's geology.821 Claimant further rejects the argument that the boreholes drilled by SMEC did not provide the yield required for Reko Diq and argues that pumping efficiency would have increased significantly by using more efficient pumps and fully \"*screening*\" the borehole.822 Finally, Claimant acknowledges that SMEC noted in its Water Resources Assessment that it was not able to perform test work across the border in Afghanistan but emphasizes that SMEC was able to obtain relevant information from a geological survey as well as satellite images.823 Claimant concludes that while it would have continued to monitor and study the Fan Sediments, it had \"*more than enough information to make an informed investment decision*\", and refers to Mr. Mayer who stated in his expert report:\n\n\"*SMEC has identified a small number of additional studies and monitoring to add to the understanding of the Fan Sediments aquifer and to optimize the production bore-field design. The practice of providing this type of advice is common and consistent with other studies I have completed. Additional information is always helpful, but there is a threshold at which a water study becomes sufficient to make a feasibility determination. Our studies were more than adequate to meet that threshold. We had contracted with experts at the top of their field, conducted rigorous pump-out tests, and studied multiple groundwater sources over a period of three years*.\"824\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 510-512, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 228, 50, 40.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 513-514, *referring to* Drury, Table 2 and \u00b6\u00b6 88(v), 95, 102, 58, 207.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 515-517, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 217-219, 201-203, 184.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 518-519, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-410**, Chapter 1-2, \u00b6 1.1 *and* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 108.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 520-521, *quoting from* Mayer, \u00b6 100.\n\n708.\n\nClaimant further rejects the contention raised by Respondent and its experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen regarding the project's water needs based on a \"*standard rate*\" of one cubic meter of water per one tonne of material being processed. Claimant notes that they do not cite any authority for this \"*standard rate*\" and ignore the fact that Claimant had designed a \"*highly efficient metallurgical process where a large amount of water from the tailings slurry would be recovered and returned for use in the process plant*.\"825 Claimant refers to the explanations provided by Mr. Mayer regarding the contemplated process as well as the amount of water used for the flotation process and the transportation of slurry to Port Gwadar. It also quotes his testimony that \"*Pakistan's recommended approach would unnecessarily increase capital and operating costs for water and tailings management, and would be irresponsible socially and environmentally. Designing a plant with Pakistan's proposed level of water demand would result in an immense waste of water and of other resources used for flotation and tailings processing. \u2026 Some mines took this approach prior to the incorporation of thickeners and efficient tailings management practices.

Claimant submits that while sand and gravel have a porosity of 30%, SMEC conservatively assumed a porosity of 20% to account for the fact that the Fan Sediments also contain silty clays.828 Claimant also emphasizes that it did not rely on SMEC's \"rough estimate\" of the total volume of water but rather on the detailed groundwater model incorporating the entire available data from surveys and the pump-out test. By contrast, Claimant notes that the storage coefficients obtained during the pump-out test, while being consistent with a short-term pumping from a confined aquifer layer, did not show the amount of water that can be extracted during long-term pumping of a complex aquifer system.829\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 534-535, *quoting from* Jones, \u00b6 74.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 536-537, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 177-180.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 539-542.\n\n710.\n\nClaimant also rejects Respondent's criticisms regarding the modeling of the size and shape of the Fan Sediments created by JSAI. Claimant refers to the explanations provided by its experts Dr. Drury and Mr. Jones as to how they determined that: (i) the ground water flows in northeastern direction from the Iranian side of the border across Pakistan towards the Afghanistan side of the border and there is in any event no impact on the Iranian hydrogeological systems;830 (ii) the estimated amount of recharge of the aquifer is based on rainfall occurring in the form of large torrential storms generating large surface water runoffs flowing into the Fan Sediments, as confirmed by Balochistan in its own Feasibility Study of the Fan Sediments in 2012, and the average annual rainfall estimated by JSAI is adequate for the elevation of the relevant site;831 (iii) there is no evidence that climate change would negatively affect Claimant's ability to obtain water but, to the contrary, increased temperatures would likely increase the energy available to generate large storms;832 and (iv) the model uses time-variant calibration based on data from the pump-out tests as set out in JSAI's final report and SMEC's 2010 Water Resources Assessment.833\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 543-557, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 104-164, *and* Jones, \u00b6\u00b6 23-40.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 558-569, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 129, 132, 154-160, *and* Jones, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 54-56, 60-64, 69, 129, 143.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 570-571, *referring to* Jones, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 572-573, *referring to* Jones, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 84-85, *and* **Exhibits CE-1334**, \u00b6 3.3.3 and **CE-1337**, \u00b6 5.\n\n711.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant contends that \"[a]*ll four hydrogeological experts agreed that the Fan Sediments would have supplied sufficient water for the operation of the mine*\" and refers in particular to the oral testimony of Respondent's expert Mr. Neville who stated that he had \"*no doubt that the volume of water they need is there in the sediments*\" and added that Claimant had \"*certainly done a good way of showing that*.\"834 Claimant further quotes from: (i) its expert Dr. Drury who testified that the Fan Sediments aquifer \"*is very extensive*\" and could \"*supply a sustainable groundwater supply to* [the] *Reko Diq mine*\"; (ii) its expert Mr. Jones who explained that Claimant's pumping would have reduced the saturated thickness of the aquifer by \"*only a small fraction of* [its] *total saturated thickness*\" and that it was therefore \"*obvious*\" that there was \"*water available for the Project*\" in the Fan Sediments; and (iii) its expert Mr. Mayer who explained that \"*the volume of water the project needs to extract is very small compared to the amount of water available*\" and concluded that \"*there's plenty of water supply for the project*.\"835\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1716.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 95-97, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), pp. 1342, 1422-1423, p. 1447 and pp. 1498, 1508.\n\n712.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the only remaining issue in dispute between the Parties' experts is therefore the extent of any drawdown across the Afghan border that would result from the pumping of water from the Fan Sediments. More specifically, Claimant notes that the different projections of the Parties' experts result from the different \"*specific yields*\" they assumed. Claimant agrees with Mr. Neville that the specific yield is the \"*ratio of the volume of water released to the volume of the porous medium*\" in an unconfined aquifer.836 Claimant notes that Mr. Jones' model on which the Feasibility Study is based assumed a specific yield of 0.15 and results, in both the expansion and the non-expansion scenarios, in a predicted drawdown at the Afghan border of 3 meters and a maximum drawdown of 5 meters that would occur \"*about 20 to 30 years after the end of mining*.\"837 According to Claimant, the accuracy of Mr. Jones' calculation when using a 0.15 specific yield was confirmed by Mr. Neville in his expert report.838\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 98-100, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1600.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 101, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1334**, p. A-4 and Figures 2.1, 3.1 *and quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1438.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102, *referring to* Neville, pp. 65, 66 and 69.\n\n713.\n\nAs for Mr. Neville's application of a specific yield of 0.02, which results in a 3-meter drawndown contour extending more than 25 kilometers into Afghanistan and a 10-meter drawdown contour extending about 5 kilometers into Afghanistan, Claimant considers it conceded by Mr. Neville that he had applied this specific yield in order to \"e *xaggerate what* [the impacts] *might be*\" and that \"*if we're going to be wrong, we should be wrong on the side of caution*.\"839 In Claimant's view, the specific yield of 0.02 for clay is \"*grossly exaggerated*\" because: (i) the Fan Sediments are not entirely composed of clay but there are significant layers of sand and gravel which have a specific yield that is 6 to 20 times higher than that assumed by Mr. Neville; (ii) there is no continuous plate of clay but rather separate clay lenses interspersed with much coarser sediments of sand and gravel within which the water would cave moved vertically past the clay lenses; and (iii) the clay lenses would have drained more slowly than the sand and gravel sediments but they would have drained eventually and at a faster rate than assumed by Mr. Neville because over the long term, the specific yield of clay can vary significantly and be up to 0.18.840\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1716, 1709.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 104-109.\n\n714.\n\nClaimant therefore maintains that the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones is more accurate and was selected based on his review of the gamma logs and on-site review of the drilling cores. According to Claimant, the projected impact of the drawdown across the Afghan border would therefore have been \"*minimal and occurred only decades after the start of the project*.\"841 Claimant also notes that there would not have been any drawdown in Iran due to the direction of the ground water flow and satellite imagery showing that users in Iran use water supplied by a different water source.842\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 577-578.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 575-576.\n\n715.\n\nIn any event, Claimant rejects the submission that any such drawdown across the Afghan border would have halted or delayed the Reko Diq project due to an obligation of Pakistan to notify Afghanistan under the UN Watercourses Convention. Claimant notes that Afghanistan and Pakistan are not party to the UN Watercourses Convention and argues that its principles do not bind the countries as customary international law as demonstrated by the lack of evidence that Pakistan has ever provided Afghanistan with a notification of any project utilizing a shared watercourse. Claimant further argues that Pakistan has also not provided any evidence of giving such notification to Iran with regard to the Saindak mine even though the project has lowered the water level by at least 6.5 meters over the last 15 years and, by contrast to the water from the Fan Sediments, the water there is potable and supplies water to a large number of farm users in Iran.843\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 113-118; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 579.\n\n716.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the use of the Fan Sediments for the Reko Diq project would in any event be equitable and reasonable in the sense of Article 6 of the UN Watercourse Convention and not cause any harm to Afghanistan given that there are \"*virtually no users in the area*\" and the brackish water is not potable and cannot be used for animals or irrigation. By contrast, Claimant argues that the socio-economic advantages for Pakistan would have been \"*overwhelming*\" given that the Reko Diq project would have created \"*thousands of direct and indirect jobs and made significant contributions to the finances of Pakistan and Balochistan*.\"844 As the water is not fit for human consumption or agriculture and the Fan Sediments are located in an isolated area with no competing users, Claimant also considers that there is no basis for the argument that there would be significant local opposition to its use of the aquifer.845\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 119-121.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 580-582.\n\n717.\n\nIn addition, Claimant claims that even if significant harm had been created by using the Fan Sediments, such harm could have been avoided or at least \"*significantly mitigated*\" by monitoring the groundwater levels at the Fan Sediments and, if the decrease approached the Afghan border, developing a mitigation system such as aquifer injections. According to Claimant, there would have been \"*ample time*\" to develop such a mitigation system as the drawdown would have occurred only \"*many years*\" after the start of operations of the mine. Claimant refers to Mr. Drury who testified that aquifer injections are regularly used and generally successful, provided that the system is properly maintained, and estimated that the costs would be \"*in the tens of millions*.\"846\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 122, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1355-1356, 1713 and 1720.\n\n718.\n\nClaimant further submits that in order to avoid or mitigate harm and \"*although more costly than a water injection system*,\" it could also have used water from one of the other three water sources that had been tested to feasibility level or, in the alternative, pumped seawater from Port Gwadar to the mine.847 Claimant rejects the allegation that it did not fully test the alternative water sources and refers to Dr. Drury's explanations regarding the tests performed by SMEC on each of these alternative sources.848 Claimant also refers to Mr. Mayer's testimony regarding the option to build a seawater pipeline, which has become more common in Chile and which was costed as an option early in Reko Diq's development.849\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 583-588, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 24-30, 50-56, 120, 260.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 589-590, *referring to* Mayer, \u00b6\u00b6 103-110.\n\n719.\n\nFinally, Claimant notes that it is undisputed that under the UN Watercourse Convention, Afghanistan would not have had the right to veto or otherwise derail the project and refers to Dr. Nanni, who confirmed that \"[t]*here is no veto power in international law*.\"850\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1701.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n720.\n\nRespondent submits that \"[w]*ater was a big concern for TCC*\" and was identified in the Risk Assessment Report prepared by Behre Dolbear in October 2007 as the \"*most critical*\" limitation of the project. Respondent emphasizes that the quantities of water needed for the construction and operation of the project would be equal to the level of daily water consumption of approximately 500,000 people and thus significantly exceed the quantities needed by other mining projects in the region, including Saindak.851 Respondent also points to the additional risks identified in Claimant's Risk Register, which confirms in its view that Claimant was aware that \"*the availability of and right to use water could doom the entire project*.\"852\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 134, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-130**, \u00b6 2.3.1.2; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 218, 221.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 218, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n721.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant \"*fell far short of proving the size of the aquifer, its plans for mitigation, and the effects of its plans on surrounding areas and countries*.\" Specifically, Respondent contends that Claimant's expert Dr. Drury acknowledged during his cross-examination that the Fan Sediments would most likely not have provided enough water for Reko Diq.853 Respondent also points out that SMEC identified \"*key issues*\" that needed to be further addressed in developing the Fan Sediments, such as the water level drawdown across the Afghan border, the tribal No-Objection Certificates (the \"**NOC**\") and the depth to bedrock at the Afghan border, and called for additional studies, warning that the \"*hydrogeological assessment of the Fan Sediments Aquifer needs to be treated with caution*.\"854 Respondent alleges that Claimant, however, abandoned many of SMEC's recommendations and pursued the development of the Fan Sediments even though they had ranked only third in Dr. Drury's assessment as they were further away from Reko Diq and less economically efficient than the other two water sources.855\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 134, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 67 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1384 lines 12-18.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 239, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-24.03** *and quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-24.04**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 135; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 234.\n\n722.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant failed to confirm the viability of the Fan Sediments aquifer. It emphasizes that \"*Pakistan is not taking issue with the tests done but rather the interpretation of the results*.\"856 In Respondent's view, SMEC committed \"*basic errors in analyzing their own samples*,\" which instead show that there was \"*far from sufficient water, even for construction*.\" According to Respondent, SMEC: (i) miscalculated and failed to actually test the available recharge as there is in fact little to no recharge to surface and groundwater sources in the region, with climate change exacerbating water scarcity; (ii) came up with the wrong size and shape of the aquifer because it did not drill to the required depths to identify the boundaries of the aquifer and failed to carry out a time-variant calibration; (iii) doubled the output of the aquifer; and (iv) ignored the transnational impacts of draining an aquifer shared by Afghanistan and Iran, inter alia, by assuming an incorrect water flow ignoring that the Fan Sediments extend into Iran and Afghanistan.857\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 223.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 219-220, 232-238.\n\n723.\n\nRespondent submits that the boreholes drilled by SMEC revealed a storage coefficient ranging from.0002 to.0006, which it considers \"*reasonable*\" for a dry desert area with no visible groundwater. According to Respondent, however, SMEC then applied a storage coefficient of.2 when calculating the entirey of the Fan Sediments as if they were located besides a large river. Respondent claims that when applying the correct storage coefficient, \"*the size of the aquifer drops dramatically, showing there is roughly enough water to merely construct the mine, only if TCC had drained the entire aquifer*.\" In Respondent's view, this error, as a result of which the amount of water was deficient by a factor of 100, would have been \"*obvious*\" to any buyer or financier.858\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 221-224, 230.\n\n724.\n\nRespondent also contends that none of the boreholes drilled provided the yield of liters per second required during construction or operation of the mine.859 In response to Claimant's reference to the 21-day pump-out test conducted by SMEC, Respondent refers to its expert Mr. Neville who testified that the test only demonstrated that \"*three wells within the study area* [could] *be pumped for 21 days at a cumulative rate of 70-liters-per-second*,\" *i.e.,* a fraction of Claimant's overall water demand, which was over 10,000 times higher over the life of the mine, and of the pumping rate, which was to be 20 times higher during the operations of the mine. Respondent therefore contends that \"[g]*iven these differences, TCC could not possibly have predicted the aquifer's viability after such a cursory test*.\" In its view, \"[t]*he inadequacy of these tests is apparent*\" when considering the scale of the plans in the Feasibility Study.860\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 229.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 137, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1581 lines 12-15 *and referring to* Neville, p. 3; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 225-227.\n\n725.\n\nRespondent argues that the 21-day test might have been sufficient \"*in a simpler setting with different materials*\" but Claimant's experts admitted that in this case the test failed to identify the aquifer's specific yield and therefore required Mr. Jones to guess a key parameter in his model, leading him to create a \"*one-sided and overly optimistic projection of the water supply*.\" In addition, Respondent claims that Mr. Jones incorrectly assumed that the aquifer was unconfined and thereby assumed that much more water was available for extraction, arbitrarily reducing the projected impact on the groundwater levels by a factor of 1,000.861 Quoting from its expert Mr. Neville, Respondent contends that in the absence of sufficient data provided by the pump-out tests, \"*the results of the Shomaker (2009) groundwater model are speculative*.\"862\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 138-140, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1400 lines 5-7 and p. 1441 lines 9-13; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 224.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 231, *quoting from* Neville, p. 4. *See also* \u00b6 240.\n\n726.\n\nRespondent points out that SMEC's conclusion based on these tests was only that \"*long-term extraction of large volumes of water may be possible*\" and that \"*the Fan Sediments may be a reasonable option to consider for water supply to Reko Diq*,\" but that more information was needed. Pointing to SMEC's statement that \"[c]*ontinuous pumping \u2026 during the three years construction phase will add substantial information about the sustainability of this aquifer system*,\" Respondent takes the position that obtaining sufficient information only halfway through construction was \"*deeply inadequate*.\"863 In Respondent's view, the Feasibility Study also does not affirmatively state that the Fan Sediments could sustain the necessary level of pumping but the only statement to this effect is made by Dr. Drury in his expert report, without providing evidence that the 21-day test results were sufficient.864\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 228, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-24.03**, pp. 5-1 and 5-9.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 229-230, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6 211.\n\n727.\n\nIn any event, Respondent notes that it was not sufficient to establish the existence of water. Claimant's analysis should have accounted for the exigencies of the area and determine the amount of extractable water. Respondent notes that the conclusions drawn by Mr. Jones in his expert report that the Fan Sediments could sustain the required levels of pumping were not included in the 2009 Shomaker Report, which only provided the results of his model simulations.865 In addition, Respondent maintains that Claimant adopted an \"*unscientific, generic approach that lead to increased levels of uncertainty*\" in particular with regard to the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones, which was based on his view that the upper layers of the aquifer were made up of \"*a lot of sand and gravel*,\" wich has a \"*standard literate value*\" of 15%.866 However, Respondent refers to its expert Mr. Neville who reviewed the bore logs in the SMEC report and reached the conclusion that the upper layers of the aquifer were primarily \"*clayey*\" and noted that clay materials have a specific yield of 2% according to the US Geological Survey. Respondent submits that on that basis, Mr. Neville concluded that the specific yield was closer to 2% as the existence of clay reduces the specific yield on an exponential basis.867\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 237, *referring to* Jones, \u00b6 13 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-24.04**, p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1442 lines 13-15 and p. 1458 lines 5-7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 143, *referring to* Neville, pp. 60-64 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1545-1546, 1607; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 238, 248.\n\n728.\n\nRespondent notes that Mr. Jones did not dispute the specific yield of clay or the existence of clay in the upper layers of aquifer and considers Mr. Jones' position that clay yields more water over time to be only an \"*unsupported opinion*.\" According to Respondent, the average 2% specific yield in the US Geological Survey is based on long-term tests and Mr. Jones in any event did not include a time scale for the specific yield in his model or expert report.868 Respondent rejects Mr. Jones' position that the mixture of clay and gravel produces a \"*normal specific yield*\" of 15% and also rejects Mr. Jones and Dr. Drury's reference to gamma logs for identifying the amount of clay in the sediments, arguing that no gamma readings were taken of the three bore holes pumped during the 21-day test.869\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 144, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1442 lines 17-19 and p. 1448 lines 2-7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 145-147, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1442 lines 11-13 and referring to p. 1353 lines 11-14, p. 1442 line 15 and p. 1459 line 7.\n\n729.\n\nRespondent refers to Mr. Neville's demonstration that a specific yield of 2% leads undisputedly to a much larger drawdown in Afghanistan, which extends approximately 30 kilometers over the border based on Mr. Jones' model. According to Respondent, this must have been known to Claimant given that SMEC had advised Claimant in its reports to conduct assessments in Afghanistan.870 In addition to the drawdown, Respondent contends that a lower specific yield also increases CAPEX for purchase of additional pumps and OPEX for maintenance and it requires Claimant to seek water at its other potential sources, involving new permits, CAPEX and OPEX, and other communities from whom Claimant would have to obtain a social license to operate. Respondent claims that none of these issues are accounted for in the contingency calculations or other parts of the Feasibility Study.871\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 148-149, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1599 lines 3-4 and (Day 5), p. 1537 lines 17-22 and p. 1461 lines 2-4, Neville, pp. 66-67 *and* **Exhibits RE-722**, p. 116 and **RE-576-24.03**, p.

Respondent notes that contrary to SMEC's recommendation, no visits or assessments were ever conducted in Afghanistan and refers to Mr. Mayer's testimony that the process \"*was never started*.\"877 Respondent further contends that given the already tense relationship with Afghanistan over the border, local authorities would not have allowed pumping from the Fan Sediments, which was, according to Respondent, one of the primary reasons that SMEC had ranked them only third in its report.878 At the very least, Respondent submits that the process would likely have involved \"lengthy negotiations\" leading to delays in using the Fan Sediments and claims that this risk was \"largely ignored\" by Claimant.879\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 154-155, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1506 line 4.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 156, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-24.03**, p. ES-9.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 241.\n\n733.\n\nRespondent also maintains its allegation that Claimant underestimated the project's water needs and its reference to the standard rate of water needed to process raw material of approximately 1 cubic meter of water per 1 ton of material processed, which would more than double the water need predicted in the Feasibility Study. In support of this allegation, Respondent refers to the estimates in the US Geological Survey which it describes as \"*widely accepted guidelines*\" and considers that Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen's one-to-one ratio is conservative against this background.880 In response to Claimant's emphasis on the process it planned to use for recovering water, Respondent considers it \"*striking*\" that Claimant did not provide insight on the amount of water saved and further questions whether there would be an overall net recovery of water given that studies revealed a reduction of the overall water demand by only 3% and concluded that Claimant's \"*estimated* [water] *returns from Reko Diq are consistent with the returns from other sites*.\"881\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 241-243, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6 192 *and* **Exhibit RE-727**, p. 3; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 255.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 244-247, *quoting from* **Exhibits RE-576-28.28**, p. 3 *and* **RE-576-28.13**, p. 2.\n\n734.\n\nRespondent further argues that any buyer would have expected alternatives to the Fan Sediments and maintains that Claimant \"*was not ready with suitable alternatives*.\" Respondent acknowledges that Claimant explored four alternative groundwater sources as part of its mitigation strategy but considers that this was insufficient to surmount the risks associated with using the Fan Sediments as the primary water source. In its view, Mr. Mayer confirmed in his oral testimony that he chose on behalf of Claimant to develop the Fan Sediments as the only source of water, despite the recommendation of Dr. Drury to develop at least two other water sources to augment the Fan Sediments. Respondent further notes that the Feasibility Study does not include mitigation measures and in particular did not discuss, test or cost aquifer injection even though Dr. Drury had recommended that it be investigated.882 In this regard, Respondent notes that the ability to re-inject water depended on having the necessary amount of water available and maintains that given the \"*grave errors*\" in SMEC's calculation of the volume of water, this mitigation measure was \"*practically impossible*.\" In any event, Respondent considers that re-injection would also have involved transboundary issues and necessitated contacting the Afghan authorities, which as Mr. Livesey admitted was not done.883\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1502 lines 10-18 and p. 1359 lines 10-11 *and* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 67; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 250; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 244-245, 247.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 246, referring to Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), pp. 1339-1341.\n\n735.\n\nRespondent further acknowledges that Dr. Drury described two of the other water sources as \"*very well-known*\" and \"*a very good water supply,*\" respectively, but considers that he did not confirm that the other water sources were assessed to a feasibility level or that they could supply enough water to Reko Diq to compensate the Fan Sediments.884 According to Respondent, the conclusions drawn by Dr. Drury in his expert report are not supported by SMEC's conclusions in its Water Resources Assessment Report, which did not assess the long-term effects of pumping water at high volumes at any of these alternative sources.885\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 161, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1385 line 16 and p. 1386 lines 20-21.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 251-253, *referring to* Drury, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54-55 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-24.03**, pp. 4-7, 4-14 *and* Table ES-1; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 250.\n\n736.\n\nRespondent points out that the other two water sources had existing groundwater users, including users located in Iran, and dismisses Claimant's argument that it chose the Fan Sediments to minimize the impact on such users, alleging that \"[o]*nce TCC* 'tapped' *the Fan Sediments, it would have been faced with the same consequences to other users that it sought to avoid*.\"886 Respondent argues that given the \"*extreme water scarcity of the region, caused by massive groundwater pumping and the increasing occurrence of more severe weather events, especially droughts*,\" Claimant should have expected local opposition. In Respondent's view, \"[i]*t is utterly realistic to assume that local communities would attribute any decrese in their well water levels to Reko Diq, whether that is in fact the case.*\" Respondent points to measures taken by Saindak to address this concern and considers that Claimant had planned \"*little to nothing*\" in this regard.887\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 162; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 249.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 252-254.\n\n737.\n\nRespondent further contends that there was no feasibility assessment on transporting the water from these other water sources to Reko Diq and no cost estimates for additional pumping wells and pipelines as well as potential electricity costs for running the pumps, which would have \"*certainly added to the USD 95 million that TCC planned to spend on developing the Fan Sediments alone*.\"888\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 163, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1523 lines 12-13 and (Day 6), p. 1717 lines 7-9 and p. 1718 lines 4-5.\n\n738.\n\nAs for the solution to pump seawater to Reko Diq, Respondent notes that the viability of this option or the associated additional costs of USD 1.7 to 2.76 billion, which it bases on Morgan Stanley estimates for the operating costs of a desalination facility per ton of copper produced and Claimant's estimate of the total copper reserves, was never discussed by Claimant's consultants and adds that this water pipeline would have faced the same risks as the slurry pipeline to Port Gwadar. In any event, Respondent maintains that \"*the value of Reko Diq must rest on the IMD FS*,\" which does not mention the use of seawater.889\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 164; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 254-255, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-668**, p. 7.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n739.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis on the issues regarding the groundwater source that was contemplated to supply the required quantities of water to the project, the Tribunal recalls that the argument that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source of its project was raised by Respondent already in the liability phase of this proceeding. In its Decision on on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal discussed this argument in the context of its analysis of whether any of the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject the Mining Lease Application and/or by Respondent in the arbitration justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application in November 2011. The alleged failure to fully assess the water source was one of the reasons that Respondent raised for the first time in this arbitration. While finding that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal in any event found that none of these additional reasons, including the reason invoked with regard to the water source, would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application.890\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1231-1233.\n\n740.\n\nAt the liability stage, the Tribunal noted that it appeared to be undisputed that Claimant had made a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for the project, *i.e*., the Baghicha Bore Field, which has in this phase more commonly been referred to as the Fan Sediments, to the extent that the Pakistani side of the aquifer was concerned. Based on a statement made by SMEC in its Final Report on the Water Resource Assessment that all of Claimant's preferred groundwater sources spanned international borders but that hydrogeological assessment of the respective areas in Iran and Afghanistan to feasibility level had not been carried out because SMEC had not received Claimant's permission to do so, the dispute between the Parties related to the question whether it was inadequate for Claimant not to make a feasibility assessment for the Afghan side of the aquifer.891\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1257-1258, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-410**, pp. 1-1 to 1-2 (corresponding to **Exhibit RE-576-24.03**, pp. 1-1 to 1-2).\n\n741.\n\nIn its analysis at the liability stage, the Tribunal relied in particular on the witness testimony of Mr. Livesey during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability regarding the significance of SMEC's statement for the other water sources it had assessed, which extended into Iran, the direction of water flow at the Fan Sediments from Pakistan into Afghanistan, as well as the mitigation measures employed by Claimant to maintain licenses at other groundwater sources.892 The Tribunal also considered it noteworthy that the GOB had chosen the same water source for its own mining project, citing the following advantages over other potential groundwater sources: \"*No other groundwater user*\"; \"*Large volume of groundwater storage*\"; \"*Easy accessibility of pipe line route*\"; and \"*Most of area of resource is in Pakistan*.\"893 On that basis, the Tribunal was convinced that \"*Claimant did in fact make an adequate assessment of the groundwater source it intended to use for its project*\" and therefore concluded that this additional ground invoked by Respondent did not present a justifiable basis for denying the Mining Lease Application.894\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1259-1261, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), pp. 1328-1331.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1262, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-372**, pp. 12-13.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1263.\n\n742.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that in its Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability filed after Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, the Tribunal addressed, *inter alia*, Respondent's argument that the results of the drilling for water provided in Appendix 24.03 to the Feasibility Study merit reconsideration of the Tribunal's finding that Claimant presented an adequate Feasibility Study meriting a mining lease because these results indicated, according to Respondent, very low storage coefficients which in its view did not support SMEC's conclusions on the amount of water available at the Fan Sediments.895\n\nDecision on Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 93; Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n\n743.\n\nThe Tribunal noted in its reasoning that Respondent did not argue that the alleged error it had identified in the Feasibility Study was known to the Licensing Authority at the time it rejected TCCP's Mining Lease Application or that it formed part of the ten grounds invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject. Based on the Tribunal's earlier finding that to allow Respondent to rely on additional reasons in this arbitration would violate Claimant's right to be heard, the Tribunal concluded that a potential error in the Feasibility Study that was not known to the Licensing Authority in November 2011 could not decisively affect the Tribunal's conclusion that the denial of the Mining Lease Application was not justified by any of the reasons given by the Licensing Authority and that \"*the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this motive*.\"896\n\nDecision on Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1264.\n\n744.\n\nThe Tribunal further emphasized that \"*it did not make a finding that the Feasibility Study was complete and/or that all assumptions and conclusions presented in the Study were fully accurate. What the Tribunal did find was that none of the reasons invoked by the Licensing Authority and, albeit it would not have been strictly necessary for its liability finding, none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in the liability phase, justified a denial of the Mining Lease Application. The question whether the assumptions made in the Feasibility Study were adequate and realistic will become relevant in the present quantum phase for the purposes of assessing the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled as a result of Respondent's Treaty breach*.\"897\n\nDecision on Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 97.\n\n745.\n\nSpecifically with regard to its reliance on the witness testimony of Mr. Livesey and Respondent's expressed fear that the Tribunal's factual findings would affect its assessment of Respondent's arguments during the quantum phase, the Tribunal stated the following:\n\n\"[T]*he Tribunal did not make a finding in the liability phase that the Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project at the time. It only assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support of its position that denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on justifiable reasons. Neither of the Parties presented any opinions from independent experts in the liability phase as they have now done in the quantum phase. As Respondent's reference to its experts Mr. Holmes and* [Dr.] *Nanni shows, it was apparently only through their review of the relevant data that the alleged errors were detected. Consequently, the Tribunal will assess the arguments presented by Respondent with regard to the water issue in its analysis on quantum once the Parties have completed their written submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact and expert witnesses during the hearing on quantum on this issue*.\"898\n\nDecision on Reconsideration Request, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n746.\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, Respondent's allegation that it had detected certain errors in the Feasibility Study, *i.e*., that the results of SMEC's studies on water did not support the conclusions drawn in the Feasibility Study regarding the size of the Fan Sediments and the amount of water available, was based on an expert report authored by Mr. Holmes and Dr. Nanni of Water Resource Associates (WRA) (\"**WRA Report**\"), which Respondent had submitted together with its Counter-Memorial on Quantum.899 After the Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request had been rendered, Respondent submitted with its Rejoinder a second expert report authored only by Dr. Nanni, in which she clarified that her participation in the WRA Report had focused exclusively on water governance and transboundary water issues and that her comments could be found in Section 5 of the WRA Report, labelled \"*Water Governance and Transboundary Issues.*\" Dr. Nanni further clarified that she had not participated in drafting the other sections of the WRA Report.900 She then confirmed her assessments made in Section 5 of the WRA Report and reproduced them in her second report.901\n\n*See in particular* Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 35 and note 57, *relying on* WRA Report, Section 3.5.\n\nNanni, \u00b6 2.\n\nNanni, \u00b6\u00b6 7-10 and Section III.\n\n747.\n\nMr. Holmes did not submit a second report in this arbitration. In preparation for the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent informed Claimant that Mr. Holmes had terminated his engagement with Pakistan and therefore could no longer be produced for examination at the Hearing. On that basis and pointing out that Section 5 of the WRA Report authored by Dr. Nanni, who remained available for examination, had been re-filed as a separate report, Claimant requested that the Tribunal strike the WRA Report from the record.902 In response, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to Claimant's request to strike the WRA Report \"*as it rests on an incomplete packet of information provided by TCCA*.\" Respondent noted that, of two reports prepared by JSAI in November 2009 and December 2009, respectively, the WRA Report could take into account only the December 2009 report as the November 2009 report was produced by Claimant only in November 2017, *i.e*., after the WRA Report had been submitted. Respondent further stated that \"[i]*n light of TCCA's failure to timely provide the November Report in advance of the Counter-Memorial, Pakistan must insist that the Tribunal strike all references to the WRA report made by TCCA and its experts*.\"903 Claimant objected to the striking of all references to the WRA Report, emphasizing that Respondent had not withdrawn its arguments based on the points made by Mr. Holmes and noting that the analysis presented by its new expert, Mr. Neville, had a more limited scope than the WRA Report and, according to Claimant, even confirmed that there would be enough water in the aquifer for the life of the mine. Claimant further noted that the November 2009 report referred to by Respondent had been provided to Pakistan five months before the due date for its Rejoinder and was in any event \"*simply a later iteration of the August Report*\" and summarized in the SMEC 2010 Report both of which had been available to Mr. Holmes when he prepared his expert report.904\n\nClaimant's letter regarding Pakistan's Rejoinder Testimony dated 23 April 2018, pp. 4-5.\n\nRespondent's letter regarding Request to Strike Experts dated 26 April 2018, pp. 7-8.\n\nClaimant's letter regarding the WRA Report dated 30 April 2018.\n\n748.\n\nBased on the Parties' submissions and in accordance with Section 16.9 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides that \"[t]*he Tribunal may disregard the testimony of a witness or expert called to testify at the hearing who fails to appear at the hearing without justified reasons*,\" the Tribunal decided to strike the WRA Report from the record, noting that: (i) Respondent had not provided any reason for which Prof. Holmes had terminated his engagement with Respondent and was no longer available for cross-examination; and (ii) Respondent had received the additional report of JSAI on Groundwater-Flow Modeling dated 6 November 2009 approximately five months before it filed its Rejoinder an Quantum and rebuttal reports from its experts, as a result of which the Tribunal did not understand this argument to serve as a reason for which Prof. Holmes had to terminate his engagement with Respondent. The Tribunal further saw no basis for striking any references to the WRA Report that were made in Claimant's submissions or the expert reports filed by Claimant's experts.905\n\nTribunal's letter to the Parties regarding the Exclusion of Evidence \u2013 WRA Report dated 2 May 2018.\n\n749.\n\nIn line with this decision, the Tribunal will not take into account any of the opinions expressed by Mr. Holmes in the WRA Report on which Respondent relied in support of its allegation that the results of SMEC's drilling did not support the conclusions drawn regarding the amount of water available in the Fan Sediments. At the same time, it is noted that Respondent continues to argue in its Post-Hearing Brief that by assuming that aquifer was unconfined, Mr. Jones \"*assumed that much more water was available for extraction and thereby arbitrarily reduced TCC's projected impact on the groundwater levels by a factor of 1,000*\" and relies on Mr. Neville's testimony during the Hearing on Quantum that \"*if the aquifer remains confined as it does during the 21 days, then the effective storage coefficient* [or the amount of water than can be extracted] *would be 1,000 times smaller than has been assumed in all of the analyses*.\"906\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 140 and note 307, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1642 lines 11-19.\n\n750.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant's statement in its Post-Hearing Brief that the only remaining issue in dispute is the extent of the drawdown in Afghanistan. Rather, it appears to the Tribunal that in addition ot the drawdown and the effects, if any, that such a drawdown would have on the feasibility and/or costs of the project, Respondent continues to dispute that there would have been sufficient water available in the Fan Sediments and that Claimant would have been able to extract the required quantities of water at the costs estimated in the Feasibility Study. Respondent further disputes that Claimant had sufficiently tested mitigation measures that might potentially be employed in case it turned out that the Fan Sediments would for any reason not be sufficient to serve as the only water source for the project. The Tribunal will therefore address all of these issues in the following analysis.\n\n**i. Whether the Estimated Mine Water Demand of the Reko Diq Project Was Reasonable**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n751.\n\nAs a preliminary matter and before addressing the question whether Claimant has established that the groundwater source it had chosen could supply sufficient water to the Reko Diq project, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has also challenged the estimates provided in the Feasibility Study regarding the amount of water needed for the project. Respondent relies on its experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen who expressed the opinion in their first expert report that the Feasibility Study \"*dramatically underestimated the amount of water needed*\" and that a \"*standard design basis would be to start at 1 cubic meter of water \u2026 per 1 ton of material being processed. Over time projects are capable of reducing this to 0.6 m\u00b3/ton of ore processed, but this should appear in the IMD FS*.\" Based on the assumption that 1 cubic meter of water would be needed for each ton of ore to be mined per day, Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen calculated that the project would require 4,583 cubic meters of water per hour and \"[t]*aking an optimistic approach of 0,8m3/ton of ore would suggest that 3,680 cubic meters of water per hour should be the design basis*.\" They noted that the Feasibility Study pegged water usage at approximately 2,100 cubic meters per hour and considered that \"[e]*ven the best plants are not this efficient*\" as a result of which \"*the base case for water usage is understated*.\"907\n\nDagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\n752.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen did not cite any authority in support of the \"*standard*\" of one cubic meter of water per ton of material being processed. According to Claimant, their opinion ignored the \"*highly efficient*\" metallurgical process that had been developed for the project as part of which \"*a large amount of water from the tailings slurry would be recovered and returned for use in the process plant*.\"908 In support of its submission, Claimant refers to its expert Mr. Mayer, Senior Manager of Water and Tailings at Barrick at the time the Feasibility Study was prepared, who oversaw the work for the Reko Diq project regarding water balance, water supply, and concentrate slurry pipeline design.909 Mr. Mayer stated in his report that \"[m]*inimizing the amount of water consumed on-site was a key consideration throughout the design process*.\" He explained that the concentration of ore minerals through the \"*flotation*\" process is \"*the core purpose of the operation and drives water demand calculation.*\" He further explained that both the rougher tailings slurry stream created from the initial float, comprising 93.5% of the total tailings mass generated, and the cleaner tailings steam created after secondary grinding and further flotation, comprising about 5% of the total tailing mass, would be thickened at the plant site to recover as much water as possible, which would be returned to the process plant for use.910 With regard to the mine water demand, Mr. Mayer stated:\n\n\"*The largest source of water consumption at Reko Diq occurs at the rougher tailings facility. This consumption is made up of moisture trapped between the tailings particles after consolidation, seepage from the facility, and evaporation. Consumption at the rougher and cleaner facilities constitutes about 87% of the total water demand.*\n\n*The remaining 13% of water consumed at Reko Diq includes water in the concentrate slurry stream, potable, dust control, and evaporation.*\n\n*Total water consumption, minus water recovered from the tailings storage facility after consolidation and return water from other minor sources, equals the mine water demand.*\n\n*As a result, the Mine Water Demand for operations was calculated at 2,410 cubic meters per hour (670 l/s) for the IMD phase and 4,625 cubic meters per hour (1,285 l/s) for the EXP phase.1 The estimate of Mine Water Demand evolved over time as the process and tailings facility designs were refined.*\n\n*In order to be conservative for the purpose of estimating the effects of pumping from the Fan Sediments aquifer on the groundwater levels, the project assumed that the water could not be recovered from the tailings storage facilities, and that water would have to be made up from the Fan Sediments aquifer. Under this conservative assumption, the mine water demand would be 730 l/s (IMD) and 1460 l/s (EXP).*\n\n*For the purpose of sizing the capacity of the water supply pipeline, the project assumed no water recovered from the tailings facilities, the average annual peak water consumption year, and the 92% planned availability of the process plant. Under these conditions the mine water demand would be 800 l/s (IMD) and 1,630 l/s (EXP) and would be equal to the maximum peak instantaneous rate*.\"911\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 525.\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7.\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33.\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.\n\n753.\n\nMr. Mayer referred to Chapter 8 of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study entitled \"*Water Management*,\" which provides in Section 8.7 on the Water Management Plan an overall water balance for the Initial Mine Development and the Expansion.912 The numbers for the Initial Mine Development are also contained in Chapter 8 of the Feasibility Study.913\n\n**Exhibit RE-577-8**, Table 8.5.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-8**, Table 8.5.\n\n754.\n\nSpecifically in response to the rate of one cubic meter of water per one ton of ore processed advanced by Respondent and its experts, Mr. Mayer considered that this approach would \"*unnecessarily increase capital and operating costs for water and tailings management to the project and would be irresponsible socially and environmentally*\" as it would be \"*an immense waste of water and of other resources used for flotation and tailings management*.\" Mr. Mayer also stated that applying this \"*rule of thumb would be terribly inefficient because excess water in the tailings storage facility would slow tailings consolidation requiring increased capacity \u2026 and would maximize the need for offsite water from the Fan Sediments aquifer*.\"914 Mr. Mayer acknowledged that \"[s]*ome older mines took this approach prior incorporation of thickeners and efficient tailings management practices*\" but stated that he was not aware of any modern mines operating in this manner. Mr. Mayer further emphasized that in their calculations of water demand, Claimant's team did not rely on \"*a general rule of thumb*\" but rather on test work on tailing samples generated from the metallurgical test work for the project which form the basis for the tailings thickeners and the tailings facility designs.915\n\nMayer, 51-52.\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.\n\n755.\n\nMr. Mayer also stated that the team estimated the chance to reclaim up to 9% of the water from the tailings facility by design and tailings management practices.916 In this regard, Mr. Mayer referred to Appendix 28.28 of the Feasibility Study, which is a Memorandum prepared by Knight Pi\u00e9sold Consulting on Rougher Tailings Facility Feasibility Design dated 30 July 2009. This Memorandum evaluated in detail three thickened tailings storage options based on Phase 4 tailings tests and recommended as the base case for the Feasibility Study Option 2 which was described as a \"*hybrid of Options 1 and 3*\" and would, *inter alia*, be more water efficient than Option 3.917 The Memorandum presented the water demands for the rougher facility options and the cleaner facility as well as the capital and operating costs associated with each option and a decising making - ranking matrix.918\n\nMayer, \u00b6 56.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.28**, pp. 1-2, 10.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.28**, Sections 4 through 6.\n\n756.\n\nIn response to Mr. Mayer's explanation of the approach contemplated by Claimant, Respondent argued that \"[w]*hile these maneuvers seem practical in theory, they provide no insight into the amount of water saved. Nor does TCCA indicate by how much the demand for water would be reduced*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant's arguments should not be trusted because: (i) \"*TCCA's two methods for conserving water\u2014extracting water from the slurry and reclaiming more water from the slurry at the storage facility\u2014 have an inverse relationship*\"; and (ii) \"*the studies conducted on this process do not reveal a significant decrease in the overall water demand*.\"919\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 244-246.\n\n757.\n\nIn support of its argument, Respondent relies on the same Memorandum of Knight Pi\u00e9sold Consulting dated 30 July 2009 in which the results of the Phase 4 tailings tests are presented in comparison to the previous Phase 3 test results and it is stated:\n\n\"*The most notable variation in the two Rougher samples is the reduction in supernatant released from the Phase 4 sample. At 67% solids there is an estimated 6% reduction in the percent of supernatant water released. As a result the improved water recovery due to operation at 67% solids is offset by a reduction in supernatant production and the resulting theoretical water demand from the tailings is only reduced by 3%. Individual options vary depending on layout and operation as discussed in more detail in Section 4*.\"920\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.28**, p. 3.\n\n758.\n\nRespondent further relies on Appendix C to an additional Memorandum prepared by the same consulting firm on Water Balance Modelling and & Decant Return dated 16 December 2008. Appendix C contains a comparison between a scenario in which the %solids of the rougher tailings are increased to 64%, as it was done in Phase 3 tailings tests, and the scenario in which they are increased to 67%, as it was done in Phase 4 tailings tests. It is noted that \"*increasing the %solids of the rougher tailings from 64% to 67% solids results in reduction in water loss of about 8% (0,033 m3/t of tailings sent to the rougher facility)*.\" Appendix C further states:\n\n\"*Thus although the supernatant production reduces as the %solids increases, the water loss (water output \u2013 water return) also reduces as the %solids increases. For a change from 64% solids to 67% solids the reduction is approximately 0,033 m3/t of water.*\n\n*For the overall project assessment this reduction in water loss needs to be compared to the relative capital and operating costs (in particular flocculant consumption) of the different thickeners being considered*.\"921\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-28.13**, Appendix C, pp. 1-2.\n\n759.\n\nBased on its own review of the memoranda relied on by Respondent, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that there appears to be a correlation between increasing the percentage to which rougher tailings are thickened and a lowering of the supernatant production in the facility itself. However, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's argument that the memoranda would reveal no significant decrease in the overall water demand. In particular, the Tribunal understands that the decrease of 3% reported in the 30 July 2009 Memorandum referred to the difference between Phase 3 tailings tests and Phase 4 tailings tests in which the rougher tailings tests were thickened to 64% and 67%, respectively. The same applies to the 16 December 2008 Memorandum, which also compares the results of increasing the percentage from 64% to 67%. Neither of the two Memoranda compares the results of Phase 4 tailings tests to a scenario in which no thickeners would be used and therefore they do not support Respondent's allegation that using thickeners would not contribute to a significant decrease in the overall water demand. In addition, while the 16 December 2008 Memorandum refers to \"*relative capital and operating costs \u2026 of the different thickeners being considered*,\" it does not provide any support for Respondent's allegation that the advantages of their use would be offset by their additional costs.\n\n760.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Respondent's experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen did not respond to Mr. Mayer's explanation why the rate of one cubic meter of water per one tor of ore processed they had introduced would, in his opinion, overestimate the project's water needs. Neither did Respondent's expert on water-related matters, Mr. Neville, express an opinion on this matter.\n\n761.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds convincing Mr. Mayer's explanation that through the process of thickening rougher tailings as well as cleaner tailings, Claimant would have been able to recover and reuse a significant amount of water, which would have decreased the amount of water to be supplied from an off-site groundwater source. Neither Respondent nor its experts have engaged in any detail with the estimates provided in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study based, *inter alia*, on the tests performed on the rougher tailings. While Respondent maintains that the rate of one cubic meter of water per ton of ore processed forms part of \"*widely accepted guidelines*\" contained in the US Geological Survey of 2012,922 it has not engaged with the specific process Claimant had designed for the Reko Diq project and has not challenged any specific part of this process or a particular aspect of the estimated water needs calculated based on the tests performed. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that the process would not be able to achieve the estimated water recovery and/or the estimated overall water balance presented in Chapter 8 of both Studies.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 243, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-727**, p. 3.\n\n762.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has also taken note of Mr. Mayer's unchallenged testimony that in order to be conservative, the final estimate of mine water demand in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study is based on the assumption that no water could be recovered from the tailings facilities.923 In the absence of any specific challenge to the process contemplated by Claimant or to the estimate of mine water demand included in the Studies, the Tribunal will base its further analysis in this section on the assumption that the amount of water needed was appropriately estimated by Claimant.\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n**ii. Whether Sufficient Water Was Available to Meet the Mine Water Demand of the Reko Diq Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n763.\n\nAs to the question whether Claimant has established that the Fan Sediments contained sufficient quantities of water to supply the Reko Diq project based on the estimated mine water demand, Claimant considers that this was confirmed by all four hydrogeological experts during the Hearing on Quantum. Respondent, on the other hand, considers that Claimant's expert Dr. Drury acknowledged that the Fan Sediments would most likely not have provided sufficient water for Reko Diq. In light of these deviating interpretations, the Tribunal will review the testimony of the Parties' experts in more detail. As noted above, the Tribunal will not take into account the opinions expressed by Mr. Holmes in the WRA Report. However, given that Respondent continues to pursue the argument that initially relied on Mr. Holmes' analysis and given that the Tribunal saw no basis for striking the references to his analysis made by Claimant's experts from the record, the Tribunal will also take into account the opinions expressed by Claimant's experts on the argument initially supported by Mr. Holmes.\n\n764.\n\nClaimant's expert Dr. Drury stated during the presentation of his findings at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*our conclusion is that the Fan Sediments can supply a sustainable groundwater supply to Reko Diq Mine. And the alternative supplies also have very large resources available to supply the mine as well*.\"924 For the Fan Sediments, Dr. Drury based this conclusion on the 21-day pump test conducted by SMEC in 2008, which he described as \"*an extraordinary event*\" that he had never carried out before in his 45-year experience. He testified that most water supply pump tests are carried out over one to three days and that he had experienced only one exception with a 10-day pump test.925 Dr. Dury then explained the tests performed by SMEC at the three alternative water resources and also referred to \"*a very big peer-review process*\" involving internal reviewers at SMEC as well as external reviewers from Claimant, Antofagasta and third-party consultants.926\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1347 lines 3-7.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1343 line 2 to p. 1344 line 17.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1344 line 18 to p. 1347 line 2. *See also* Drury Presentation, pp. 8-9.\n\n765.\n\nRespondent contends that during cross-examination, Dr. Drury \"*expressly recognized that the Fan Sediments would most likely not have provided enough water to Reko Diq.*\"927 It relies on the following testimony of Dr. Drury:\n\n\"*Q. \u2026 Mr. Drury, you say in Paragraph 67 of your Report that you were confident that water existed at Balochistan from a combination of groundwater around Reko Diq to supply the mine requirements.*\n\n*Do you see that?*\n\n*In your Expert Report and also in the SMEC Report, you don't say that the Fan Sediments would have been enough. You say that it's a combination of groundwater sources is the one that would have supply-and-demand requirement?*\n\n*A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. Do you agree?*\n\n*A. That's what I say, yes.*\n\n*Q. And you also say that,* 'It's my understanding that TCC intended to initially develop the Baghicha Borefield and then augment water supplies from at least one other nearby groundwater source.'\n\n*A. The TCC had the Fan Sediments as the primary water supply, and then there were fallback positions for Patangaz or Upper Tahlab*.\"928\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 134.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1383 line 21 to p. 1384 line 18.\n\n766.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, Dr. Drury stated in his expert report:\n\n\"*My overall impression from the aquifer testing and modelling results was that there was sufficient groundwater available from a combination of the groundwater development sites around Reko Diq to supply the mine requirements. It is my understanding that TCC intended to initially develop the Baghicha Borefield (Fan Sediments) and then augment water supplies from at least one other nearby groundwater source (Patangaz and/or Upper Tahlab).*\"929\n\nDrury, \u00b6 67.\n\n767.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that Dr. Drury apparently did not consider it certain that the aquifer at the Fan Sediments would by itself have provided sufficient water for Reko Diq over the entire life of the mine. In particular, the Tribunal does not understand Dr. Drury's conclusion that the Fan Sediments could provide a \"*sustainable groundwater supply to Reko Diq mine*\" to mean that no other water sources would be needed over the life of the mine. To the contrary, Dr. Drury's statement in his report that sufficient groundwater would be available \"*from a combination of the groundwater development sites around Reko Diq*\" and his understanding that Claimant intended to first develop the Fan Sediments and then \"*augment water supplies from at least one other nearby groundwater source*,\" together with the clarification he provided during the Hearing that the Fan Sediments were to serve as \"*the primary water supply*,\" with the other sources being \"*fallback positions*,\" confirm his recommendation in the SMEC reports that \"*in addition to the Fan Sediments, at least two other independent water supply sources be developed for water supply purposes*,\" which he understood was incorporated by Claimant into the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study as well as the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.930\n\nDrury, \u00b6 65, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-8, RE-577-8** *and* **RE-601**.\n\n768.\n\nMr. Mayer also explained that the Fan Sediments were chosen as the primary water source but that SMEC recommended that Claimant retain its existing No Objection Certificates (NOCs) in the areas of the three alternative sources. He agreed with this advice and the NOCs were retained. Mr. Mayer further confirmed that \"[t]*he feasibility studies carried out by SMEC indicated that each of these areas was a viable option to supplement the Fan Sediments aquifer yields if required*.\"931\n\nMayer, \u00b6\u00b6 99, 101.\n\n769.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Dr. Drury's testimony confirmed that the Fan Sediments would \"*most likely not have provided enough water to Reko Diq*.\" The Tribunal cannot follow this interpretation. As for the volume of water in storage, Dr. Drury explained in his expert report that SMEC in its 2009 report did \"*not present a definitive calculation on groundwater reserve within aquifers as sufficient data across the borders was not available*\" and noted that a \"*measurement of the volume of groundwater in storage does not, by itself, indicate how much water can be extracted from the aquifer*.\" He explained that \"*the projected groundwater yield of a multilayered hydrogeological system over long-term pumping (possibly many decades) can only be made through groundwater modeling*\" for the discussion of which he referred to Claimant's expert Mr. Jones from JSAI.932 Dr. Drury explained that the estimate of water volume in bulk storage in the 2009 SMEC report \"*was a simple ranking mechanism to compare the attributes of the three main potential borefields (Upper Tahlab, Patanganz and Fan Sediments) \u2013 what is small, medium and large*\" based on the concept of Total Porosity. He emphasized that \"[i]*n the absence of an extensive knowledge of each aquifer system*,\" SMEC did \"*not discuss the volume of groundwater that can be physically extracted from the aquifer \u2013 this is a conclusion that can only be reached once the complete groundwater system is understood*.\"933 Dr. Drury further explained why in his view, the assumptions made in the WRA Report \"*considerably underestimated groundwater availability*.\"934 As the WRA Report has been struck from the record, the Tribunal does not have to address these aspects in further detail. However, based on his explanations, Dr. Drury further concluded that: \"[i]*f anything, SMEC may have underestimated the volume of water in storage in that: (i) clay aquitards and aquifers in Layer 1 will leak vertically to the pumped aquifers; (ii) groundwater from the deep aquifers may migrate upwards during long-term pumping periods; and (iii) additional groundwater may be available from the deep, narrow trench system*.\"935\n\nDrury, \u00b6\u00b6 171-173\n\nDrury, \u00b6\u00b6 175, 178.\n\nDrury, \u00b6\u00b6 174-193.\n\nDrury, \u00b6 194.\n\n770.\n\nMr. Jones confirmed in his expert report that the amount of water available for extraction from the Fan Sediments is determined based on the porosity of the saturated sediments, ranging from 10% to 40% of the volume of the aquifer. Specifically with regard to the storage coefficients in respect of which Respondent claims to have identified an error in the calculation of the available water volume, Mr. Jones explained that \"[t]*he confined storage coefficients describe short-term water-level changes in response to pumping, in the pressurized sections of aquifer intersected by wells, but they have nothing to do with the volume of water in storage, which is a function of porosity. The confined storage coefficient equates to a porosity of 0.03% well below the physically-possible range of porosity for sedimentary materials (about 10% to 40%)*.\"936 Mr. Jones further expressed the opinion that \"*WRA's physically-impossible low estimate of porosity results in a dramatic under-estimate of the amount of groundwater stored in the Fan Sediments*.\"937 He explained:\n\n\"*The confined storage coefficients are results obtained from the 21-day pump-out test that depressurized, but did not drain, the individual strata providing water to the pumping wells. They do not reflect the physical water content of materials in the aquifer. Actual draining of aquifer sediments would only begin after more time and pumping, when the water in the aquifer is no longer held under pressure.*\n\n*The calculations by WRA estimating the volume of water in storage based on the confined storage coefficients, which amount to the equivalent of 0.03% porosity, are not credible. Unconsolidated and semi-consolidated sediments (dirt) never have such a low porosity*.\"938\n\nJones, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\nJones, \u00b6 76.\n\nJones, \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.\n\n771.\n\nAs noted above, Mr. Holmes, on whose opinion Respondent had relied with regard to the alleged error regarding the storage coefficient, did not present a second report and, for reasons which remain unknown to the Tribunal, terminated his engagement with Respondent before the Hearing on Quantum and was no longer available for cross-examination. Together with its Rejoinder on Quantum, Respondent submitted an expert report by Mr. Neville, who reviewed in detail the 21-day pump test conducted by SMEC. In his expert report, Mr. Neville also used the term \"*storage coefficient*\" and presented a detailed memorandum on \"[t]*he significance and magnitudes of aquifer storage coefficients*\" as an appendix to his report. He did not, however, confirm the criticism raised by Mr. Holmes that the confined storage coefficients obtained through the 21-day pump-out test did not support the conclusions drawn by SMEC regarding the amount of water available in the Fan Sediments. Mr. Neville rather noted that the 21-day test had not been sufficient \"*to constrain the specification of the specific yield*\" and considered that the specific yield of 0.15 assumed by Mr. Jones in his model was \"*not representative of the sediments that will be drained by long-term pumping*\" but should have been \"*smaller, on the order of 0.02*.\"939 The dispute between the Parties regarding the specific yield and its impact on the extent of the drawdown in Afghanistan will be addressed further below.\n\nNeville, pp. 2-3.\n\n772.\n\nIn its Post-Hearng Brief on Quantum, Respondent maintained the argument, however, that Mr. Jones had incorrectly assumed in his model that the aquifer was unconfined even though it had remained confined during the 21-day test and relied on the oral testimony of Mr. Neville, who confirmed during his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum that \"[b]*ased solely on the 21 days, the aquifer was responding as a confined aquifer.*\"940 Mr. Neville further explained the consequence of an aquifer being confined or unconfined as follows:\n\n\"*The difference is in the effective storage coefficient. So, that's the term I've used. So, the effective storage coefficient--that's how water re-enters the aquifer after 21 days--is on the order of three zeros and a 1, something like that. So, the point 0--10 to the minus 4,.001.*\n\n*In contrast, if the water does in the end come from vertical drainage at the water table, then the effective parameter would be if--2 percent? 15 percent? Whatever; the point is, much, much larger than the confined storage coefficient. A factor of 1,000, larger than this confined storage coefficient.*\n\n*So, that means in* [sic] *the aquifer remains confined as it does during the 21 days, then the effective storage coefficient would be 1,000 times smaller than has been assumed in all of the analyses, whether Mr. Jones's analyses or mine. And the implications would be the following: The drawdowns--that's the declines in water levels--would be much larger. The absolute magnitudes of the drawdowns would be much larger.*\n\n*Secondly, the extent of the drawdown cone--so, how much water level has declined, say, in Afghanistan would be much larger. So, we--my analysis--we predict--Mr. Jones and I confirm his results--predicted drawdowns on the order of 3 meters at the Afghani border. And with the storage coefficient that's 1,000 times lower, they would probably be on the order of--I don't know. 30 meters? 300 meters? Some--well, not 300 because that would drain the aquifer completely, but some much larger level of drawdown. So, that's one implication.*\n\n*The other implication is that the feasibility of the water supply would be called into question because the depths from which--since the water levels are depressed even further, the height at which water has to be lifted to get it into a pipeline would have to be that much higher. The energy requirements would be that much higher. You'd need more pumps. You'd need more wells. You'd need more than the 22 wells because the wells would interfere with each other over the long term; right?*\"941\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1641 lines 14-15.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1641 line 20 to p. 1643 line 20.\n\n773.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Neville's testimony confirms that if the aquifer remained confined as it had during the 21-day test, the effective storage coefficient would be 1,000 times smaller and the drawdown to be expected in Afghanistan would be much larger than assumed both by Mr. Jones and by Mr. Neville himself. However, Mr. Neville provided this explanation in response to the abstract question regarding the difference between an unconfined and a confined aquifer. He did not express the opinion that the Fan Sediments would in fact remain confined in the long term. While he disagreed with Mr. Jones as to whether the effective parameter would be 2% or 15%, he in any event agreed that the relevant parameter is the specific yield, which will be addressed below, rather than a much lower confined storage coefficient. During his presentation at the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Neville explicitly stated that \"*I happen to believe that a more realistic value for these sediments is significantly lower* [than the 15% assumed by Mr. Jones], *but it's much bigger than the confined storage coefficient*.\"942 Against this background, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's allegation that Mr. Jones, by basing his model on the assumption that water would be flowing from the upper layers of the aquifer, he over-estimated the amount of water available for extraction and thereby \"*arbitrarily reduced TCC's projected impact on the groundwater levels by a factor of 1,000*.\"943\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1536 lines 12-15.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 140.\n\n774.\n\nIn addition, as pointed out by Claimant, Mr. Neville testified in response to the question whether there was enough water to go ahead with the project: \"*I don't think it's a question of how much water is available. I think it's a question of how feasible it is to get to the water*.\" He then confirmed: \"*I don't think it's a question of how much water is there. It's a big area, and I have no doubt that the volume of water that they need is there in the sediments. They've certainly done a good job of showing that*.\"944 Mr. Neville explained that if he had been working for Barrick, he would have provided cost estimates for the potential need of additional pumping wells and a reinjection system as well as the risk that water would have to be pumped out from deeper levels, which would have increased electricity or diesel costs. He stated:\n\n\"*So, I think the water is there, but is it a question of--to me, it's a question of how feasible it to get out* [sic], *and, if anything, I would want to exaggerate how much it's really going cost.*\n\n*ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: So, just to summarize, to make sure I understand you correctly, the answer to the question of how feasible it is to get the water out is translated into are there adequate provisions for increased costs in the feasibility studies.*\n\n*THE WITNESS: (Mr. Neville) I would say so. Yeah. I would say so. And I don't think they are insubstantial costs; right?*\n\n*ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: Understood*.\"945\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1715 lines 13-15 and p. 1716 lines 13-17.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1717 line 5 to p. 1718 line 2.\n\n775.\n\nIn response to the question whether his response related to the Fan Sediments or the whole area around Reko Diq, Mr. Neville clarified that \"*from studying the SMEC work, it was clear to me that there was a recognition that the Fan Sediments alone might not be--even if the water--the volume of water is there, that it might not be feasible to get all of the mine water requirements just from the Fan Sediments. So, they were already contemplating seriously other sources of water.*\"946 This was confirmed by Dr. Drury who stated that the Fan Sediments was the primary source of water chosen by Claimant but that \"*in any major mining water-supply project, you always have backup systems*\" and SMEC therefore recommended to retain the NOCs for the other \"*huge aquifer deposits in the area*.\" He emphasized that \"*the other ones, it's not because we doubted Fan Sediments, but we had NOCs that we retained in case there was an issue in the future*.\"947\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1721 lines 9-16.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1721 line 19 to p. 1722 line 15.\n\n776.\n\nIn light of this testimony by the Parties' experts, the Tribunal considers it established that there was sufficient water available for the Reko Diq project. While Claimant had chosen to develop the Fan Sediments as its primary water source, it had, upon recommendation from SMEC, decided to also retain the No Objection Certificates over the areas in which the other water sources were located. The question that remains to be answered is whether the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study adequately accounted for the possibility that Claimant might have to resort to using other water sources besides the Fan Sediments and/or that Claimant might have to spend additional costs at the Fan Sediments because of deeper drilling or measures required to mitigate the drawdown into Afghanistan.\n\n777.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant does not make reference to the alternative water sources or the costs associated with having to develop them in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Dr. Drury confirmed in his expert report that for the purposes of the Feasibility Study, SMEC produced its Final Report in 2010, which was an extract of the 2009 report that focused on the Fan Sediments.948 Claimant emphasized, and this was confirmed by Mr. Mayer in his expert report,949 that all three alternative water sources were assessed to feasibility level. While Respondent disputes this, it did not provide any evidence in support of its allegation that the assessments were not sufficient for the purposes of demonstrating the availability of alternative water sources that could be used in addition to the primary water source.\n\nDrury, \u00b6 66, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1228**.\n\n*Cf*. Mayer, \u00b6 80.\n\n778.\n\nRespondent contends that Dr. Drury \"*was not able to go so far as to say that the other sources were assessed to a feasibility level*.\"950 The Tribunal notes, however, that in response to the question whether he would agree that the other groundwater sources were not at a feasibility level or a pre-feasibility level, Dr. Drury expressly stated: \"*No, no. Absolutely not. I reject that*.\"951 He testified that \"[t]*he Upper Tahlab was very extensively drilled, and the Saindak Borefield has been pumping now for 15 years suppyling water to the mine, so have a 15-year pump test*.\" Dr. Drury also referred to \"*more pump tests and more drilling*\" carried out by SMEC as a result of which the Upper Tahlab \"*is very well known*.\"952 As for Patangaz, Dr. Drury explained the drilling carried out by SMEC and the information from such drilling which was incorporated into the model, concluding that \"[i]*t was a feasibility at that location. So, I have little doubt at all that it was a very good water supply for the mine site*.\"953 Finally, as to the transportation of the water to Reko Diq, Dr. Drury testified that \"*Fan Sediments was feasibility*\" and the other groundwater sources were \"*I would say pre-feasibility. Surveying geotech work was done*.\" He confirmed his statement in the SMEC December 2009 report that \"[m]*ost water delivery systems for the various preferred groundwater sources, areas, and from the ocean are designed to pre-feasibility level*\" but also testified that \"[t]*he pipeline design was still happening when* [he] *left the project*\" in March 2009 and \"*more work was carried on for another three months*.\"954\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 161.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1385 lines 19-22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1386 lines 1-16.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1386 line 22 to p. 1387 line 21.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1386 line 22 to p. 1389 line 14.\n\n779.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by Respondent's allegation that Claimant failed to conduct feasibility assessments of the alternative water sources, this does not yet answer the question whether it also accounted for the costs associated with the possibility of having to develop either of these additional water sources in order to supply sufficient water to the Reko Diq project. Given that the other water sources were not discussed in the chapter on Water Management in the Feasibility Study and the chapter on Capital Costs states that \"[t]*he water supply pipeline estimate is based on the source of water from the Fan Sediments*,\"955 without making reference to alternative water sources, it indeed appears that potential costs associated with these other water sources were not included in the cost budget for the water supply in the Feasibility Study and Claimant does not argue otherwise.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-16.\n\n780.\n\nHowever, this does not appear unreasonable to the Tribunal given that Claimant planned on developing the Fan Sediments as its primary water source and would resort to the other water sources only if and when required to do so. Mr. Mayer confirmed during the Hearing on Quantum that \"*Fan Sediments was to be used for the whole life of the mine; however, we were going to maintain--no, not maintain, but the intention was to maintain the NOCs in the other areas in case mitigation was necessary. That mitigation could be from--I don't think it would be from a technical mitigation of supply but, you know, there's all kinds of permitting risks and things of that nature that we wanted to have some fallback systems*. \u2026 *But certainly that the Feasibility Report is Fan Sediments for the life of the mine including construction*.\"956\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1502 lines 10-22.\n\n781.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant and confirmed by Respondent,957 the residual risk register included risks and associated cost estimates relating to the insufficiency of the Fan Sediments and the need to develop other water sources besides the Fan Sediments, which will be set out in further detail below. Specifically, it included the following risks: (i) \"*Available water resource insufficient to supply operating requirements (including slurry pipeline), resulting in production interruptions and/or additional expenses*\"; (ii) \"*Water usage by project from alternate sources than Fan Sediments (i.e. the back up supply) causes drawdowns that impact locals (Pakistan drawdown of wetlands, domestic and agriculture water supply) resulting in negative perceptions re. the project and additional compensation costs*\"; and (iii) \"*Draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project needs caused by the current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to use water (quantity and duration) results in the need to develop alternative sources*.\" In addition, the risk register also identified the risk that \"*A lender requires the project to engage in cross border consultation with* [Afghanistan / Iran] *due to the* [Fan Sediments / Patangaz] *water supply*.\" These risks were captured with an additional capex and/or opex estimate and included in Prof. Davis' model.958\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 218.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 26, pp. 4, 8, 12; **Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n782.\n\nRespondent did not raise a specific argument as to why the cost estimates assigned to these risks would not fully capture the costs associated with the possibility that Claimant might have to develop an alternative water source in the future in order to supply sufficient water to the Reko Diq project.\n\n783.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers it established that there was sufficient water available for the project when considering all of these potential water sources. While Claimant's experts could not exclude that Claimant might have to resort to alternative water sources at some point, there was agreement, including by Respondent's expert Mr. Neville, that the Fan Sediments and the alternative water sources would together be able to provide sufficient water to the Reko Diq project. Mr. Neville explicitly stated that \"*I think the water is there, but is it a question of--to me, it's a question of how feasible it to get out, and, if anything, I would want to exaggerate how much it's really going cost.*\"959\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1718 lines 11-14.\n\n**iii. Whether It Was Feasibile to Extract the Water from the Fan Sediments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n784.\n\nAs to the feasibility of extracting the water from the Fan Sediments and the potential impact and costs associated with the extraction, the dispute between the Parties focused on the question whether the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones in the groundwater model led to an adequate prediction of the potential effects of long-term pumping. It appears to be undisputed that the specific yield of 0.15 that Mr. Jones used in his model could not directly be derived from the results of the 21-day pump-out test.\n\n785.\n\nAccording to Mr. Neville, \"[t]*he 21-day duration of the pumping test is not sufficient to contrain the specification of the specific yield*\" and, \"[i]*n the absence of data to contrain the analyses, the results of the Shomaker (2009) groundwater model are speculative.*\"960\n\nNeville, pp. 2, 4.\n\n786.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, Dr. Drury confirmed during the Hearing on Quantum that \"[t]*he 21-day pump test gave you the storage coefficient and transmissivity of this confined aquifer. The specific yield relates to the upper horizons in the 21-day pump test. There was not any indication of a specific yield*.\"961 He confirmed that it was not possible to calculate the specific yield in the 21 days and explained that \"[t]*he Fan Sediment is in the upper aquifer. We pumped from the--which is 50--60 or 70 meters below the surface. We're pumping from 150, 200 meters. In that 21 days, we haven't got values of specific yield. The specific yield may not be found for six months. It may be 12 months before it is determined*.\"962 When asked what it tells about the aquifer that the specific yield was not determined during the 21-day pump test, Dr. Drury testified that \"*what it tells the aquifer is actually a very extensive aquifer. The water level drawdown from those free-pumping bores was small, and you have to remember that this aquifer from Mirjawa Hills to the Baghicha Borefield is 10 kilometers, and from Baghicha borefield to Gowd-e-Zereh another 15, so that's 25 kilometers, and 70 kilometers long. And what we are doing, we've got a little pinprick, a little pinprick of where we've actually got our bores in this big area, and we've drawn down this little point in this huge aquifer system. So, it shows that we have a very extensive aquifer. We've only made a dent in the system. The water level drawdown, away from production bore, was only 500 meters. Those which would be 1,000 meters away almost didn't respond to pumping. So, we have a very, very restricted--so, we have a huge aquifer, and we're just a little pinprick in the whole system*.\"963\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1400 lines 3-7.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1401 lines 8-14.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1422 line 17 to p. 1423 line 12.\n\n787.\n\nMr. Jones also agreed with Mr. Neville's statement that \"[t]*he 21-day duration of the pump test is not sufficient to constrain the specification of the specific yield*.\" He explained that the reason for this was that \"*we pumped from some confined strata, about 200 meters down in the aquifer, and we measured no response in the shallow water table in the unconfined strata and so, therefore, we don't know the specific yield*.\" He added that \"[t]*his is very encouraging news. It means that the aquifer will sustain pumping of a much greater scale than we tested*.\"964\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1441 lines 9-22.\n\n788.\n\nWhile the Parties' experts are therefore in agreement as to the fact that the specific yield could not be determined based on the results of the 21-day pump-out test, they disagree as to the consequences to be drawn from that knowledge as well as to whether the specific yield could reliably be determined in a different manner. First of all, the Tribunal takes note of Dr. Drury's statement that it might have taken six or even 12 months of pumping before the specific yield would be found. Dr. Dury also testified that \"[t]*he 21-day pump test is an extraordinary event*\" and that he had \"*never carried out a 21-day pump test in all* [his] *45 years' experience*\" but that in \"*at least 95, 97 percent of* [his] *experience, one to three days' pumping is what it carried out*\" with one exception where a 10-day pump test had been carried out at the request of the water authority. He emphasized that \"[y]*ou don't pump 50 years to prove you have a water supply for a 50-year mine*.\"965\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1343 lines 3-18.\n\n789.\n\nMr. Mayer also testified that in his professional opinion, \"*21 days is an unusually long time to perform a pumpout test, much longer than is required to determine permeability and storage properties of the aquifer*\" and that he had \"*never participated in a pump-out test that lasted a full 21 days. Typically, these tests last three or four days or up to a week at most.*\"966\n\nMayer, \u00b6 88.\n\n790.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Neville expressed the opinion that the data collected during the 21-day pump test demonstrated \"*only that three wells within the study area can be pumped for 21 days at a cumulative rate of 70 L/s*.\"967 Apart from the disagreement as to whether 70 l/s was the correct figure even though the pumping rates at the three wells were 40 l/s, 40 l/s and 30 l/s, respectively,968 the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Neville's apparent argument that the test was not able to demonstrate anything more than the amount and rate actually pumped during the test. As pointed out by Dr. Drury, the requirement cannot be that a test would have the same duration as the life of the mine. In addition, neither Respondent nor Mr. Neville disputed Dr. Drury and Mr. Mayer's opinion that a 21-day test was considerably longer than the usual duration of pump-out tests and thus exceeded industry standards. While Respondent pointed to the undisputed fact that the amount of water pumped during the test was much lower than the amount to be pumped over the life of the mine and alleged that \"[g]*iven these differences, TCC could not possibly have predicted the aquifers' viability after such a cursory test*,\"969 neither Respondent nor Mr. Neville made any statement as to the length they would have considered appropriate for the test let alone provide any supporting authority for such an opinion.\n\nNeville, p. 3.\n\n*Cf*. Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1582-1583.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 137.\n\n791.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have considered the 21-day pump-out test carried out at the Fan Sediments insufficient and/or that it would have agreed with Mr. Neville's opinion that Mr. Jones' predictions of the long-term drawdown were \"*necessarily speculative*\" because the specific yield was not determined during the test.\n\n792.\n\nConsequently, the remaining question for the Tribunal to address is the dispute between Mr. Jones and Mr. Neville as to the appropriate specific yield to be used for the material in the Fan Sediments, which undisputedly affects the expected drawdown across the Afghan border and therefore could have resulted in additional costs for the project.\n\n793.\n\nIn his expert report, Mr. Neville criticized Mr. Jones for having applied a specific yield of 0.15 in the groundwater model he created in 2009. Mr. Neville expressed the opinion that \"[t]*he assumed value of specific yield, 0.15, is representative of coarse-grained materials, whereas the sediments that will be drained are clayey. A value of the specific yield that is smaller, on the order of 0.02, should have been assigned to the Fan Sediments*.\" According to Mr. Neville, the assumption of a 0.15 specific yield led to an underprediction of the potential effects of pumping, specifically of the drawdown cone which would be deeper and \"*significantly broader*\" when using a 0.02 specific yield.970\n\nNeville, p. 3.\n\n794.\n\nMr. Neville explained that values of the specific yield vary from almost zero to 0.50, with values of 0.2 to 0.25 being typical for coarse-grained sands and gravel and values \"*on the order of 0.02*\" for clays and other fine-grained materials. In support of his opinion that the \"*relatively small value*\" of 0.02 should have been used for the Fan Sediments, Mr. Neville presented the following tables:971\n\nSELECTED VALUES OF POROSITY, SPECIFIC YIELD, AND SPECIFIC RETENTION  \n**[Values in percent by volume)**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Material** | **Porosity** | **Specific yield** | **Specific retention** |\n| Soil ----------------------- | 55 | 40 | 15 |\n| Clay----------------------- | 50 | 2 | 48 |\n| Sand ---------------------- | 25 | 22 | 3 |\n| Gravel--------------------- | 20 | 19 | 1 |\n| Limestone------------------ | 20 | 18 | 2 |\n| Sandstone (semiconsolidated) | 11 | 6 | 5 |\n| Granite -------------------- | .1 | .09 | .01 |\n| Basalt (young)--------------- | 11 | 8 | 3 |\n\nSource : Heath (1983; page 9)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texture | Average specific yield | Coefficient of variation (%) | Minimum specific yield | Maximum specific yield | Number of determinations |\n| Clay | 0.02 | 59 | 0.0 | 0.05 | 15 |\n| Silt | 0.08 | 60 | 0.03 | 0.19 | 16 |\n| Sandy day | 0.07 | 44 | 0.03 | 0.12 | 12 |\n| Find sand | 0.21 | 32 | 0.10 | 0.28 | 17 |\n| Medium sand | 0.26 | 18 | 0.15 | 0.32 | 17 |\n| Coarse sand | 0.27 | 18 | 0.20 | 0.35 | 17 |\n| Gravelly sand | 0.25 | 21 | 0.20 | 0.35 | 15 |\n| Fine gravel | 0.25 | 18 | 0.21 | 0.35 | 17 |\n| Medium gravel | 0 23 | 14 | 0.13 | 0 26 | 14 |\n| Coarse gravel | 0.22 | 20 | 0 12 | 0 26 | 13 |\n\nSource : Johnson (1967). reproduced in Healy and Cook (2002; page 91)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Material** | **Specific Yield in [1]** | **Reference** |\n| **Clay** | **0.01 to 0.18** | **A** |\n| **Gravel, fine** | **0.13 to 0.40** | **A** |\n| **Gravel, medium** | **0.17 to 0.44** | **A** |\n| **Gravel, coarse** | **0.18 to 0.43** | **A** |\n| **Limestone** | **0.00 to 0.36** | **A** |\n| **Loess** | **0.14 to 0.22** | **A** |\n| **Sand, fine** | **0.01 to 0.46** | **A** |\n| **Sand, medium** | **0.16 to 0.46** | **A** |\n| **Sand, coarse** | **0.18 to 0.43** | **A** |\n| **Sand.

He also refers to \"[d]*ata presented in the literature* [which] *indicate that even a relatively small amount of clay issufficient to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of coarse-grained materials by orders-of-magnitude so that they act as barriers to groundwater flow*.\" He therefore concludes that a smaller specific yield, \"*on the order of 0.02, should have been assigned for the Fan Sediments*.\"973\n\nNeville, pp. 59, 63.\n\n797.\n\nIn his further analysis, Mr. Neville examined the effects of 56 years of pumping at 730l/s (Initial Mine Development) as well as of 5 years pumping at 730 l/s followed by 30 years of pumping at 1,440l/s (Expansion), assuming a specific yield of 0.15, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively. Using a value of 0.15, the results of Mr. Neville's analysis \"*approximate closely the Shomaker results*\" in both scenarios. Using a value of 0.02, the drawdowns \"*are significantly larger and extend well beyond the Shomaker predictions*.\" Specifically, the predictions made by Mr. Neville of the drawdowns extending into Afghanistan in the different scenarios he analyzed can be summarized as follows:974\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Scenarios** | **Specific yield** |\n|  | **0.15** | **0.02** | **0.05** |\n| **730 l/s, 56 years** | 3-m drawdown: | 3-m drawdown: | 3-m drawdown: |\n|  | **0.15** | **0.02** | **0.05** |\n|  | ca. 5km into Afghanistan | > 25km into Afghanistan | ca. 10km into Afghanistan |\n| **730 l/s, 5 years +****1,440 l/s, 30 years** | 3-m drawdown: ca. 5km into Afghanistan | 3-m drawdown: ca. 25km into Afghanistan 10-m drawdown: ca. 5km into Afghanistan | 3-m drawdown: ca. 15 km into Afghanistan |\n\nNeville, pp. 65, 69.\n\n798.\n\nAs Mr. Neville's report was submitted only together with Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, Claimant's experts did not have the opportunity to address his analysis in their expert reports. In his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Drury was presented with Appendix B to the SMEC 2010 report, on which Mr. Neville had based his illustration of the composition of the three production wells.975 Dr. Drury explained why, in his opinion, the samples collected and reflected in the lithology log presented in Appendix B do \"*not necessarily represent what actually is in that location*\" and that he \"*would not use the lithological description to apply any sort of hydrogeological aquifer characteristic*.\"976 When presented with Mr. Neville's illustration, Dr. Drury first noted that \"*it's a very generalized system because what Mr. Neville has done is, yellow is sand and gravel, based on lithological logs, and anything which is mentioned as fine silty or clayey is blue*.\" He further pointed to the screen locations in the bore which pumped 38 liters a second and explained that \"[w]*e don't get that from clay material. 38 liters a second for 21 days. So, there's obviously something wrong between what's shown in this column and the screens. And this is typical of lithology logs. \u2026 Lithology logs don't usually express what actually is down there*.\"977\n\n**Exhibit CE-1309**.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1348 line 12 to p. 1352 line 6.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1352 line 9 to p. 1353 line 7.\n\n799.\n\nDr. Drury therefore disagreed with Mr. Neville's method for determining the composition of the sediments and stated: \"*What you should use is the gamma log, and the gamma log is there in the geophysical--gamma measures the radiation of the sediment. Clays normally have a high gamma count because of Potassium-40, then clean sands and gravels. So, if you look at the gamma log, if it moves to the left, you're getting clean material. If it moves to the right, you're getting silty clay material*.\"978 Dr. Drury then pointed to an example where the gamma log showed very low radiation that \"*actually is clean sands and gravels, even though the lithological log says silty clay and clay*.\" Dr. Drury also pointed to a deviation to the other side and reiterated that \"*the gamma log is what we always use in assessing the location of screens, not the lithological log*\" because \"*it's a continuous measurement of in situ--because the probe is lowered down the hole 2 or 3 meters per minute. So, you get a continuous log of radiation. So, you can actually see where the clays are, where the sands are by the lithological log. And it's uncontaminated, in that it goes down the sidewall and measures what is there*.\"979\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1353 lines 8-18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1354 lines 3-19.\n\n800.\n\nMr. Neville confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that he had based his analysis on a careful review of the SMEC logs. In response to the question whether it would have been an advantage to be on site and look at the sediments himself, he testified that while this was generally desirable and good practice, it would not have been an advantage \"*if they are drilling with mud,* [because] *then it's really hard to tell what is coming out when. So, you need not an amateur like me, you need a real professional geologist to be doing the characterization, and I assume that the SMEC logs were done by qualified professional geologists. So, if the professional geologists says that it's clayey, then I believe it is clayey. On the other hand, if I were standing at the drill rig and they are drilling with mud and stuff is coming up into the mud pit, then probably I wouldn't be the best judge of what's there*.\"980 Mr. Neville did not confirm, however, that drilling with mud would affect the description in the bore log because, in his opinion, \"[a] *professional geologist would know exactly what they were drilling through, and that's what it looks like they've identified very carefully on these drilling logs*.\"981\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1619 line 22 to p. 1620 line 21.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1625 lines 10-18.\n\n801.\n\nMr. Neville further expressed a different opinion on the relevance of gamma rays, which he described as \"*a very general indicator of a clay content*\" which he would not use to design well screens for which he would rather use \"*grain size measurements taken on-site*.\" Mr. Neville did not agree that gamma rays would tell the \"*exact*\" composition of sediments; he acknowledged that once the device was calibrated, he \"*would take, in a general sense, what the gamma logs are suggesting, but* [he] *wouldn't take them too far*.\"982 At the same time, Mr. Neville testified that he was using gamma rays \"[a]*ll the time*,\" considering it \"*a very good technique in dolostone rocks that we work with in Southern Ontario for distinsguishing between the limestone rocks and shales*\" because of the \"*enormous*\" contrast showing the change in material properties. Mr. Neville further testified that he was not an expert in defining the contrast between sandier material and clayey material but that, when confronted with the gamma logs for the borehole at the Fan Sediments, he was missing a \"*sharp contrast*\" but only saw a \"*random signal*\" or a \"*random variation over the length of the borehole*.\"983\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1625 line 22 to p. 1627 line 14.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1628 line 2 to p. 1632 line 19.\n\n802.\n\nMr. Jones testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the specific yield of 0.15 he used is a \"*standard literature value*\" that he selected based on \"[his] *examination of the cuttings in the field*.\" He stated: \"I *saw plenty of core screen particles. It looks to be normal sediments to me* that have a normal specific yield.\" Mr. Jones clarified that he assumed the 0.15 value based on: \"*My experience, my consultation of text books, my examination of the gamma logs, examination of the core. And my experience I have is different than the experience of field hydrogeologists in that I have studied in my models, I watched specific yields increase in the time scale that you observe it on*.\"984 As to Mr. Neville's emphasis on the presence of clay, Mr. Jones confirmed that \"[t]*here is clay in the sediments. And this idea of 2 percent specific yield is true of clay in a short-term test. That's the water that's initially released when the clay is depressurized, but then over time, the clay continues to be compressed and yields more water. And over a period of years, it will yield an order of magnitude more water than 2 percent*.\"985\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1458 line 5 to p. 1459 line 11.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1442 line 17 to p. 1443 line 2.\n\n803.\n\nBased on the evidence presented by the experts, the Tribunal is not convinced of the accuracy of Mr. Neville's calculation regarding the amount of clayey material contained in the Fan Sediments and of his opinion that the material at the water table, which he considered to be particularly relevant for determining the specific yield, was primarily clayey. Mr. Neville based his analysis on the information in the lithology log contained in Annex B to the SMEC 2010 report. Following Dr. Drury's explanation why the lithology log did not necessary represent the material actually contained at a specific depth of the borehole, Mr. Neville confirmed that when drilling with mud, it might be difficult to tell from which depth material coming out actually stemmed, and that he would not be able to make that determination even if he had been on site and therefore relied on the \"*professional geologist*\" for that purpose. As Dr. Drury was the responsible geologist on site, the Tribunal considers his testimony that one should not rely on the lithology log but rather on the gamma logs particularly relevant. While Mr. Neville testified that he would not rely on gamma logs for the purposes of distinguishing between clayey and sand/gravel materials, he confirmed that he was using gamma logs for distinguishing other materials with a sharp contrast in their gamma radiation. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Jones, who actually selected the specific yield, testified that he had relied not only on gamma logs but also on his examination of the core screen particles as well as on his 29-year experience of creating and studying groundwater models showing that specific yields increase over time.\n\n804.\n\nIn any event, there appears to be common ground to the extent that the sediments are neither composed entirely of clay or clayey material nor that they are entirely composed of coarse-grained material. Nevertheless, Mr. Neville considered it appropriate to apply a specific yield that he considered to be representative of clay, *i.e*., as if the sediments were 100% composed of clay. Mr. Jones, on the other hand, did not simply apply a specific yield for coarse-grained materials as suggested by Mr. Neville. According to the authorities relied on by Mr. Neville, sand and gravel are reported to have a specific yield between 0.20 and 0.25 (Heath), 0.21 and 0.27 (Johnson), or 0.01 to 0.47 (Spitz and Moreno). The Tribunal also notes that the most recent source which, according to Mr. Neville, is based on long-term drainage experiments, reports for clay a specific yield in the range of 0.01 and 0.18. Consequently, and regardless of the specific composition of the material in the Fan Sediments, the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Neville's opinion that a specific yield of 0.02 should have been applied to predict the effects of long-term pumping at the Fan Sediments.\n\n805.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Jones' explanation that the specific yield of clay would increase in the long term because the clay would continue to be depressed and actually yield more water over time. As pointed out by Claimant, this would also be consistent with the range of 0.01 to 0.18 reported for clay based on long-term drainage experiments. Mr. Neville testified that the long-term effect was not known because it could not be derived from the 21-day test and \"[e]*verything else is speculation*.\" He confirmed that it was a \"*reasonable assumption*\" that clay would drain during 56 years of pumping when the water level sinks beneath it; he added that he therefore decided to follow Mr. Jones' model, maintaining, however, what he considered to a \"*more representative value of the specific yield*.\"986\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1636 line 10 to p. 1637 line 19.\n\n806.\n\nMr. Jones disagreed with the criticism expressed by Mr. Neville: \"*We see ample core screen sediments in here. Mr. Neville mentioned some long-term laboratory column experiments, but actual sediments in the ground are under great pressure, and they behave very differently. So the core screen settlements will yield, the specific yield is something like we assumed in the short-term. The fine-grained, the clay sediments will yield them only over long periods of time, but all of the sediments contain this quantity of wate* r.\"987\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1705 line 17 to p. 1706 line 5.\n\n807.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is disagreement between the experts as to whether it would be reasonable to expect that the specific yield of clay increases in the long term. However, on balance, *i.e*., also taking into account the experts' testimony on the amount of clayey material contained in the Fan Sediments and the authorities provided by Mr. Neville regarding the specific yield of the different materials contained in the Fan Sediments, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Jones made an unreasonable assumption regarding the specific yield or that a buyer would have considered that assumption overoptimistic. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that while Mr. Neville repeatedly emphasized that the assumption made by Mr. Jones was not based on the results of the 21-day test because the aquifer had remained confined during this test, Mr. Neville also made clear that he did not consider it appropriate to assume that the aquifer would remain confined in the long term and be limited to the much lower confined storage coefficient yielded by the 21-day test. Accordingly, Mr. Neville's own assumption was likewise not based on these test results but on a value derived from literature and his review of the borehole logs. Given the detailed explanations provided by Dr. Drury and Mr. Jones as to the basis on which the specific yield could be determined, the Tribunal concludes that the assumption made by Mr. Jones was reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n**iv. Whether Claimant Adequately Predicted and Accounted for the Potential Effects of Long-Term Pumping at the Fan Sediments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n808.\n\nOn that basis, the remaining question for the Tribunal to address is whether Claimant adequately predicted the effects of long-term pumping at the Fan Sediments and whether it appropriately accounted for potential risks associated with those effects. In his expert report, Mr. Neville confirmed that when applying the specific yield selected by Mr. Jones, the results of his analysis \"*approximate closely the Shomaker results*\" both for the Initial Mine Development scenario and the Expansion scenario. In both scenarios, the analyses conducted by both experts thus predicted that the area in which a drawdown caused by the pumping for the Reko Diq project would exceed 3 meters would extend about 5 kilometers across the Afghan border.988\n\nNeville, pp. 65, 69.\n\n809.\n\nMr. Neville illustrated the proximity of the results reached by the two experts as follows:989\n\nNeville, pp. 66, 70.\n\n810.\n\nRespondent argues that given that the drawdown would have extended into Afghanistan, Pakistan would have been required under customary international law to notify Afghanistan in advance of the potential transboundary effects and further claims that during potential subsequent discussions between the two countries, the project could not have been developed. In support of this argument, Respondent relies on its expert Dr. Nanni who expressed the opinion that while Pakistan is not party to the UN Watercourses Convention, it would have been obliged under customary international water law to observe the three \"*cornerstone principles*\" codified in the UN Watercourses Convention, *i.e*., equitable and reasonable utilization, obligation not to cause significant harm and general obligation to cooperate, and in order to ensure observance of these principles to provide Afghanistan \"*with timely notification of any planned development of the size of the Reko Diq project before the development is authorized, together with all the documentation relating to the development, including an environmental impact assessment*.\" Dr. Nanni further stated that if objections were raised, negotiations would follow which \"*would likely be lengthy as the issues involved are often complex and sometimes of a political nature*.\"990\n\nNanni, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16-17, 57.\n\n811.\n\nClaimant disputes that Pakistan is bound under customary international law to notify Afghanistan and further disputes that such a notification would have had to occur at the beginning of the project and that negotiations would have delayed the project.\n\n812.\n\nIn support of their opinion that the principles and the obligation to notify under the UN Watercourses Convention are binding on Pakistan under international law, Respondent and Dr. Nanni relied on the ILC Rapporteur on the Law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses, who considered it \"*reasonable to conclude on the basis of state practice that at least three of the general principles embodied in the convention correspond to customary norms. These are the obligations to use an international watercourse in an equitable and reasonable manner, to use such a watercourse in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other riparian states, and to notify potentially affected riparian states of planned measures on an international watercourse*.\"991\n\n**Exhibit NAN-7**, p. 260.\n\n813.\n\nAs pointed out by the ILC Rapporteur, the basis for his conclusion was an examination of State practice. While Respondent and Dr. Nanni point to the existence of the Indus Waters Treaty concluded between Pakistan and India in 1960 as evidence of Pakistan's commitment to these principles, Claimant refers to the absence of evidence that Pakistan has ever provided Afghanistan with a notification regarding the contemplated use of shared watercourses, including in the context of the Kabul river system. Claimant pointed Dr. Nanni to two sections of a report on the \"*Water management of the Kabul River Basin in Afghanistan and Pakistan*,\" which Dr. Nanni had provided with her expert report. In the regional overview, it is stated:\n\n\"*Pakistan has data on the Kabul River, but not of tributaries that flow into the autonomous region of FATA. It does not share data on the Kabul River with any ministries in Afghanistan. Provincial governments in border areas do not exchange hydrological data or meet with their trans-boundary counterparts to discuss water-related issues, according to our investigations in Paktia, Khost and Kunar provinces in Afghanistan and Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan*.\"992\n\n**Exhibit NAN-18**, p. 5.\n\n814.\n\nIn the section of precedents for collaboration, it is further stated:\n\n\"*Afghanistan's recent parallel agreements and discussions with neighbouring states are worth noting because the absence of a treaty with Pakistan is often attributed to Afghanistan's lack of internal capacity. The failure to collaborate in the last decade can equally be seen as a collateral effect of bad relations between the two countries.*\n\n*Despite declarations made by both Afghan and Pakistani leaders at the Islamabad Conference of 2009 to strengthen relations, collaboration has not materialised in the water sector. Engineers on both sides of the Af-Pak border confirm they do not share any hydrological data with their riparian partner, nor are there any joint flood-protection strategies or joint dam feasibility studies*.\"993\n\n**Exhibit NAN-18**, p. 14.\n\n815.\n\nWhen confronted with these statements, Dr. Nanni maintained that to her understanding, \"*they are trying to come together with Afghanistan parties to start discussions on the possibility to agree on the Kabul.*\" In response to the question whether she agreed that the practice of Pakistan and Afghanistan showed that they do not consider that they have a customary law obligation to notify each other and to cooperate, Dr. Nanni further stated: \"*I'm not sure it's universal--it can be stated like this: The two countries are now--specifically, Pakistan is experiencing a difficult period. There is animosity between the two countries that I think I mentioned in my Report. There is contention created by the Durand Line established by the British. So, there is this type of relationship. But I believe that, eventually, this all will end up with fruitful cooperation and an agreement*.\"994\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1682 line 1 to p. 1687 line 17.\n\n816.\n\nDr. Nanni also stated that she was not aware of Pakistan having provided a notification for use of a groundwater source to Afghanistan or to Iran with which Pakistan shares the Upper Tahlab aquifer being used to supply the Saindak mine.995 The Tribunal is aware that Dr. Nanni also noted that this factual question had not been within the scope of her current research. However, taking into account the apparent lack of cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan with regard to the Kabul river basin and in the absence of any evidence that Pakistan considers itself bound by customary international law to provide Afghanistan or Iran with notification of the contemplated use of a shared water source, the Tribunal is not convinced that Pakistan would have considered itself under an obligation to provide such notification with regard to Claimant's contemplated use of the Fan Sediments.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1687 line 18 to p. 1688 line 18.\n\n817.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also notes that as Dr. Nanni confirmed during the Hearing on Quantum, the examples of agreements on groundwater sources she had provided concerned very large aquifer systems with a large number of users.996 By contrast, the Fan Sediments had no users because, as Claimant submitted and Respondent did not dispute, the water was not potable and not suitable for irrigation or agricultural use. According to Mr. Mayer, this aspect formed an important consideration for Claimant's decision to develop the Fan Sediments as its primary water source:\n\n\"*I made this decision after consultation with the experts conducting the water studies, in-house Barrick experts, the permitting team, project team members, and management. This decision was supported by the following considerations: 1) the indication of sufficient water supply from the pre-feasibility studies; 2) the absence of existing groundwater users from the Fan Sediments aquifer in Pakistan; 3) the depth of the groundwater in the area targeted for development making physical access to Fan Sediments aquifer water difficult; 4) the poor quality of the groundwater, which is not suitable for human consumption, livestock, or agriculture; and 5) the suitability of the water-quality for use in the beneficiation process for the mine*.\"997\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1688 line 19 to p. 1690 line 22.\n\nMayer, \u00b6 85.\n\n818.\n\nAs an additional consideration, the Tribunal considers it relevant that, in the Initial Mine Development scenario, Mr. Jones' groundwater model predicted the first drawdown at the Afghan border to occur after 30 years of pumping and the maximum drawdown of about five meters to occur 17 years after the end of mining.998 In the Expansion scenario, the model predicted the maximum drawdown at the Afghan border to occur 20 years after the end of mining; Mr. Jones did not state at what point in time the first drawdown at the Afghan border would occur.999\n\nJones Presentation, p. 7; **Exhibit RE-576-24.04**, Appendix A, pp. A-1 to A-2.\n\nJones, \u00b6 87; **Exhibit RE-576-24.04**, p. B-1.\n\n819.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant \"*would have caused transboundary effects in the short term*,\" *i.e*., already during the three-year construction phase, and relies on Mr. Neville's testimony that \"[a]*fter 21 days, the aquifer responded as if it were still confined, so the responses would actually be observed relatively quickly*.\"1000 However, as noted above, Mr. Neville did not testify that he actually expected the aquifer to remain confined in the long term but rather followed Mr. Jones' assumption that it would be unconfined and only disagreed with the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones. Mr. Neville further specifically stated that he did not investigate the \"*question of timing*\" but rather \"*looked at the long-term results*,\" *i.e*., at the \"*end of operations*.\" When asked whether he could give an opinion on the timing, he made the statement quoted by Respondent \"*if I limited myself to just that data*\" and otherwise noted that \"*beyond the 21 days, we're all speculating*.\"1001\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 157 and note 352, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1708 lines 4-10.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1706 line 18 to p. 1708 line 21.\n\n820.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that any drawdown into Afghanistan would have occurred only several years or even decades into the future. The Tribunal has taken note of Dr. Nanni's testimony that she would still provide a notification to a neighboring State even if it was known that the effects would occur only 30 years into the future in order to place \"*the other countries in the position to opt for an exit strategy*.\"1002 While the Tribunal appreciates Dr. Nanni's opinion that this is a \"*very important issue*,\" the Tribunal does not find it convincing that notice would have to be given decades in advance before it was known whether and to what extent any effect would occur. In particular, given Dr. Nanni's explanation that the notification should include information regarding the possible adverse effects, it does not appear plausible to the Tribunal that notice should be given at such an early point in time and before it was known, *e.g*., whether and, if so, when the expansion scenario would materialize.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1662 lines 4-20.\n\n821.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal also notes that Claimant was considering the use of mitigation measures in order to avoid or mitigate any impact across the Afghan border. As Dr. Drury explained during his direct examination, the drawdown could have been mitigated by a \"*mythical aquifer injection, which is, basically, you actually engineer the aquifer by injecting water into the aqua system in a location where it is sensitive. So, if you've got water levels drawing down and you don't want the water level to extend beyond a certain point, you can actually inject water in bores, across a line. And so, the bores--so the water level on the outside of the injection is still steady state, but on the inside, drawdown still occurs*.\" Dr. Drury noted that SMEC had recommended this mitigation measure in its 2009 report and \"*that trial has been carried out*.\" According to Dr. Drury, it is a \"*very common*\" measure which he had also used for Barrick Coal in Bangladesh and Oakland'coal mine.1003\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1355 line 11 to p. 1357 line 14.\n\n822.\n\nMr. Mayer stated, in response to the question whether he looked into the costs and feasibility of the option to use aquifer injection and its suitability to avoid the issue of entering into the Afghanistan aquifer: \"*Yeah. It is something that, against, it was proposed as a possible mitigation measure, if required. And so the process would be the Feasibility Study's done, we have the project definition, we have our cones of depression. Those cones go to the environmental and permitting group, and they would come back with a recommendation that we would need to find a mitigation strategy. But as far as is it feasible? It certainly is, and it would require \u2026 injecting water along a line or, you know, even infiltrating water along a series of trenches to basically just create a little mound of water*.\"1004 Mr. Mayer further confirmed that this option was still under consideration at the time the SMEC feasibility report was completed. He added that \"*after this study we would have gone forward with the recommendations. I think there were other recommendations outside of that. I think there was to drill some deeper holes and other things that SMEC had proposed, and those things would have taken place in that next phase of work we had planned, which was the \u2026 EPCM phase*.\"1005 Mr. Mayer stated that he did not have a cost estimate for this solution but stated that \"*it would not be a large cost, you know, in comparison to the \u2026 cost of the Project*.\" Referring to the estimate for development of the Fan Sediments of USD 95 million, he stated that they had \"*contingency within the estimate that would cover off, you know, this*.\"1006 Mr. Mayer then explained:\n\n\"*What generally happens is you agree to monitoring and generally like triggers. \u2026 You develop the groundwater model and--with the information that's available, and we had quite a bit of information here with the testing--and that model makes projections and it--most likely a system, a trigger and mitigation system would have been developed based on the model projections. And then monitoring would be put in place and we would actually monitor. Not based on a model, but actually monitoring levels. We would monitor levels, and the levels got to a point where the agreed-upon triggers were, then it usually goes: Increase the frequency of monitoring, develop mitigations system, implement mitigation system, generally, like three triggers such as that. That is typically how it is done.*\n\n*\u2026 And the last bit of that is that we would update the model like probably early on every quarter, take the information that we collect from the pumping and look at it, update the model and, you know, depending on if it's on or off, if it's doing pretty good, you know, we'd decrease the frequency of that.*\n\n*So, yeah, and typically \u2026 what would happen, again, you know, is that, if the \u2026 permitting side never got to the point of recommending that the cross-border issue required mitigation, okay.*\n\n*If they--and I'm not saying is that that was a final decision or anything. I just think that things were cut short before that decision was arrived at. But if it was an issue, then the trigger system would be developed and the mitigation issues would have been developed, you know. And I'd put it this way, you know.*\n\n*As far as costs go, it would not be a large cost, you know, and it wouldn't be--it would be a small amount of water that we'd have to inject. But comparatively of having to go off to Tahlab or Patangaz or Hamun or the ocean, it would be economical, yeah*.\"1007\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1521 line 11 to p. 1522 line 2.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1522 line 12 to p. 1523 line 4.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1523 lines 8-17.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1524 line 15 to p. 1526 line 14.\n\n823.\n\nMr. Neville testified that while he did not consider mitigation measures in his expert report, there were \"*a few big issues*\" regarding aquifer injection, such as where the water would come from and how much the water would have to be treated before reinjecting it. He stated that \"*there's a long history of unsuccessful reinjections systems*\" because \"*wells clog usually very rapidly*\" and \"*very elaborate water treatment*\" is needed. He noted that \"*these systems require a lot of care and feeding*\" in that they have to be monitored carefully over the long term and concluded that \"*when you look in the literature, you see as many successful implementations of groundwater reinjections as you don't*.\"1008\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1710 line 14 to p. 1712 line 19.\n\n824.\n\nDr. Drury confirmed that there is a \"*maintenance issue*\" but maintained that there are \"*some very, very successful aquifer injection systems*\" and expressed the opinion that \"[t]*he ones which fail are the ones which are normally poorly run*.\"1009 Dr. Drury further testified that \"[b]*ased on experience elsewhere*,\" he assumed that the cost for an injection solution would be \"*in the $10 to $20 million range*\" but noted that \"*it has not been costed*\" and \"*it's not inexpensive. And there's also a long-term monitoring and maintenance program, so you need people employed to carry out the maintenance program as well*.\"1010\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1713 line 12 to p. 1714 line 8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1720 lines 3-10.\n\n825.\n\nBased on the testimony of the experts, the Tribunal considers it established that aquifer injection was considered as a potential mitigation measure at the time, which could have been employed if and when it turned out that there would be a considerable impact on Afghanistan territory. In the Tribunal's view, this supports the conclusion that a potential drawdown into Afghanistan would not have prevented Claimant from using water from the Fan Sediments. On the other hand, Mr. Mayer and Dr. Drury confirmed that no cost estimate was included for this potential mitigation measure. While Mr. Mayer considered that the cost would have been included in the cost estimate of USD 95 million for the development of the Fan Sediments, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by this testimony, given that Dr. Drury stated that the solution could have increased costs by USD 10-20 million and there would have been additional cost for the maintenance program. It should be noted, however, that the 11% contingency on the overall capital costs included an 11.75% contingency regarding off site fresh water, *i.e*., an amount of USD 11.3 million.1011\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, Table 23.20.\n\n826.\n\nAs noted above, the residual risk register included the risk that a \"*lender requires the project to engage in cross border consultations with Afghanistan due to the Fan Sediments water supply*.\"1012 However, this risk was assigned only an opex impact but no capex impact and apparently did not include the possibility that Claimant might have to install a monitoring and/or mitigation system.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 26, p. 4; **Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n827.\n\nIn addition, Claimant identified the following risks to which it had not assigned an capex or opex estimate: (i) \"*Cross border consultation & mitigation in Afghanistan caused by the use of water sources resulting in schedule delay and/or community/government opposition or demands*\"; and (ii) \"*Water usage by project causes drawdowns that have impact in* [Iran / Afghanistan] *resulting in diplomatic challenges*.\"1013 As for the first risk, Claimant was planning to mitigate it through a potential \"*ground-truthing*\" field inspection of the affected area in Afghanistan; if impacts turned out to be negligible, it would notify the relevant authorities and if they were significant, it would \"*perform public consultation and develop mitigation/compensation*.\" It was noted that the risk rating was \"*based on reputational or regulatory consequences, not financial or operational*.\"1014 Prof. Davis incorporated this risk into his model as a risk that could cause project start-up delay.1015 As for the second risk, Claimant referred to the development and implementation of a community and government relations strategy; the action step \"*Confirm that water drawdowns in Afghanistan are minimal*\" was marked as completed.1016 Accordingly, Prof. Davis recorded this risk as \"*not material*.\"1017\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. 4.\n\n828.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this confirms that Claimant did not include the costs of having to install a monitoring and/or mitigation system because it had concluded that the predicted water drawdown in Afghanistan would be \"*minimal*\" and thus did not anticipate at the time that there was a significant risk of having to implement these mitigation measures. While this risk assessment may have changed in the future, the Tribunal is not convinced that, based on the information available as of the valuation date, a buyer would have reached a different conclusion and required the addition of further contingency to account for the possibility of having to mitigate drawdowns in Afghanistan.\n\n829.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that neither of the issues raised by Respondent would have affected the feasibility of Claimant's plan for the supply of water to the project. While it appears to the Tribunal that Claimant has not accounted for the potential extra costs associated with having to implement an aquifer injection system to mitigate possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan, the Tribunal does not consider that this would have affected the value of the Reko Diq project from the perspective of a buyer in November 2011.\n\n**6.

Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n830.\n\nClaimant submits that it \"*fully recognized and addressed the relevant security risks, including those associated with transporting the slurry concentrate by pipeline to the port of Gwadar*.\"1018\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 592.\n\n831.\n\nClaimant refers to the chapters on security and risk included in both the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study as well as the \"*comprehensive Risk Register in which risks were catalogued, assigned a mitigation strategy, and tracked with respect to progress*.\"1019 According to Claimant, the costs associated with the security plans were accounted for in the operating and capital cost estimates, with \"*significant contingencies totaling more than half a billion dollars*\" built into the capital expense estimates.1020\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 132, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-124, RE-134** *and* **RE-136**.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 132, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-97**, pp. 1-78, 1-80 and 1-84; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 593-594.\n\n832.\n\nClaimant notes that based on the documentary record and the testimony of Mr. Livesey, the Tribunal held in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that \"*it is plausible that not all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy evolves over time and the further development of the project. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume a failure on the part of TCCP to adequately address security risks in the Feasibility Study*.\"1021 In Claimant's view, Respondent is attempting to recycle the same arguments, which the Tribunal has already rejected in the liability phase.1022\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 595, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 596, 600.\n\n833.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Respondent's expert Mr. Davies confirmed in his expert report that Claimant's security plan for the central facilities at Reko Diq was \"*acceptable*\" and that mining operations could have proceeded with a \"*significant but tolerable level of risk after mitigation had been implemented*.\" He further considered that the security budget for the central facilities \"*appears to be appropriate*\" and noted that \"[m]*any of these measures are in-line with what would be expected of an operating company at this stage of the project cycle*.\"1023 Claimant also refers to its own expert Mr. Ridley, who led the International SOS Security Risk Assessment in 2006 and, after again visiting the site and reviewing Mr. Davies' critique, concluded that \"*TCC's security plan was workable, within expectations and financially viable*.\"1024 Claimant also emphasizes that the 2006 assessment was carried out before any mitigation measures and determined that \"[d]*espite the fact that Pakistan represents a significant risk to specific assets and business operations, strategic planning and supported procedures will ensure a permissible operations environment for businesses*.\"1025\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130, *quoting from* Davies I, pp. 4, 10, 11; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 597-599.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 131, *quoting from* Ridley, \u00b6 50; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 601.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 598, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1279**, p. 13.\n\n834.\n\nWith regard to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline, Claimant notes that it decided to use the pipeline based on \"*extensive trade-off studies showing that a slurry pipeline would be both the safest and most economical option*.\" Claimant refers to the Bankable Feasibility Report prepared by Pipeline Systems Inc. (PSI), which was based, *inter alia*, on an in-person survey of the pipeline route and expressly included security considerations in the design of the pipeline, such as that the pipeline would be entirely underground and avoid sensitive areas.1026 Claimant quotes from Mr. Mayer who supervised the work carried out by PSI and concluded that \"[t]*he Bankable Feasibility Report exceeds what I would expect from a pipeline bankable feasibility design study, and is consistent with design studies I have approved and gone on to execute for other pipeline projects*.\"1027\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 134, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 16 *and* Mayer I, \u00b6 121; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 618-619, 622 *referring to* Livesey V, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 22-24, **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 5, *and* Mayer I, \u00b6 70.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 620, *quoting from* Mayer I, \u00b6 68.\n\n835.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Mr. Davies did not present any example of an attack on a slurry pipeline but only relied on case studies regarding oil and gas pipelines. According to Claimant, these present \"*fundamentally different security risks*\" as they are more vulnerable to attack than a slurry concentrate pipeline because they: (i) \"*tend to be above ground, or are buried only a few inches below the surface, making them easy to locate and access along their entire length*;\" (ii) \"*they contain flammable materials that magnify the effect of any explosion*\"; (iii) \"[r]*epairs are often costly and lengthy*\"; and (iv) there is an \"*economic incentive for those able to steal the contents*.\"1028 Specifically with regard to the \"politically charged\" Sui gas pipeline in Balochistan, Claimant also refers to Mr. Livesey's testimony that \"*the Sui has* [sic] *pipeline and the rest of the gas infrastructure in Balochistan does not pay any royalty or revenue to Balochistan itself, so it's naturally a target because it's seen by the Balochis as being a non-Balochi project. It's being seen as something that is not adding value to them necessarily*.\"1029 By contrast, Claimant argues that the slurry pipeline would be an \"*unlikely target for Baloch nationalist attack*\" as it would run exclusively through Baloch territory and transport slurry of a project in which Balochistan would have held a 25% participation.1030\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135, *referring to* Mayer I, \u00b6 125; Ridley, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1826 and (Day 1), p. 255; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 603, 607, 610, *referring to* Davies I, pp. 35-36, 57-65.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 605, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1255 line 10 to p. 1256 line 3.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 606.\n\n836.\n\nBy contrast, Claimant contends that there would have been \"*no real incentive*\" for insurgents to attack the slurry concentrate pipeline because: (i) the pipeline would be \"*difficult to locate, access, or breach*,\" taking into account the desert environment and Claimant's army patrols, the small size of the pipeline and its burial \"*several feet underground*\" as well as its \"*flexible composition of high density polyethylene lined carbon steel enveloping slurry in a cylindrical container*\"; and (ii) any damage would cause \"*minimal, if any, downtime*\" as the pipeline would be easier to repair than an oil and gas pipeline due to its simple design and, once a breach would be detected through an electronic monitoring system, the concentrate flow could be discontinued so that \"*little, if any, of the procduct would be lost.*\"1031 Claimant also argues that the slurry concentrate would be \"*almost commercially useless to anyone but TCC*\" because it would have to be refined at appropriate facilities which are \"*in short supply*\" in Balochistan.1032\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, Mayer I, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127 *and* Livesey V, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 607-609, 611-616, *referring to* Ridley, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 62-69, 7, *and* Mayer I, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 604, *referring to* Ridley, \u00b6 60.\n\n837.\n\nClaimant notes that the assessments made by Mr. Mayer and Mr. Ridley are supported by the experience with an above-ground slurry concentrate pipeline in Indonesia, which was \"*repaired and restored promptly after an attack*.\" Claimant quotes from an OPIC Memorandum reporting that after an attack with a hacksaw on adjacent slurry and fuel pipelines, \"*within a few hours both pipelines had been repaired and returned to full operation*,\" and after a separate attack, \"*repairs were completed and the pumping of slurry was resumed*\" the following afternoon and \"*no slurry was lost through that pipeline*.\" According to Claimant, the financial impact of the disrutption was thus \"*minimal*.\"1033\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139, *quoting from* **Exhibit SRM-70**, pp. 29-34.\n\n838.\n\nClaimant notes that Mr. Davies referred in his second report to the \"*aggregated consequences of disruption*\" and agreed during the Hearing on Quantum that the main motivation of any insurgent would be to cause downtime and thus financial damage. Therefore, Claimant maintains that \"*the sheer difficulties of causing any disruption, and the minimal economic impact of any such disruption, would have rendered the concentrate pipeline an unattractive target*.\"1034\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140, *quoting from* Davies II, p. 18 *and referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1827-1828.\n\n839.\n\nClaimant further claims that the \"*low risk of an occasional disruption of the slurry pipeline with its minimal finciancial impact*\" would have been preferable over the annual cost of USD 20.5 million for the 6,820 man-force proposed by Mr. Davies to guard the pipeline. In any event, however, Claimant emphasizes that even that cost together with the other security measures proposed by Mr. Davies woud not have rendered the project uneconomic. It refers to its expert Prof. Davis, who calculated that the proposed security costs would have reduced the value of the project from USD 8.5 billion to USD 8.1 billion, without accounting for the reduced probability of shutdowns and interruptions that would have resulted from these increased mitigation measures, and confirmed that \"[t]*he project could easily support the additional costs and remain valuable*.\"1035\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142, *referring to* Mayer I, \u00b6 128 and Ridley, \u00b6 90 *and quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 185; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 644-645.\n\n840.\n\nClaimant submits that based on PSI's design of the pipeline, it evaluated and created mitigation plans for the remaining security risks and quotes from Mr. Ridley's opinion that \"*TCC adequately considered and addressed the existing, relevant and foreseeable security threats specific to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline*,\" and that Claimant's approach \"*was consistent with international standards and related hierarchy of controls, which in turn contributed to the security risks being minimised as far as reasonably practicable*.\"1036\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 623, *quoting from* Ridley, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n841.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's reliance on a statement in the PSI report that \"[n]*o safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to Pakistan*,\" Claimant refers to Mr. Livesey's testimony that PSI is \"*not a pipeline security company, so the security risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under G&A*.\"1037 Claimant submits that its security plan involved strategic partnerships with Balochistan and a \"*network of relationships with service infrastructure providers and the socio-economic participants*\" and notes that the Feasibility Study also set out that \"[t]*he concentrate pipeline route, choke and valve stations, and Panjgur drivers' rest stop will be patrolled by a light truck, a driver, and a guard on 24 h/d, 7 d/w basis. The three stations will be monitored by CCTV and access control and alarm systems*.\"1038 Claimant also emphasizes that its security plan would have continued to evolve over time adapting to changing circumstances and accounting for factors such as new technology throughout the life of the project.1039\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 624-625, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1262 lines 7-13.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 625, *quoting from* **Exhibits CE-98**, p. 2-9 *and* **CE-255**, p. 19-40.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 626, 633, *quoting from* Ridley, \u00b6 79.\n\n842.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study were \"*commensurate with the known information and pre-operational stage of the project*.\" Claimant contends that \"*normal security costs and precautions*\" were included in PSI's estimate and \"*extraordinary*\" security costs were addressed in other sections of the Feasibility Study. Specifically, Claimant refers to the Concentrate Transportation Trade-Off Study prepared by SLI which \"*included the costs for the excluded items*,\" including \"[e]*xtraordinary security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities*.\"1040 Claimant submits that based on the recommendation of the recommendation of Barrick's Senior Vice President & Operations Officer Mr. Wall and his team, \"*an additional layer of security precautions and costs, such as alarm systems, CCTV monitoring and patrolling vehicles and Chokidars was added to PSI's initial recommendations*\" the costs of which are reflected in the capital and operating expense estimates of the Feasibility Study.1041\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 628-630, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-119**, p. 71 *and quoting from* **Exhibit RE-138**, p. 16.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 631, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-124**, pp. 19-20, 19-40, 19-43 and **RE-576-24**, pp. 24-32 to 24-33, **CE-97**, Table 1.31, Livesey V, \u00b6\u00b6 16-24, *and* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), pp. 1164-1165, 1251-1252, 1262.\n\n843.\n\nBy contrast, Claimant considers the cost estimates provided by Mr. Davies \"*exaggerated and unrealistic*,\" arguing that they are exclusively based on case studies which do not include any example from the mining sector and ignore specific characteristics of the area. Claimant quotes from Mr. Ridley's opinion that \"*S-RM's unscientific process resulted in vastly inflated cost estimates, which are divorced from the realities on the ground and offer no useful comparison*.\"1042 Specifically with regard to the estimate of USD 20.5 million in OPEX for 6,800 men to guard the pipeline, Claimant notes that Mr. Davies himself admits that this \"might appear to be a grossly inflated figure\" and acknowledges that Claimant could use less manpower if it used surveillance technology and a detection and alerting system for which Mr. Davies also included a cost estimate of USD 1.5-2 million.1043\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 632, 634, *quoting from* Ridley, \u00b6 84\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 635, *quoting from* Davies, pp. 72, 74, 76.\n\n844.\n\nAs for Mr. Davies' estimate of USD 20-25 million for security hardware to protect the central production facilities, Claimant argues that this would not have been necessary and in even counter-productive and submits that Mr. Davies in any event did not provide sufficient information to show how he arrived at that figure.1044 In Claimant's view, the same applies to Respondent's reliance on \"*security challenges*\" of the Saindak mine, which according to Claimant, in any event has taken a \"*profoundly different approach to security than that adopted by TCC*,\" with a history of negative community relations and the use of a \"*disproportionate security force*\" which worsened its security situation.1045\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 636-637, *referring to* Ridley, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 639-640, *quoting from* Ridley, \u00b6 114 *and* Mayer I, \u00b6 76.\n\n845.\n\nFinally, Claimant emphasizes that Respondent did not raise any security-related concerns about Claimant's pipeline plans prior to this arbitration even though the GOB was informed about the pipeline as an option as early as December 2007. Claimant also refers to Respondent's plans starting at the end of 2010 to construct a natural gas pipeline which, in Claimant's view, would have been more vulnerable to attack than the proposed slurry pipeline. With regard to the Sui gas pipeline invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that the company continues to operate profitably and expand its pipeline network, which it considers as evidence of the viability of its slurry concentrate pipeline.1046\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 646-653.\n\n846.\n\nIn any event, Claimant contends that Prof. Davis' model \"*fully accounts for any security costs*.\" Specifically, Claimant refers to Prof. Davis' inclusion of a 0.5% annual likelihood of permanent pre-mature mine shut-down of Reko Diq due to acts of extreme political violence, which, according to Prof. Davis, \"*reduces the value of the investment by US$ 1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario where this risk would be absent*.\"1047 According to Claimant, this is \"*an extremely conservative assumption*\" given that Mr. Davies acknowledged that there is little risk that potential attacks would permanently shut down operations. Claimant also argues that Prof. Davis' 0.5% probability has a \"*strong evidentiary basis*\" as it is derived from the market pricing of political violence insurance provided by OPIC and conservatively uses the \"*high end of the rate range*.\" Claimant rejects the arguments raised by Respondent's experts and maintains that OPIC rates are \"*true market rates*\" and \"*the best indication of the underlying probability of political violence occurring,*\" regardless of whether or not Claimant would have been able to actually buy OPIC insurance.1048 Claimant also dismisses Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' reference to the separate insurance for business income as irrelevant because even if an investor were to pay an additional premium, \"*the probability and hence rate charged for political violence insurance should not change,*\" as confirmed by the fact that the rates for the insurance of assets and business income are the same.1049\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 178.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 394-401.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 402-403, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1145**.\n\n847.\n\nClaimant further rejects that the analysis made by Dr. Burrows in his second report based on Pakistan's sovereign yield spread reflects the political risk in Pakistan as the spread includes numerous risks that are inapplicable to the project. Claimant also refers to the scholarly papers on which Dr. Burrows relied in his analysis and contends that confirm that the method is improper for the present purposes. Claimant considers this confirmed by the fact that the country risks ratings relied on by Dr. Burrows have stayed nearly constant during the investment period while Pakistan's sovereign yield spread \"*has varied widely for reasons unrelated to political risk*.\"1050 Claimant also notes that it requested the full underlying data and regression analysis allegedly performed by Dr. Bekaert and was provided with a partial response which revealed that the analysis was produced before Dr. Burrows' first report. In any event, Claimant submits that the document produced by Respondent does not contain the underlying data or explain the method used by Dr. Bekaert for his regression analysis, thereby preventing Prof. Davis from fully testing it. According to Claimant, the Tribunal should therefore not give any weight to this analysis.1051\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 405-413, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p-2357, **Exhibits CE-1564**, p. 2 *and* **CRA-55**, p. 472, *and* Davis Presentation, p. 37.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 417-419, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1784**.\n\n848.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Hearing on Quantum raised further questions undermining the reliability of the analysis as the 2015 paper co-authored by Dr. Bekaert did not contain the data used in the regression analysis but Dr. Burrows initially testified that he had relied on an earlier paper from 2014 and then claimed that Dr. Bekaert had updated the model for him, which apparently produced \"*completely different*\" results from the results presented in the 2015 paper.1052\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 420-424, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2847.\n\n849.\n\nClaimant also refers to Prof. Davis' testimony that based on the data he received and tested, \"*the model doesn't work for Pakistan*\" but is \"*off roughly 100 percent, on average*.\" Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis' illustration of the lack of correspondence between Pakistan's sovereign yield spread and political risk which \"*move completely independent from each other*\" and demonstrate that \"[t]*he sovereign spread is moving around for reasons other than political risk.*\"1053\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 429-432, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), pp. 2355-2357, *and* Davis Presentation, pp. 35-36.\n\n850.\n\nIn addition to the 0.5% annual probability, Claimant notes that Prof. Davis incorporated into his model the risks included in the risk register, which included risks raised by Mr. Davies as well as \"*many*\" risks that he failed to identify.1054 Claimant refers to \"*substantial premiums*\" for insurance protecting against the effects of political violence, terrorist attacks, and other security threats in the total amount of nearly USD 9 million per year and adjustments made by Prof. Davis to reflect the residual risk of various security threats reducing the cash flows by USD 13.9 million per year during the first five years of operations and USD 5.7 million per year thereafter.1055\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 145, *referring to* Davis I, Workpaper 25 (SEC05, SEC24, SEC26 and SEC27); Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 643.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 249-250, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6 189, 173, *and* Workpaper 26.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n851.\n\nRespondent considers it undisputed that Claimant was planning to build a mine in \"*one of the most dangerous places in the world*\" and that the security situation in Balochistan has worsened from 2006 to 2011 and continuing thereafter. However, Respondent contends that Claimant \"*made little to no effort to identify and address the security risks that the Reko Diq project faced, largely ignored the threat of sabotage on the pipeline, and completely understated the costs to adequately secure the mine's operations*.\"1056\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 166; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 288, *referring to* Rais, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33, 37-42; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 256-257.\n\n852.\n\nRespondent notes that Balochistan's political and security context is described as \"*hellish complexity*\" and that the political risk in Pakistan is referred to as \"*Extreme*.\"1057 Respondent also refers to its expert Prof. Rais who outlined the dangers posed by Balochistan's geographical location located between Afghanistan and Iran, with the Chagai district being a known smuggling corridor, as well as the presence of Taliban and other militant groups which have been linked to a growing number of violent attacks and the fact that only 5% of Balochistan are under police control. Respondent notes that Claimant has not disputed the data regarding the number of attacks or Prof. Rais' description of the sources of conflicts in the region and the increased incidents or violence.1058 Respondent further explains that the conflict in Balochistan is multi-dimensional and that there would not have been any single group or authority with whom Claimant could have negotiated on the slurry pipeline; in addition, the communities are not necessarily receptive to Western models of community investment and development.1059\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 259, *quoting from* Davies I, p. 13 *and* **Exhibit RE-586**, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 200-202, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1781-1793; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 266, *referring to* Rais, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 24 *and* Davies II, pp. 13-14.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 262-264.\n\n853.\n\nRespondent claims that none of the documents to which Claimant has pointed in this arbitration support that Claimant adequately considered and addressed the security risks for the project. According to Respondent, none of the cited trade-off studies directly address security risks and Mr. Ridley's \"*independent*\" security assessment in 2006 \"*completely ignored*\" the security risks and mitigation plans for the slurry pipeline.1060 Similarly, Respondent submits that the contingency in the Feasibility Study to which Claimant has pointed does not make reference to security issues but rather, by its own definition, addresses only technical engineering issues and unit costs, and specifically excludes \"*labour disputes, change in scope or price escalation*.\"1061 As for the chapter on security, Respondent argues that it \"*only superficially deals with security for the pipeline*,\" which is focused on theft and fraud and not on acts of sabotage or terrorism.1062 Respondent further notes that the socio-economic baseline conducted along the transport corridors, including the pipeline route, referred to \"*security related considerations, more specifically the hostility of the local people towards outsiders*\" as a limitation to the study as well as \"*limited police presence in the surveyed villages along the transport corridor*.\"1063\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 167-169, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-30.01** and **RE-728** and Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1734 lines 14-22 and p. 1735 lines 1-22; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 260, 263, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-30.02**.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 169, *quoting from* **Exhibit 576-23**, p. 23-45.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 258, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-19**, pp. 19-i to 19-ii and 19-27.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 260, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-751**, pp. 1-7 and 4-9.\n\n854.\n\nAs for Claimant's reference to its Risk Register, Respondent acknowledges that it \"*at least mentions security issues*\" but maintains that it \"*underscores TCC's almost flippant approach.*\" In Respondent's view, the mitigation measures identified in response to the highest security are ineffective given that the residual risk rating following mitigation is still high and the likelihood of the threat occurring remains the same.1064 Respondent further claims that Claimant fails to account for the impact to CAPEX and OPEX for most of the risks, including the highest security risks (SEC01, SEC03, SEC05 and SEC08), and fails to accurately add up the impact of unmitigated exposure in its risk register.1065\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 170, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-20.01**, p. TCCA042249; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 259.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 170, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n855.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant \"*only planned to secure the central mining site to a minimum adequate level, avoiding best practices while leaving other areas of the mining operations vulnerable*,\" in particular the pipeline as a \"*critical infrastructure piece*\" to bring the concentrate out of the country.1066\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 257.\n\n856.\n\nAcording to Respondent, the pipeline is \"*the greatest weakness of the project*\" but the Feasibility Study is \"*almost dismissive of the threat*.\" With regard to Claimant's plan to secure the pipeline, Respondent notes that Claimant originally estimated 730 FC personnel to provide security for the project but decided to \"*drastically cut to 200 FC personnel without further explanation*.\" While noting that the original estimate pre-dated the decision to transport the copper concentrate via pipeline, Respondent maintains that Claimant should instead have increased the number following its decision to use a pipeline, due to the \"*dramatically*\" increased footprint of project which went through the \"*highest threat areas*.\"1067 In Respondent's view, both the water suppy pipeline and the slurry pipeline would have been \"*vulnerable to even rudimentary attacks*\" and thus have presented opportunity that would have drawn insurgents from the region.1068\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 171-173, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1327**, p. 12 *and* **RE-576-19**, p. 19-25.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 266-268, referring to Davies I, pp. 32, 48.\n\n857.\n\nRespondent also presents what it describes as \"*some selected examples of negative attitudes expressed towards TCC's plans by a diverse range of actors*,\" such as protests against the hiring of non-locals over locals for the Reko Diq project in 2008 and against the dismissal of local workers in 2009 and 2011 as well as several petitions filed with the Pakistan Supreme Court regarding the GOB's collaboration with Claimant. Respondent also considers that Claimant made \"*elementary errors*\" leading to \"*very negative perception within the communities*\" in the context of hiring people from outside the local area and declining to meet with local tribes along the pipeline route.1069\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 274-279, *referring to* Davies I, pp. 31, 43 and notes 103-107.\n\n858.\n\nRespondent argues that the pipeline is an attractive target for insurgents. Referring to its expert Mr. Davies, Respondent submits that \"*the history of attacks on Balochistan's infrastructure projects and transportation corridors make it highly likely that the pipeline would have been targeted*\" and further contends that the pipeline would go through some of the most dangerous districts in Pakistan. Respondent refers to videos of attacks in Balochistan it has submitted as evidence which demonstrate in its view that insurgents were capable and had the intention to conduct sabotage and inflict maximum damage.1070 In Respondent's view, the video also demonstrates that the GOB's involvement in the project might actually increase the attractiveness as a target given the tension between the nationalist groups and the States and as evidenced by attacks on government-owned pipelines such as the Sui gas pipeline.1071 Respondent also refers to security issues faced by PSI during its trip to survey the pipeline route and an attack on Claimant's community relations team during a field trip on ESIA related work.1072\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 175-176, 180-181, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1799 lines 13-16 *and* **Exhibit SRM-85**;

(ii) the material of the pipeline would be no different from those used in oil and gas pipelines and Claimant was not planning to encase the pipeline in concrete over its entire length or to use reinforced concrete and, therefore the pipeline would not be \"*particularly blast resistant*\" to withstand the explosives used by insurgents in Balochistan; and (iii) pipeline repairs would not be as simple as Claimant has stated given the security issues preventing technical teams from making the repairs.1073\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 177-179, 182, *referring to* Davies II, pp. 28-29 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1810 lines 1-9 and p. 1804 lines 10-18; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 267-268, *referring to* Davies II, pp. 23-28.\n\n860.\n\nRespondent also rejects the argument that oil and gas pipelins are more susceptible to attacks because of their content and argues that \"*the primary driving force of the attacks is not to steal the contents, but to sabotage operations*,\" which would make Claimant's slurry pipeline \"*just as susceptible to delays and financial loss.*\" Respondent acknowledges that \"there have been more incidents involving gas and oil pipelines\" but maintains that this is due to the fact that \"*it is a more established industry with more pipelines and greater opportunity for sabotage*.\"1074 In addition, Respondent argues that while the copper concentrate may not be flammable as oil and gas \"*the end result is not much different when an attack occurs*\" with regard to delays and downtime impacting operations.1075\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 264-265, *referring to* Davies II, pp. 17, 2, 11 and Rais, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 27.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 268, *referring to* Davies II, p. 15.\n\n861.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant failed to fully account for these security risks, including the aggregate impact on the mining operation, and thereby also prevented \"*any accurate determination of TCC's tolerance level to withstand repeated attacks*.\" It further refers to Mr. Davies' testimony that these types of attacks have caused other commercial operations to be halted for long periods or suspended indefinitely.1076 Again referring to Mr. Davies, Respondent submits that in this environment, the question is not if but when an attack might occur.1077\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 183, *referring to* Davies I, pp. 64-65.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 184, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1809 lines 5-10.\n\n862.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant's security plans were \"*outdated, missing information, and generally incomplete*,\" given that: (i) the SOS International assessment in 2006 undisputedly did not evaluate the pipeline route or security threats at Port Gwadar and no supplemental risk assessment was prepared to address these issues or the increasing level of separatist insurgent activity between 2007 and 2011; (ii) Mr. Ridley could not confirm that the Hearing on Quantum that Claimant's international security documents complied with the relevant ISO 31000 standards, stating that he was \"*no actually making a summary judgment as to the overall ISO 31000 as it pertains to TCC*\" and Mr. Ridley received only \"*some*\" of the \"*weekly*\" security reports and testified that he would not be surprised if an attack of Claimant's own personnel would not be included in these reports which, according to Respondent, renders them \"*essentially useless*.\"1078 According to Respondent, the security documents contain \"*further flaws, almost too many to address in the space allotted*\" and Claimant \"*could never have expected a third-party buyer to accept the security situation, plans, or costs as reflected in TCC's documents*.\"1079\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 185-189, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), pp. 1737-1738, 1745-1748, 1753-1758; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 263, *referring to* Davies I, pp. 7-8.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 190-191.\n\n863.\n\nAs to the costs included by Claimant for its security plans, Respondent alleges that they are \"*so paltry as to be embarrassing*.\" Referring to Mr. Davies, Respondent contends that the Feasibility Study does not include adequate security costs for the pipeline and notes that the pipeline's feasibility study expressly excludes security cost, stating that \"[n]*o safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better cost estimate for this important task.*\" PSI further stated in the CAPEX estimate that it \"*does not include any extraordinary provisions for security either during construction of the facilities described here or for the completed facilities after construction of for* [sic] *day to day operations*.\" Respondent further submits that while Claimant insisted that these costs are included in other sections of the Feasibility Study, it has not been able to point to a specific page showing the amount. Specifically with regard to the \"*extraordinary*\" security costs recorded in Chapter 19 on Security, Respondent claims these are \"*simply a CCTV monitoring system and security access system at each of the three pumping stations, leaving hundreds of kilometers of the pipeline in between unsecured*.\"1080\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 192-193, *referring to* Davies I, p. 68 and **Exhibit RE-576-19**, pp. 19-20, 19-40, and 19-43, *and quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 64; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 276-277; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 257.\n\n864.\n\nIn response to Mr. Livesey's testimony that security costs for the pipeline are reflected in various budgetary items, Respondent maintains that it is impossible to tell from these budgets how security is included in these general headings. Respondent also notes that G&A for OPEX includes one item addressing security which amounts to USD 2.5 million per year to secure the entire project. In Respondent's view, this is insufficient.1081 In addition, Respondent notes that Claimant did not assign any CAPEX or OPEX impact to the \"*likely*\" risk of \"*a direct violent attack in-country by any hostile force*\" even though Mr. Cusworth stated that it should be assigned an impact before and after mitigation.1082\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 194, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 405 lines 3-7 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-24**, p. 24-28.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 195, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-952** (SEC03) *and referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 857 lines 2-3.\n\n865.\n\nRespondent refers to an estimate of Mr. Davies who recommends that approximately 6,820 security personnel to provide a high level of resilience and estimates that the following costs would be necessary: (i) approximately USD 20-25 million in CAPEX for the necessary security hardware to protect the central facilities; (ii) an additional USD 13.68 million in CAPEX for the necessary vehicles support for the pipeline's armed manpower teams; and (iii) approximately USD 20.52 million per year in OPEX for the necessary manpower to ensure pipeline security.1083 Respondent considers that this number is \"*not overwhelming force*\" and confirmed by the example of a proposed pipeline running through Afghanistan that would be protected by similar manpower.1084 According to Respondent, Claimant's security budget did not reflect any of these costs, which reduce Claimant's valuation by almost USD 400 million, nor did it give consideration to alternative technologies for securing the pipeline or the costs associated with the downtime caused by potential attacks.1085 Respondent clarifies that downtime is also not accounted for in Mr. Davies' estimate, nor did he seek to determine the costs of \"*inevitable delays that would have occurred in the start-up of the security effort*.\"1086\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 196, *referring to* Davies I, pp. 74, 76; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 281-.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 197, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1807 lines 5-22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 278, 288, *referring to* Davies II, p. 9 *and* Brailovsky/Wells, Section 3.7.2.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 282.\n\n866.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the important point is that Claimant has not conducted \"*a thorough assessment to allow a determination of the project's tolerance level for aggregate losses that it would suffer from multiple attacks*.\" In the absence of an adequate risk mitigation plan, Respondent considers it a \"*completely reasonable approach*\" for Mr. Davies to resort to case studies from similar threat environments.1087\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199.\n\n867.\n\nRespondent further points to the Saindak mine which, in its view, \"*has been able to run a mining operation in Balochistan because it has limited its footprint to a mangeable area, avoided pipeline transport all together, and ensured community engagement and participation in the project*.\" Respondent also notes that it is primarily a socio-economic project of the GOB which \"*naturally gives a higher tolerance level than a purely commercial operation*\" with only a minority interest of the GOB in a portion of the resource. Despite these differences, Respondent submits that Saindak has suffered numerous attacks and therefore invested \"*significant resources*\" into protecting its assets, including \"*large security forces and CSR efforts*.\"1088\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 203-204, *referring to* ul Haque, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 284; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 270.\n\n868.\n\nIn addition, Respondent refers to Mr. Davies' testimony that any insurance coverage that Claimant would likely have obtained would not have extended to business interruption and be limited to physical damage and repair. Respondent considers the results of Mr. Davies' inquiry confirmed by the statement in the Feasibility Study that insurance would be unavailable or too expensive.1089\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 205, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 6), p. 1835 line 19 to p. 1638 line 3 *and* **Exhibit RE-576-2**, p. 2-10.\n\n869.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reference to the adjustments made by Prof. Davis to account for residual risks, in particular the 0.5% annual probability of a permanent shutdown, Respondent considers that none of the projects he referred to are located in a comparable environment in terms of security risks and the proposed pipeline route. Respondent further notes that OPIC insurance on which Prof. Davis based his estimate would not have been available to Claimant and considers it likely that no private insurance options or rates would have been available. As for the insurance premiums referred to by Claimant in the Feasibility Study, Respondent maintains that these do not take into account political risk but exclude \"*terrorism*\" as well as \"*war and civil war*.\" Finally, Respondent claims that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis to cost and production quantities fail to account for the risks of sabotage and direct attacks.1090\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 279-283, *referring to* Davies II, p. 40, **Exhibits RE-729**, **CE-1145**, **RE-576-29**, p. 29-17 *and* **RE-576-30**, p. 30-20.\n\n870.\n\nRespondent concludes that any third-party buyer would have had access to the same information that Pakistan presented in this arbitration and \"*would likely have refrained from going forward*\"; however, if it had decided to proceed, it could not have relied on Prof. Davis' valuation model which, according to Respondent, \"*does not account for the cumulative effect of attacks, the impact of security costs on the financials of the project as management saw it in 2010-2011, and a realistic view of the insurance market*.\"1091\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 206.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n871.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of the issues regarding Claimant's security plan for the Reko Diq project and, in particular, for the slurry pipeline, the Tribunal recalls that Respondent also raised the argument that TCCP failed to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline already in the liability phase of this proceeding. The Tribunal discussed this argument, together with the argument that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source of the project, in the context of its analysis of whether any of the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject the Mining Lease Application and/or by Respondent in the arbitration justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application in November 2011. Similarly to the alleged failure to fully assess the water source, the alleged failure to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline was one of the reasons that Respondent raised for the first time in this arbitration. While finding that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal in any event found that none of these additional reasons, including the reason invoked with regard to the security of the pipeline, would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application.1092\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1231-1233.\n\n872.\n\nAt liability stage, Respondent already invoked the statement made in the Bankable Feasibility Report on the pipeline prepared by the pipeline construction company PSI:\n\n\"*The safety and security only includes minor support for the offices. No safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better cost estimate for this important task.*\"1093\n\n**Exhibit RE-119 / Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 71.\n\n873.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal noted that the security risks had been subject to an extensive discussion with Mr. Livesey, who explained during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that PSI is \"*not a security company so the security risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under G&A.*\"1094 The Tribunal further took note of Mr. Livesey's reference to the chapter on security in the Feasibility Study, including a paragraph describing security measures for the pipeline, and his explanation regarding Claimant's strategy of developing three levels of strategic partnership, which was reflected in the \"*Business Strategy*\" of the Feasibility Study.1095 In addition, Mr. Livesey provided explanations as to why they \"*felt* [that their] *level of risk was much lower than in the gas pipelines*\" such as the Sui gas pipeline. In particular, Mr. Livesey emphasized that, by contrast to the Sui gas pipeline, Claimant would have been paying royalty to Balochistan, sought to have the GOB as an equity stakeholder and planned to engage with local communities to provide ongoing support for the project. Mr. Livesey also explained the basis on which Claimant had concluded that the pipeline was a cheaper and safer option than using trucks or railway for transportation of the concentrate, which included the consideration that pipeline patrols could be sourced from local people while the trucking fleet would have to be sourced from outside of Balochistan.1096\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1249; Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1262 lines 7-13.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1250; **Exhibit CE-98 / RE-576-2**, p. 2-9; **Exhibit CE-255 / RE-576-19**, p. 19-40.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1251-1252; Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1255 line 10 to p. 1256 line 3, p. 1264 line 18 to p. 1265 line 12 and p. 1274 line 11 to p. 1275 line 9.\n\n874.\n\nThe Tribunal noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that there were some \"*residual risks*,\" including security risks, which were identified in the chapter on asset valuation but for which no value was included in the economic valuation of the project.1097 Referring to the scope of its analysis at liability stage, the Tribunal did not agree with Respondent that TCCP therefore failed to adequately address the security risks but considered it plausible that not all risks could be fully assessed or quantified at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy would evolve over time and the further development of the project.1098 Also noting that the GOB had never raised any concerns regarding the security of the pipeline, even though it had been aware of this option since December 2007, and that security risks were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal was not convinced that this additional reason invoked by Respondent in the arbitration played any role in the decision-making process of the Licnesing Authority in November 2011.1099\n\n**Exhibit RE-133 / RE-576-28**, p. 28-30.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1253-1255.\n\n875.\n\nBy contrast to the allegation that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source for the project, the allegation that it failed adequately to assess the security risks for the pipeline did not form part of Respondent's Reconsideration Request which it filed shortly after submission of its Counter-Memorial on Quantum. However, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that its more general note regarding the scope of its findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is worth recalling in the present context as well. Specifically, the Tribunal noted that it \"*did not make a finding in the liability phase that the Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project at the time. It only assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support of its position that denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on justifiable reasons*.\"1100 Similarly to the issues regarding water and metallurgy, which were explicitly discussed in the Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, neither of the Parties presented any opinions from independent experts on the security plan for the pipeline or the project in general in the liability phase as they have now done in the quantum phase. Consequently, the Tribunal will also make its findings on security based on the Parties' completed written submissions and the hearing of the fact and expert witnesses during the Hearing on Quantum.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 99.\n\n876.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the allegation in the liability phase was limited to the security risks regarding the slurry concentrate pipeline which was supposed to transport the concentrate from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar, Respondent's argument in the present phase is broader in that it alleges that Claimant generally failed to address the security risks that the Reko Diq project faced. However, the debate between the Parties and their experts again focused on the slurry pipeline. Two further aspects were, rather briefly, mentioned, *i.e*., the central facilities at Reko Diq and the water supply pipeline from the Fan Sediments to Reko Diq. The Tribunal will therefore first address Claimant's security plan for the project's central facilities and then turn to the security plan for the off-site facilities and, in particular, the slurry concentrate pipeline.\n\n**i. Whether Claimant Adequately Accounted for the Security of the Project's Central Facilities at Reko Diq**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n877.\n\nAs for the central facilities, Respondent contends that Claimant \"*only planned to secure the central mining site to a minimum adequate level, avoiding best practices*\" and considers the security plan for the central facilities of \"*low average standard*.\"1101 Respondent's expert Mr. Davies stated in his first report:\n\n\"*Chagai district, in which Reko Diq is situated, experiences a low frequency of serious security incidents compared to many other districts in Balochistan. The apparent reasons for this are subtle and are explained in Section Two of our report. In theory, this isolates Reko Diq from the worst effects of the Baloch separatist insurgency and, as a result, mining operations at Reko Diq itself could probably have proceeded with a significant but tolerable level of risk after mitigation had been implemented*.\"1102\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 257.\n\nDavies I, p. 4.\n\n878.\n\nMr. Davies further considered that there were \"*some positive elements in TCC's approach to security planning*,\" which included that \"[t]*he strategy for protecting the central facilities at Reko Diq met what we would consider to be an acceptable standard*.\" Mr. Davies also referred to Claimant's \"*sensible measure*\" to fly in non-local workers into Reko Diq, the issuance of weekly and monthly security reports which he considered to be \"*of an average standard compared across the security management industry*,\" the commissioning of a Security Risk Assessment by SOS International and the conducting of risk workshops, which included a focus on security risks. Mr. Davies concluded that \"[m]*any of these measures are in-line with what would be expected of an operating company at this stage of the project cycle. However, in overview we would characterise the security content of TCC's Feasibility Study as achieving a low-average standard compared to industry peers*.\"1103 While noting that Claimant's security plans were generally \"*of an acceptable standard*,\" Mr. Davies criticized an absence of any plans for the security of the export pipeline. Similarly, while Mr. Davies further considered that \"[t]*he security budget for the central facilities appears to be appropriate, although we interpret the standards for fencing to be below what is normally implemented for critical national infrastructure facilities,*\" he then criticized the budget for protecting the export pipeline as \"*grossly inadequate*.\"1104\n\nDavies I, p. 10.\n\nDavies I, pp. 10-11.\n\n879.\n\nBased on case studies set out in detail in his report, Mr. Davies provided a summary of his \"*cost estimates for security in this type of high threat environment*,\" which included an item \"*Security hardware to protect central production facilities*\" with an CAPEX estimate of USD 20-25 million, noting that \"[t]*his is based on a higher standard of protection than that described in TCC's FS and it aligns with other benchmarked projects in comparable threat environments that have implemented a CNI approach to security risk mitigation*.\"1105\n\nDavies I, p. 76.\n\n880.\n\nMr. Davies derived this estimate from a case study of oil producing field in Oman. Following an outline of the \"*key line components of the mitigation strategy*,\" Mr. Davies stated that \"[t]*he specifications are broadly aligned with those described in TCC's FS, although they are more clearly defined because they reference internationally recognised standards*.\" He noted that \"[t]*he main difference is the standard of perimeter fencing*.\" Mr. Davies stated that the overall cost for these components slightly exceeded USD 50 million, which he considered to be \"*at the high end of the range*\" due to the standards imposed by the Government of Oman and therefore concluded that \"*a CAPEX in the region of US$ 20 \u2013 25 million would be reasonable balanced against the realistic level of threat. This is therefore the figure we suggest as a benchmark for the Reko Diq project*,\" *i.e*., the \"*likely costs of the security hardware to protect the central facilities*.\"1106\n\nDavies I, pp. 71-72.\n\n881.\n\nClaimant's expert Mr. Ridley agreed with Mr. Davies' conclusions that Claimant's \"*strategy for protecting the central facilities at Reko Diq met \u2026 an acceptable standard*\" and that \"*mining operations at Reko Diq itself could probably have proceeded with a significant but tolerable level of risk after mitigation had been implemented*.\"1107 He noted that this was in line with the determination in SOS International's Security Risk Assessment in 2006 that \"[d]*espite the fact that Pakistan represents a significant risk to specific assets and business operations, strategic planning and supported procedures will ensure a permissible operations environment for businesses*.\"1108 Mr. Ridley further agreed with Mr. Davies' conclusion that \"[t]*he security budget for the central facilities appears to be appropriate*.\"\n\nRidley, \u00b6 38.\n\nExhibit CE-1279, \u00b6 1.1.1.\n\n882.\n\nAs for Mr. Davies' estimate of additional CAPEX costs for security hardware to protect the central production facilities, Mr. Ridley explained why, in his opinion, the higher costs were unnecessary and even counterproductive:\n\n\"*A higher standard of perimeter fence would have been unnecessary under the circumstances. In the IMD Feasibility Study, TCC provided for a 2 m high chain link perimeter fence* 'with the capability of being upgraded to a medium security fence that would include razor wire coils on top and bottom, if deemed necessary.' *TCC intended the perimeter fence to serve as* 'a site demarcation boundary to prevent unintentional intrusion, and will serve as a deterrent for intentional pedestrian or vehicle intrusion.' *Any sensitive areas received higher protection, including high security areas surrounded by* 'two parallel 3 m high chain link fences with a 10\u00b0 angled fence facing outwards and a 5 m wide patrol road in between' *with* 'a 0.75 m barbed tape coil on top and two 0.90 m coil of flat wrap barbed tape on the bottom.' *Applying S-RM's proposed level of security to the entire perimeter added little value, while also harming community relations and caused human rights issues by restricting access for local Bedouins and migrant travellers passing through the areas*.1109\n\nRidley, \u00b6 100, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-19**, p. 19-13.\n\n883.\n\nMr. Ridley further considered that Mr. Davies did not provide sufficient information for his conclusion that a figure of USD 20-25 million would have been appropriate or what costs this figure would include.1110\n\nRidley, \u00b6 101.\n\n884.\n\nAt the outset of his second report, Mr. Davies noted that he had provided \"*an objective and balanced commentary on TCC's approach to security risk assessment and mitigation. Where the facts and methodology are appropriate, I have chosen not to question TCC's work. For example, I am content to leave undisturbed TCC's overall security plan at the mine's central facilities and the general approach used in the ESIA*.\"1111 Specifically with regard to the protection of Reko Diq's central facilities, he clarified the following:\n\n\"*I regard TCC's security plans for the central facilities as reaching a minimum acceptable standard, as measured against industry peers. TCC's approach to security planning is not revolutionary, but merely adheres to common practices (and not necessarily* 'best' *practices) in the extractive industries. For example, my explanation of perimeter protection standards at paragraph 3.3.2 below, makes it clear that TCC, advised by International SOS, intended to implement a level of protection below accepted UK and EU norms. I accept that this does not necessarily imply a* 'kill point' *for the project, for reasons I have explained in my First Expert Report. However, it does lead me to question whether TCC understood fundamental principles in aligning mitigation with threat.*\"1112\n\nDavies II, pp. 7-8.\n\nDavies II, p. 8.\n\n885.\n\nMr. Davies restated his critique regarding a \"*low standard of perimeter protection*\" below \"*the currently established benchmark in the UK and the European Union*\" and maintained his cocnclusion that \"*TCC's plans for the central facilities were* 'a low-average standard compared to industry peers'. *TCC was accepting common practice, not pursuing best practice*.\"1113 Mr. Davis further stated that \"[i]*n the case of the central facilities, because protecting a static site is a straightforward security management task, I accept that the plan would most likely have developed. Over time, TCC may have achieved a tolerable balance of risk versus mitigation. It can also reasonably be argued, that companies can absorb high consequences, resulting from attacks on central facilities, if their risk tolerance is high enough*.\"1114\n\nDavies II, pp. 11-12.\n\nDavies II, pp. 12-13.\n\n886.\n\nBased on the opinions offered by the Parties' experts, the Tribunal considers it common ground that Claimant's security plans for protecting the project's central facilities at Reko Diq met an acceptable standard. While Mr. Davies clarified in his second report that he considered specifically the plans for the central facilities to be of \"*low-average standard*\" (in his first report, Mr. Davies had use this term to describe the security content of the Feasibility Study as a whole, *i.e*., including the plans for the pipeline), he also stated that he was \"*content to leave undisturbed TCC's overall security plan at the mine's central facilities*\" and identified only one specific criticism regarding the standard of the perimeter fence. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Davies did not engage in his second report with the arguments raised by Mr. Ridley that the Feasibility Study also included higher protection for sensitive areas and that a higher perimeter would have added little value and even harmed community relations. Mr. Davies also did not provide any additional information as to how he had arrived at his estimate of additional CAPEX required to implement the higher security standard he considered appropriate. In the absence of any further substantiation, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have included the additional CAPEX estimate of USD 20-25 million in its valuation of the Reko Diq project.\n\n887.\n\nThe Tribunal has no reason to believe that a buyer in November 2011 would have considered Claimant's security plans for protecting the central production facilities at Reko Diq, including the cost estimates, insufficient. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Davies explicitly accepted in his second report that the security plan for the central facilities \"*would most likely have developed*\" and that \"[o]*ver time, TCC may have achieved a tolerable balance of risk versus mitigation*.\" In the Tribunal's view, it is plausible and confirmed by the record that Claimant would have continued to develop its security plans and risk mitigation strategies and that it would also have been able to react to a potential change in the assessment of certain risks. Conseqently and given the absence of a substantiated challenge regarding the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study for the central facilities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant's security plans for the project's central facilities would have been considered adequate for a project at the development stage of Reko Diq.\n\n**ii. Whether Claimant Adequately Accounted for the Security of the Project's Off-Site Facilities, in Particular the Pipeline to Port Gwadar**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nWith regard to the security of the off-site facilities, the criticisms raised by Respondent and its expert concerned primarily the slurry concentrate pipeline from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar. However, the Tribunal notes that Respondent also referred to the water supply pipeline from the Fan Sediments to Reko Diq and considered that \"[b]*oth of these pipelines would have been vulnerable to even rudimentary attacks using rockets, grenades, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs), all of which are common weapons in Balochistan*.\"1115\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 267.\n\n889.\n\nMr. Davies noted in the context of a summary he provided on opinions expressed by \"*experienced and non-aligned mining investors and senior executives*\" on the insurability of the Reko Diq project that these individuals considered \"[m]*ost aspects of the project would have been insurable, but WTPV risks looked very negative with respect to the export pipeline, and to a more or less equal extent the water supply pipeline*.\"1116 Mr. Davies did not provide any further assessment or opinion on the costs estimated by Claimant for protecting the water supply pipeline. In his second report, Mr. Davies restated his concerns regarding the vulnerability of the slurry pipeline and noted that \"*the known threats in the operating area... apply to other commercial operations outside the perimeters of the central facilities, not just the slurry pipeline*.\"1117 He did not provide any further assessment regarding the security risks affecting other commercial operations such as the water supply pipeline.\n\nDavies I, p. 24.\n\nDavies II, p. 7.\n\n890.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal considers that while it has no basis for calling into question specific cost estimates with regard to the water supply pipeline, it will bear the argument in mind that certain risks affecting the slurry pipeline could likewise have affected the water supply pipeline (or other commercial operations outside Reko Diq) and that such risks should therefore be addressed with regard to both pipelines in a valuation of the Reko Diq project.\n\n891.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will now turn to the dispute between the Parties as to whether Claimant had a feasible plan to address the security risks affecting the slurry pipeline from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar and whether the Feasibility Study and/or Prof. Davis adequately accounted for these risks in their estimate of the associated cost impact.\n\n892.\n\nIn October 2009, the company Pipeline Systems Incorporated (PSI) completed a Reko Diq Concentrate Pipeline Bankable Feasibility Study, which was appended to the Feasibility Study. In this report, PSI provided an estimate of the total capital costs \"*for the Reko Diq Copper concentrate pipeline and associated facilities in PSI's scope*,\" which amounted to USD 318.6 million for the route to Port Gwadar. PSI expressly noted that \"[i]*tems that are not included in the capital cost estimates*\" were, *inter alia*, \"*Extraordinary security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities*.\"1118 In Chapter 16 on Pipeline CAPEX and OPEX, PSI clarified that \"[t]*his capital cost estimate does not include any extraordinary provisions for security either during construction of the facilities described here in or for the completed facilities after construction or for day to day operations*.\"1119 Specifically with regard to the four pump stations along the pipeline route, PSI noted that its estimate \"*includes a minimum security provision, which could be considered normal for most remote locations. We believe that this level of security for this project may be inadequate considering the local political environment; the owner may decide to take extraordinary precautions to protect these facilities*.\"1120 In addition, PSI made the statement on which Respondent had also relied in the liability phase of the arbitration:\n\n\"*Safety and Security - The safety and security only includes minor support for the offices. No safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better cost estimate for this important task*.\"1121\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 11.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 64.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 71.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 71.\n\n893.\n\nBased on these express statements, it can be considered common ground that the capital cost estimate provided by PSI did not include costs for \"*extraordinary security*\" and that, as indicated by PSI itself, it was therefore appropriate to include additional security costs accounting for \"*the local political environment*\" and \"*the unknown issues related to Pakistan*\" in the estimate for capital and operating expenses in the Feasibility Study. In this regard, Claimant again referred to Mr. Livesey's testimony at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that security risk issues were not within the expertise of PSI and were therefore \"*transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under G&A.*\"1122\n\nTranscript (Day 5), p. 1262 lines 7-13.\n\n894.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, the Copper Transportation Trade-off Study, which was also appended to the Feasibility Study as Appendix 30.02, noted in the chapter on the slurry concentrate pipeline that the capital and operating costs for the concentrate pipeline and associated facilities prepared by PSI excluded certain items such as \"*Extraordinary security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities*\" and stated that \"*SLI has prepared and included the costs for the excluded items.*\"1123\n\n**Exhibit RE-138**, p. 12.\n\n895.\n\nThis separation of tasks is confirmed in the Feasibility Study's chapter on capital costs:\n\n\"*The capital cost estimates of the pipeline have been based on the pipeline route alignment developed using Google Earth and verified during the field trip as much as possible and the pipeline design developed by PSI during a feasibility study that is detailed in this report.*\n\n*Provisions for security during construction of the facilities and for the completed facilities after construction of for day to day operations have been included by SLI*.\"1124\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-19.\n\n896.\n\nSpecifically with regard to security for the pumping stations which PSI had considered potentially inadequate, it is noted that \"[a]*dditional fencing has been added by SLI for security purposes*.\"1125 As pointed out by Respondent, the Feasibility Study further incorporated \u2013 without any changes \u2013 the statement made by PSI on \"*Safety and Security*\" which is quoted in paragraph 892 above. However, given that a whole section of PSI's report was incorporated into this particular section of the Feasibility Study and taking into account the other references that SLI in fact did include additional security provisions for the slurry pipeline, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the PSI statement was only a remnant that Claimant omitted to amend.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-25.\n\n897.\n\nBased on a comparison of the capital cost estimate prepared by PSI and the capital cost estimate included in the chapter on capital costs in the Feasibility Study, it is apparent that the costs for the security provisions included by SLI were not directly added to the capital cost estimate for the pipeline. Specifically, PSI concluded that the sub-total capital cost (before EPCM and contingency) were USD 232.2 million plus 3.8 million for spares and commissioning, *i.e*., approximately USD 236 million. PSI also recommended a contingency of USD 47.2 million.1126 As per the Contingency Summary contained in the chapter on capital costs in the Feasibility Study, Claimant included a capital cost estimate for \"*Slurry Pipeline (PSI)*\" of USD 236.3 million and a contingency of USD 47.3 million.1127\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 64.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, Table 23.20.\n\n898.\n\nHowever, it is stated in the Feasibility Study that the owner's cost estimate includes, *inter alia*, the following information and project data: \"*security costs estimate: manpower readiness (December 2009) by TCC*.\"1128 While the owner's cost does not include a specific line item for security, it is explained that the line item \"*field general expenses*\" representing 36% of the owner's cost includes an estimate of USD 2.06 million for security contractors, which is based on information provided by TCC's security team, and also provides a breakdown of this estimate.1129\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-30.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-36 and Table 23.12.\n\n899.\n\nClaimant further pointed to the chapter on security in which it is stated that \"[t]*he off-site facilities security system will encompass the following: three slurry pipeline pump stations; and raw water pump station plus booster pump station*.\" It is further stated that \"[t]*he defined security system equipment and materials are included in the cost estimates for this FS. The security system is to ensure security access and control and the CCTV system design to ensure the integrity of the mine and off site facilities*.\" The chapter then provides a detailed description of the integrated CCTV (closed circuit television) and access control system, access cards and detection system.1130 As part of the chapter on Security Action Management Plans, reference is made to a Product Transportation Plan including the following measures:\n\n\"*Product will be sent via concentrate pipeline direct to Port Gwadar via four pump stations, one on site and three pump stations on the pipeline.*\n\n*These pump stations will be secured by a high security fence and manned by a team led by a TCC security officer and three supervisors working 24 h/d, 7 d/wk. They will be assisted by two levies per shift and locally employed Chokidars/watchmen.*\n\n*The access road will be patrolled by a security officer and levies in a vehicle supplied by TCC. They will be stationed at each pump station.*\n\n*Each vehicle will be supplied with adequate communications to enhance their effectiveness. These security vehicles will be fitted with GPS monitoring capability.*\n\n*Slurry will be subject to density monitoring/process control as it leaves the mill site and arrives at any offsite dewatering facilities.*\n\n*All vehicles entering TCC areas will need to go through security clearances/scanning at security checkpoints outside/within perimeter fenced areas.*\n\n*Further detail can be found in Section 9, Infrastructure and Services*.\"1131\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-19**, pp. 19-20 to 19-23.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-19**, p. 19-27.\n\n900.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the construction phase, it is stated that the concentrate and water pipelines and pumping stations will be monitored as follows:\n\n\"*Concentrate Pipeline*\n\n*The concentrate pipeline, and pumping stations will be patrolled by a patrol consisting of a light truck, a driver, and a guard on a 24 h/d, 7 d/wk basis. In addition, the valve and choke stations will be monitored by an alarm system. Water Pipeline and Pumping Stations*\n\n*The water pipeline and pumping stations will be monitored by a Chokidars, who will be supported by patrol consisting of a light truck, a driver, and a guard between the Fan Sediments and site. In addition, the pumping stations will be monitored by an alarm system*.\"1132\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-19**, p. 19-37.\n\n901.\n\nAs for the operations phase, similar statements are made:\n\n\"*Concentrate Pipeline and Panjgur Rest Stop*\n\n*The concentrate pipeline route, choke and valve stations, and Panjgur drivers' rest stop will be patrolled by a light truck, a driver, and a guard on a 24 h/d, 7 d/wk basis. The three stations will be monitored by CCTV and access control and alarm systems.*\n\n*Water Pipeline and Pumping Stations*\n\n*The water pipeline and pumping stations will be patrolled by a roving patrol.*\n\n*The pump stations will be monitored by an alarm system*.\"1133\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-19**, p. 19-40.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been provided with any indication that the capital costs for the security measures described in the chapter on security were not included in the capital cost estimate provided in the Feasibility Study.\n\n903.\n\nIn addition to capital costs, Mr. Livesey also testified that security costs were added to the OPEX estimate under G&A. As pointed out by Claimant, the G&A Operating Cost Breakdown includes a line item \"*Security*\" which is accounted for with USD 0.06 per ton of ore milled over the life of operations.1134 In absolute terms, Claimant estimated that G&A costs would include annual costs of 2.3 to 2.5 million per year for security.1135 The following explanation was provided with regard to the \"*security*\" line item:\n\n\"*It is envisaged that the security forces required during operations phase will be a combination of TCC personnel supervising a security contractor, plus Frontier Corps (FC) personnel and police support (Levies).*\n\n*For the purposes of the OPEX estimate, the security staff was estimated to be comprised of:*\n\n*\u2022 TCC personnel: a security country manager, site managers, superintendent, senior security officers, senior supervisors, supervisors, control room operators, security drivers and guards. A total payroll of 115 people;*\n\n*\u2022 Security contractor: a third party service administered by TCC personnel and composed mainly of supervisors and guards. A total of 67 people with a cost of $3 750/person/a;*\n\n*\u2022 Frontier Corps (FC): a Federal military force with personnel recruited mostly from the tribal areas and with officers from the Pakistani Army. A force of 200 persons was included in the estimate. A total of $96 600/a was allocated to supporting the government personnel (it is assumed that sporadic lodging and catering is included in this cost);*\n\n*\u2022 Police Corps: all operational activities of the Balochistan police force are being supervised and monitored from the central police office in Quetta. A total of $91 500/a was allocated for supporting the government personnel (this includes sporadic lodging and catering); and Chokidars / Watchmen: composed of patrol and guard personnel. A total force of 44 persons at a total annual cost of $75 900/a was allocated for this item.*\n\n*An allowance was made to include security audits performed by a national contractor*.\"1136\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-1**, Table 1.31 and **Exhibit RE-576-24**, Table 24.5.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-24**, Table 24.12.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-24**, pp. 24-32 to 24-33.\n\n904.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal cannot follow the argument that the capital and operating cost estimates in the Feasibility Study did not include any security costs for the pipeline. To the contrary, the chapter on security set out the security measures that Claimant was planning to implement for the slurry pipeline (as well as for the water supply pipeline) and the chapters on capital and operating costs included corresponding estimates for the costs associated with implementing these measures.\n\n905.\n\nThe question that remains to be answered is whether these estimates and the underlying security measures that Claimant was planning to implement would have been considered adequate and sufficient by a buyer in November 2011.\n\n906.\n\nMr. Davies stated in his first report that in his opinion, Claimant included \"*wholly inappropriate and impractical planning and budgetary assumptions for pipeline security in the Feasibility Study*.\" He noted that \"[p]*ipeline security is not explicitly mentioned in the applicable line items of TCC's Risk Register (i.e. SEC 03 & SEC 10), and we therefore assume that TCC did not formally assess the security risks to the export pipeline*.\" Based on the case studies presented in his report, Mr. Davies considered it mistaken to assume that buried pipelines would be less vulnerable to sabotage and that natural gas pipelines would be more \"*politically charged*\" than other types of pipelines. In his opinion, \"*TCC's apparent failure to appreciate the threats to the export pipeline and the aggregated consequences of sabotage would have introduced a very significant probability of project failure*.\"1137\n\nDavies I, p. 4.\n\n907.\n\nMr. Davies raised concerns with regard to what he considered to be an \"*absence of any plans dealing with the security of the export pipeline. We accept that construction and operation of the pipeline would happen later in the project, but we would expect at least some meaningful planning estimate to have been conducted, in order to support considerations about the feasibility of perhaps the most important part of the project plan*.\" Specifically, Mr. Davies considered that the \"*Security Execution Plan for Transportation Rout* [sic] *Survey*\" was no more than a survey of the pipeline route in October 2008 and labelled the quality of the document \"*concerning*.\" Mr. Davies also expressed the opinion that \"[t]*he budget for protecting the export pipeline is grossly inadequate. We assert that this is because TCC's security department seriously misunderstood the inherent vulnerabilities of pipelines in high threat environments and thus could not provide a sensible cost estimate for protecting the pipeline*.\"1138\n\nDavies I, pp. 10-11.\n\n908.\n\nBased on a case study of an oil export pipeline in the Kurdish region of Iraq, Mr. Davies provided an estimate of what he considered necessary to protect the slurry pipeline from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar. He stated that the \"*key line components of the pipeline protection strategy*\" for the Iraq oil pipeline included \"[o]*ne permanent guard post every 2km*,\" with \"[e]*ach guard post* [being] *manned by 20 soldiers*,\" resulting in \"*approximately 450 soldiers for the pipeline's 45km length*\" and an approximate cost of USD 8.2 million per year. According to Mr. Davies, such cost is \"*in line with expectations, based on similar projects in moderate to high threat environments*\" and referred to another case study he had presented on a zinc mining project in Yemen which included a 4km water pipeline guarded by 60-75 soldiers at a time. He considered the total manpower requirement \"*realistic in the absence of an automated alarm triggering system*.\"1139\n\nDavies I, pp. 72-73.\n\n909.\n\nOn the assumption that there is a linear relationship between troop levels and length of the pipeline, Mr. Davies scaled up the troop levels deployed in Iraq to the length of the Reko Diq pipeline and concluded on \"*6,820 personnel to secure the entire pipeline*.\" Mr. Davies himself noted that \"[a]*t first glance this might appear to be a grossly inflated figure*\" but considered it supported by the \"*9,000*\" personnel deployed to protect the Sui gas pipeline. Mr. Davies further noted that two Pakistani army officers serving with the Frontier Corps provided the same estimate for dealing with this task but that they had also \"*considered the task to be 'impossible' in practice, owing to their own experiences of Baloch insurgents. Apart from the impractical scope of the defensive task, the officers' main objection was the threat to patrols and resupply movements off-road in the vicinity of the pipeline*.\" Mr. Davies also noted that \"[i]*n the absence of effective technology such as surveillance UAVs (drones) and Distributed Sensing, the manpower required to ensure adequate levels of protection will grossly breach the reasonable component of the ALARP principle*.\"1140\n\nDavies I, p. 73.\n\n910.\n\nMr. Davies himself considered that the cost resulting from his estimate of required manpower was \"*of course unrealistic*\" and therefore considered that Claimant \"*should have considered options that combined detection and alerting technology with a more flexible armed response based on more intelligent deployment of personnel*.\" He nevertheless provided a calculation of the \"*costs of relying on manpower alone to provide adequate protection to the export pipeline*\" based on pay scales advised by a serving officer and estimated that costs for soldiers, weapons and vehicles would together require an additional CAPEX of USD 13.68 million and an additional OPEX of USD 20.52 million per year.1141\n\nDavies I, p. 74.\n\n911.\n\nMr. Davies then considered alternative options for protecting the pipeline \"*without reducing mitigation below a tolerable level*\" but considered that: (i) \"*reducing troop deployment numbers to save costs would clearly not be justifiable*\"; (ii) employing drone technology would have been \"*unlikely \u2026 to offer significant cost reductions*\" given the constraints against this technology and the unavailability of commercial drone technology in November 2011; and (iii) \"*transferring the risk to insurance is unrealistic based on TCC's own admission*.\" Mr. Davies therefore concluded that \"*given such an unfavourable balance between risk and cost of mitigation, terminating the activity appears to be the most viable course of action*\" and \"*other means of exporting product should be considered potentially more viable than the pipeline*.\" Noting that \"*rail transport is too inherently vulnerable to sabotage to be seriously considered as a viable option, and in this respect rail compares closely to pipelines*,\" Mr. Davies concluded that \"[b]*ased on our own experience, we consider than large and less frequent convoys, packaged with robust defensive armed escorts, offer the optimum cost versus mitigation balance*.\"1142\n\nDavies I, p. 75.\n\n912.\n\nIn his summary of costs, Mr. Davies included the CAPEX and OPEX estimates for a 6,820 men force but noted that \"[t]*his level of cost may well be considered unrealistic. If so, then S-RM contends that the export pipeline option is potentially unviable*.\" Mr. Davies also provided a CAPEX estimate of *\"< 1.0M*\" for the use of a distribution sensing system and of \"*0.5 \u2013 1M*\" for surveillance UAVs.1143\n\nDavies I, p. 76.\n\n913.\n\nMr. Ridley raised several criticisms with regard to Mr. Davies' assessment, in particular that Mr. Davies failed to analyze the available documentation of Claimant's risk security assessment but instead relied on unrelated and often unidentified sources as well as \"*irrelevant case studies*\" all of which concerned oil and gas pipelines.1144 In his opinion, \"*TCC adequately considered and addressed the existing, relevant and foreseeable security threats specific to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline*.\" Mr. Ridley further considered that Claimant's evaluation of residual risk was in line with international standards and \"*contributed to the security risks being minimised as far as reasonably practible*.\"1145 Mr. Ridley further considered that \"*while TCC's security planning frames the threat perception in terms of the foreseeable future, TCC also provided for a progressive roll out and scale of implementation that would correspond with the evolution and development of the project. This level of flexibility would have allowed TCC to adjust its approach to meet changing levels and types of security risks throughout the life of the project*.\" Mr. Ridley stated that Claimant's security cost estimates were based on \"*careful consideration of the security threats and an evolving strategy to meet them*\" for which he considered there to be \"*ample proof*.\" He added that his \"*advice in November 2011 would have been that the project could proceed from a security perspective*.\"1146\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 32-36.\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81.\n\n914.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Davies' cost estimates, Mr. Ridley reiterated that Mr. Davies' case studies did not include any example from the mining sector, noting Mr. Davies' statement that S-RM did not have experience with mining projects of this scale. In his opinion, \"*guard posts would not need to be any closer than an average of 100 kilometers apart*\" and \"[o]*ut of an abundance of caution,* [Mr. Ridley] *would have recommended at least five mutually supporting security posts along the entire length of the proposed pipeline*.\" Describing further precautions he would have recommended but also considered sufficient, Mr. Ridley stated that these \"*could be implemented at a fraction of the cost that S-RM proposes, remaining well within TCC's budget*.\"1147 By contrast, Mr. Ridley considered that Mr. Davies' estimate of required manpower was \"*more reminiscent of the days of the Berlin wall than of any modern security approach in order to protect a buried slurry concentrate pipeline*\" and noted that Mr. Davies himself admitted the possibility of using surveillance techonolgy such as a detection and alerting system to trigger an armed response before a breach occurs and estimated a cost of USD 1.5-2 million. Mr. Ridley further stated that Mr. Davies' approach \"*contravened specific consideration and prevention strategy noted in numerous community relations assessments not to use armed military personnel as a substitute for civilian security personnel due to potential human rights violations\u2014thereby opening the project up to further risks, rather than reducing them*.\" In his opinion, the estimate was also superficial as it ignored the four different types of terrain and visibility calling for a different range within which outposts should be placed and failed to take into account relevant cost savings.1148\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 83-89.\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 90-98.\n\n915.\n\nMr. Ridley concluded:\n\n\"*Thus, in my professional opinion, S-RM's cost estimates are not credible. As a security professional, I would never advise or employ S-RM's proposed strategy, and would never suggest establishment of so many fixed locations and the expenditure of such high levels of capital. Better, more cost efficient options would entail mobile assets, frequent patrolling, leveraged technologies, more competent personnel and active, experienced oversight\u2014 all of which are more in line with TCC's proposal than with SRM's inflated estimates*.\"1149\n\nRidley, \u00b6 115.\n\n916.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Davies maintained his concerns regarding the protection measures contemplated by Claimant for the slurry pipeline which, in his opinion, \"*were intended to mitigate theft and casual interference, not sabotage by skilled insurgents using explosives*.\"1150 He further continued to \"*attach little value to TCC's protection plan*\" for the pipeline based on the \"*basic observations*\" that: (i) Claimant \"*did not draw the right lessons from the insurgency in Balochistan and from other examples of pipeline sabotage*,\" expressly referring to the attack on the slurry pipeline of the Freeport Grasberg Mine in Indonesia referenced in PSI's draft report; and (ii) Claimant continued to rely on the \"*inappropriate*\" plan to bury the pipeline to make it resilient against sabotage. Mr. Davies further emphasized that the \"*leveraged technologies*\" offered by Mr. Ridley were not included in Claimant's \"*extraordinary*\" security costs referred to by Claimant and there was no evidence that such mitigation measures were considered by Claimant at the time.1151 As a second observation, Mr. Davies pointed out that the decision to construct the pipeline was taken only after the Security Risk Assessment had been carried out by International SOS and that he would have expected \"*to see an equally detailed supplementary security risk assessment for the pipeline's proposed route(s)*.\" In the absence of evidence that there was \"*an adequate level of scrutiny*\" and based on his review of the proposed mitigation measures, Mr. Davies maintained the opinion that \"*TCC's proposed mitigation plan for the pipeline is well below what I would consider reasonable, when measured against the potential threats*.\"1152\n\nDavies II, p. 2.\n\nDavies II, pp. 9-10.\n\nDavies II, p. 10.\n\n917.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Davies' statements in his second report confirm that the main issue in dispute between the Parties is whether Claimant sufficiently accounted for the risk of sabotage and/or attacks on the pipelines by insurgent groups in Balochistan. While there is common ground regarding the presence of insurgent groups in Balochistan and the existence of a risk that critical infrastructure of the project might be subject to an attack, the Parties and their experts have fundamentally deviating views regarding the level of risk affecting specifically the slurry pipeline and the security measures that could or should have been implemented to address this risk.\n\n918.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that while Mr. Davies included in his first report an estimate of costs required to deploy 6,820 armed guards for protection of the pipeline, he noted himself that \"[t]*his level of cost may well be considered unrealistic*\" and did not recommend that these measures should be adopted in reality. However, Mr. Davies then took the opinion that the level of risk could not be mitigated to a tolerable level without such prohibitive costs and therefore concluded that the pipeline was not a viable option.\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by this opinion. In particular, Mr. Davies himself presented as an alternative to such a large number of armed guards the use of surveillance UAVs and distributed sensing systems and provided an CAPEX estimate of below USD 2 million for both measures. While Mr. Davies emphasized that these measures were not included in the cost estimates of the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the security plan would have continued to evolve over time and the development of the project, as Mr. Ridley also expressly confirmed. Mr. Davies pointed out that UAV surveillance was still evolving in 2011 but this does not mean that a buyer would therefore have ignored, or would have expected Claimant to ignore, an evolving technology that would likely become commercially available in the future. Mr. Davies also did not explain why he did not consider it a viable option to implement a distributed sensing system, except to reiterate that this system was not included in the Feasibility Study.\n\n920.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Ridley's opinion that \"[o]*ut of an abundance of caution*, [he] *would have recommended at least five mutually supporting security posts along the entire length of the proposed pipeline*\" and his reference to certain additional options regarding the communication and detection system that Claimant could have used. In Mr. Ridley's opinion, these precautions \"*would have sufficed to protect the pipeline and could be implemented at a fraction of the cost that S-RM proposes, remaining well within TCC's estimated budget*.\"1153 Mr. Davies has not provided a deviating estimate for the costs of Mr. Ridley's proposed security measures but the Tribunal considers the relatively marginal dimension of additional costs involved confirmed and in line with Mr. Davies' estimate for detection and surveillance technology.\n\nRidley, \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.\n\n921.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that the level of risk affecting the slurry pipeline was so high that that it would have rendered the slurry pipeline an unviable option if the implemented security measures did not serve to fully mitigate the risk of an attack. The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has taken Respondent's submissions as well as the opinions provided by Prof. Rais and Mr. Davies regarding the security situation in Balochistan, and specifically the districts through which the pipeline would go, very seriously. In particular, the Tribunal does not wish to take the complex situation outlined by Prof. Rais lightly nor does it wish to brush away the concerns that the slurry pipeline would have been subject to a considerable level of threat from insurgents and possibly even terrorists. However, the Tribunal also considers it established that the security situation was assessed and analyzed by Claimant's security team, supervised by Barrick's Global Security Vice President as well as by third-party consultants such as Mr. Ridley, and that mitigation measures were being developed and corresponding cost estimates were included in the Feasibility Study.\n\n922.\n\nWhile Mr. Davies considered it a fundamental mistake to assume that burial of the pipeline would protect it against attacks, the Tribunal notes that Claimant and Mr. Ridley referred to various other arguments as to why it was concluded at the time that the slurry pipeline would be less vulnerable to attacks than oil and gas pipelines, such as the Sui gas pipeline. In particular, Claimant also pointed to: (i) the design and material of the pipeline and the relative ease of repairing it; (ii) the absence of flammable and combustible content; and (iii) the slow flow of the concentrate which could be discontinued and drained from the pipeline in case of a breach, all of which would reduce the damage inflicted and thus the incentive to attack in the first place.\n\n923.\n\nIn his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Ridley referred to the only example of an attack on a slurry concentrate pipeline (in Indonesia in 1986) to which Mr. Davies had pointed in his second report. Mr. Ridley explained that he was personally involved in investigating the incident and reviewing the damage done to the pipeline at the Freeport Grasberg Mine. In response to the question what the impact of the incident involving the pipeline was to the operations of the mine, he testified:\n\n\"*Negligible. The pipelines are routinely closed or suspended for both maintenance, repairs. And, in this instance, it was both negligible because the operations continued in other parts of the production.*\n\n*The pipeline itself is merely a means of transportation from A to B. And the primary motivation of those people that were targeting the pipeline itself was to extract the copper and gold concentrate. And, as a result, it was quickly responded, repaired to.*\n\n*Take into consideration that this was an above-ground exposed pipeline, and even then, the overall disruption was minimal.*\n\n*Q. When you say 'minimal,' what does that mean in terms of downtime?*\n\n*A. In terms of the directly affected or associated reasons for closure, maybe a few hours, and it was either simply repaired or operations in pumping continued, even though it was breached. I used 'breached' as an exotic term for a hole because most of the holes that were put into the pipeline were using kitchen implements: Saws, picks, axe, anything they could get their hands on*.\"1154\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 6), p. 1730 line 21 to p. 1731 line 22.\n\n924.\n\nMr. Ridley further confirmed that the Grasberg Mine has \"*been running for 50 years. The pipeline itselfwas installed in the late '70s \u2026 and it still remains both active and profitable today.*\"1155\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 6), p. 1732 lines 3-6.\n\n925.\n\nClaimant also pointed to the description of the incident in Indonesia in OPIC Memorandum of Determinations of 1986 on which Mr. Davies had also relied for reference to this incident in his second report:\n\n\"*At approximately 10:00 p.m. February 19 the slurry and fuel pipelines were severed by hacksaw in several locations resulting in a substantial loss of slurry, containing copper, silver and gold ores, and diesel fuel. Fires were set at the breaks along the fuel line. A party of police and security personnel was fired on while attempting to approach the site of the fuel fires. Shortly thereafter, the alleged saboteurs fled, the fires were extinguished, and within a few hours both pipelines had been repaired and returned to full operation.*\n\n*The [second] strike came the night of April 24. Both the slurry and the diesel fuel pipelines were again cut, related valves and plumbing were vandalized, a flush tank was drained, electrical wires were cut, the access road was blocked by felled trees and boulders and mobile construction equipment tires were burned. Several segments of the slurry pipeline were carted off. This time, because company officials responded to the rumors by interrupting the pumping of slurry, no slurry was lost through that pipeline. However, substantial diesel fuel was lost and again fires were set along the fuel line. Again security and repair crews were met with gunfire as they approached the sites of the damage. Police and GOI military personnel assisted in securing the area. One alleged saboteur was shot and killed by the security forces. By 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon of April 25 repairs were completed and the pumping of slurry was resumed*.\"1156\n\n**Exhibit S-RM-70**, p. 33.\n\n926.\n\nWith regard to this description, Mr. Davies confirmed during his oral testimony that the Grasberg slurry pipeline was not buried and that, by contrast to the diesel-fuel running pipeline running next to it, \"*a concentrate wouldn't burn*.\" In response to the question whether he would agree that the downtime for damage to a slurry pipeline is not very long, Mr. Davies testified as follows:\n\n\"*When repairing a pipeline or any other component, there are two things which enter into consideration. The first is the technical requirement, that will take a certain amount of time; and the second is whether the area is permissive or nonpermissive.*\n\n*Now, what I also said in my Second Report is that OPM militants\u2014'militants,' I'm not even sure that's the right word--are at the bottom of the scale of capability. This I see as a disruptive sabotage-type event by unprofessional, disorganized, disaggregated threat actors. I would not draw any parallel in terms of the capability of these threat actors across to highly professional, highly organized insurgents in Balochistan.*\n\n*I would characterize Baloch separatist insurgents along with, you know, the capability that we see, you know, demonstrated by Al-Qaeda in Yemen, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and other groups which are characterized as terrorist organizations but which are effectively guerrilla armies, and that's a matter of labeling, but I'm at pains here to point out that OPM, the saboteurs in this case, are at the bottom end of the scale in terms of capability; hence, you know, easy access to an above-service pipeline using hacksaws, lighting fires, this is--you know, this is really bottom-end stuff*.\"1157\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 6), p. 1838 line 22 to p. 1840 line 8.\n\n927.\n\nMr. Davies confirmed that by contrast to the incident in Indonesia which was caused by striking workers, the risk in Balochistan being discussed was \"*the possibility of people coming along and detonating part of the pipeline out in the country somewhere and then going away again so that they wouldn't be caught, not actually occupying the line of the pipe*.\" Mr. Davies further confirmed that it was about \"*considering the balance between what would be the cost of maintaining \u2026 an army of 7,000 people on the line and what would be the cost of mending it from time to time, something which can really only sort of be ascertained by experience*.\" Mr. Davies emphasized that he had not seen in Claimant's documentation an assessment of the aggregate loss caused by an attack and the number of attacks likely to be expected, which would have provided an \"*order of magnitude*\" feel to understand the risk tolerance of the project.1158 Mr. Davies confirmed, however, that the pipeline could be restored very quickly \"[i]*f you have access to the pipeline in a more or less permissive environment, yes*.\" He also confirmed that Claimant was planning to use a fibre optic cable that \"*would shut down the pumps as a reactive measure*\" in case the pipeline was breached.1159\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 6), p. 1840 line 22 to p. 1843 line 5.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 6), p. 1843 line 16 to p. 1844 line 14.\n\n928.\n\nBased on the explanations provided by the Parties' experts, the Tribunal is not convinced that an attack of the slurry concentrate pipeline in Balochistan would have caused major damage and thus would have required or even justified the implementation of security measures at the cost proposed by Mr. Davies. He expressly confirmed that, if breached, the pipeline could be mended relatively quickly and there would also be relatively little loss of slurry given the automatic shutdown of the pumps. Therefore, and while noting that the additional cost proposed by Mr. Davies would have reduced the value of the project by USD 400 million according to Prof. Davis' model,1160 and would therefore in any event not have rendered the project economically unfeasible, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have added costs of this magnitude in its valuation of the project. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the contingency for the project included a contingency of 20% for the slurry pipeline, *i.e*., USD 47.3 million. In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore plausible that, as Mr. Ridley has testified, additional security measures for the pipeline such as the distributed sensing system proposed by Mr. Davies or the communication and detection system proposed by Mr. Ridley would have remained within Claimant's estimated budget.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 185.\n\n929.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that if the frequency of attacks and/or the severity of damage turned out to be higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt its security plan and react to the new level of threat. That Claimant had identified and assessed the risks in this regard is demonstrated by Claimant's residual risk register which included, *inter alia*, the following risks: (i) \"*TCC Security staff Implicated in human rights abuses resulting in reputational damage*\"; (ii) \"*Direct violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, death, business disruption*\"; (iii) \"*Criminal extortion & kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel harm, reputational and financial loss*\"; (iv) \"*Theft of explosives & blasting accessories - linked to CPL13 leading to restrictions on our ability to operate, disruptions and reputational and financial loss*\"; (v) \"*Sabotage of Equipment Structures (IMD) e.g. Interference with blasts, tailings thickener, etc. resulting in disruptions and financial loss*\"; (vi) \"*Disruption in supply chain caused by unrest situations resulting in business interruption*\"; (vii) \"*Interruption of goods and concentrate supply chain on roads, rail, ports, sea caused to any terrorism/civil unrest resulting in disruption and financial loss*\"; and (viii) \"*Inability to secure the supply routes for stores and concentrate for the construction and operations phase, causes delays and increases costs*.\" Claimant had further identified risk mitigation strategies to address these risks and reported on their progress.1161\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-20.01**.\n\n930.\n\nRespondent pointed out that Claimant did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to a number of security-related risks, including the risks quoted in items (i) through (iv) above. As the Tribunal noted already in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal continues to consider it plausible that not all risks could be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy would evolve over time and the further development of the project.1162 While the Tribunal was concerned at the liability stage only with the question whether this amounted to a failure of TCCP justifying a denial of the Mining Lease Application, the Tribunal now has to assess whether a buyer of the Reko Diq project in November 2011 would have assigned a quantifiable impact to these risks and, if so, by how much this would have reduced the value of the project. In this regard, the Tribunal will review whether Prof. Davis has adequately quantified the residual security-related risks.\n\nCf. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1253.\n\n**iii. Whether Prof. Davis Has Adequately Quantified Residual Security-Related Risks**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n931.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis reviewed the residual risk register in preparing his valuation of the project. Prof. Davis explained that for the risks for which Claimant had estimated a financial impact, he used the impact estimated by Claimant to calculate the cash flow impact of these risks. As for the risks for which Claimant did not estimate a financial impact, Prof. Davis classified them in four categories, *i.e*., material risks that could cause: (i) the early termination of the project; (ii) delays in starting project construction; (iii) temporary interruption of operations. The fourth category included risks with no material impact.1163\n\nDavis I, Appendix D.\n\n932.\n\nAs for the four security-related risks for which Claimant has not estimated a financial impact, Prof. Davis classified the three risks regarding human rights abuses, criminal extortion and kidnap, and theft of explosives and blasting accessories in the third category, *i.e*., as material risks that could cause temporary interruption of operations.1164 In this regard, Prof. Davis noted that Claimant had planned to purchase business interruption insurance with a coverage of USD 1 billion of lost income which was to cover a total production interruption for a year and more moderate loss for up to two years. On that basis, he assumed that the risks classified in that category (to the extent that no separate cash flow asjustment was made) would be covered by this business interruption insurance the premium of which was included in the project costs.1165 Prof. Davis further noted that he had also adjusted production amounts to account for the risk of business interruptions lasting less than 30 days as these would not be compensated by insurance and explained how he had arrived at his estimate of the annual financial loss due to production interruptions.1166 This estimate was not challenged by Respondent or its experts.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27.\n\nDavis I, Appendix D, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\nDavis I, Appendix D, \u00b6 24; Davis II, \u00b6 186.\n\n933.\n\nRespondent placed particular emphasis on the fact that Claimant had not estimated a financial impact for the risk of \"*Direct violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, death, business disruption.*\" Prof. Davis classified this risk in the first category, *i.e*., as a material risk that could lead to early termination of the project.1167 Prof. Davis further explained that he \"*incorporate*[d] *the risk of early project termination in the simulation by assuming that in each year, starting with the first year of construction, there is 0.5% probability that the project ends prematurely*.\"1168 In his first report, Prof. Davis already confirmed that this risk category \"*includes events caused by either extreme political violence or government action*\" and made explicit reference to the risk pointed to by Respondent.1169 He further stated that the magnitude of this risk can be quantified based on the price of insurance protecting against such events and referred to \"*a range of indicative prices for political violence coverage*\" provided by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which \"*includes coverage for losses caused by declared and undeclared war, hostile actions by national or international forces, revolution, insurrection, civil strife, terrorism, and sabotage*.\" Noting that the high end of this range was USD 0.53 per year for each USD 100 of insured asset value and based on his \"*understanding of past experience with large projects*,\" Prof. Davis decided to \"*use a likelihood of permanent premature shut-down at Reko Diq due to such acts of 0.5% annually*.\"1170\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27.\n\nDavis I, Appendix D, \u00b6 15.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 189.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 189.\n\n934.\n\nRespondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells stated in their first report that \"[t]*he \u00bd percent annual complete stoppage proability hardly covers these eventualities*,\" *i.e*., \"*the very real possibility that production will be interrupted for substantial periods from time to time, but perhaps permanently, by the armed forces in the region*.\"1171 They did not, however, engage with the considerations underlying Prof. Davis' assumption nor did they express an opinion which alternative percentage they would have considered more appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 34.\n\n935.\n\nIn response, Prof. Davis placed emphasis on the impact of assuming an annual 0.5% probability of permanent shut down:\n\n\"*The annual 0.5% probability of shut down included in my model amounts to an 18% cumulative probability of shut-down due to political violence over the course of the 39- year mine life in the expanded case.221 It is even higher, 26%, when the IMD mine life option is selected.222 Even accounting for the fact that in some simulations the Project would shut down early for other reasons, resulting in a shorter than planned mine life, 14.6% of the 200,000 simulations result in Project shut down caused by this factor alone. It reduces the value of the investment by $1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario where this risk would be absent (the fair market value of TCC's share would be $9.9 billion instead of $8.5 billion.)*\"1172\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 178.\n\n936.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells engaged in more detail with Prof. Davis' assumption. In their opinion:\n\n\"*The fact is that for every particular year the average probability is only 0,073%, not 0.5%. This is so because, as Brattle indicates in the quote above, only 14.6% of the cases are affected by the 0.5% occurrence, but not the remaining 85.4%, so one has to take the weighted average of 0% and 0.5%. Note that closures for* 'extreme political violence and government action' *are restricted so that they can occur only after production starts, considerably reducing their effect, but there is no reason why such an event cannot occur even in the first year of development*.\"1173\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 131.\n\n937.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered the relevant question to be: \"*what is the expected mean or average life of the project given the Bernoulli distribution proposed by Brattle with a probability of 0.5%?*\" and noted that the mean expected life was not much shorter than the nominal life, \"*which makes little sense in a project situated in Balochistan*.\" In their opinion, \"*an investor might be satisfied with \u2026 a mean expected life of about half or less of the nominal life*,\" which would imply an annual probability of between 3.5% (30-year project) and 5% (20-year project).1174\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133.\n\n938.\n\nMr. Brailovksy and Prof. Wells also addressed Prof. Davis' reliance on the indicative rates provided by OPIC and pointed to the statements made by OPIC above the indicative rates:1175\n\nIndicative Rates\n\nIn certain cases, OPIC Insurance rates may fall outside of the ranges shown in the table below, depending on the particular risk profile of he project. It is also possible that the ranges shown also could be adjusted and affect rates for potential insurance contracts. However, once an insurance contract is executed, the rates in that contract are fixed for the contract\u2019s term.\n\nOPIC insurance contracts generally require that premiums be paid annually in advance.\n\nOPIC insurance may not be available for certain coverages, or there may be limitations for underwri ing or other reasons. Investors should consult the country list page regarding availability in par icular countries.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Coverage | Active/Current | Standby |\n| Inconvertibility | $0.18-$0.42 | $0 20 |\n| Expropriation | $0.28\u2014$0.60 | $0 20 |\n| Political Violence\\* |\n| Business Income | $0.21-$0 53 | $0 20 |\n| Assets | $0.21-$0 53 | $0 20 |\n\n*\\* Discounted rates may be available for small businesses and/or a combination of coverages.*\n\n*\\*\\* Investors should contact OPIC directly for information on pricing for Non-Honoring of a Sovereign Guaranty and Oil and Gas coverages.*\n\n**Exhibit CE-1145**.\n\n939.\n\nThey further noted that, as can be seen in the above excerpt, OPIC provides two types of insurance against political violence, *i.e*., for business income and assets, with a maximum rate of USD 0.53 for each of them. In their opinion, the two types of insurance are not mutually exclusive but \"*at least partially additive*\" given that OPIC states in its Handbook as a footnote to its rates for \"*Manufacturing Services*\" that \"[d]*iscounted rates may be available for combined business income and assets political violence coverages*.\"1176 Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further considered that Prof. Davis should also have included the maximum rate for the risk of \"*Inconvertibility*\" (USD 0.42) and of \"*Expropriation*\" (USD 0.60), which would add up to a total rate of USD 2.08 or, assuming a 10% discount on the combined political violence insurance, a total rate of USD 1.97 per USD 100 of insured value.1177 In addition, they considered that Prof. Davis used the wrong reference as the OPIC Handbook includes a table specifically for natural resources (except oil and gas), which provides the following rates:1178\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| INFRASTRUCTURE/NATURAL RESOURCES (Except Oil and Gas) |\n| Annual Base Rates per $100 of Coverage |  |\n| Coverage | Active/Current | Standby |\n| Inconvertibility | $0.25-$0.45 | $0.20 |\n| Expropriation | $0.55-$0.85 | $0.20 |\n| Political Violence |  |  |\n| Business Income | $0.30-$0.55 | $0.20 |\n| Assets | $0.40-$0.75 | $0.20 |\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 135, *quoting from* **Exhibit BW-69**, p. 29 (note to the first table).\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 135, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1145**.\n\n**Exhibit BW-69**, p. 30.\n\n940.\n\nIn any event, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells note that OPIC insurance is available only for US businesses, insures only up to 90% of the investment and with a time limit of 20 years. Considering that \"[c]*ommercial insurance rates \u2026 would likely be much higher*,\" they concluded that \"*calculations of probabilities of political risk events based on OPIC rates are simply not relevant*.\"1179\n\nBrailovksy/Wells II, \u00b6 138.\n\n941.\n\nFinally, they relied on an analysis performed by Respondent's expert Dr. Burrows in his second report which resulted in an \"*implied annual probability of loss in Pakistan in November 2011*\" between 4.6% and 8.2%. They calculated that when changing only this assumption in Prof. Davis' model, this range of probabilities would lead to a value of between USD 1,539 billion and minus USD 895 million.1180 They conclude:\n\n\"*These results are consistent with those of both the SNC-Lavalin study and the unmodified Brattle Report when appropriate discount rates are applied. It seems that a fatal flow in the Brattle analysis is the whopping underestimation of the risk of* 'early termination due to extreme political violence or government action.' *A proper calculation of the probabilities of this risk, which is no other than country risk, leads to more sensible results from the* 'modern' *DCF*.\"1181\n\nBrailovksy/Wells II, \u00b6 139.\n\nBrailovksy/Wells II, \u00b6 140.\n\n942.\n\nDr. Burrows, who had not expressed an opinion on the 0.5% annual probability in his first report, stated in his second report that this estimate of \"*Pakistan country risk*\" is \"*absurdly low and based on a seriously flawed reasing of available data*.\"1182 He provided the following reasons for his opinion: (i) OPIC insurance rates may fall outside the range of indicative rates and do not reflect the level of private insurance; (ii) OPIC's political risk coverage does not reflect all country risk and provides several limitations as a result of which it does not measure the full extent and range of risk faced by private investors; and (iii) OPIC states in its financial accounting statements for 2012 that its political risk insurance premiums are approximately 0.9% of its \"*current exposure to claim*\" and highlights that projects in, *inter alia*, Pakistan, \"*often entail more risk*.\"1183\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 53.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 54-56, *quoting from* **Exhibit CRA-53**, p. 7.\n\n943.\n\nDr. Burrows further refers to a methodology that Prof. Davis used in a different arbitration proceeding for the calculation of the \"*probability of closure due to political risk*\" for Peru. Noting that he \"*obtained data on Pakistan from one of the study's authors (Geert Bekaert) covering the time period from 2006 to 2011*,\" Dr. Burrows stated that he followed the same methodology to calculate the probability for Pakistan, resulting in a range of 4.6% to 8.2%, which would result in cumulative loss probability over 30 years of 75.8% to 92.3%.1184 Dr. Burrows added that, in his opinion, the large deviation from the probability assumed by Prof. Davis could not be due to his exclusion of unlawful actions, considering it \"*unlikely that unlawful actions by Respondent would account for much, if any, of the gap*\" between their respective estimates.1185\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 57 and Appendices 13 and 14.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 58.\n\n944.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the timing of the introduction of Respondent's experts' detailed arguments on the 0.5% annual probability formed the subject of several debates between the Parties and the Tribunal, including at the Hearing on Quantum. Prof. Davis had included already in his first report his analysis of the 0.5% annual probability while Respondent's experts presented their detailed arguments in opposition only together with Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum. This was the case, in particular, of the analysis made by Dr. Burrows based on data he stated to have obtained from Dr. Bekaert but did not fully provide to Claimant or Prof. Davis for analysis. Apart from the question whether and to which extent Claimant was prejudiced by the introduction of a new analysis in the Rejoinder, Prof. Davis expressed the opinion at the Hearing on Quantum that the methodology applied by Bekaert *et al*. did not work for Pakistan as it is based on a country's sovereign spread which, in Pakistan's case, is not driven by political risk and therefore not an indicator that can be used for this purpose. Noting that he had not been provided with all relevant data underlying Dr. Burrows' analysis, Prof. Davis testified that he had tested the data he did receive and considered that \"*the problem is that the model just doesn't work for Pakistan*.\" Following a detailed explanation as to why he considered that the model did not adequately predict either Pakistan's sovereign spread or the political risk included in that spread, Prof. Davis also illustrated with the following graph why in his opinion, Pakistan's sovereign spread \"*embodies very little information on political risk in Pakistan*\":1186\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2355 line 10 to p. 2357 line 9; Davis Presentation, p. 37; **Exhibit CE-1783A**.\n\n945.\n\nProf. Davis provided the following additional explanation as to why he used the Bekaert methodology in the arbitration *Bear Creek v. Peru* but not in this case:\n\n\"*Well, in Bear Creek, we were not instructed to ignore expropriation risk, and so we needed to adjust the Project cash flows or discount them downward for that asymmetric risk. There was political turmoil at the time of the valuation. A new President was coming into office. It was not clear how he was going treat mining entities, and so we sought to capture as a discount to my valuation in that approach an index. So, we used Bekaert, his conversion of sovereign spread to a political risk discount or country-risk discount for Per\u00fa. I think it was 1.4 percent there. And we liked it because Per\u00fa was in the original sample in his paper. Pakistan was outside the original sample, so they hadn't really proven that the model worked for Pakistan. And the other reason is, we didn't have any kind of detailed analysis like we had here with the Risk Register and all the possibility risks and how frequently they could happen and what the impact would be.*\n\n*There was no Risk Register for the Per\u00fa case. So, we needed to use a blunter instrument, and we elected to go with the Bekaert adjustment of 1.4 percent to the cash flows to try to encompass all of these things that were missing, basically, from the Feasibility Study and were not available to us*.\"1187\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2506 line 2 to p. 2507 line 7.\n\n946.\n\nDr. Burrows rejected Prof. Davis' opinion that the study \"*doesn't work for Pakistan*,\" arguing as follows:\n\n\"*Well, the study, as he knows, was a cross-sectional study. It wasn't a study of Pakistan. It was a study of political risk--how political risks related to the Sovereign Bond Yield across the world, as a cross-sectional study.*\n\n*So, if worked for Per\u00fa, it works for Pakistan. You can't make the Statement that it would work for Per\u00fa and not work for Pakistan. It wasn't a study--it wasn't a longitudinal study of Pakistan. It was a cross-sectional study*.\"1188\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2766 line 19 to p. 1768 line 6.\n\n947.\n\nDr. Burrows further considered that Prof. Davis had misapplied the Bekaert methodology because he had applied the percentage of the predicted spread accounted for by political risk to the *predicted* observed spread of Pakistan instead of the *actual* observed spread. In his opinion, a correct analysis would result in the following contribution of political risk to the sovereign yield spread:1189\n\nContribution of political risk to sovereign yield spread\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **(in basis points)** | **Sep-06** | **Nov-11** | **Change** |\n| **Based on Narrow Measure of Political Risk Spread** |\n| Percentage of the predicted spread accounted for by political risk [1] | 64% | 45% |  |\n| Actual observed sovereign spread | 240 | 1,149 | +909 |\n| **Portion of actual sovereign yield spread due to political risk** | 154 | 515 | +361 |\n| **40%** |\n| **Based on Wide Measure of Political Risk Spread** |\n| Percentage of the predicted spread accounted for by political risk [1] | 100% | 80% |  |\n| Actual observed sovereign spread [2] | 240 | 1,149 | +909 |\n| **Portion of actual sovereign yield spread due to political risk** | 240 | 916 | +676 |\n| **74%** |\n\n[1] Provided by Prof. Bekaert.

He was taking advantage of fluctuations across countries and trying to use that to explain how sovereign yield spread across countries is affected by political risk spread. He wasn't doing a longitudinal analysis of any one country*.\" He also rejected the argument that, by testing whether the model could predict the sovereign yield spread itself, Prof. Davis had tested it as to its validity for Pakistan, claiming that this test \"*contradicted the test that the authors of the paper said was the way to test the model*.\"1191\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), pp. 2843-2848; **Exhibit CE-1784**.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), pp. 2849-2857; **Exhibit CE-1783A**.\n\n949.\n\nBased on its review of the opinions offered by the Parties' experts and the supporting documentation provided by the Parties, the Tribunal is not convinced that the analysis brought forward by Dr. Burrows based on data he had received from Dr. Bekaert provides a reasonable estimate for the annual probability of permanent shut down that Prof. Davis should have included in his valuation model. Besides taking note of Dr. Burrows' confirmation that Dr. Bekaert \"*updated his model*\" with new data for Pakistan which was not included in his published study and apparently not shared with Claimant or Prof. Davis, the Tribunal is not convinced that the model would produce valid results for Pakistan. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr. Burrows' argument as to why he considered the differing development of the sovereign yield spread and the political risk rating irrelevant. Even if the model was based on an analysis across various countries, the Tribunal does not understand how this would render the relationship between the spread and the rating in the particular country in question irrelevant. The Tribunal also does not find it convincing that Dr. Burrows dismisses Prof. Davis' test of the validity of the model for Pakistan and simply assumes that the model either works for all countries or for none of them. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr. Burrows' argument that Prof. Davis' test contradicted the Bekaert *et al.* study. While the authors state that the ratio of the spread accounted for by political risk is to be applied to the \"*actual observed spread,*\"1192 they do not state that it would be invalid to test whether the model could also predict the observed spread itself.\n\n**Exhibit CRA-55**, p. 484.\n\n950.\n\nAs an additional consideration, the Tribunal notes that if the range of political risk produced by the Bekaert model is applied as the annual probability of permanent shutdown, this results, according to Dr. Burrows, in a cumulative probability of 75.8% to 92.3% that the project would have to be shut down during the first 30 years of the life of the mine. In the Tribunal's view, such an assumption is not warranted or justified by the circumstances in Balochistan. This would even exceed the assumption made by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that an investor would expect the mean expected life of the project to be \"*about half or less*\" of the nominal life, which the Tribunal also does not find convincing. They do not provide any authority or other support for their statement that \"*an investor might be satisfied*\" with this assumption for a project situated in Balochistan.1193\n\n*Cf*. Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 133.\n\n951.\n\nThe Tribunal also cannot follow the argument raised by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that Prof. Davis' 0.5% annual probability in reality corresponds to only 0,073% because \"*only 14.6% of the cases are affected by the 0.5% occurrence, but not the remaining 85.4%, so one has to take the weighted average of 0% and 0.5%*.\"1194 Prof. Davis stated that \"*14.6% of the 200,000 simulations result in Project shut down caused by this factor* [*i.e*., the annual 0.5% probability] *alone*.\"1195 In the Tribunal's view, this cannot reasonably be understood to mean that the 0.5% annual probability is applied only to 14.6% of the simulations; it is rather applied to all simulations and results in 14.6% early terminations.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 131.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 178.\n\n952.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal is not convinced by either of the alternative assumptions made by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells or Dr. Burrows, the question that remains to be answered is whether Prof. Davis' reliance on the indicative rates provided by OPIC for insurance against political violence for assets can be considered adequate. While the Tribunal has taken note of the caveats expressed by OPIC, in particular that actual rates might fall outside of the range of the presented indicative rates, and of the undisputed fact that OPIC insurance itself would not have been available to Claimant, the Tribunal considers that these indicative rates are in any event the best estimate of what the financial impact of either taking out political violence insurance or otherwise making a corresponding deduction from the project value by a buyer would have been. In the absence of any more specific data on rates for Pakistan, the Tribunal also considers it plausible to apply the maximum rate of the indicative range.\n\n953.\n\nHowever, as pointed out by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, Prof. Davis decided to apply only the rate for insurance of asset value and did not consider an additional rate for insurance of business income. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also pointed out that OPIC provides rate specifically for \"*infrastructure/natural resources (Except Oil and Gas)*\" which, *inter alia*, provides a rate of up to 0.75 for insurance against political violence for assets.1196 By contrast, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that Prof. Davis should also have included the rate for \"*Inconvertibility*\" or \"*Expropriation*\" in order to determine the annual probability of a permanent mine shut down. Prof. Davis explained that he was instructed not to make adjustments for the risk of illegal government conduct, such as the risk of uncompensated expropriation.1197 As noted in the OPIC Handbook, currency inconvertibility coverage also insures against government action or inaction preventing the transfer of investment returns from insured investments.1198\n\n**Exhibit BW-69**, p. 30.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 190.\n\n**Exhibit BW-69**, p. 18.\n\n954.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been provided with any argument as to why the present assessment of Claimant's damages, which must eliminate Respondent's Treaty breaches, should account for risks caused by the host Government's unlawful conduct. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that specifically for natural resources projects, OPIC \"[a]*dditionally*\" offers insurance against \"*the unlawful withdrawal or breach by the host government of mineral exploration and development rights, and other legal rights vital to the success of a particular project.*\" In the Tribunal's view, the availability of such additional insurance clarifies that the rates for \"*political violence*\" insurance do not cover the types of risks or breaches that the present assessment is intended to eliminate.\n\n955.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal therefore concludes that while it considers the basis for Prof. Davis' assumption reasonably reliable as an indicator for the risks he intended to capture, it is not entirely convinced that the rate he came up with fully captures these risks. The Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis also drew on his experience with past projects but did not provide any further detail in this regard, including after Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had raised detailed criticisms with regard to the particular indicative rate on which he had relied. In particular, Prof. Davis did not provide any explanation as to why he based his estimate only the \"*assets*\" rate and did not consider it appropriate to refer to the \"*business income*\" rate even though a permanent shutdown would also, if not primarily, result in a loss of future cash flows that would otherwise have been generated by the mine. Prof. Davis also did not provide any indication as to why he did not refer to the range of insurance rates for \"*assets*\" of infrastructure and natural resources projects (except oil and gas) even though there can be no dispute that Reko Diq would qualify as such a project.\n\n956.\n\nThe Tribunal does not wish to go as far as to consider it established that Prof. Davis should have combined the rates for \"*assets*\" and \"*business income*\" for the purposes of determining the annual probability of permanent shutdown. However, the Tribunal recalls in particular that even on the assumption that it was appropriate for Prof. Davis to rely (only) on the \"*assets*\" rubric of OPIC insurance rates, the maximum indicative rate for infrastructure and natural resources projects amounts to 0.75. On that basis, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that a buyer would have applied a higher annual probability of permanent shutdown than assumed by Prof. Davis in his valuation model, more specifically a probability in the range of the maximum rate of 0.75 for infrastructure and natural resources projects.\n\n957.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been provided with a sensitivity analysis by either of the Parties' experts on the impact of assuming a higher annual probability of annual shutdown based on indicative OPIC insurance rates other than the rate relied on by Prof. Davis. In the absence of a sensitivity analysis based on an annual shutdown probability in the range of 0.75%, the Tribunal considers that the most reasonable assumption is to start from Prof. Davis' explanation that the 0.5% probability reduced the value of the project by USD 1,423 billion and to increase this amount by 50%, *i.e*., USD 711.5 million, in order to reflect the Tribunal's considerations above. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that an additional amount of USD 711.5 million has to be deducted from the value of Claimant's investment\n\n**7. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for Compliance with Environmental Regulations and Obtaining a Social License to Operate**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n958.\n\nClaimant submits that its approach to identifying, assessing and managing potential environmental and social risks of the project was consistent with international best practices and in line with what lenders and regulators would have expected for the Reko Diq project at this stage.1199 Claimant notes that the ESIA process was coordinated by Mr. Cessford of SRK Consulting UK Ltd who confirms that none of the criticisms raised by Respondent are material enough to have an effect on the quality of the ESIA.1200 Claimant also refers to the testimony of Mr. Livesey and Ms. Cessford to argue that the ESIA process reflected a dynamic collaboration between Claimant, its owners and third-party consultants and that the final ESIA ensured compliance with the most stringent standards in the industry.1201\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 696.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 697, *referring to* Cessford, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 93, 145.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 699 *referring to* Livesey IX, \u00b6 74 *and* Cessford, \u00b6\u00b6 82-86.\n\n959.\n\nClaimant contends that the ESIA addressed \"*the full range of issues that could potentially be impacted by TCC's proposed mine*\" and that the ESIA process was completed over three years before it was submitted to Balochistan together with TCCP's Mining Lease Application. Claimant emphasizes that no concern was raised with regard to any issue covered in the ESIA before this arbitration, including in the Notice of Intent to Reject, and there is no evidence that the ESIA was ever reviewed by Balochistan before this arbitration; only in the quantum phase of this arbitration did Respondent start to allege that the ESIA failed to comply with local law or international standards and would have prevented Claimant from seeking financing.1202\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 700-702, 705-706.\n\n960.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent's experts Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor fail to quantify the impact of the alleged shortcomings and also do not take into account the additional adjustments made by Prof. Davis to account for risks associated with possible environmental and social impacts.1203 In addition, Claimant argues that the complaints raised by Respondent's experts should be dismissed because: (i) contrary to the statements made in their reports, Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor performed only \"*a superficial review of only a portion of the record selected in advance by Pakistan's counsel, and then became uncritical advocates for Pakistan's positions, including on issues outside their experience or competence*\"; (ii) the Parties' experts are in agreement on \"*the core issues concerning the rigor and reliability of the work conducted by TCC and its consultants*,\" with Respondent's experts only disputing the conclusions reached which could have been resolved through an iterative process; and (iii) Respondent's allegations of shortcomings or flaws are contradicted by Claimant's expert Ms. Cessford and the \"*extensive contemporaneous analyses reflected both in the documents Pakistan's experts reviewed and those that they ignored*.\"1204\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 147; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 702.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 148-153.\n\n961.\n\nWith regard to the documents reviewed by Respondent's experts, Claimant refers to Ms. Filas' testimony that she had personally reviewed only \"*a good number of them*,\" which she did not \"*go through \u2026 in detail*,\" and that she had decided not to review \"*thousands of pages*\" stating that she could judge from the context of the document that it \"*wasn't going to contribute to* [her] *opinion*.\" According to Claimant, Dr. Connor also confirmed that she did not inquire about or verify the accuracy and veracity of the documents provided to her.1205 In addition, Claimant notes that neither expert asked to be provided with additional documents and refers to Ms. Filas' statement that she did not see the need for such a request for her \"*high-level*\" review as well as Ms. Connor's statement that it was irrelevant if the socio-political and security risks that she considered to be not adequately addressed in the ESIA were discussed in \"*35 other places*\" in Claimant's studies.1206\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1965, 1967 *and referring to* pp. 2041-2043.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1971 and 2036-2037.\n\n962.\n\nReferring to Ms. Filas' labelling of Claimant's ESIA as only a \"*plan-for-a-plan*\" and her argument that instead a detailed Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) would have been required, Claimant notes that a contemporaneous report provided to Dr. Connor expressly noted that a \"*preliminary deadline date*\" for a \"*fully operational Environmental Management System*\" had been set for the end of December 2010.1207 Claimant further claims that Dr. Connor's criticism regarding an alleged failure to address potential opposition to Claimant's acquisition of land for the pipeline ignored the testimony of Respondent's witnesses and Respondent's exhibits confirming that there were \"*virtually no implications for land acquisition*\" given the sparse population of the land.1208\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 158, *quoting from* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 66, 140, Filas Presentation p. 15 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1973-1975 *and* **Exhibit CE-165**, p. 25.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 159, *referring to* Connor, Section 2.2.4, \u00b6\u00b6 2-4 *and* **Exhibits RE-750A** through **RE-750D** *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 4), p. 1077 and (Day 6), p. 1801.\n\n963.\n\nClaimant considers it agreed between the Parties and their experts that it applied the correct laws and guidelines in preparing the ESIA and that it correctly applied generally accepted ESIA methodology given that Ms. Filas \"*did not take exception to the general methodology \u2026 used in conducting the ESIA analysis*,\" Dr. Connor agreed that the ESIA consultation \"*followed the usual protocols*,\" and Respondent confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that it does not \"*challenge* [the] *methodology*\" applied by Claimant.1209\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 161-162, *quoting from* Filas II, \u00b6 78, Connor, Section 2.2.2, \u00b6 1 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 1), p. 262.\n\n964.\n\nClaimant further refers to Ms. Cessford's testimony that the process of assessing and managing environmental and social impacts is a \"*cyclical process \u2026 based on the knowledge \u2026 available at the time*\" which is contunously checked reassessed \"*throughout construction and operation, and then finally again at the end of the life-of-mine*.\" Claimant points out that Dr. Connor agreed that \"*it's a*[n]*iterative process*,\" and that Ms. Filas confirmed that it \"*generally and typically evolve*[s]*over the life of the project*.\" Finally, Claimant also considers it agreed that the process if characterized by a \"*back and forth*\" between the company and the regulators or lenders until the impacts are managed in a satisfactory manner.1210\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 163, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1891-1893, 1963-1964, 1988 and 2027.\n\n965.\n\nAs a result of the Parties' experts' agreement on these issues, Claimant claims that: (i) there can be no dispute about the reliability of the results on which the ESIA team relied in reaching their conclusions and recommendations; (ii) Respondent cannot fault Claimant for not completing steps in the process \"*which\u2014by practice and design\u2014would only come after the grant of the mining lease which Balochistan wrongfully withheld*\"; and (iii) the allegation raised by Respondent's experts that any of the supposed flaws would have been \"*fatal*\" or \"*non-starters*\" for the project is contradicted by the reality of routine ongoing consultations with funders or regulators.1211\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 164.\n\n966.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant also refers to Ms. Cessford's explanation that \"*both regulators and investors have mechanisms by which any perceived shortfalls in the ESIA process can be addressed without a regular resorting to rejecting an ESIA or refusing the overall project outright*.\"1212 Claimant also refers to Pakistan's own Guidelines for the preparation and review of Environmental Reports which recognize the availability of \"appropriate remedial options\" to address specific inadequacies of the environmental report.1213 Referring to Ms. Cessford, Claimant submits that in that case funding can be approved subject to \"*conditions incorporated into the loan agreement, usually in the form of an environmental and social action plan (ESAP)*\" and argues that there is no reason why this would not have been possible in case of inadequacies in Claimant's ESIA.1214\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 707, *quoting from* Cessford, \u00b6 121.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 708, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1248**, p. 32.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 709-710, *quoting from* Cessford, \u00b6 123.\n\n967.\n\nIn any event, Claimant maintains that none of the technical flaws alleged by Respondent and its experts exists. Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to Ms. Filas' criticism, there is no requirement under Pakistani law or international guidelines that an ESIA report at development stage has to include concrete managements systems and refers to guidelines issued by the International Finance Corporation which allow a company to \"*develop*[] *and implement*[] [an ESMS] *over a reasonable period of time as agreed with the IFC*\" if it did not have \"*a satisfactory Management System at the time of IFC's appraisal of the project*.\"1215\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 167-168 and note 373, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1292**, p. 2, \u00b6 G3.\n\n968.\n\nClaimant further contends that while Respondent's experts criticized Claimant's ESIA for failing to meet Pakistan's standards and guidelines with regard to environmental and social matters, neither of them is qualified to express an opinion on such standards given Ms. Filas' concession that she was \"*not an expert on Pakistan requirements*\" and Dr. Connor's \"*limited, dated, and irrelevant*\" in-country experience.1216 Claimant further considers this criticism disproved by standard industry practice and Ms. Cessford's testimony that Claimant's selection of locations for monitoring impact of air emissions was based on the objective \"*to generate a background concentration*\" and to communicate to the stakeholders the likely direct air quality impacts.1217 According to Claimant, these locations represented \"*the most densely-populated areas near the marine terminal, which were most likely to impact a large group of stakeholders*\" and were therefore \"*appropriate and suitable*\" to meet that goal.1218 Claimant further refers to Ms. Cessford's explanation that \"*the ESIA report* [not only] *specifically discussed impacts on the closest current receptors*,\" but also \"*presented dispersion plume figures showing the concentration plumes at other locations, including across the project site and beyond*.\" According to Ms. Cessford, the impact can be ascertained at any point of the graphic image of the marine terminal and not only at the monitoring locations.1219\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 169, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1989-1990.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 170-171, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1918.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-601**, Sections 6.2.1, 6.2.3.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172, *quoting from* Cessford, \u00b6 129 *and referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1912-1915; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 715-716.\n\n969.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant also contends that Respondent misunderstands the ambient limit standards set out in the EDC in that they do not apply to the ESIA's air quality impact assessment for the mine site, which is an occupational zone and therefore subject to occupational health standards with which Claimant has complied in committing to a separate study under the Health & Safety management system; by contrast, the ambient level values in the ESIA are \"*significantly below*\" the ambient limit standards.1220 Claimant further notes that its model of the dispersion of the emissions was provided by Lorax Environmental, a marine specialist and water quality expert, and rejects the suggestion that it manipulated the testing of emission levels by not using the levels at the discharge point. According to Claimant, measuring concentration of metals at the end of the mixing zone is consistent with international standard practice.1221\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 712-714.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 718-719.\n\n970.\n\nClaimant submits that local law requirements were captured in its Environmental Design Criteria (EDC) but argues that, contrary to Respondent's argument, compliance with the EDC is not a requirement under local law or international guidelines. In any event, Claimant contends that the ESIA \"*demonstrated compliance with every aspect of the local requirements that was reasonably practicable*.\"1222\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 703-704, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-12.05** *and* Cessford, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 72.\n\n971.\n\nClaimant also relies on Ms. Cessford's testimony to argue that its seeking of \"*a variance*\" to the marine effluent standards did not serve to characterize Claimant's works as faulty, in particular because the limit in Pakistan's stated standards appears to have been erroneously \"*carried over from the freshwater limit into the marine*\" and \"*could actually be causing a harm to the aquatic life.*\"1223 According to Claimant, seeking relaxation of a standard for two parameters is recognized by international guidelines; for all others, Claimant maintains that when comparing the correct values to the \"*EDC effluent limit*,\" the values are equal to or below the stated limits.1224\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 173, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1919-1921.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 717, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-601**, p. 7-92, Table 7.18 *and* **Exhibit CE-1351**, p. 2-22, Table 2-8.\n\n972.\n\nClaimant rejects the allegation that it selected the Fan Sediments as its water source without considering the impact of its water usage on the competing interests of local communities. It refers to Mr. Livesey and Mr. Mayer who explained that the water from the Fan Sediments was not suitable for irrigation or other agricultural purposes and therefore had no possible alternative economic use.1225\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 720-722, *referring to* Livesey IX, \u00b6 75, Mayer I, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84-85 *and* Cessford, \u00b6 141.\n\n973.\n\nSimilarly, Claimant submits that the direct impact of its proposed slurry pipeline on \"*groundwater flow patterns*\" as well as possible indirect impacts on flood irrignation systems and other water users were specifically considered in the ESIA, which proposed mitigation measures to undertake further study. Claimant argues that the \"[t]*he purpose of the ESIA is to identify and assess material risks*\" and claims that there is no basis for Respondent's claim that this assessment was deficient or unacceptable.1226\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 723, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-601**, pp. 7-63 to 7-66.\n\n974.\n\nAs to Ms. Filas' criticism that Claimant's mine closure plans would have had to provide for a complete backfill of the pit, Claimant argues that complete backfilling is not generally required for pits of the kind contemplated for Reko Diq and the specific requirement to this effect in California \"*has long been controversial*\" and is under consideration for \"*substantial revisions*.\"1227 Claimant points to its conceptual plan for mine closure and the ESIA and the Feasibility Study as part of which it carried out a high-level assessment of the likelihood of a pit lake forming at closure and identified the studies required during the life of the project.1228\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175, *referring to* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40 and 149-151 *and* **Exhibits CE-1693** to **CE-1697** and **CE-1704** to **CE-1705** (admitted *de bene esse*).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 724-725.\n\n975.\n\nClaimant also rejects Respondent's criticism that it failed to consider the condition of the roads, arguing that, as noted in the ESIA, it was not provided with the relevant information by the Pakistani authorities.1229\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 726, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-601**, Sections 3.2 and 3.3 *and* Cessford, \u00b6 134.\n\n976.\n\nWith regard to Dr. Connor's criticism that Claimant did not have tailored community plans or two qualified personnel to supervise and implement them, Claimant refers to its demonstration at the Hearing on Quantum of \"*the incredible breadth and detail of the community engagement plans it had developed, and the extensive and unrebutted record proving that it had already started to implement these plans and would deliver on its commitments*.\" Claimant also refers to Dr. Connor's admission that she was not aware that Claimant had engaged \"*a Community Engagement Expert*\" to support its work in this regard.1230 Claimant argues that it was committed to engaging with all relevant stakeholders that could be affected by the proposed mine and considers this aim reflected in the ESIA process and the preparation of the report.1231\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 176, *referring to* Claimant's Opening Presentation, pp. 104-105 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2054-2062, 2044-2046.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 727, *referring to* Cessford, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n977.\n\nClaimant concludes that, as Ms. Cessford confirmed, its ESIA was the product of a \"*robust and rigorous*\" ESIA process, which was managed by \"*conscientious project sponsors who acted with integrity*,\" and it would have been treated seriously by potential investors to satisfy their requirements under the international standards.1232\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 728, *quoting from* Cessford, \u00b6\u00b6 86, 144-145.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n978.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant recognized in the Feasibility Study that \"*the main challenge in Reko Diq is to obtain the social license to operate from the communities, authorities and all the relevant stakeholders*.\" According to Respondent, however, Claimant did not have a comprehensive plan in place in order to obtain and maintain the social license but relied primarily on \"*a high-level review of the socio-political and economic environment and hypothetical support based on a range of benefits it planned to provide*.\"1233 Respondent refers to its social license specialist Dr. Connor who pointed out that Claimant \"*followed the wrong process, used the wrong people, and poorly executed what little work it tried to do*.\"1234\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 207, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-2**, p. 2-10; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 290.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 208.\n\n979.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant: \"*(1) had no comprehensive plan to mitigate the public's concerns and provide benefits; (2) failed to understand the socio-political conditions in the area and the Resource's role in exacerbating already existing tensions; (3) failed to sufficiently engage the affected communities or involve them in strategic decision making during the consultation process; and (4) underestimated what it would take to obtain a social license and maintain it*.\"1235\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 291.\n\n980.\n\nRespondent claims that Claimant's ESIA failed to conform to the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles as well as to its own Environmental Design Criteria (EDC) in various areas as a result of which it would not have been able to seek funding and would not have been able to obtain political risk insurance.1236\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 313, 320, *referring to* Filas I, Sections 5.2.3, 5.5.3 and 5.5.4.\n\n981.\n\nRespondent relies on Dr. Connor's testimony that \"*the information on baseline social conditions is completely inadequate*\" and that the ESIA ignored the conflict situation in Balochistan and thereby also the potential of the project further exacerbating existing conflicts.1237 Dr. Connor pointed out that the ESIA provides only a \"*brief and superficial description of conflict in Balochistan*\" and does not identify terrorism or insurgent activity as a risk to Claimant's operations but focuses on social ills which reveals \"*a profound misunderstanding of the project*.\"1238 In addition, Respondent argues that, as pointed out by Dr. Connor, there were no mitigation measures to manage potential social conflict with or among the tribes or to deal with militant organizations; there was also no analysis of the adverse impacts of the projects and whether these would be outweighed by the benefits that Claimant would provide.1239 With regard to the alleged benefits, Respondent quotes from Dr. Connor's testimony that she found no information on:\n\n[H]*ow that was analyzed, who did it, who determined that was the right thing to do, who determined that wasn't the wrong thing to do that would divide and cause more conflict, who determined how they were going to figure out what the recipients have, because if you give the wrong thing to the wrong group, you may have a war on your hands.

Respondent refers to Ms. Filas' testimony that \"*IFC, in particular, will require a management system to be fleshed out to a certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA*\" and argues that despite Claimant's reference to a deadline for a \"*fully operational ESMS completed by the end of December 2010*,\" there was no evidence of any further steps taken towards completion of the ESMS by November 2011.1241\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 212-213, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1986 lines 18-20 and p. 1987 lines 1-8.\n\n983.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant's approach to community relationships and social management programs was \"*at best haphazard*\" and refers to Dr. Connor's conclusion that it \"*did not have anywhere near the right staff to develop*\" the project. Respondent notes that Claimant would have required, *inter alia*, a \"*conflict management expert*\" and argues that this was not only a question of additional costs but also the delay in \"*finding and putting in place the right individuals*.\"1242 Respondent also refers to the observations made by a consultant reviewing the community outreach process which, according to Respondent, \"*counter any idea that TCC had in place a robust community relations plan*.\"1243\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 214, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2019; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 298, *referring to* Connor, Section 2.1, \u00b6 9 and Section 2.2.2, \u00b6 5.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 298, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 3-4.\n\n984.\n\nAccording to Dr. Connor, Claimant would have required \"*a very skilled manager, not only a community relations expert\u2026but a manager. And that only happens when you put it within the confines of an Environmental and Social Management Plan*.\" Respondent considers it undisputed that no such management system was developed as Ms. Cessford admitted that \"*an environmental social management system \u2026 was being developed by TCC and stopped at the point that the Project ceased.*\" Referring to Ms. Filas, Respondent contends that the management system was required by relevant international standards but Claimant instead only had a \"*plan for a plan*\" which was not in accordance with these standards.1244\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2064 lines 16-20, p. 1896 lines 7-10 and p. 1956 lines 4-10.\n\n985.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reference to other documents besides the ESIA and community initiatives, Respondent points to Dr. Connor's explanation that she did not have to go further than the ESIA because it did not contain the information that a lender would want to see and a lender would therefore have requested that the ESIA be completely redone. According to Respondent, Claimant's community initiatives were insufficient in the absence of an adequate impact assessment to determine what benefits would be necessary to obtain a social license from the community. Respondent claims that \"*the contributions and expenditures TCC outlined in slides 104 and 105 of their opening presentation does little to show that TCC understood the social risks, assessed those risks, and properly planned to mitigate those risks*.\"1245\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2029-2030, 2036, 2047 and 2057-2058.\n\n986.\n\nRespondent considers that this conclusion is also confirmed by Ms. Filas who testied that \"[b]*ased on the status of the programs in the ESIA, this Project \u2026 would be extremely challenged to gain public support, which is needed to get you social license to operate*\" as well as by Prof. Rais who did not think that \"*these social development programs and community development \u2026 will satisfy the Baloch, who have long list of grievances*.\"1246 Respondent also refers to Mr. Davies who testified that \"*uniform negative feedback provided to us by community representatives indicated that TCC likely failed to engage in a way that would have positively influenced community perceptions*\" and to Mr. Owen who also concluded that Claimant had not adequately engaged with the local communities and failed to understand the tribal culture in Balochistan.1247\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 219, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1958 lines 18-20 and p. 1792 lines 18-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 219, *quoting from* Davies II, p. 45 *and referring to* Owen Trip Report, pp. 6-8; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 350.\n\n987.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that Claimant \"*performed some consultation work with local communities and gathered some locat data*,\" but maintains that Claimant failed to allocate adequate resources to the consultation process and failed to address the community concerns in a meaningful way as they were simply passed on and no follow up was made. Referring to Dr. Connor, Respondent contends that Claimant had set up a formal grievance procedure but failed to properly implement it. Respondent also asserts that Claimant ignored concerns raised by its own community relations team regarding the hiring of outsiders for security posts and claims that \"[t]*he community's negative perception of TCC was evident.*\"1248\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 297-301, *referring to* Connor, Section 2.2.2, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\n988.\n\nRespondent contends that Dr. Connor's conclusions are also confirmed by contemporaneous documents referring to labor disputes, community protests, hunger strikes, a terrorist attack, and bullying of local journalists all of which involved or were directed at Claimant. Respondent also refers to a statement in the Forward Work Plan in the Feasibility Study which confirms in its view that Claimat had not engaged with \"*stakeholders in the communities of the pipeline area, Gwadar and in water affected areas*.\"1249\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 221-222, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-564, RE-656** to **RE-658**, **RE-650, RE-752** and **RE-576-32**, p. 32-9;

in its view, risks relating to the lack of a social license cannot be incorporated into a modern DCF model and therefore render the project's value \"*speculative, at best*.\"1253\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 224-225, *referring to* Dagdelen/Owen I, \u00b6\u00b6 212, 220-223.\n\n991.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's ESIA, Respondent argues that it was not in compliance with the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles, which made it unacceptable to international lenders and the affected community, and points to the following \"*deficiencies*\": \"*there was a secret sludge dump, TCC circumvented points of compliance to measure water and air discharges, the discharges were not within the prescribed limits of Pakistani law, there were no management plans for mitigation, and mitigation costs were not included in either the ESIA or the IMD FS*.\"1254\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 226; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 310.\n\n992.\n\nRespondent considers it undisputed that the ESIA would have had to comply with local law and internationally recognized standards, both of which are acknowledged in the EDC, and refers to Ms. Cessford's testimony that \"*ESIAs must also satisfy policy considerations in addition to the legal requirements imposed by Pakistani national and regional governments*,\" which include \"*internationally recognized guidelines on GIIP\u2026additional requirements or obligations imposed by financial lenders, and commitments made to stakeholders*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant therefore also had to comply with its EDC which sets compliance targets adopted and referenced in the ESIA.1255\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 227-228, *quoting from* Cessford, \u00b6 55; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 313-314, *referring to* Filas II, \u00b6 30.\n\n993.\n\nRespondent argues that lenders expect the ESIA to \"*meet host country requirements*\"; however, Claimant's ESIA failed to comply with: (i) national standards for water quality discharge at the Port of Gwadar; (ii) IFC and Pakistan's guidelines for pollution control of NOx emissions; (iii) the 2002 BM Rules regarding the backfilling of pits; and (iv) the IFC guidelines for assessing the impact of high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.1256\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 230, 235, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1952 lines 7-14 and p. 1958 lines 1-7, *and* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39;

Claimant, however, did not adequtately locate the points of compliance for assessing air quality and in its dispersion model at the closest point of access or the property boundary. Claimant also did not set the monitoring points in locations with the nearest receptors and thereby acted contrary to the local law.1257\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 231-232, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1926 lines 3-8, p. 1945 lines 19-22, p. 1946 lines 12-14 and pp. 1917-1918, *and* Cessford, \u00b6 67; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 334, 336, referring to Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 138, 165, 175-176; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6. 325, *referring to* Filas I, Section 5.3.3, p. 15.\n\n995.\n\nAs for water discharge, Respondent considers that Claimant conceded that it could not meet national standards (let alone its own Environmental Design Criteria) as it required a variance for two metals \"*with little to no justification*.\" It further claims that, \"*in many cases, TCC was planning to discharge metals that were thousands of times the ocean background levels,*\" *i.e*., 10,000 for copper, 7,800 for lead, 3,750 for nickel and 10,050 for zinc and significantly exceeded the EDC limits. Respondent also contends that Claimant failed to consider the cumulative impact of the metals it planned to discharge over the life of the project on the fisheries and refers to its expert Dr. Ault who pointed out that Claimant's modelling studies were \"*insufficient*\" and the \"*risks posed to the local ecosystems and local populations are unquantified*.\"1258\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 231-234, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1919, p. 1921 lines 16-18 and p. 1953 line 17 to p. 1954 line 8, Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 123-124, *and* Ault, p. 10; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 312, 335 *referring to* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 71, 80-81, 113, 121-125, 150, 190; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 332-335, *referring to* Filas I, Sections 5.2.2 and 6.0.\n\n996.\n\nRespondent contends that neither the ESIA nor the Feasibility Study include plans for mitigation and, therefore, the costs for mitigating the adverse effects or emissions, water discharge, sludge treatment and removal were no adequately reflected in the Feasibility Study. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant recognized in the Feasibility Study that the environmental impacts of the project \"*could affect the health and welfare of the communities*\" and that \"*some of the impacts would not be able to be reduced to acceptable levels*\"; the ESIA, however, failed to identify or address these areas of non-compliance. As an example, Respondent considers it confirmed by Mr. Livesey that Claimant had no plans for treating and disposing of the wastewater treatment sludge and merely speculated that it would be \"*an authorized facility in the Port of Gwadar area*\"; however, there was no analysis of the amount of sludge or its chemical characteristics and no estimate of the costs for treatment and disposal.1259 Similarly, Respondent claims that while Claimant recognized the \"*potential loss of income from fishing near the site for discharge of water in the ocean at Port Gwadar*\" and identified as a source of \"*tension and discord in the local communities,*\" it failed to assess the impact on the fisheries and failed to account for any mitigation costs in this regard.1260\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 237-239, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-13**, p. 13-31 and *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), pp. 355-357, *and* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 126; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 329, 340 *referring to* Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 126 *and* **Exhibit RE-601**, p. 4-43.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 240-241, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576**, p. 13-31, *and referring to* Ault, p. 10 *and* Filas II, \u00b6 131; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 330, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-601**, pp. 8-17 to 8-19; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 335.\n\n997.\n\nRespondent also contends that the ESIA failed to evaluate mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the public concerns raised as required under the IFC standards and refers to Ms. Filas' opinion that any \"*mitigation measures were limited to generalized statements regarding economic development, establishing communications between TCC and local communities and Project monitoring*.\"1261\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 326, *quoting from* Filas I, \u00b6 12.\n\n998.\n\nReferring to Ms. Filas, Respondent contends that the management system plans missing in the ESIA are critical in that they \"*define what would need to be done to implement those commitments that are made in the ESIA, in order to make and adequate estimate of the costs*.\" Ms. Cessford conceded that the ESIA did not include an environmental mitigation budget but stated that \"*there are numbers presented in the Feasibility Study for it*\"; however, the Feasibility Study was completed almost six months before the ESIA and there were no costs in the Feasibility Study, *e.g*., for the proposed sludge disposal even though Mr. Livesey did not know \"*whether it would be a significant cost*.\"1262 Respondent considers that the amount of USD 1.2 million in CAPEX for \"*field environmental mitigation costs*\" is \"*completely unrealistic in light of the ESIA's deficiencies*\" and notes that OPEX G&A costs reflect only environmental monitoring but expressly exclude environmental closure costs. As a result, Respondent claims that the mitigation costs required during the operation of the mine \"*are severely understated and in most cases are missing.*\"1263 According to Respondent, the same therefore also applies to Prof. Davis' model, which \"*only addressed three discreet areas, which did not include water aquifer reinjection, training of low-skilled workers, sludge treatment and disposal, air and discharge emission controls, just to name a few*.\"1264\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 242-244, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1997 lines 16-19 and p. 1934 lines 6-7 *and* (Day 2), p. 358 lines 2-5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 245, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-23**, p. 23-27 *and* **RE-576-24**, pp. 24-23 to 24-24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 246, *referring to* Davis I, Workpaper 26, pp. H-53 to H-56.\n\n999.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimant's ESIA failed to meet the formal requirements under the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles and notes that Ms. Cessford testified only that \"*it aligned with the IFC Performance Standards*\" and referred to the Feasibility and other unnamed draft documents that would together with ESIA meet the applicable international standards.1265 Respondent points to Ms. Filas' identification of \"*the key areas*\" where the ESIA did not meet international standards and her conclusion that it would therefore not have met lender or regulatory requirements as of the valuation date.1266 Specifically, Ms. Filas stated:\n\n\"*They haven't provided justifications, in particular, for greenhouse gas, for NOx emissions and for the concentrate effluent, and failure to adequately address public concerns regarding aquifer depletions, air emissions, the quality of water into the fishery, and the toxic mine water that would have been left at the end of the closure period*.\"1267\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 247, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1900 lines 16-17 *and referring to* pp. 1900-1904.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 248, *referring to* Filas I, Filas II, *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1943-1959.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1958 lines 1-7.\n\n1000.\n\nRespondent also refers to Ms. Filas' testimony that the ESIA itself would have had to provide an evaluation of the transboundary water drawdown in Afghanistan and an assessment on security in order to meet the IFC Performance Standards.1268 According to Respondent, Claimant understated the risks and impact associated with: (i) the extraction of water from the Fan Sediments; (ii) the safety and security issues in Balochistan; (iii) the greenhouse gas emissions from the mine that would amount to almost 1% of Pakistan's overall greenhouse emissions; (iv) the environmental impacts to the marine life in the Arabian sea; (v) transboundary impacts on Afghanistan; and (vi) the health impacts on the employees.1269\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102 (numbering after \u00b6 248) on p. 103), *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 320-325; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 324, 330, 334-339, 351.\n\n1001.\n\nRespondent submits that both of its experts reached the conclusion that Claimant's ESIA was not lender ready: (i) Ms. Filas stated that she could \"*tell by the content of what's in the ESIA today whether its lender ready. And this one was not*\"; and (ii) Dr. Connor stated that the ESIA would need to be \"*redone*\" because it has not \"*identified all the impacts*\" and does not give \"*the reader \u2026 enough information to reach a conclusion about whether \u2026 to invest or not.*\"1270\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 249-250, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1986 lines 6-9 and p. 2030 lines 2-3.\n\n1002.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that the assessment of a project's environmental and social impacts is a dynamic and iterative process. It notes that the ESIA is submitted to both the local authorities for permits needed for the project as well as to financiers and adds that \"[a]*s the local authorities and the financiers make changes to the ESIA, the ESIA normally goes through various drafts. With each draft, the requirements imposed by the financiers and the government may require changes to the mine plan, and the mitigation costs related with certain compliance requirements can materially impact the mine, if not make the mine uneconomic to operate*.\"1271\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 347; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 316.\n\n1003.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Claimant planned to start construction less than a year later and, as of November 2011, \"*the ESIA was not complete, lacked many of elements that lenders would require, and did not include a plan for managing environmental mitigation*.\" Referring to Ms. Filas, Respondent maintains that the ESIA was only a \"*plan for a plan*\" which, in Respondent's view, \"*could have equally been used for any other project*,\" and further maintains that \"*IFC would have required at the very least a draft management plan*.\" Specifically, Respondent refers to Ms. Filas testimony that, drawing on her experience of working with IFC, \"*the IFC \u2026 would expect to see a management system. I believe that this Guidance note is saying that it doesn't have to be complete and final, but it needs to address those elements that are time-dependent*.\"1272 According to Respondent, this management system is required for \"*any significant impacts that require mitigation*\" and should address non-compliant air and water discharges, occupational health and safety plans and security measures to protect the work site and the workers.1273\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 251-252, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1956 lines 1-12 and p. 1983 lines 9-18; ; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 349, *referring to* Filas II, \u00b6 143 *and* Henry/Howden II, p. 17.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 319, *referring to* Filas I, Table 2 and \u00b6\u00b6 68, 142, 166; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 323.\n\n1004.\n\nRespondent notes that Ms. Filas identified these deficiencies of the ESIA during a high-level review and observed that \"*it is conceivable that the project's ESIA may be rejected outright, without necessary conducting a detailed review of its content*.\" Respondent argues that a buyer would also have detected these shortcomings and likely have required the presentation of effective management systems before accepting the ESIA. Respondent also submits that lenders would have found these deficiencies \"*at the very least problematic*\" and curing them would have resulted in additional costs for Claimant (as would have the addition of the required mitigation measures), which are not accounted for in the Feasibility Study.1274\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 254-255, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1959 lines 1-3; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 311, 347-348 *quoting from* Filas II, \u00b6 15 and referring to \u00b6\u00b6 66, 143, 180.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties' dispute regarding the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the Reko Diq Project, which was prepared and completed for submission to the authorities in November 2010, concerns several issues, which are to some extent intertwined. Respondent and its experts take the position that the ESIA did not contain all of the elements required under the relevant international standards that regulatory authorities and lenders would have expected to see in an ESIA when considering whether to approve or provide funding to the project. In addition, Respondent and its experts have raised concerns with regard to certain impacts that are addressed in the ESIA but would, in their opinion, not have been considered acceptable by the authorities and/or lenders.\n\n1006.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties' experts that the relevant international standards are the Equator Principles, and the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Performance Standards. With regard to the environmental impact assessment, Ms. Cessford and Ms. Filas both also made reference to Pakistan's National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS).\n\n1007.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, there further appears to be agreement between the Parties regarding the methodology applied by Claimant's consultants in preparing the ESIA. Ms. Filas confirmed in her second report:\n\n\"*Filas Engineering agrees that it did not take exception to the general methodology that SRK Consulting UK Ltd and Hagler Bailly Pakistan Pvt. Ltd used in conducting the ESIA analysis. The impact analysis methodology used appeared to be conventional. Due to the high-level nature of our review, Filas Engineering did not conduct a technical review of the various modeling efforts nor did we take exception to their process. We did, however, express concern regarding the proper assessment of specific issues and in the comprehensiveness of the ESIA content relative to Equator Principles IFC Performance Standard expectations*.\"1275\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 78.\n\n1008.\n\nDr. Connor stated in her report with regard to the consultation of stakeholders: \"*TCC identified stakeholders, conducted consultations between March 2008 and October 2009 with various stakeholders including a selection of communities in three affected areas, developed a Grievance Mechanism, and prepared an initial Public Consultation and Development Plan (PCDP) developed during the Scoping phase. Consultation information in the ESIA and PCDP indicates that TCC followed the usual protocols*.\"1276\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.2, \u00b6 1.\n\n1009.\n\nHowever, Dr. Connor also noted the following:\n\n\"*The different formats used and the brevity of the descriptions of stakeholder participation (particularly at the community level), however, inhibit judging the acceptability of the consultation process at that stage and as described in the documents in terms of its scope, extent, methodologies and the level of representativeness of the participation. A reasonable judgment would have required more clarity in identifying the extent and scope of consultation*.\"1277\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.2, \u00b6 2.\n\n1010.\n\nWhile Respondent's experts therefore made certain caveats regarding their acceptance of the methodology and process followed, the Tribunal considers that in the absence of any specific objection in this regard, it has no basis to find that the ESIA process itself, *i.e*., the manner in which information was collected and assessed to determine the environmental and social impacts of the project, would have given a buyer or a lender cause for concern.\n\n1011.\n\nBefore turning to the criticisms raised by Respondent's experts on the contents of the ESIA, the Tribunal also notes that there was agreement between all experts that the assessment of environmental and social impacts is characterized by an iterative process that continues throughout the life of the project. They are in disagreement, however, as to the question which level of information, in particular when it comes to mitigation measures and a management system, has to be included in the ESIA, which is prepared before the start of construction, in order to be considered acceptable by the relevant authorities and potential lenders.\n\n1012.\n\nRespondent itself confirmed in this regard that when an ESIA is submitted to the relevant authorities and lenders, it is not yet set in stone; it expressly noted that \"[a]*s the local authorities and the financiers may make changes to the ESIA, the ESIA normally goes through various drafts*.\"1278 Ms. Filas stated in her second report, however, that \"[i]*f the Project does not propose adequate environmental controls and does not enjoy local support, it is conceivable that its ESIA may be rejected outright, without necessarily conducting a detailed review of its content.*\"1279\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 316.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 15.\n\n1013.\n\nMs. Cessford explained at the Hearing on Quantum that the expectation of what would occur after the submission of the ESIA to the Balochistan authorities was as follows:\n\n\"*The ESIA team had actually been scoped to interact with the regulator post-submission, the regulator in this case being the Balochistan Environmental Protection Agency. We had also been scoped to undertake the feedback stakeholder of consultation, which is a very important stage in the process, whereby the outcome of the ESIA is presented to stakeholders so they can understand how the issues that they raised in the Scoping Stage have been addressed and what the plans are moving forward with the Project.*\n\n*This was to take place in parallel with the Public Hearing, which is the regulatory requirement, in terms of the Balochistan environmental requirements. In addition to that, we were expecting to have to, as part of our work with the interaction with the stakeholders and the regulators--to possibly have to make amendments to the ESIA. That is quite common as a result of these engagement activities. And then, also, we had been scoped with providing input into TCC's development of their Management Plans*.\"1280\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1897 line 16 to p. 1898 line 15.\n\n1014.\n\nMs. Filas noted in her second report that \"[i]*t is true that a regulatory authority such as the Pakistan EPA can review an ESIA report and reject certain portions of its content and request additional information on those aspects that are not fully explained*.\" In her opinion, however, the environmental issues she had identified \"*would likely be a non-starter in most countries*.\"1281 She further confirmed her opinion that \"[t]*o propose a massive use of water resources in a hyperarid environment with little to no environmental controls on air emissions and water discharges without adequate justification would likely be a non-starter for the Pakistan EPA, the IFC and potential private investment firms*.\"1282\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 80.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 180.\n\n1015.\n\nWith regard to the review of the ESIA by the competent regulatory authority, which she confirmed to be the Balochistan EPA, Ms. Filas noted at the Hearing on Quantum that she was \"*not an expert on Pakistan requirements*\" and that she did \"*not have experience submitting these ESIAs to the Balochistan EPA*.\" She clarified that her opinion was based on her expectation \"*that any Regulatory Authority would expect justification for the presentations that are made. So, it doesn't require experience in Balochistan to have a reasonable expectation that they would behave in the manner that most regulators around the world do*.\"1283 Ms. Filas further confirmed that she had not asked for information about the record of the Balochistan EPA in reviewing ESIAs but was aware of the ESIA for the earlier Tanjeel project at Reko Diq which had been approved. Claimant pointed out to Ms. Filas that it had asked for but was not provided with any other ESIA submitted to the Balochistan EPA and that the Tanjeel ESIA was therefore the only ESIA in the record. It further pointed out that the Saindak mine, which has been operating in Balochistan for a number of years, therefore appeared to be allowed to operate without having an approved ESIA.1284 When presented with this information, Ms. Filas maintained her opinion that \"*the term* 'non-starter' *\u2026 it's an accurate statement because \u2026 the massive use of water resources in a hyperarid environment, with little or no environmental controls on air emissions and water discharges without adequate justification would likely be a non-starter*.\" She further clarified that \"*if you're not going to mitigate, \u2026 if you're going to require variances to the expectations by the lenders and government \u2026 and you don't provide adequate justification for those, then it's likely to be a nonstarter because that's what regulators and lenders do*.\"1285 Ms. Filas testified that \"[w]*hat happened with the Saindak mine is not relevant to whether or not the Reko Diq ESIA is lender ready*\"; she clarified that she had not been testifying about regulatory approval in her second report but rather that \"*lenders will defer to the Host Country requirements. You have to meet Host Country requirements, and you have to meet lender expectations*.\"1286\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1989 line 16 to p. 1990 line 18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 1992-1993.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1993 line 22 to p. 1994 line 13.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1994 line 17 to p. 1995 line 3.\n\n1016.\n\nMs. Filas' oral testimony made clear that she did not base her opinion that the ESIA in its current form \"*would likely be non-starter for the Pakistan EPA*\" on any specific practices of the competent provincial authority in Balochistan but rather on a more general expectation of how a regulatory authority would react to the environmental impact of the project as presented in the ESIA. At the end of her testimony, Ms. Filas further clarified that she did not really express an opinion on whether regulatory approval would be denied but rather whether non-conformities with the environmental requirements in Pakistan would result in lenders refusing to fund the project.\n\n1017.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume that the ESIA would have been rejected by the Balochistan EPA. As Ms. Cessford testified, Claimant expected that interactions with the authority would be required after submission of the ESIA, that there would be a public hearing in accordance with the regulatory requirements, and that they would \"*possibly have to make amendments to the ESIA*,\" which she considered \"*quite common*.\"1287 As noted above, Respondent itself submitted that \"*the ESIA normally goes through various drafts*\" as, *inter alia*, \"*the government may require changes to the mine plan*.\"1288 There is no indication that the Balochistan EPA would not have engaged in such a dialogue with Claimant in the absence of Respondent's Treaty breaches. In addition, as was also pointed out by Claimant, Balochistan's authorities did not raise any concern with regard to the environmental or social impact of the project after the ESIA had been submitted together with TCCP's Mining Lease Application in February 2011. No concern in this regard was included in the reasons provided by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject and there is no evidence of a concern being raised at any point prior to this arbitration.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1898 lines 8-12.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 316.\n\n1018.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the more relevant question is therefore whether the content of the ESIA and the proposed measures to mitigate the impact identified in the ESIA would have been considered by lenders to be in conformity with international standards and, if not, whether they would have required significant additional measures and, thus, additional costs to be included before agreeing to fund the project. In this regard, Ms. Cessford testified at the Hearing on Quantum that with regard to expected interactions with investors, the ESIA team had only been scoped to produce a \"*Glorified Executive Summary*\" of the ESIA, which she described as \"*a much longer Executive Summary, suitable for investors that explained the process and the interaction with the project engineers*.\" She further testified:\n\n\"*In addition to that, although we had not been scoped in this case, based on my other experience on other projects, we had expected to have interactions with any investors, respond to questions, possibly undertake additional studies, such as on issues they raised, and to develop action plans to address any gaps that they might identify that they felt needed further work*.\"1289\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1898 line 18 to p. 1899 line 16.\n\n1019.\n\nMs. Cessford's testimony makes clear that Claimant and its consultants expected at the time that additional work might be necessary before the ESIA would be considered satisfactory. It is also apparent to the Tribunal that additional work might result in additional costs, be it due to substantial further work on the ESIA and/or due to additional mitigation measures that might have to be included following the interactions with investors and authorities. One question that will be addressed below is therefore whether Claimant and/or Prof. Davis included adequate contingency for such additional costs and possibly also delays in the start of construction.\n\n1020.\n\nHowever, as noted above, Ms. Filas expressed the opinion in her second report that \"[i]*f the Project does not propose adequate environmental controls and does not enjoy local support, it is conceivable that its ESIA may be rejected outright, without necessarily conducting a detailed review of its content*\" and that by proposing \"*a massive use of water resources in a hyperarid environment with little to no environmental controls on air emissions and water discharges without adequate justification*,\" the ESIA would likely have been \"*a non-starter for \u2026 the IFC and potential private investment firms*.\"1290\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 180.\n\n1021.\n\nDr. Connor testified at the Hearing on Quantum:\n\n\"*So, let me tell you what would happen if this ESIA would have gone to a lender, whether it's me or anybody else. They would have said, This ESIA has to be--or SIA has to be completely redone. You haven't identified all the impacts, and things like land aren't even addressed in it. You haven't properly addressed the significance, and you haven't given the reader or me or anyone else enough information to reach a conclusion about whether I would want to invest or not*.\"1291\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2029 line 22 to p. 2030 line 9.\n\n1022.\n\nIt became clear at the Hearing on Quantum that the opinion expressed by both of Respondent's experts, *i.e*., that the ESIA was so deficient that it would likely not even have formed the basis for further discussions with the lenders as described by Ms. Cessford, was based on the consideration that certain information required under the relevant international standards had to be included specifically in the ESIA and not in any other part of the documentation of the project, in particular the Feasibility Study.\n\n1023.\n\nMs. Filas clarified at the Hearing on Quantum that she had not been retained to provide an assessment of any gaps contained in the work done by Claimant and its consultants but rather of \"*gaps* \u2026 *in the content of the ESIA relative to lender expectations*.\" In response to the question whether she had considered whether any such gaps might be filled in other documents, Ms. Filas confirmed that she had \"*looked at the ESIA as a stand-alone document*\" and that her \"*task was to look at the ESIA and understand and advise on whether or not it was complete and technically adequate*.\"1292 Ms. Filas added that she had also looked at \"*the background information*\" and whether \"*what was presented in the ESIA was a reasonable translation and summary of what was in the supporting documents*.\" Specifically with regard to the situation of conflict in Balochistan, which she considered to be \"*so downplayed in the ESIA itself*,\" Ms. Filas explained that she had also reviewed Chapter 19 of the Feasibility Study on Security and testified: \"*I looked at the representation in the Feasibility Study, and it was represented more like what I was expecting to see, where terrorists and militant groups were active in the area, which was more like what I was expecting to see*.\"1293 Ms. Filas further confirmed that the list of documents she had reviewed was not a comprehensive set of documents for the Reko Diq project but expressed the opinion:\n\n\"*I don't think it was necessary to ask for more documents to come to the conclusions that I came to. My review was done at a high level, and I could see that if this document were to be submitted to the regulators and disclosed to the public, it would have been cause for confusion that would have required additional attention being devoted to this document*.\"1294\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1967 line 18 to p. 1968 line 4.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1968 line 13 to p. 1970 line 8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1971 line 12 to p. 1972 line 4.\n\n1024.\n\nThen asked whether this additional attention would have come in the course of the iterative conversations and dialogue she had referred to earlier, Ms. Filas confirmed that \"[i]*t would have come through that process*\" but maintained the opinion that \"*typically you will complete that work before you submit the document for regulatory review.*\"1295\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1971 lines 8-11.\n\n1025.\n\nDr. Connor also testified at the Hearing on Quantum that she was criticizing a lack of information in the ESIA itself:\n\n\"*I thought I didn't have the information. They're supposed to be in the ESIA. The information is supposed to be in the Social Impact Assessment. That's where it's meant to be. They said it was finished. It's not there. There's a difference. It's not supposed to be somewhere else*.\"1296\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2029 lines 7-12.\n\n1026.\n\nDr. Connor emphasized that \"[t]*here are steps in the financing Project. You will submit to the lender certain documents at intervals. They will decide whether to go forward at each of those intervals*.\" She confirmed that a lender would also have reviewed the Feasibility Study but maintained that \"*their purposes are completely different*\" and that the \"*social assessment doesn't occur until the ESIA until the Social Impact Assessment. And that document would have to demonstrate to the lender that you are serious and know what you're doing about the social impacts, particularly those of the nature--the fragile and delicate nature and volatile nature that I mentioned*.\"1297 Dr. Connor then confirmed that the opinion she had expressed in her report, *i.e*., that the existing documentation did not demonstrate a satisfactory grasp of the human environment in which TCC would operate, particularly the socio-political and conflict conditions, was based only on the documents she had reviewed and that she \"*didn't need to see any other documents*.\"1298 She maintained:\n\n\"*If it is meant to be addressed as a social impact in the ESIA, that is where it goes. It can be 35 other places, but it has to be in the social impact assessment because that's the document that assesses the risk of that to the Project, and the risk of the Project to the people in that area.*\n\n*So, you can have all kinds of background documents. You have--there should have been. There should have been a very in-depth study of this. That does not exist. There is a sort of superficial study. But the ESIA is a document that the bank--you do not ask the lenders to look around for things. They have a suite of documents they ask for, and that's where it is supposed to be*.\"1299\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2029 line 18 to p. 2031 line 9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2036 lines 2-22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2037 lines 7-20.\n\n1027.\n\nIt is apparent from the testimony of Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor that their review focused on the ESIA itself and whether this report included the information required under the relevant international standards, *i.e*., in particular the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards. However, the Tribunal notes that when Ms. Cessford was asked whether the ESIA met the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards at the time it was submitted, she testified as follows:\n\n\"*I would say that it aligned with the IFC Performance Standards. My experience shows that every potential investor has certain things that they are concerned about, and that varies from investor to investor and from person to person within the financial institute. So, one never knows exactly how they are going to interpret it, but it certainly aligned with the process, and it took a precautionary approach to the items that were covered.*\n\n*Q. Okay. When you say* 'aligned with the process,' *do you mean that, in your opinion, it met the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards on the date of submission, or that it would meet those standards in the future?*\n\n*A. The Report itself or the Process? Because the IFC Performance Standards, which support the Equator Principles, outline a process. The ESIA is one step in that process. So, there isn't a fixed endpoint that you reach. The ESIA was part of that, and at that point, we stopped, but we were still doing other activities in parallel with the ESIA that might not be captured in the document itself.*\n\n*The document's key purpose is to submit to regulatory authorities, not to meet the Equator Principles. To meet the Equator Principles and the IFC Performance Standards, one is doing a process which is captured in multiple documents, including the Feasibility Study and other documents that may have been generated throughout the course of that process*.\"1300\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1900 line 13 to p. 1901 line 22.\n\n1028.\n\nMs. Cessford further clarified that in her opinion, the process of preparing the ESIA met the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards and in terms of content reiterated that \"*the content of the ESIA Report is only part of the content that's needed to meet the IFC Performance Standards*.\" She further confirmed that \"*if you pull in the Feasibility Study and other additional work that was going on in parallel, then, yes, I believe it would* [meet the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards].\" She testified that some of the additional content she was referring to was contained in the Feasibility Study and further referred to \"*draft documents floating around at the time we stopped working.*\"1301\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1902 line 2 to p. 1903 line 19.\n\n1029.\n\nBased on Ms. Cessford's testimony, it appears to be undisputed that the ESIA did not contain in and of itself all of the information required under the relevant international standards. The experts expressed deviating opinions as to whether this would have caused lenders to request additional work on the ESIA on that basis or whether they would also have been satisfied if the information was included in other documentation such as, in particular, the Feasibility Study and other reports that Claimant had completed or was planning to complete before seeking funding from international lenders.\n\n1030.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on this point. Even if, as Respondent's experts testified, lenders had required Claimant to include all relevant information, *e.g.*, on the security and conflict situation in Balochistan, in the ESIA itself and had not been satisfied that such information was provided in other reports or in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that these issues could have been resolved without significant additional costs or significant delay \u2013 to the extent an assessment had been made and the information was therefore already available in a different part of the documentation.\n\n1031.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the relevant question is therefore whether Respondent's experts identified assessments or plans that would have had to be included in the ESIA under the relevant international standards but were not made by Claimant or its consultants, including in other parts of the documentation for the Reko Diq project.\n\n1032.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent's expert identified in particular two aspects that they considered crucial but missing in the ESIA (as well as other parts of the documentation), *i.e*., an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and a community impact assessment. In addition, Ms. Filas raised various additional concerns regarding the environmental impacts of the project presented in the ESIA.\n\n**i. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed Environmental and Social Management**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1033.\n\nAs for environmental and social management, Ms. Filas stated in her second report that \"*the management measures proposed in the ESIA were only broad-based generalizations that would normally be further addressed in environmental and social management systems. The ESIA did not include these management systems, which is customary for inclusion in a typical ESIA and mandated by IFC Performance Standard 1 and Equator Principle 4, but instead only included a framework for the management systems. Consequently, the ESIA did not provide adequate information for a reviewer to determine the effectiveness of the management systems in mitigating environmental impacts*.\"1302 In her opinion, \"*a certain number of the evaluations and impact analyses did not get completed to a level that meets international best practice or typical lender expectations*,\" including \"*the* 'plan-for-a-plan' *instead of actual management systems to demonstrate how mitigation will be accomplished*.\"1303 Ms. Filas further stated:\n\n\"*Discipline-specific management plans describe the* 'who, what, where, when and why' *of implementing mitigation measures. If these are not spelled out, it is difficult to accurately cost out the management system implementation costs. This suggests that the costs included in the Feasibility Study financial model may be insufficient to cover the actions needed to mitigate Project impacts to acceptable levels once those management plans are adequately developed*.\"1304\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 17.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 21.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 66.\n\n1034.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Ms. Cessford agreed that \"[i]*n terms of environmental and social management, the process is laid out in IFC Performance Standard One*\" and noted that this process \"*follows a standard business cycle of plan, do, check, act*\" with certain additions. She testified that \"*all the activities that were undertaken by the ESIA team fall under the planning aspect of this*\" and then explained how they \"*would have expected the Environmental and Social Management System to have moved forward through this plan, do, check, act, as it moved towards construction, operation, and then, eventually, its end of life-of-mine*.\"1305 Ms. Cessford illustrated the steps which had been carried out and completed (orange) as well as the steps that had been commenced but not completed and the outstanding steps (grey) as follows:1306\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1888 line 6 to p. 1889 line 6.\n\nCessford Presentation, p. 4. *See also* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1889 line 7 to p. 1892 line 4.\n\n1035.\n\nMs. Filas testified in response to this presentation:\n\n\"*I heard her Opening Presentation, and I fundamentally disagree with the comments that she made about the ESMS being something that can be put off until later.*\n\n*I've been called in on projects, by the IFC in particular, where projects have done almost identical to this and where they had not done a management system--and management systems, I agree, they're an iterative process. They are developed over time and refined over time, but you don't--if you're trying to comply with Equator and IFC expectations, you have a plan, a management system plan, and action plan for those key mitigation measures that you need to be able to demonstrate how you're going to implement them on the ground.*\n\n*You don't have a generic plan for a plan that does not address how you do that, and you don't wait until later, particularly in those areas that are timedependent.*\n\n*This Project was going to be--was scheduled to be implemented according to the Implementation Schedule in the ESIA, less than a year later. So, you better have your preferential benefits for local communities identified and who's going to get those benefits because, in an area of conflict, you're going to have conflict if you don't respect that*.\"1307\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1973 line 10 to p. 1974 line 13.\n\n1036.\n\nMs. Filas noted that she did not have experience working with Pakistan but that she had worked with lenders and \"*the lenders expect more than what is presented here. IFC is very clear on that*.\" As for the opinion expressed in her second report that a \"*complete plan*\" would normally be expected, including by the Government of Pakistan, Ms. Filas stated that she \"*would expect that most Governments expect to see \u2026 a complete document, and there may be some discretion as far as the level of development in--from country to country. But certainly from a lender perspective and an IFC perspective, I can assure you that the expectation is higher than a generic plan for a plan*.\"1308\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1975 line 9 to p. 1976 line 5.\n\n1037.\n\nThen pointed to the IFC Performance Standards' description of the \"*Social and Environmental Management System*,\" which \"*will incorporate the following elements: (i) Social and Environmental Assessment; (ii) management program ; (iii) organizational capacity; (iv) training; (v) community engagement; (vi) monitoring; and (vii) reporting*,\"1309 Ms. Filas agreed that the ESIA corresponded to the first element and was different from the management program embodied in the second element. Ms. Filas did not agree, however, that by criticizing the Reko Diq ESIA for not including a full management plan, she was actually going further than the IFC requires. She stated that \"*I think you're splitting hairs here because, as far as I'm concerned, if you were going for financing at IFC or with an equator lender, you will need to have the management system, the initial Management System and certain action plans that will mitigate--that will demonstrate how you intend to mitigate the critical impacts and the time-dependent impacts.*\"1310\n\n**Exhibit FIL-18**, p. 1.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1979 line 17 to p. 1981 line 17.\n\n1038.\n\nClaimant then pointed to the IFC's guidance notes on the Performance Standards, which provide with regard to the requirement quoted above:\n\n\"*The level of detail and complexity of the social and environment management system and the resources devoted to it will depend on the level of impacts and risks identified in the social and environmental assessment and the size and nature of the client's organization. A satisfactory Management System appropriate to the nature and scale of the project and commensurate with the level of social and environmental risks and impacts is a condition of IFC's investment. If the client does not have a satisfactory Management System at the time of IFC's appraisal of the project, one should be developed and implemented over a reasonable period of time agreed with IFC, and be in effect in time to manage project activities financed by IFC*.\"1311\n\n**Exhibit CE-1292**, p. 2.\n\n1039.\n\nWith regard to the final sentence of the paragraph quoted above, Ms. Filas testified that \"[t]*hey are giving that provision--my experience in working with IFC has not--has been that they would expect to see a management system to some level being a project-specific management system. I believe that this Guidance Note is saying it doesn't have to be complete and final, but it needs to address those elements that are time-dependent*.\"1312 Claimant then pointed to its Quarterly Report on Exploration Activities that ended 30 June 2010, which provided:\n\n\"***Implementation of Environmental Management System (EMS)***\n\n*Reko Diq Environmental management system currently is under development. The preliminary deadline date to have fully operational Environmental Management System is end of December 2010. It is anticipated that during November \u2013 December status of the EMS implementation will be reviewed by the owners and in 2011 EMS will be certified according ISO 14001.*\n\n*The major activities are:* [\u2026]\"1313\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1983 lines 1-18.\n\n**Exhibit CE-165**, p. 25.\n\n1040.\n\nThen asked whether, if she had been reviewing the ESIA for an investor or a regulator, she would have asked when the company expected to have a fully operational ESMS, Ms. Filas testified:\n\n\"*If I'm reviewing a document for whether or not it is lender ready, I can tell by the content of what's in the ESIA today whether it's lender ready. And this one was not.*\n\n*Q. Okay. We went through and showed how the IFC Performance Standards don't actually require a full management plan in the ESIA. I can do the same exercise with you with the Equator Principles and the Pakistani regulations, if you would like.*\n\n*A. You can certainly do that. Guidelines are written the way they're written so that they give flexibility. My experience, on more than--on several projects are that the IFC, in particular, will require a management system to be fleshed out to a certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA.*\n\n*Q. Even though that's not what the IFC Performance Standards or the Guidelines say?*\n\n*A. My Expert Opinion is that the IFC will require that whether they have easygoing words or not. You will have to make a case for why it's not necessary if you are not going to include what is required by Performance Standard 1 and Equator Principle 4 in the documentation that you're putting forward as representing those--addressing those elements*.\"1314\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1986 line 6 to p. 1987 line 8.\n\n1041.\n\nBased on the testimony of the Parties' experts regarding the Environmental and Social Management System, the Tribunal considers it common ground that the IFC Performance Standard One requires the implementation of such a Management System. It further appears to be undisputed that Claimant's ESIA did not contain the management program identified in the IFC Performance Standard but that, as stated in Claimant's June 2010 Quarterly Report, it was aiming to implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) by December 2010. On the other hand, Claimant has not pointed the Tribunal to a document demonstrating that this deadline was met and that a fully operational EMS was completed by the end of 2010 or thereafter.\n\n1042.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether the EMS was or was not completed and, if not, whether this was due to events after the delivery of the Feasibility Study to the GOB, which gave rise to Respondent's breaches of the Treaty. It is also not entirely clear whether the scope of the management system that Claimant planned to implement would be limited to environmental impacts or would also extend to social impacts as required under IFC Performance Standard One. In any event, however, the Tribunal is not convinced that a not yet fully operational ESMS would have caused a lender to consider the ESIA and other documentation of the project so deficient that it would have rejected the ESIA or requested that it be completely redone. As pointed out by Claimant, the guidance notes of the IFC Performance Standards state that the absence of a satisfactory Management System does not mean that funding is necessarily declined but the Management System should then \"*be developed and implemented over a reasonable period of time agreed with IFC, and be in effect in time to manage project activities financed by IFC.*\" Ms. Filas confirmed at the Hearing in Quantum that the guidelines \"*are written they way they're written so that they give flexibility*\" but maintained that her experience was that the IFC \"*will require a management system to be fleshed out to a certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA*.\"1315\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1986 lines 15-20.\n\n1043.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on this point. Even if, as Ms. Filas testified, the IFC and other lenders were to require a certain level of information on the management system to be implemented for the project in the ESIA and even if, contrary to the Quarterly Report of June 2010, Claimant had not completed the implementation by the time it would approach lenders, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have caused the lenders to decline funding to the project. In the Tribunal's view, it is rather reasonable to assume that, as Ms. Cessford expected, interactions would have followed and based on the requirements and issues raised by the lenders, Claimant would have had the chance to finalize its plans for a management system in conformity with the IFC Performance Standards.\n\n1044.\n\nThe question that remains to be answered is whether this would have resulted in additional costs that Claimant did not sufficiently account for in its cost estimate for the project. Ms. Filas testified that the management system would be important in order to determine the actual costs associated with implementing the mitigation measures identified with regard to environmental and social impacts. Ms. Cessford confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that the \"*Budget*\" identified in her illustration of the business cycle under the action item \"*Do*\" in pink color \"*wasn't presented in the ESIA*\" but also stated that \"*there are numbers presented in the Feasibility Study for it*.\" She then clarified:\n\n\"*The ESIA team did not get to the pink area, but you can't--like with any aspect of a project, when you do your Feasibility Study, you put costs in. There were costs presented in the Feasibility Study to handle environmental and social management \u2026both Capex and Opex.*\n\n*They are just not presented in the ESIA. \u2026*\n\n*They are presented in the Feasibility Study. \u2026*\n\n*And the ESIA team did not develop those costs. TCC developed those costs*.\"1316\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1934 line 1 to p. 1935 line 4.\n\n1045.\n\nMs. Filas stated at the Hearing on Quantum that in her opinion the ESIA would need to address the shortcomings she had identified and confirmed that this would likely translate into further outlays from Claimant in terms of capital costs and operating costs. She further confirmed that she had not given an estimate of what those costs might be for the following reason:\n\n\"*I do not give an estimate of what those costs are, but I do know that those costs are, normally, when you prepare an ESIA, the idea behind--because the ESIA is being developed concurrently with the Project Feasibility Study, the action plans for implementing mitigation measures for the key mitigation that needs to be done for the Project would typically be accompanied by an implementation schedule and an implementation budget so that you have the capital and the Operating Costs quantified based on the commitments of the Project. And those would be factored into the Feasibility Study Cost Evaluation.*\n\n*And, to me, the Management System is the piece, the missing piece that would define what would need to be done to implement those commitments that are made in the ESIA, in order to make an adequate estimate of costs*.\"1317\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1995 line 20 to p. 1997 line 19; Filas Presentation, p. 17.\n\n1046.\n\nMs. Filas confirmed that Ms. Cessford was \"*absolutely right if she says the ESIA costs would be factored into the Feasibility Study*.\" She then referred to a discussion with Ms. Cessford on the disposal of sludge, which she considered to be \"*a costly item*\" for which \"*they hadn't even decided what they were going to do with that*.\" Ms. Filas further confirmed that she was not aware whether the additional costs to meet any additional commitments that Claimant might have to make were already included in the valuation model prepared by Prof. Davis for this arbitration.1318\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1997 line 20 to p. 1999 line 4.\n\n1047.\n\nBased on the experts' testimony, the Tribunal considers it undisputed that the costs for handling environmental and social impacts would be included in the Feasibility Study and not in the ESIA itself. The question is rather whether Claimant had sufficiently accounted for these costs. Ms. Filas did not provide an estimate of what she would have considered an adequate budget or which additional costs Claimant should have included in the Feasibility Study. As will be discussed in further detail below, Dr. Connor also did not provide an estimate of the \"*substantial expenditure in cost and time*\" that she described as necessary to maintain a social license to operate in Balochistan.1319\n\n*Cf.* Connor, Section 2.1, \u00b6 9; Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2059-2062.\n\n1048.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Respondent's experts both testified that they focused their review on the ESIA and supporting documents and reviewed only certain parts of the Feasibility Study such as the Chapter on Security. In particular, neither of them engaged with the cost estimates provided in the Chapters on Capital Costs and Operating Costs, including the contingencies, nor with the residual risk register and the quantification of these risks by Claimant and/or by Prof. Davis in his valuation model. Consequently, the Tribunal has no basis to find that Claimant should have included a specific additional amount to manage environmental and social impacts.\n\n1049.\n\nThis does not yet mean, however, that the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant had sufficiently addressed and accounted for the various individual issues raised by Respondent's experts in terms of environmental and social impacts. These will now be assessed.\n\n**ii. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed the Environmental Impacts of the Project**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1050.\n\nAs for environmental impacts, Ms. Filas raised criticisms regarding the assessment of the impact on air quality at the mine area and at the area of Port Gwadar, greenhouse gas emissions, the water treatment process and resulting quality of the effluent to be discharged into the sea, and transboundary impacts of pumping water from the Fan Sediments. Ms. Filas also identified what she described as \"*Other Non-Conformities*\" in her presentation at the Hearing on Quantum with regard to safety and security, traffic, cumulative impacts and the presentation of alternatives for power supply, water supply and concentrate transport in the ESIA.1320 In addition, Ms. Filas raised concerns with regard to toxic mine water forming in the pit at closure of the mine and a requirement in the 2002 BM Rules to fill up excavations after mining.1321\n\nFilas Presentation, p. 14.\n\nFilas Presentation, p. 16; Filas II, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151.\n\n**(a) Impacts of the Project on Air Quality**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1051.\n\nWith regard to air quality, Ms. Filas criticized in particular that, in her opinion, \"*the point of compliance used for assessing air quality impacts were inappropriately located at both the mine and the port*.\" Noting that the ESIA was to be submitted to the regulatory authority, she considered that \"[a]*ir quality compliance is measured at the source*\" and would therefore have expected a table in the ESIA providing information as to the emissions at the mine itself. She also expressed the opinion that for dispersion modeling, \"*the point of compliance is set at the property boundary or closes point of public access*\" because \"*the project proponent does not control what happens outside the fence*.\"1322 For the mine area, Ms. Filas accepted that to set the points of compliance upgradient from the wind in order to analyze the impacts to receiving communities \"*makes sense*\" but maintained that these did not correspond to the closest point of public access, which she instead considered to be the access road to the project. For the port area, Ms. Filas similarly illustrated that the nearest residential location and a hotel were located closer to the port site than the points of compliance. She acknowledged that \"*these two locations, maybe these were built after the ESIA was completed*\" but considered this as a confirmation that \"*it's more prudent to look at the property boundary because you can always have receptors move in with time*,\" in particular with a project life of over 50 years.1323\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1945 line 18 to p. 1946 line 17.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1946 line 21 to p. 1949 line 9.\n\n1052.\n\nWhen presented with the dispersion plume for sulfur dioxide for the Marine Terminal Operation Phase,1324 Ms. Cessford testified that the areas within the dispersion plume \"*would be experiencing an increase in \u2026 annual average sulfur dioxide of two micrograms per normal meter cubed*.\" She explained that in order to determine the impact, the increase would have to be added to the background concentration and the total figure would then be compared to the ambient air quality guideline for sulfur dioxide annual average. Ms. Cessford stated that the concentration within the dispersion plume was \"*well below*\" the guideline and also referred to \"*other ways of assessing the impact, which are explained in more detail in the Air Quality Impact Assessment Report*.\"1325 As for the dispersion plume for nitrogen dioxide presented for the same area,1326 Ms. Cessford acknowledged that if inhaled, this gas \"*can have affects on your respiratory system if it exceeds the ambient air quality limit*.\" She pointed out, however, that even the areas nearest to the port with the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide had a concentration of \"*less than the ambient air quality limit \u2026 for nitrogen dioxide*.\" She added that, therefore, \"*even in those areas, I would not expect to see an impact on health based on comparison with the air ambient quality*.\"1327 With regard to the locations circled in the illustration, Ms. Cessford testified that \"[t]*hey are chosen, one, because it's the nearest location to the port, the port facility, so the nearest place a person could be in terms of ambient air quality as opposed to occupational air quality. The one at the Pearl Continental Hotel is basically downwind. And then, as we talked about, the upwind one is a little bit trickier just because there is water there*.\"1328 Ms. Cessford further explained:\n\n\"[I]*f the authorities request it, it would be, I'm sure, not a problem to create one maybe up on the mainland off the peninsula, to give a background, because what you're trying--the objective is to generate a background concentration. And if the authorities felt that that was not appropriate, it would absolutely not be a problem to add another monitoring location in a place that they felt was more appropriate*.\"1329\n\n**Exhibit FIL-11**, Figure 6.5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1913 line 1 to p. 1914 line 4.\n\n**Exhibit FIL-11**, Figure 6.6.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1914 line 13 to p. 1915 line 8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1917 lines 3-10.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1917 line 21 to p. 1918 line 7.\n\n1053.\n\nMs. Cessford further clarified that what Ms. Filas had described as inappropriate points of compliance were not the points used to reach the conclusions regarding the impacts in the ESIA. She explained that \"[t]*hose are the points that were used to represent to stakeholders in a very simplistic way what the impacts might be on them. The conclusions reached in the ESIA are based on the isopleth plumes and a specialist air quality interpretation of those*.\"1330\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1918 lines 8-15.\n\n1054.\n\nBased on the experts' testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced by the concern raised by Ms. Filas, *i.e*, that the impacts on air quality at the mine area and at the port area were inappropriately assessed. In particular, Ms. Cessford pointed out that even the areas with the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide close to the port site at Port Gwadar would be within the relevant limits provided for ambient air quality. Ms. Filas stated in her second report that she \"*could not evaluate whether ambient standards would be met at the property boundary*\" because \"*the ESIA does not provide isocontours for SOx and NOx concentration levels at the port*\" but considered it \"*likely that ambient standards would not be met*\" due to \"*the use of high sulfur fuel, multiple large generators, and the relatively small size of the property*.\"1331 Ms. Filas therefore did not show that if the impacts had been assessed at the property boundary, ambient standards would not have been met; she merely presumed that this would be the case based on rather general assumptions. She also did not engage with the information that the dispersion plumes also provided on the areas closest to the port site, as Ms. Cessford pointed out at the Hearing on Quantum.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 139.\n\n1055.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that if the points of compliance had been set differently, the ambient standards for air quality would not have been met. In addition, even if the authorities had requested that the impact be presented for a different location such as the property boundary, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have caused significant additional costs or delay.\n\n1056.\n\nMs. Filas further continued to criticize that the ESIA did not present the emissions at source. Already in her first report, Ms. Filas stated that \"[t]*he ESIA should have assessed whether these occupational standards and guidelines could be met on site given the very high SO\u2082 and NO\u2082 emission levels*.\"1332 In response, Ms. Cessford emphasized that \"*the IFC PS do not require compliance with occupational health standards to be expressly discussed in the ESIA. Instead, they mandate the identification and management of occupational health exposures*.\" She further stated:\n\n[T]*he Filas Report has drawn conclusions based on a comparison of health exposures against the EDC ambient limits which is not comparing the values against the proper occupational standards. This misrepresents the information provided in the ESIA report which is not appropriate for occupational health assessment. The ESIA acknowledged the project's commitment to separately develop health and safety management plans, to continuously and systematically identify, assess and respond to health and safety risk throughout the project's life cycle. The environmental and social management programme included as part of the ESIA also reaffirmed this commitment. In my experience, addressing occupational issues in this manner would satisfy regulators or potential investors, or could be supplemented by the mechanisms available to them if they were not*.\"1333\n\nFilas I, p. 14,\n\nCessford, \u00b6 130.\n\n1057.\n\nIn her second report, Ms. Filas responded to this statement:\n\n\"*While Filas Engineering accepts that it is not necessary to develop comprehensive health and safety plans prior to submittal of an ESIA, a preliminary plan is usually included as part of the management system. Since the ESIA did not include even a preliminary management system, as is required for conformance with Pakistan, Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards, employee health impacts were never addressed.*\n\n*The commitment referenced in the ESIA to develop a health and safety management plan consists of approximately one page of general statements that could apply to any project. There is no discussion of site-specific concerns and potential safety measures that would be considered in addressing these concerns. While it is customary to have a conceptual or preliminary health and safety management plan completed at this stage in the process, it is also common to provide more project-specific health and safety information in the ESIA, especially if elevated levels of air pollutants are expected, which they are, on site. This would establish some level of confidence that the project proponent can meet applicable occupational regulations and guidelines*.\"1334\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 167-168.\n\n1058.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in addition to the disagreement regarding the preliminary management system which has already been addressed above, Ms. Filas maintained her opinion that \"*more project-specific health and safety information*\" should have been provided in the ESIA. She did not, however, point to a specific requirement to this effect in the IFC Performance Standards and therefore did not specifically address Ms. Cessford's comment that compliance with occupational health standards does not have to be addressed in the ESIA. Ms. Filas also did not provide any support for her opinion that a comparison of stack discharges with emission limits at the source \"*is normally required by governments and lenders*.\"1335 In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas herself stated in her second report:\n\n\"*Although dispersion modeling is commonly used for evaluating compliance with ambient standards and guidelines, the rules and guidelines for maximum concentrations of pollutant apply to stack emissions. The air emission EDC for power generation facilities states correctly that the Pakistan NEQS does not have a stack emission standard for oil-fired power plants and instead relies on an ambient standard*.\"1336\n\nFilas Presentation, p. 5.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 174.\n\n1059.\n\nMs. Filas then referred to the Pakistan guidelines for major thermal power stations as well as as the IFC guideline stack emission standards and, based on the annual level of NOx emissions presented in the ESIA, considered it \"*likely that the exceedance of the guideline is significant*.\"1337 The Environmental Design Criteria and Guidance Report to which Ms. Filas referred in this regard states:\n\n\"*The HFO plant proposed is a reciprocating engine with a total rated heated heat input capacity of 400 MW on a higher heating value basis and therefore a number of the Pakistan standards are not applicable. In particular, the particulate matter limits in the Pakistan guidelines for power plants and the NEQS do not apply to engines and nitrogen oxides are controlled with ambient standards only. The only Pakistan standard applicable to engines is for sulfur dioxide. The IFC EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants has limits for reciprocating engines with total rated heat input capacity above 300 MW, which are based on one hour average basis and should be achieved 95% of annual operating hours. The relevant standards and derived project design criteria are presented in Table 3.2*.\"1338\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 175-176.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix D, pp. 14-15.\n\n1060.\n\nFor nitrogen oxides, table 3.2 then refers to the IFC EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants and provides the following note: \"*The project is in an area of scarce water resources (see note above) and therefore this Project emission limit only applies if the Project's ambient air quality criterion for nitrogen oxides (see Table 12.1) cannot otherwise be achieved, as determined by air dispersion modeling*.\"1339\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix D, p. 15.\n\n1061.\n\nMs. Filas agreed that there is no stack emission standard in the Pakistan NEQS which instead rely on an ambient standard. She further did not provide the Tribunal with any substantiated basis for calling into question the consideration presented in the ESIA that the IFC emission guideline would become relevant only if the project could not otherwise achieve compliance with the ambient air quality standard through dispersion modeling, which has already been discussed in detail above.\n\n1062.\n\nIn the same context, Ms. Filas further criticized that the ESIA did not perform an analysis regarding the amount of water required for NOx emission controls or the effectiveness of water injection in reducing NOx emission levels.1340 Ms. Cessford responded that in her opinion this was not necessary because \"[t]*he dispersion modeling conducted as part of the Air Quality Impact Assessment for the Reko Diq Mine Site concluded that the predicted emissions from the power plant would enable compliance with the Project's ambient air quality target. Therefore, it did not provide emission controls for nitrogen oxides. This is consistent with the EHS guidelines, which explicitly waive the requirement to control nitrous oxides under these circumstances. The Filas Report also does not challenge any aspect of the modeling process, including the underlying choice of model, the ESIA's approach to modeling or the scenarios adopted, or the inputs. Accordingly, the Filas Report has provided no basis for its arguments*.\"1341 In response, Ms. Filas noted that the NOx emissions at the mine's power plant did not comply with the IFC guidelines at the source and maintained her opinion that the ESIA should \"*at least evaluate emission controls and justify why water to reduce emission levels cannot be made available*.\" She also criticized that nitrogen oxide controls were dismissed as unnecessary \"*without presenting an assessment of the human health risk posed by worker exposure*.\"1342\n\nFilas I, p. 13.\n\nCessford, \u00b6 131.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 169-173.\n\n1063.\n\nAs pointed out by Ms. Filas, the ESIA provides in this regard:\n\n\"*The sulfur content of HFO currently available in Pakistan is 3.5%, which prevents effective use of electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to control particulates or selective catalytic reactors (SCR) to control oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The maximum sulfur content that would allow use of ESP and SCR under the expected operating conditions would be 2%.*\n\n*Whereas particulates are effectively controlled by the included fabric filters, no suitable alternative is available for NOx control. Water injection into the engines would achieve some reduction in NOx emissions, but in a water-scarce environment the achievable reduction in NOx emissions is outweighed by the increased consumption of water. The mine site is in a non-deteriorated airshed. Dispersion modelling (Chapter 7) demonstrates compliance with the Project's ambient air quality target for NOx. Therefore, no NOx emission controls are provided. This is consistent with IFC guidelines, which waive the requirement to control NOx emissions under these circumstances*.\"1343\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 4-22.\n\n1064.\n\nMs. Filas did not dispute the statement that NOx emission controls were not required by the IFC guidelines in the circumstances presented in the ESIA. She also did not provide an argument as to why a lender or regulatory authority would have considered NOx emission controls necessary despite the absence of a NOx emission standard in the Pakistan NEQS and the described waiver in the IFC guidelines. On balance, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the assessments made by Claimant and its consultants with regard to the impact on air quality were not in conformity with the relevant standards.\n\n1065.\n\nMs. Filas further testified that \"[t]*he ESIA also fails to address greenhouse gas emissions*\" and that despite recognizing that \"*the mine site will be a major emitter*,\" it \"*present*[ed] *no options to reduce or offset the impacts of greenhouse gas*.\" In her opinion, the rationalization of these emissions by noting that they would amount to less than 1% of Pakistan's greenhouse emissions was \"*flawed*\" and \"*lenders would definitely take exception to that logic.*\"1344 With regard to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Ms. Cessford provided the following explanation in her expert report:\n\n\"*Although not included in the GHG section, the ESIA report did include information about the project's consideration of a number of options with the potential to reduce GHG for activities considered as significant emission contributors: fuel, power and concentrate transportation. This was presented in other sections of the ESIA report. For example, the ESIA indicated that the HFO engines are convertible to dual fuel so that if natural gas became available, modifications could be made to use natural gas. The ESIA also evaluated different power supply options, including renewable energy sources and acknowledged the use of wind as a supplemental energy source as a matter for further investigation. The options considered, however, were not technically and financially feasible and cost-effective. Also, the selection of a concentrate slurry pipeline as the preferred option was based on a number of reasons, including the fact that this resulted in lower GHG emissions than transporting concentrate by trucks*.\"1345\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1950 line 14 to p. 1951 line 9.\n\nCessford, \u00b6 110.\n\n1066.\n\nIn response, Ms. Filas merely noted the acknowledgment *\"that the GHG section of the ESIA did not include the options considered for GHG mitigation*\" and maintained that *\"the EDC obliged additional consideration in the feasibility study which was not done in the SNC Lavalin report nor in the ESIA.\"1346* Ms. Filas did not, however, engage with the references made by Ms. Cessford to the other sections of the ESIA in which certain options were discussed but considered not feasible and cost-effective. Against this background, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to discuss this criticism in further detail as it has not been sufficiently substantiated.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 110.\n\n**(b) Impact of Discharging Effluent on Sea Water Quality**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1067.\n\nMs. Filas further criticized that the water treatment process and resulting quality of the effluent to be discharged into the sea was calculated and that she \"*saw no evidence that testing was done to demonstrate the quality of water that would be coming from this system.\"* In her opinion, such testing would have been necessary to determine the efficacy and to predict the cost for water treatment which are *\"usually not trivial\"* and *\"need to be factored into the Feasibility Study\"1347* Ms. Filas then relied on a table in which she had summarized the water quality data for the proposed Reko Diq project's effluent discharge, and highlighted in blue what she considered to be failures to comply with the relevant standards. She further presented the ratio by which the concentration of the effluent exceeded the background concentration highlighted in yellow:1348\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1951 lines 10-21.\n\nFilas Presentation, p. 11.\n\n1068.\n\nIn Ms. Filas' opinion, \"*the yellow portion is compelling because what that is, is it takes the treated effluent, and it divides each parameter by the background water quality*.\" She acknowledged that \"*you can meet the ambient limits after dilution in this from the modeling*\" but noted that the model \"*didn't take it over a 56-year time frame*\" and did not look at the degradation of the water quality even though \"*70 percent of the people, according to this ESIA, say that--they draw their income from the fishing industry out of the Arabian Sea*.\" Ms. Filas considered that \"*even though the evaluation of the discharge can meet the particular toxicity requirements of the ambient background conditions, when you're putting out copper concentrations and zinc concentrations that are literally 10,000 times the concentration of the receiving seawater, that's a significant degradation of the water, and that is something that--those are parameters that are known to be toxic to aquatic life, and so it's something that I think would be very, very difficult to get past the local community in Gwadar*.\" She emphasized that while the ESIA \"*only attempted to look at the \u2026 variances for boron*,\" \"[t]*he issue really is, the composition of the water is extremely different than the composition of the receiving water, and that's what you see highlighted in yellow, and that's where I think that the issue would see itself.*\"1349\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1952 line 11 to p. 1954 line 8.\n\n1069.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ms. Cessford clarified in her report that the Upper Limits of Treated Effluent, which are presented in the left column of the table prepared by Ms. Filas, had to be compared to the EDC effluent limit presented in the Reko Diq Concentrate Characterisation and Ocean Discharge Study prepared by Lorax Environmental in July 2010 (rather than the EDC Ambient Seawater Limits to which Ms. Filas had compared them in her first report). Ms Cessford stated that \"*compar*[ing] *like for like \u2026 the Filas Report should have concluded that all the values are equal to or below the EDC effluent limit*.\"1350 Specifically, Ms. Cessford referred to the following table in the study prepared by Lorax Environmental:1351\n\n**Table 2-8:**\n\n**Composition of Treated EffIuent Compared to its Environmental Design Criteria**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Parameter** | **Units** | **Treated effluent** | **EDC 1** |\n| **METALS** |  |  |  |\n| **Aluminum** | **mgL** | **1.74** | **NP2** |\n| **Antimony** | **mgL** | **0,001** | **NP** |\n| **Arsenic** | **mgL** | **0.0042** | **1.0** |\n| **Barium** | **mgL** | **0,039** | **1.5** |\n| **Beryllium** | **mgL** | **<0,001** | **NP** |\n| **Bismuth** | **mgL** | **<0,001** | **NP** |\n| **Boron** | **mg/L** | **2.5** | **6.0** |\n| **Cadmium** | **mg/L** | **0.0066** | **0.1** |\n| **Calcium** | **mgL** | **940** | **NP** |\n| **Chromium** | **mg/L** | **0,064** | **1** |\n| **Cobalt** | **mg/L** | **0,024** | **NP** |\n| **Copper** | **mgL** | **1.0** | **1.0** |\n| **Iron** | **mgL** | **8.0** | **8.0** |\n| **Lead** | **mgL** | **0,234** | **0.5** |\n| **Magnesium** | **mgL** | **155** | **NP** |\n| **Manganese** | **mgL** | **1.5** | **1.5** |\n| **Mercury** | **mgL** | **<0.0005** | **0.01** |\n| **Nickel** | **mg/L** | **0.75** | **1** |\n| **Potassium** | **mgL** | **68** | **NP** |\n| **Selenium** | **mgL** | **0.02** | **0.5** |\n| **Silver** | **mgL** | **0.00007** | **1** |\n| **Sodium** | **mgL** | **2195** | **NP** |\n| **Strontium** | **mgL** | **21.4** | **NP** |\n| **Tin** | **mgL** | **<0,001** | **NP** |\n| **Titanium** | **mgL** | **<0.01** | **NP** |\n| **Uranium** | **mgL** | **0.0024** | **NP** |\n| **Vanadium** | **mgL** | **<0.01** | **NP** |\n| **Zinc** | **mgL** | **1.0** | **5** |\n| **Total toxic metals 3** | **mgL** | **4.6** | **Background 4** |\n| **PHYSICAL** |  |  |  |\n| **PH** | **PU** | **8.5** | **6-9** |\n| **Total Dissolved Solids** | **mgL** | **10190** | **Background 4** |\n| **ANIONS/NUTRIENTS** |  |  |  |\n| **Ammonia** | **mgL** | **0.67** | **40** |\n| **Nitrate** | **mgL** | **5.4** | **NP** |\n| **Fluoride** | **mgL** | **2.5** | **10** |\n| **Sulphate** | **mgL** | **2760** | **Background 4** |\n\n1.

Baseline value of TDS is 36,000 mg/L, of sulphate is 2760 mg/L, and of TTM is 6.0 mg/L..\n\nCessford, \u00b6 114.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1351**, Table 2-8.\n\n1070.\n\nMs. Filas acknowledged in her second report that she had \"*initially misinterpreted the information presented in the Lorax Report, as two different compliance criterion were presented in the report with limited explanation*.\" However, she maintained her opinion that \"*the proposed discharge of partially treated waste water exceeds Pakistan's NEQS for Municipal and Liquid Effluents into the Sea*.\"1352 Ms. Filas agreed with Ms. Cessford that \"*the Pakistan NEQS only requires* 'end-of-pipe' *compliance for discharge to the sea*\" but emphasized that \"*the proposed discharge does not meet the NEQS discharge standard for total dissolved solids (TDS) and total toxic metals (TTM)*.\" She further disagreed with Ms. Cessford's opinion that adequate justification was presented in the ESIA for relaxing the standards for TDS and TTM and that this was in accordance with good international practice. Ms. Filas considered that it would have been \"*normal practice to conduct benchscale tests of the treatment process to determine the level of treatment necessary to meet water quality standards*.\" Ms. Filas also maintained that \"*some of these metals are present in the effluent at thousands times greater than the ocean background levels*\" and that, therefore, \"*it would be unlikely that the Pakistan EPA would relax the TTM standard in such an important fishery*.\"1353\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 116-123.\n\n1071.\n\nMs. Cessford explained at the Hearing on Quantum with regard to the ESIA's proposal for \"*a variance to the TTM (boron constituent only) and TDS limits*\"1354 that \"*the limit set in the NEQS, which is the Pakistan limits, is significantly below the actual seawater level, the actual concentration in the seawater. So, by--if the effluent was required to meet the lower limit, you would be discharging--you would basically be putting in at much lower than the existing seawater is*.\" Ms. Cessford further testified that \"*Canadian guidelines indicate that the TDS discharge should not be more than 10 percent of the actual receiving watercourse to protect aquatic life. So, if they were obligated to discharge TDS at that concentration, it could actually be causing a harm to the aquatic life.*\"1355 With regard to boron, Ms. Cessford testified:\n\n\"*In the case of boron, it's a less significant difference. So we're talking about--I think it was--the seawater was 6, and the limit needed to be less than 2 in order to comply with the total toxic metals. But there was a conflict in the guidelines, because the guidelines also give a limit of a boron of 6. But if you discharge at 6, boron, you cannot comply with the total toxic metals of 2. So there's a conflict in the legislation.*\n\n*Obviously, I'm not party to how those guidelines were written, but my initial reaction is regulators make mistakes. I was a regulator for eight years. We make mistakes. And I suspect that these were carried over from the freshwater limit into the marine and are mistakes. And, in my experience, regulators are very reasonable when presented with this kind of information*.\"1356\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 7-91.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1919 line 22 to p. 1920 line 18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1920 line 19 to p. 1921 line 13.\n\n1072.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ms. Cessford's explanation is in line with the argumentation presented in the ESIA. It was specifically noted:\n\n\"*Pakistan's NEQS for effluent discharged to sea contains a limit for boron of 6 mg/L and a limit for total toxic metals (TTM) of 2 mg/L. The TTM parameter incorporates boron along with 10 other metals, thus by implication lowering the maximum possible value for boron to 2 mg/L. This lower boron value is below the average background seawater concentration for boron of 6 mg/L, as measured during the baseline studies. Additionally, the NEQS limit for total dissolved solids (TDS) of 3,500 mg/L is also lower than the background TDS of seawater in the discharge area (36,000 mg/L).*\n\n*For the boron constituent in the TTM parameter and TDS, the Project proposes to treat the concentrate filtrate to concentrations no higher than seawater background levels, not to the lower levels implied in the NEQS. Discharging effluent with lower values of these parameters than seawater background would not benefit the marine ecosystem and would require more elaborate treatment involving the generation of additional sludge requiring disposal, with associated negative terrestrial environmental consequences. Therefore the project is proposing a variance to the TTM (boron constituent only) and TDS limits as there is no environmental benefit to be gained with treatment to these discharge limitations*.\"1357\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 7-91.\n\n1073.\n\nIn the Environmental Design Criteria and Guidance Report, it is similarly noted that \"[f]*or boron and TDS the Project proposes to treat the concentrate filtrate to seawater background levels, not to the lower levels implied in the NEQS. Discharging effluent with lower values of these parameters than seawater background would not benefit the marine ecosystem and would require more elaborate treatment involving the generation of additional sludge requiring disposal, with associated negative terrestrial environmental consequences*.\"1358\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix D, p. 20.\n\n1074.\n\nMs. Filas maintained in her second report that the request to increase the TDS standard to 36,000 mg/L was \"*without merit*.\" She did not dispute that this corresponded to the background levels of TDS in the ocean but considered that it \"*ignor*[ed] *that the chemical composition of the proposed effluent is quite different than sea water.*\" In her opinion, \"[t]*he effluent contains elevated levels of metal and would be expected to have a different ionic makeup given the chemical characteristics of the pipeline concentrate*.\" She pointed to the overall annual discharge of waste material into the sea and considered that \"[g]*iven that the baseline report for the port area found that the sea water and sediment were of good quality, it is unlikely that the Pakistan EPA and the local fisherman would agree to this requested variance*.\"1359 As for boron, Ms. Filas did not dispute the contradiction between the the NEQS effluent standard for boron of 6 mg/L and the NEQS effluent standard for total toxic metals of 2 mg/L. She maintained, however, that even excluding boron, the TTM exceeded the effluent standard (2.12 compared to 2.0).1360\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 122 and Table 1.\n\n1075.\n\nAs for the variance of the TDF effluent standard, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas did not provide any support for her opinion that the ESIA's proposal to treat the concentrate to seawater level would not be accepted due to the \"*quite different*\" chemical composition of the effluent. The Tribunal understands based on Ms. Cessford's reference to the Canadian guidelines that it would in fact cause harm to aquatic life if the TDS discharge varied more than 10% from the receiving watercourse, which would be the case if the water were treated to the NEQS effluent standard. Against this background, the Tribunal cannot follow Ms. Filas' opinion that a variance would likely have been denied by the Balochistan EPA.\n\n1076.\n\nAs for the total toxic metals, the Tribunal considers it common ground between the experts that the NEQS effluent standard for boron, *i.e*., for one of the 11 metals included in the TTM, was higher than the TTM effluent standard and that it was therefore reasonable to request a variance for the boron constituent as proposed in the ESIA. Finally, as for the TTM effluent (excluding boron), Ms. Filas calculated that the value still exceeded the NEQS standard. However, in the absence of any further support for Ms. Filas' argument that the ESIA incorrectly calculated the TTM effluent, the Tribunal has no basis to assume that the ESIA contained an error which would have been a significant issue for the Balochistan EPA.\n\n1077.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in her table presented at the Hearing on Quantum, Ms. Filas also highlighted certain additional values, which in her opinion failed to comply with the NEQS and IFC limits, specifically for copper, iron, lead and nickel. Ms. Cessford testified, however, that the IFC Liquid Effluent Limits to which Ms. Filas had compared the Upper Limits of Treated Effluent were \"*very outdated*\" as they \"*date way back to the previous set of guidelines which were superseded*\" and stated that they had instead used the numbers in the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines dated 2007.1361 The Tribunal notes that the document referenced by Ms. Filas for this column indeed dates from July 1998.1362 Ms. Cessford's testimony is therefore plausible to the Tribunal. Also taking into account that the values for copper, iron, lead and nickel are all equal to or below the values presented in the Reko Diq Concentration Characterisation and Ocean Discharge Study,1363 the Tribunal cannot follow Ms. Filas' opinion that the planned discharges exceeded the relevant effluent limits.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1923 line 14 to p. 1924 line 3.\n\n**Exhibit FIL-12**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1351**, Table 2-8.\n\n1078.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal recalls that what Ms. Filas described as \"*the real issue*\" concerned her illustration in yellow of the Effluent-to-Background Ratio, *i.e*., the ratio between the concentration of a certain element in the effluent that Claimant planned to discharge into the sea and the background concentration in the ocean water. Ms. Cessford acknowledged that \"*there are some quite significant increases, yes*.\"1364 When asked whether she would anticipate that this would have an effect on how fishermen would view the impact of the project, she testified:\n\n\"*The way you have to look at this is that the discharge obviously looks at emission limits at the point of release, which we talked about the motivation for adjustment of those. It then looks at the compliance with ambient seawater quality guidelines, and that's where all the modeling comes in.*\n\n*Now, that modeling shows that those ambient water quality limits can be met within different distances, depending on the scenarios used. So, there is a range of scenarios used to look at sort of your normal case and then a worst case.*\n\n*So, what's important here is compliance with the ambient seawater quality limits because those are set specifically to protect marine life, not the difference between baseline and the ambient limit.*\n\n*So, just because you have a background that's much lower than the ambient limit doesn't mean that there's going to be an impact, because the ambient limit is set to protect marine life.*\n\n*And then in addition to that, the ESIA, the marine specialists, undertook ecotoxicology. So, they specifically looked at the effect on, I think, three organisms to evaluate the ecotoxicology of the effluent.*\n\n*And then that--also you see how far--what sort of distance--we call it a mixing zone--what sort of distance from the discharge point that reaches. That showed an even smaller mixing zone than compliance with the ambient limits, which just shows that the ambient limits are conservative in nature in terms of protecting marine life.*\n\n*And under normal circumstances, we were looking at--I can't remember the numbers--but I think 1 meter and 3 meter for ecotoxicology and ambient chemistry. And then I think it was 10 and 13 for the worst case scenario.*\n\n*So, we're talking about an impact that stretches 13 meters from a discharge point*.\"1365\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1925 lines 15-18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1926 line 3 to p. 1927 line 19.\n\n1079.\n\nAs for the impact that the ratio presented by Ms. Filas would have on the perception by the local community regarding the discharge, Ms. Cessford considered that \"*it depends on how it was presented. If an anti-mining NGO got ahold of it and presented it in a similar way to what we're talking about now, yes, it could give negative. But if it was presented with the scientific information on the ecotoxicology and the ambient air, seawater quality monitoring and the actual expected impact and the proposed monitoring, and it was presented in a constructive way, you'd get a different reaction*.\"1366\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1928 lines 2-10.\n\n1080.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Ms. Cessford's testimony convincing. While particularly the ratios presented by Ms. Filas for copper (10,000), iron (4,000), lead (7,800), zinc (10,050) and ammonia (8,375) have been acknowledged by Ms. Cessford as \"*quite significant*,\" it appears to be undisputed that this ratio is not directly relevant to assessing whether the discharge was in compliance with the relevant effluent standards and the ambient seaweater limits which Claimant had also set out in its EDC. As discussed above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the discharge failed to comply with any of the relevant limits. Rather, both Respondent's line of questioning and Ms. Filas' testimony indicate that the Effluent-to-Background ratio could have influenced the perception of the discharge by the community and in particular the fishermen. In this regard, the Tribunal also agrees with Ms. Cessford that this perception would naturally depend on the way in which the information was presented to the community. While it may be reasonable to assume that there would be opposition from the fishermen to the discharge because they feared an impact on their income, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that a regulatory authority acting in good faith would have refused to grant a permit for the discharge in compliance with the applicable standards. This does not mean that the perception of the project by the community was irrelevant but, in the Tribunal's view, a perceived impact is better characterized as a social impact and should be discussed in the context of whether Claimant had adequate plans to ensure that it would obtain and maintain a social license to operate. This will be addressed further below.\n\n**(c) Disposal of Sludge Generated by Water Treatment**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1081.\n\nAn additional concern raised by Ms. Filas with regard to the water treatment process was the disposal of the sludge generated by the treatment of the water before discharging it into the sea. In the context of whether the costs of the ESIA were factored into the Feasibility Study, she noted that \"[i]*f you have to transport sludge back to the mine, that could be quite a costly activity, and they hadn't even decided what they were going to do with that*.\"1367 Ms. Filas was referring to the earlier testimony of Ms. Cessford in response to the question whether she agreed that the ESIA did not arrive at a conclusion regarding the disposal of the wastewater treatment sludge:\n\n\"*At the time we were finalizing the ESIA, I think that work was still progressing for the project, and in line with the precautionary principle, which is one of the fundamental principles of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, we evaluated--I'm going to use the word* 'worst case,' *so anything that the company did that improved the situation would be better. So we've evaluated the most--the worst potential in terms of impacts, and the information is what's presented in the impact assessment*.\"1368\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1998 lines 3-8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1922 lines 3-12.\n\n1082.\n\nShe clarified that \"[a] *number of options were presented*\" in the ESIA for where to dispose of the wastewater treatment sludge and testified that \"*I believe one was at the mine site, and the other would be at a site that would have to be authorized by the authorities*.\" She added that \"*there's not a specific* 'this is what it's going to be.' *It presented some alternatives and it indicated that we would assess the worst of those situations*.\"1369\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p.1922 line 18 to p. 1923 line 4.\n\n1083.\n\nThe issue was not addressed in the first round of the experts' reports. In her second report, Ms. Filas expressed the opinion that the \"*assessment of impacts associated with wastewater treatment and the sludge that will be generated at the Port of Gwadar was substantially disregarded*.\"1370 She noted that the ESIA provided the following information:\n\n\"*Excess overflow water from the dewatering process is treated before being discharged to the sea. Treatment will consist of lime pre-treatment followed by reverse osmosis. The effluent treatment process will generate a sludge, which will be disposed of in a lined facility at the mine site or other suitable authorized location*.\"1371\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 22.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 4-43.\n\n1084.\n\nMs. Filas further noted that site layout drawings of the ESIA showed two water treatment plant sludge ponds but considered that \"*they appear to be for temporary storage given that they are much too small to store an appreciable amount of the sludge that would be produced by this large of* [sic] *a dewatering operation*.\" She therefore complained that \"[t]*here was no discussion of permanent repositories for water treatment sludge in the Conceptual Closure Plan at either the mine or port facility*\" and that, apparently, no tests were carried out \"*to determine the amount of sludge that would be produced and what its chemical characteristics might be*.\" In her opinion, \"[t]*he lack of this information and the lack of a disposal facility design and associated costing represents a large gap in the ESIA and associated documents*.\"1372 Ms. Filas further stated that in order to grant a discharge permit, the regulatory authority would need to review \"*the solid waste characteristics of the sludge produced during the treatment process and the proposed disposal facility*,\" and considered that the above quoted description in the ESIA fell \"*far short of what would be required for a regulatory agency to evaluate the toxicity of the material and the type of lined facility that would be needed to safely dispose of the material*.\"1373\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 22.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 126.\n\n1085.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Livesey was referred to the description in the ESIA and responded to the question whether he knew where Claimant decided to actually put the sludge, that \"*at the port, there was a design containment facility to collect that--in the port design. It's not on this image. This just shows the ship loader. But if you show the picture of the wider port design, you can see, quite clearly marked, there's a sludge containment pond next to the dewatering area*.\"1374 When asked whether Claimant also contemplated disposing sludge at the mine site, Mr. Livesey responded that they \"*contemplated tailings at the mine site*\" but that \"*this reference here, if this is referring to the operations at the port, clearly it wouldn't be driven back up to the mine site. This would be in an authorized facility in the Port Gwadar area*.\" He confimed that he was not aware where that facility would have been \"*because Port Gwadar was and is still undergoing expansion. The 30-year design is available and, I believe, was reviewed by Tethyan's team, as we did with Port Qasim and Port Karachi as well*.\"1375 Mr. Livesey further testified:\n\n\"*But there was a facility designed, I think, on the--to the east in the bay--in the bay to the east of the promontory--if there was a map, I could point it out--was the area which the Government itself had designated as part of the port expansion as a materials-handling area. I can't remember the exact phrase they used, but it basically referred to bulk materials.*\n\n*And that would have been an area that probably would have had this type of facility developing in it.*\n\n*Q. You stated that* 'would have been an area that probably would have had this type of facility.' *So, you don't know. You're speculating as to what it would be; right?*\n\n*A. I'm speculating based on the interactions we had at Port Qasim and Port Karachi, where the port designs contemplated disposal of materials--areas for disposal of materials. And the fact that the team met with Port Gwadar officials and again looked at the Project design for Port Gwadar*.\"1376\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 355 lines 8-16.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 355 line 21 to p. 356 line 5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 356 line 8 to p. 357 line 11.\n\n1086.\n\nFinally, in response to the question whether the potential cost for the disposal facility was included in the Feasibility Study, Mr. Livesey stated:\n\n\"*I'm sure there would be a cost captured in there somewhere. I don't know where it is.*\n\n*Q. Would it surprise you if it was not?*\n\n*A. It would surprise me if it was not if it was a significant cost. We don't know how much sludge would be generated. We don't know whether it would be a significant cost. The likelihood is it wouldn't.*\n\n*The sludge at the dewatering facility is a wash-down material. The material that is coming down the pipe is concentrate, which you want to dry and ship, and the resultant waters that you are bringing out would be put down and disposed of separately.*\n\n*So, the sludge would be a minor component by the time you're at the port facility.*\n\n*Q. So, you don't know how much sludge would have been generated, but you are able to reach a conclusion as to whether the cost would have been significant?*\n\n*A. No. I can say that if the cost had been significant, I would be surprised if it had been omitted, which, I think, was the thrust of your question. I did not say that the cost would be significant. I said I suspected that it would not because the volumes would be small, in my opinion. But it was not my area to design. I was the Project Director. I was not specifically on any one target area*.\"1377\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 357 line 20 to p. 359 line 4.\n\n1087.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Livesey's testimony that a sludge disposal facility was designed and contemplated to be in an area designated by the Government for bulk material appears plausible. The Tribunal also finds it reasonable that it was not yet clear where exactly that facility would be due to the fact that Port Gwadar was in the process of being expanded. Given Mr. Livesey's explanation that their assumption for the contemplated location was based on interactions of his team with officials at Port Gwadar and the port design for contemplated disposal of materials, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent's characterization that Mr. Livesey was \"*mere speculating*.\"1378\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 239.\n\n1088.\n\nThe remaining question is therefore whether the costs associated with the sludge disposal facility were included in the Feasibility Study. As pointed out by Respondent, Mr. Livesey did not confirm that this was the case nor did he confirm that they were not a significant cost. He explained, however, why it was likely that it was not a significant cost and reiterated that \"*any sludge generated \u2026 would most likely be from wash-downs and flushing out of equipment, which would, you know, not be\u2014we're not talking about half of the contents of the concentrate pipeline going into a sludge tank*.\"1379 The Tribunal also notes that, while Ms. Filas referred to the sludge disposal as a potentially \"*costly item*,\" she clarified that this \"*could*\" be the case \"[i]*f you have to transport sludge back to the mine.*\"1380 It is therefore apparent that she was transferring to the cost of transporting the sludge rather than the cost of disposing it in a designated facility. Mr. Livesey clarified, however, that the sludge generated at the port would not be transported back to the mine site but rather disposed in the Port Gwadar area and that, therefore, no such costly transport would occur. Ms. Filas did not provide any opinion whether the cost associated with disposing the sludge would be significant and the Tribunal therefore has no basis to doubt Mr. Livesey's explanation as to why they would likely not be significant.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 359 lines 17-22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1998 lines 3-8.\n\n1089.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal recalls that the ESIA explicitly noted that by requesting a variance for two metals contained in the effluent to be discharged into the sea, additional water treatment and the creation of additional sludge were avoided. In the Tribunal's view, this further confirms the reasonableness of Claimants plan to request a variance and Mr. Livesey's testimony that the volume of sludge generated would not be such as to cause significant additional cost. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a conclusive finding as to whether the costs for the disposal facility were included in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study because, in any event, it is not convinced that this would amount to a significant additional cost.\n\n**(d) Further \"Non-Conformities\" Regarding Environmental Impacts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1090.\n\nAs a final criticism on water, Ms. Filas also criticized that the ESIA characterized the drawdown of the aquifer at the Fan Sediments and transboundary effects to be of \"*low significance*.\" The water supply, including the transboundary effects into Afghanistan, have already been addressed in detail above. At this point, it suffices to add to the Tribunal's previous findings that the Tribunal is not convinced by Ms. Filas' comment that \"[e]*ven though there were no beneficial users of the water identified, water competition will be significant if you've got water available*.\"1381 As discussed in detail above, Claimant pointed out that the water at the Fan Sediments was not potable and not suitable for irrigation and agricultural use. Also taking into account Ms. Filas' agreement that \"*there is no fixed procedure for assessing the significance of impacts*,\"1382 the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that it was inadequate in the circumstances to assign a low significance to this aspect.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1954 lines 9-20.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 9.\n\n1091.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Filas' criticism on the absence of \"*an appropriate security and conflict action plan*,\" the Tribunal refers to its detailed analysis of the security-related issues above and further recalls that these were addressed in the Feasibility Study, in particular Chapter 19 on Security, which Ms. Filas also reviewed and considered to be \"*more like what* [she] *was expecting to see*.\"1383 In the absence of any detailed engagement by Ms. Filas with those parts of the Feasibility Study that addressed security and conflict in the area, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address Ms. Filas' criticism on the absence of appropriate information in the ESIA in more detail.\n\n*Cf*. Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1969 line 14 to p. 1970 line 8.\n\n1092.\n\nAn additional criticism of Ms. Filas concerned the characterization of traffic impacts as \"*negligible*\" despite the lack of information on road size, conditions and current levels of congestion. Ms. Cessford pointed out that \"*the lack of information on road geometry and future improvement plans is a result of HBP's inability to obtain this from the National Highway Authority of Pakistan*.\" She added that \"[t]*he study used available information and presented results showing the incremental increase was not considered significant in light of the overall increase in traffic expected as a result of Pakistan's ongoing development. In any event, the condition of the national roads is something over which TCCP has no control, which the ESIA acknowledged. To the extent that TCCP will construct or maintain roads outside the Project area, the ESIA also committed to perform regular inspections*.\" Ms. Cessford also noted that as the condition of the roads was a matter outside the control of the company, she failed to see how this could affect an investor's decision whether to participate in the project.1384\n\nCessford, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134.\n\n1093.\n\nAs pointed out by Ms. Cessford, the Traffic Modeling for Reko Diq Transport Corridors prepared by Hagler Bailly Pakistan in July 2010 noted in its section of Total future Traffic Levels:\n\n\"*It is pertinent to know the present highway capacity and the extent to which it is currently utilized and will be utilized in future, ie, when it is likely to saturate. This information is not available from the National Highway Authority. As highway capacity is a function of road surface dimension, geometry, controls, and environmental conditions, any attempt to calculate the highway capacity also failed due to lack of information on these aspects. Only relevant information that is available is that the highway is a two lane highway (one lane in each direction). The width of each lane is 3.7 m (12 feet) and the shoulders on each side are between 1 to 2 m (typically 6 feet). The exceptions are as follows:* [\u2026]\"1385\n\n**Exhibit CE-1349**, pp. 3-1 to 3-2.\n\n1094.\n\nSimilarly, it is noted in the section of Future Road Development Plans:\n\n\"*Future road development plans for the segments comprising RD-1 were not available with the NHA. However, these are expected to include roadway widening, resurfacing, shoulder and curvature improvements, additional lanes and carriageways, bridges and grade-separated intersections, and new alignments and connecting routes that will improve the route capacity, level of service, and reduce travel distances. These changes may appreciably alter the regional roadway infrastructure over the operational phase of the Project*.\"1386\n\n**Exhibit CE-1349**, p. 3-2.\n\n1095.\n\nIn response, Ms. Filas emphasized that she had merely observed that if the capacity and physical condition of the roadways is unknown, \"*the ramifications of that increase cannot be assessed based on the available information*.\" She added that \"[t]*his observation was in response to the ESIA having turned the HBP report into seven pages of impact assessment text when the HBP report did not present anything more than traffic counts. To assess impacts, an understanding of the road conditions and carrying capacities must be coupled with the baseline traffic and Project-related traffic volumes to determine if the Project-related transportation requirements can be accommodated or will adversely affect existing public arterials.*\" Ms. Filas then clarified that she did not state that this issue would affect an investor's decision but \"*simply observed that impacts could not be reasonably drawn from calculated percentages of traffic counts. Impacts could only be understood when those increases in traffic counts are coupled with the capacity and condition of the arterial*.\"1387\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n1096.\n\nIn light of Ms. Filas' clarification that she did not consider this issue to affect an investor's decision and also taking into account that any more detailed assessment of the traffic impact would have required information that was not available from the National Highway Authority of Pakistan, the Tribunal is not convinced that this aspect would have been considered a significant issue by lenders or the authorities.\n\n1097.\n\nFinally, Ms. Filas considered that the assessment of certain additional cumulative impacts like the Tanjeel project, air emissions and water discharge as well as alternatives for power supply, water supply and concentrate transport were not sufficiently addressed in the ESIA. In this regard, Ms. Cessford explained that the Tanjeel project was not addressed in the ESIA because its scope was limited to the initial mine plan, which did not include Tanjeel. She also noted that \"[a]*lthough not explicitly stated in the ESIA the Tanjeel project was considered within the cumulative impact assessment as part of TCCP's planned expansion. The ESIA report also acknowledged the upsides associated with the socio-economic effects of expansion by TCCP or the development of other projects in Section 9.3*.\"1388 In response, Ms. Filas maintained her opinion that having a previously approved ESIA for Tanjeel and then not mentioning it in the cumulative impact section of the ESIA for the Feasibility Study was \"*highly unusual*\" and considered that it was relevant in that \"*it could potentially prolong the life of the Project and disturb more land, with all the trickle-down impacts, both positive and negative, that go with land disturbance and extended mine life.*\"1389\n\nCessford, \u00b6 111.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 111.\n\n1098.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is plausible that the Tanjeel project and the additional impacts it might have would have to be addressed if and when they materialized, *i.e*., in the context of the contemplated expansion. By contrast, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Balochistan EPA or a lender would have expected these impacts to be addressed in the context of the ESIA for the Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study covering the Wester Porphyries and not the Tanjeel area. As for the additional aspects of the air emissions and water discharge, the Tribunal notes that these were raised by Ms. Filas only in her second report and not substantiated in any further detail.\n\n1099.\n\nFinally, as for the alleged failure to sufficiently consider alternatives for power supply, water supply and concentrate transport, Ms. Cessford stated noted that \"*there is no requirement to exhaustively consider and investigate all alternatives at the same level of detail. For example, Pakistan's Guidelines for the preparation and review of Environmental Reports expressly recognise this. It also states that it is* 'quite common to undertake a preliminary analysis of a wide set of alternatives to decide which ones should be taken forward for further consideration, and which ones should be discarded.' *The Guidelines also accept that in many environmental impact assessments, the* 'favoured alternative will be the only one examined in detail.'\"1390 As for the IFC Performance Standards, Ms. Cessford explained that they require \"*an environmental and social impact assessment to include* 'an examination of technically and financially feasible alternatives to the source of such impacts, and documentation of the rationale for selecting the particular course of action proposed.' *The Guidance Notes to the IFC PS explain that the report* 'typically includes' *analysis of alternatives that* '[c]ompares reasonable alternatives' *and* '[s]tates the basis for selecting the particular project design proposed.' *It also implicitly recognises that the ESIA need not be exhaustive but should* 'focus[] on the significant issues' *and its scope and level of detail should be* 'commensurate' with the project's impacts and risks.' *Accordingly, in preparing the ESIA report there is judgment involved in determining* 'reasonable' *alternatives and the level of detail necessary to meet the IFC PS requirements to compare alternatives and state the basis for selecting an alternative*.\"1391\n\nCessford, \u00b6 137.\n\nCessford, \u00b6 138.\n\n1100.\n\nMs. Cessford testified that as noted in the ESIA, alternatives were \"*investigated and refined*\" but in some cases, the results of investigations were included in the supporting documents rather than the main ESIA report because they were no longer relevant to the final project description. She also stated that she attended workshops and conference calls discussing alternatives, which meant that \"*the analysis of alternatives proceeded both formally and informally and was reflected in the ESIA and other documentation*.\" Ms. Cessford then discussed in more detail the evaluation of the different water sources, the HFO plant to which there were \"*no other technically and financially available alternatives that could have been considered*\" and concentrate transport for which three options were considered.1392\n\nCessford, \u00b6\u00b6 139-142.\n\n1101.\n\nIn response, Ms. Filas noted that \"[t]*echnical reviewers are not mind readers*\" and considered that \"*if the ESIA fails to enumerate the alternatives considered or how the criteria influenced their decisions, a reviewer has no choice but to identify that missing information and explanation as gaps*.\"1393\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 182.\n\n1102.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Ms. Filas' argument. While it is certainly true that technical reviewers could only rely on information provided to them, Ms. Cessford stated that the information was included in the supporting documentation, which would also be provided to a reviewer. This is also expressly noted in the ESIA.1394 In addition, Ms. Filas did not engage with Ms. Cessford's references to both Pakistan's guidelines and IFC Performance Standards and her explanation as to why she therefore considered the discussion of alternatives in the ESIA and/or supporting documentation adequate and sufficient. Against this background and in the absence of any further substantiation on this point, the Tribunal is not convinced that a lender or regulatory authority would have requested additional work on the consideration of alternatives for power supply, water supply or concentrate transport.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 5-1.\n\n**(e) Impact of the Project After Closure of the Mine**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1103.\n\nAs a final matter that was not addressed in any detail at the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas also criticized in her first report that while the ESIA and the Conceptual Closure Plan did not expect that a toxic pit lake would form at closure of the mine, they failed to evaluate the likeliness and she \"*did not identify documentation to substantiate the presence or absence of a pit lake at closure*.\"1395 Ms. Filas considered:\n\n\"*The ESIA has already stated that the hypersaline sink water contained in the pit would be a high to extremely high toxicity risk. Moreover, surface water exposure in such a hyper-arid environment could potentially result in significant impacts to living receptors. Road blocks, berms and physical enclosures all have the potential of being breached if humans, animals, birds or other organisms have no other access to water. The ESIA disregards the potentially significant impacts associated with a likely toxic water body remaining at the surface post-closure, even if only temporary as a result of precipitation events*.\"1396\n\nFilas I, p. 11.\n\nFilas I, p. 12.\n\n1104.\n\nIn response, Ms. Cessford emphasized that \"[t]*he ESIA acknowledges there is a threat to birds of exposure to the pit lake based on a screening level risk assessment undertaken in supporting documents. Having identified the potential risk, it is not correct for the Filas Report to say that the ESIA did not assess the risk*.\"1397 Specifically, the ESIA states:\n\n\"*The model indicates that should a pit lake form, the combination of the metals in the pit lake water with the excessive concentrations of calcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium, sodium and sulfate, makes the modelled pit waters unsuitable for consumption, with an overall high to extremely high risk to livestock and wildlife.*\n\n*During operation, water will be removed from the pit and used in the process plant. Access of livestock and large mammals to the pit will be prevented by a fence. At closure, earth embankments will be placed across access points to the pit and the haul roads will be ripped up, and fences will be placed around the pit to preclude access by large mammals and livestock. It is expected that over time, the pit bottom will slowly fill with windblown sand further reducing the size and duration of any pit lake*.\"1398\n\nCessford, \u00b6 126.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 7-26.\n\n1105.\n\nWith regard to the likelihood of a pit lake forming after the closure of the mine, Ms. Cessford noted that \"*technical experts from SMEC and Barrick provided findings with respect to the groundwater inflow, on which the Filas Report has not commented*.\"1399 In this regard, Ms. Cessford referred to the Section on Temporary Pit Lake Geochemical Predictive Modelling in the report on Geochemical Characterisation and Prediction, Reko Diq Project, Pakistan prepared by SRK Consulting in July 2010, which states, *inter alia* : \"*Pit water balance studies undertaken by Barrick (Zhan and Shelp, 2008a; Zhan, 2008; Zhan and Shelp, 2008b) have shown that a permanent pit water body will not form at the Reko Diq site. This is due to low precipitation, minimal groundwater interception and highly evaporative environment. However, modelling indicates that temporary pit water bodies may form in response to extreme storm events (Zhan, 2009; Appendix J, Attachment 5C). SRK has modelled these events taking into account post closure build up of evaporative deposits within the pit bottom and wall rocks in response to average rainfall events*.\"1400\n\nCessford, \u00b6 127.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1348**, p. 146.\n\n1106.\n\nMs. Cessford further pointed out that both the ESIA and the Conceptual Closure Plan \"*also acknowledged that further studies are needed during the life of the project to confirm: a) if a lake is likely to form; and b) how potential exposure of wildlife, particularly birds, could be managed*.\"1401 Among the primary components of the closure approach, the ESIA lists the following:\n\n\"*Pit safety berms and/or fences will be placed around the perimeter of the pit and across the ramps into the pits to restrict vehicular access. Groundwater intersected by the pit is notexpected to accumulate in the pit to form a lake after closure. However, storm water may periodically accumulate in the pit bottom and remain until it evaporates. Additional monitoring and studies during operations will be able to better predict if groundwater is likely to inflow into the pit at a rate that would cause a permanent pit lake in which case additional mitigation could be required*.\"1402\n\nCessford, \u00b6 127.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 4-59.\n\n1107.\n\nThe Conceptual Closure Plan further stated:\n\n*\"One large open pit will exist at closure, the Western Porphyries pit. Based on the current groundwater models, the pit is not expected to collect groundwater after closure, although monitoring of groundwater inflows during operations will provide additional data to improve the accuracy of this prediction. However, stormwater may accumulate ephemerally during major storm events and that water is likely to exceed IFC water quality standards. Given the significant evaporation at the site, any collected stormwater is not expected to remain in the pit for very long.*\n\n*Because there is some uncertainty associated with the prediction of groundwater inflow to the pit, and the likelihood of ephemeral stormwater collection, mitigation measures to protect human, terrestrial and avian life may be required after closure. Therefore, the closure plan assumes that access to the pit will be limited after closure by construction of fences and berms around the pit. Avian access to a possible pit lake would be difficult to limit, so future studies should evaluate the need for, and feasible types of mitigation for this potential risk.*\n\n*Although placement of waste rock backfill in the pit bottom, or an excavated sump in the pit bottom, could act as a temporary mitigation measure, it is not considered a permanent solution because fine grained material from the pit walls and blowing sand will eventually fill the void spaces in the backfill, limiting the water that could be stored in the backfill and resulting in an ephemeral pit lake on top of the backfill following major storm events. The other closure concern related to the pit is the safety risk associated with the final pit highwalls. Currently, the key components of the closure approach for the open pits include:*\n\n*\u2022 placement (or repairing) of a safety berm and/or fence a safe distance from the pit high wall;*\n\n*\u2022 posting warning signs around the pit highwall; and*\n\n*\u2022 construction of berms across the pit ramps to stop unauthorized access to the pit.*\n\n*Over time, blowing sand is likely to accumulate in the pits. This would not adversely affect the closure design and would be consistent with natural landforms in the area.\"1403*\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix H, p. 17.\n\n1108.\n\nMs. Cessford then expressed the opinion that \"[g]*iven the risk concerns a situation arising after many years at the closure of the mine, even if this was perceived as a shortcoming, a regulator could require remedial action such as monitoring or further investigation during the operation of the mine. A potential investor could also require an ESAP to monitor, review and audit the company's compliance with its plan for further studies.\"1404*\n\nCessford, \u00b6 127.\n\n1109.\n\nIn her second report, Ms. Filas did not reiterate her initial criticism that the ESIA failed to evaluate the likelihood of a pit lake forming at closure or that it disregarded the potentially significant impacts associated with a (temporary) pit lake. However, she raised a new concern, *i.e*., that the EDC and Conceptual Closure Plan failed to discuss \"*the Balochistan requirement for backfillung excavations upon closure*\" or the potential need to request a variance.1405 She took note of the following statement in Table 3.1 on Environmental Legislation Relevant to Reko Diq in Appendix C of the ESIA:\n\n\"*The requirement of Rule 13(2)(d) to fill up all excavations is interpreted not to apply to large scale open pit mining operations, as complete backfilling of the open pit would be infeasible and would not be required for similar operations anywhere else.*\"1406\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 39.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix C, p. C-10.\n\n1110.\n\nThe requirement itself was described to be as follows:\n\n\"*The conditions pertaining to the mitigation of negative impacts require that the holder of the mineral title or concession:*\n\n\u2026\n\n*\u2022 on the expiry, termination, surrender or cancellation of the title or concession and in accordance with good mining practices, fills up all excavations, securely plugs all mines, removes all equipment, installations and structures and restores the land, in so far as possible, to its original condition and to prevent hazards to human or animal life or to the property of others or to the environment* [Rule 13(2)(d)].\"1407\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix C, p. C-10.\n\n1111.\n\nIn Ms. Filas' opinion, the interpretation regarding the inapplicability of the requirement to the Reko Diq project was wrong because \"[t]*here are many instances where pit backfilling is done concurrent with mining operations and there are instances where such backfilling is required by law. Exemptions to complete pit backfilling are sometimes approved by regulating authorities, but such variances are authorized based on appropriate technical and financial justification presented by the project proponent, not based on an arbitrary assumption that Balochistan law is not applicable to this Project*.\"1408 In support of her opinion, Ms. Filas referenced US and California legislation.1409\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 40.\n\n**Exhibits FIL-22** and **FIL-23**.\n\n1112.\n\nMs. Filas further agreed that \"*there is significant time to optimize the Conceptual Closure Plan included as Appendix D to the ESIA over the life of the Project*\" but considered that \"*the ESIA commitments must be sufficient to demonstrate that the proposed action presented in the ESIA has the ability to mitigate Project risks to acceptable levels. It is not enough to simply intimate that there is a risk and we will deal with it later because we don't need to know if our closure plan will work for at least 50+ years. The ESIA must present a plan that will mitigate unacceptable risks. That plan is then carried forward into the Project feasibility study and financial analysis*.\" Specifically with regard to the requirement to fill up all excavations, Ms. Filas considered that the acknowledgment of this requirement only in an appendix and its dismissal as inapplicable suggested that it \"*may have been intentionally ignored*.\" She added that \"[i]*f the Government of Balochistan were to insist on compliance with this backfilling requirement, the circa $130 million closure cost estimate presented in the Feasibility Study and presumably included in the Project financial model would be grossly inadequate and may affect the overall feasibility of the Project*.\"1410\n\nFilas II, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151.\n\n1113.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue was not discussed with the experts during the Hearing on Quantum. However, given that Ms. Filas had raised this issue only in her second report, Claimant sought leave to introduce certain exhibits into the record which demonstrate in its view that \"*complete backfilling is not generally required for pits of the kind contemplated for Reko Diq*\" as well as that \"*the specific California requirement cited by Ms. Filas has long been controversial and that substantial revisions to limit its scope were under active consideration.*\"1411 The Tribunal admitted these exhibits *de bene esse* and now decides to admit them into the record. As pointed out by Claimant, Ms. Filas did not include the requirement of filling up excavations in her presentation of the \"*non-conformities*\" she had identified in the ESIA. She did, however, maintain that \"[t]*oxic mine water was a concern during public consultation, so leaving toxic water in the pit at closure will likely be contentious*.\"1412 In her conclusion, Ms. Filas included \"*the toxic mine water that would be left at the end of the closure period*\" as an issue for which \"[t]*hey haven't provided justifications*.\"1413\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175.\n\nFilas Presentation, p. 16.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1958 lines 1-7.\n\n1114.\n\nAgainst this background, it appears to the Tribunal that while Ms. Filas maintained her criticism that the concern of leaving toxic mine water in the pit at closure was not adequately addressed in the ESIA, she did not reiterate her criticism that this was contrary to a requirement in the 2002 BM Rules or contrary to current practices in mining operations. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it necessary to address the evidence submitted by Claimant in detail. It suffices to note at this point that the California Regulation on backfilling was criticized in the documents submitted by Claimant as being detrimental to the environment because it \"*requires moving material twice (increasing GHG emissions), fails to address the proper storage and handling of waste materials (jeopardizing water quality), and can cause greater ground disturbances (impacting habitat for sensitive species)*.\"1414\n\n**Exhibit CE-1695**, p. 1.\n\n1115.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that considerations underlying a discussion on amendments to California legislation are not directly relevant to whether the Balochistan authorities would request that Claimant fill up the excavations created by its mining project at closure. As pointed out by Ms. Filas, rules 13/2)(d)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules indeed provides that \"[i]*t shall be a condition of every mineral title or mineral concession that -\u2026 (d) on the expiry, termination, surrender or cancellation of the title or concession, the holder thereof, in accordance with good mining practices, shall - (i) fill up all excavations on the land to which the title or concession relates*.\"1415 This provision is contained in Part III of the 2002 BM Rules, which contains general provisions on Mineral Titles and Mineral Concessions and would thus generally be applicable to the project. However, the Tribunal cannot agree with Ms. Filas that the ESIA ignored this requirement and dismissed it without any discussion with the GOB. In the appendix to the ESIA, it is stated that \"*complete backfilling of the open pit would be unfeasible and would not be required for similar operations anywhere else*.\"1416 While Ms. Filas disputed this statement, she did not provide any support for her opinion apart from her reference to US and California legislation which is apparently under revision due to the environmental concerns raised by the backfilling requirement. In addition, as Mr. Filas herself noted, the Chapter on Closure in the Feasibility Study expressly quotes, *inter alia*, the requirement in rule 13(2)(d)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules and then states:\n\n\"*These rules contain some requirements that appear to imply that all pits would require backfilling as part of closure. However, these regulations are based on laws written in the mid-twentieth century and complete backfilling of large base metal pits is not a standard practice anywhere in the world. These particular aspects of the regulation will need to be discussed and clarified with the Balochistan government during negotiations for the mining lease*.\"1417\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 13(2)(d)(i).\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Appendix C, p. C-10.\n\nExhibit RE-576, p. 15-5.\n\n1116.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent or Ms. Filas that this requirement was simply ignored or hidden in an appendix to the ESIA. Claimant rather made express reference to it in the Feasibility Study and considered it an aspect for negotiation with the GOB. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal sees no basis for doubting Claimant's statement that complete backfilling is not standard practice in the mining industry. Also taking into account the express reference in rule 13(2)(d)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules to \"*good mining practices*\" and the environmental implications of backfilling which were not addressed by Ms. Filas, the Tribunal is not convinced that the GOB would have required Claimant to completely fill up the excavation created by the mine and, thus, that it should have accounted for the cost of complete backfilling in its estimate of the closure costs.\n\n1117.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the residual risk register of the Feasibility Study expressly includes the risk of \"*Underestimation of closure cost due to uncertainty in regulatory closure requirements (e.g., pit backfilling requirements)*\" and assigned to this risk a CAPEX impact of USD 20.6 million.1418 This risk was incorporated by Prof. Davis into his valuation model.1419 Neither Respondent nor Ms. Filas have addressed the quantification of this residual risk by Claimant and the Tribunal therefore has no basis to assume that a buyer would have considered it insufficient.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 26, p. 3.\n\n1118.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced that Claimant's plans for addressing a temporary toxic pit lake that might form at closure of the mine were inadequate for a project at the development stage of Reko Diq. Ms. Filas explicitly agreed that \"*there is significant time to optimize the Conceptual Closure Plan \u2026 over the life of the project*.\"1420 While she maintained the opinion that the ESIA should have presented a plan for the mitigation of unacceptable risks, the costs of which would then be carried over to the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal has also taken note of Ms. Cessford's explanations and the results of the pit water balance studies and the modelling performed by SRK Consultating. On balance, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the possibility of a temporary toxic pit lake forming at closure was a risk whose mitigation could not be addressed over the life of the mine or that Claimant should have accounted for additional costs regarding the closure of the mine. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the overall closure cost estimate accuracy was presented as being \"*in the range of +30% to -25%*\" and that the total closure cost estimate of USD 110.6 million was therefore increased by an additional USD 20 million contingency.1421 In the Tribunal's view, Respondent and Ms. Filas have failed to provide the Tribunal with a substantiated argument as to why this estimate would have been considered insufficient.\n\nFilas II, \u00b6 149.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-15**, p. 15-31 and Table 15.2.\n\n1119.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent and its expert Ms. Filas have failed to convince the Tribunal that any of the alleged non-conformities of the ESIA in terms of environmental impacts would have been an issue causing significant additional work and/or costs for which Claimant should have accounted in the cost estimate included in the Feasibility Study.\n\n**iii. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed the Social Impacts of the Project**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore now turn to the social impacts addressed in the ESIA and the criticisms raised by Dr. Connor.\n\n1121.\n\nIn her presentation at the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor stated, *inter alia*, that \"[t]*he information on baseline social conditions is completely inadequate*,\" which she considered to be \"*particularly worrisome \u2026 in terms of the conflict implications, as well as there appears to be an almost complete lack of understanding of the local organizational structure.*\" In her opinion, \"[y]*ou need to have much more information. And that is missing in the ESIA, and that is absolutely required in the ESIA. That's its job, is to do the assessment, determine the severity*.\"1422\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2014 line 14 to p. 2015 line 13.\n\n1122.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, as already discussed above, Dr. Connor placed emphasis on the fact that certain information was supposed to be contained in the ESIA rather than any other place of the project documentation and that if the ESIA for Reko Diq had gone to a lender, \"[t]*hey would have said, This ESIA has to be \u2026 completely redone. You haven't identified all the impacts, and things like land aren't even addressed in it. You haven't properly addressed the significance, and you haven't given the reader or me or anyone else enough information to reach a conclusion about whether I would want to invest or not*.\"1423 Dr. Connor acknowledged that a lender would also have seen the Feasibility Study but maintained that \"*their purposes are completely different*.\" In her opinion:\n\n\"*The social aspect of the Feasibility Study level are up in the sky. They didn't tell you anything. They give you a sort of overall view of how many people might be affected if they locate the mine here, blah, blah, blah. That's why it is so different from environmental.*\n\n*That social assessment doesn't occur until the ESIA, until the Social Impact Assessment. And that document would have to demonstrate to the lender that you are serious and know what you're doing about the social impacts, particularly those of the nature--the fragile and delicate nature and volatile nature that I mentioned*.\"1424\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2029 line 7 to p. 2030 line 9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2030 line 17 to p. 2031 line 9.\n\n1123.\n\nIn response to the question whether there were other documents addressing the socio-political and security risks, Dr. Connor again maintained that these had to be addressed in the ESIA \"*because that's the document that assesses the risk of that to the Project, and the risk of the Project to the people in that area*.\" She agreed that \"*you can have all kinds of background documents*\" but considered that there was only \"*a sort of superficial study.*\" Dr. Connor confirmed that she had reviewed Chapter 19 of the Feasibility Study on Security but noted that she \"*wasn't here to evaluate security*\" and argued that \"[i]*t does not address\u2014what what I am concerned about is the social person, is how do we address the implications of the Project, how the Project is going to cause more conflict. And it doesn't address that*.\"1425\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2037 line 5 to p. 2040 line 1.\n\n1124.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal is not convinced by an argument that certain information was to be contained in the ESIA rather than other parts of the documentation that would also be submitted to a lender. To the extent that a certain assessment was made and the information was thus available, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that any issue regarding the location of the information could have been resolved without causing significant additional costs or significant delay. While the Tribunal understands Dr. Connor's testimony to be that critical information on the social baseline conditions was missing, including from other parts of the documentation, the Tribunal is not convinced that this is in fact the case.\n\n1125.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Dr. Connor that the Chapter on Security in the Feasibility Study may not have contained the social assessment she was looking for. However, Claimant also asked its consultants from Hagler Bailly Pakistan to prepare a Socioeconomic Baseline for Reko Diq Transport Corridors and Marine Terminal, which was completed in July 2010.1426 It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether Dr. Connor was referring to this report when opining that there was only \"*a sort of superficial study.*\" However, the Tribunal notes that while Respondent frequently referred to the July 2010 report in its Rejoinder on Quantum, Dr. Connor did not list it among the documents she consulted when preparing her report.1427 She rather listed a Cultural Baseline and Study of Relationship Dynamics Draft Report dating from July 2009, which was considerably shorter than the July 2010 report.1428\n\n**Exhibit RE-751**.\n\n*Cf*. Connor, pp. 5-6.\n\n**Exhibit CON-9 / RE-609**.\n\n1126.\n\nAs for the socio-economic baseline, Dr. Connor referred in her report to Section 6.3.2 of the ESIA on Conflict in Balochistan, criticizing that it was \"*very brief and superficial*\" and \"*only \u00bd page long.*\"1429 Dr. Connor then discussed Section 8 of the ESIA containing the Socioeconomic Impact Assessment but continued to refer in this discussion only to Section 6.3.2 of the ESIA as the \"*baseline*,\"1430 without addressing the 160-page July 2010 report on the Socioeconomic Baseline for Reko Diq Transport Corridors and Marine Terminal. She also did not make any explicit reference to the 39-page July 2009 draft report on the Cultural Baseline and Study of Relationship Dynamics. In the absence of any engagement by Dr. Connor with these reports, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr. Connor's opinion that \"[t]*he information on baseline social conditions is completely inadequate*.\"\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.1 and note 7, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-601**, p. 6-25.\n\n*Cf*. Connor, Section 2.2.1, \u00b6 3.\n\n1127.\n\nDr. Connor further testified that \"[t]*here are no methods to manage \u2026 the benefits the project will have*\" and criticized that \"[t]*hose benefits are not in that part of the ESIA*\" but only \"*some section on the kind of typical benefits that a mining project will bring local employment \u2026 and other kinds of community development and that sort of thing, educational help and so on*.\"1431 She criticized that \"[t]*here is no implementation plan. There is not one single discussion of how that was analyzed, who did it, who determined that was the right thing to do, who determined that wasn't the wrong thing to do that would divide and cause more conflict, who determined how they were going to figure out what the recipients have, because if you give the wrong thing to the wrong group, you may have a war on your hands*.\" In her opinion, there were only \"*some boilerplate descriptions of, say, employment training plans that come out of \u2026 any standard mining company before they actually develop the plan*.\"1432\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2015 line 17 to p. 2016 line 19.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2016 line 20 to p. 2017 line 17.\n\n1128.\n\nIn her report, Dr. Connor referred to Section 1.3.3 and Table 8.1 of the ESIA in this regard, which \"*identifies numerous benefits that the project would bring to Balochistan and its people*\" but considered that \"[t]*his benefits description \u2026 is a list of the general types of benefits mining projects provide, rather than the detailed plans for delivery of benefits needed to evaluate their effectiveness in maintaining LTO*.\"1433 While the list of documents consulted by Dr. Connor in preparing her report also included Chapter 13 of the Feasibility on Community Relations,1434 she did not make any reference to this chapter throughout her report, including to Section 13.5 on Community Management Plans, which included a more detailed description of Claimant's Community Engagement Plan, Community Development Projects, Local Workforce Development, Education and Training, Local Procurement and Supplier Development, and Management of In-migration.1435 The Tribunal is not convinced that the description in the Feasibility Study could reasonably be described as \"*some boilerplate descriptions*\" or \"*a list of the general types of benefits mining projects provide*\" and, thus, that Dr. Connor's criticisms regarding the ESIA would also apply to the Chapter on Community Relations in the Feasibility Study. As Dr. Connor did not engage with the content of Chapter 13, the Tribunal cannot follow her opinion regarding the description of the benefits that Claimant intended to bring to Balochistan.\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.3, \u00b6 1.\n\nConnor, p. 5.\n\nExhibit RE-576-13, pp. 13-36 to 13-39.\n\n1129.\n\nDr. Connor further argued that Claimant had not developed a community development strategy and, while acknowledging that \"*community development strategies and plans typically evolve over and are revised over time*,\" the ESIA failed to explain \"*how these efforts would be tailored to the conditions of the affected communities \u2013 the most important factor in developing effective plans and in evaluating the likely outcome of community support programs*.\"1436 Dr. Connor noted that the benefits \"*though a way off from being turned into management plans*\" had been made known to the community through disclosure and consultations and therefore considered that \"[m]*anaging these expectations requires a great deal of skill, which does not seem to have been the case with TCC's Community Relations (CR) work or, at least, evidence is not available*.\"1437\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.3, \u00b6 2.\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.3, \u00b6 3.\n\n1130.\n\nDr. Connor then referred to a \"*Social Performance Specialist's report from his 2009 visit*\" in which it was noted that \"*community contributions at that stage were ad hoc consisting largely of donations to sports events and some other minor activities in response to requests, and these activities were being implemented in an uncoordinated way by various non CR departments*.\" Dr. Connor agreed with the Social Performance Specialist that \"*donations and responding to requests cause more problems than they resolve as they lead to negative feelings of both those whose request is rejected, as well as those whose request is accepted, but find the assistance insufficient or become entitlements over time from which the company cannot extract itself without causing conflict*.\"1438\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.3, \u00b6 3.\n\n1131.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor confirmed that she had relied in her report on a contemporaneous assessment performed by Mr. Luc Zandvliet, whom she now described as a Community Engagement Expert and \"*the only one out there I would have paid any attention to and given me an opinion*.\"1439\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2044 line 21 to p. 2045 line 6 and p. 2053 lines 3-7\n\n1132.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that with regard to community development, Mr. Zandvliet stated in his report of a trip to Reko Diq in March /April 2009 that \"[a] *community development strategy is yet to be developed, which is normal is this phase of the project*.\"1440 Consequently, and contrary to what Dr. Connor's report suggests, he did not consider it unusual that Claimant had not yet developed a community development strategy at the time he visited the teams working on the project.\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, p. 8.\n\n1133.\n\nMr. Zandvliet then noted that \"[t]*he current approach largely consists of donations to sports events, combined with a number of activities that were started, and are still being implemented by departments other than CR*\" and that \"[t]*he donation policy is not likely to yield a positive return on investment*.\" He proceeded to present various options for community development, including to \"[b]*ase a short term community development strategy on risk analysis and link it to the business case*.\" He noted that \"[t]*he main risks to the Reko Diq project are related to the perceived lack of jobs and contracting opportunities for local people, rather than the lack of community projects. This needs to be reflected in the community development approach*.\"1441\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, p. 8.\n\n1134.\n\nAs Dr. Connor placed emphasis on the expertise of Mr. Zandvliet as a community engagement expert, the Tribunal considers it worth reviewing his trip report in more detail. Mr. Zandvliet indeed made various observations and proposals indicating that significant additional work would be required on the subject of community relations before construction could start. For example, Mr. Zandvliet made the general observation that \"[c]*onsistently and repeatedly, local stakeholders have expressed their - expectations related to two main benefits: jobs and contracts for which they feel they are qualified. These demands are reasonable but require a concerted effort on TCC's part given current local literacy levels and contracting capabilities. If construction does indeed commence in Q2 2010, TCC's efforts are currently not bold and comprehensive enough to provide local people with realistic employment and contracting opportunities; the window of opportunity is rapidly closing to train 5000+ people to a level of qualification for non-or semi-skilled labor positions*.\" He then presented options on how this could be achieved.1442\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 2-3.\n\n1135.\n\nWith regard to the community relations team, Mr. Zandvliet considered that \"[t]*here are opportunities for the CR team to become more strategic in its approach to establish and maintain local support and in allocating staff to achieve these objectives*\" and \"*an opportunity to clarify the tasks of various members of the CR team to ensure that duplication is avoided and some gaps are addressed*.\" He referred to certain measures which had already been implemented during his trip and presented further options on how the effectiveness of the community relations team could be improved in the future.1443\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 3-5.\n\n1136.\n\nOn stakeholder engagement, Mr. Zandvliet observed that \"[t]*here has been no systematic and ongoing TCC presence in the various communities. This was in part due to assumptions that too many visits would lead to questions and requests for which the company would not have an answer*.\" He then reported that \"[t]*he CR team committed to the implementation of a stakeholder engagement program, which will be systematically followed starting the first week of May. The month of April will be used for 5 pilot meetings. See Annex G for an overview which stakeholders will be met as well as the frequency of engagement*.\" He also noted that \"*Stakeholders claim that, in the past, TCC has made several promises that it never fulfilled*\" but added that \"[t]*his perception is typical for any project during the exploration stage*\" and referred to a new site-based Communication Officer and a draft communication strategy which he had provided. He again presented further options on how to improve stakeholder engagement.1444\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 5-6.\n\n1137.\n\nAs for the grievance procedure, Mr. Zandvliet observed that it \"*has been implemented and diligently followed by the grievance officer. The first cases have been closed*.\" He noted that some Heads of Departments had dismissed the grievance SOP because it had not been explained to them but noted that it would be publicized during the upcoming round of public community meetings and again presented further options with regard to the grievance procedure.1445\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 6-7.\n\n1138.\n\nPerhaps most urgently, Mr. Zandvliet addressed employment and hiring, observing that \"[a] *staff recruiting strategy for the construction phase is still missing. On a site level, the HR department is mandated, and resourced, to look after existing employees (and reportedly does that well). As a result, TCC has yet to start developing a hiring strategy for 5,000-10,000 people\u2013potentially starting within the year. Experience from other mines shows the need to start planning for a recruitment exercise of 5,000-10,000 at least one year in advance. Some mines have a full-time project team of 3-6 people on site at least 6 months prior to the start of construction dedicated to preparation and implementation of the recruitment effort. If a hiring strategy is not developed in the short term, there will not be sufficient time to educate communities, and to design a mechanism that provides maximum opportunities for local people, which will almost certainly increase social risk to the project*.\" Following further observations on a lack of progress on vocational training and a feeder program as well as a \"*Policy-Practice Gap*\" regarding preferential recruitment, he again presented various options to address the issues he had identified.1446\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, pp. 10-12.\n\n1139.\n\nFinally, for Contracting, Mr. Zandvliet noted that \"[a]*t present, very few local businesses benefit from the presence of TCC. Even many of the goods that local business people say they can provide are sourced from Karachi or elsewhere. This is to assure quality of produce as well as timely delivery*\" and that \"[a]*t the same time, the administration department has made deliberate efforts to source locally but was confronted with sellers who did not understand the modalities of working with a large company (e.g. they kept raising their prices).*\" Mr. Zandvliet saw \"*tremendous opportunities to ensure that local vendors and contractors benefit more from the TCC presence*\" and presented an option which he considered \"*would be* 'low hanging fruit,' *possibly cost effective and would demonstrate a visible commitment to TCC claims to support local people*.\"1447\n\n**Exhibit RE-644**, p. 13.\n\n1140.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor clarified that she did not know whether Mr. Zandvliet's recommendations had been followed. She also clarified, however, that while she had not known at the time she had written her report that Mr. Zandvliet had been retained by Claimant as a consultant, she learned shortly before the Hearing that Claimant had offered him a contract after his trip report.1448 As the criticisms raised by Dr. Connor were raised for the first time in her report submitted together with Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, Claimant submitted certain additional documents which were admitted by the Tribunal *de bene esse* and are now admitted into the record. Specifically in this context, Claimant submitted a Reko Diq Flash Report dated July 2009 in which was noted that \"*Luc Zandvliet has been retained as a consultant to support Community Relations team.*\"1449\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2046 lines 4-8 and p. 2063 lines 9-15.\n\nExhibit CE-1714, p. 3. It was also noted than \"*Alexey Fotygin has joined site as Environmental Manager*.\"\n\n1141.\n\nDr. Connor explained that Mr. Zandvliet would often fly in for a brief visit at first and then provide a proposal on how he could help \"[a]*nd in most cases, he goes in to help them, and he's quite good at it*.\"1450 Against this background and taking into account that Mr. Zandvliet's initial observations dated from April 2009, *i.e*., one and a half years before the Feasibility Study and ESIA were completed, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that Claimant retained him in order to work on the areas he had identified and implement some of the options he had proposed.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2063 lines 16-21.\n\n1142.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is also confirmed by the summaries of the community initiatives that Claimant presented at the Hearing on Quantum: (i) the contributions that Claimant had already made before applying for a mining lease (first slide); and (ii) the contributions that Claimant planned to make after being granted the mining lease (second slide):1451\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, pp. 104-105.\n\n1143.\n\nDr. Connor confirmed that she was aware of the initiatives reflected on the slide presented to her and added that \"[t]*hey are not all in here, but there are pages that show photographs of people doing this and that, and, you know, they are having this training program and so on. So, there are lists periodically that have some of these things, yes. So, I'm aware of this, yes*.\"1452 In response to the question whether she would agree that what matters to a local population would be what the company does rather than what it writes or says, Dr. Connor responded:\n\n\"*This has changed so much in the last 10 years, and I've been involved in that. The old style was charity, and then it moved to sort of philanthropy, but that's 25 years out of date. This is 25 years out of date. And you don't just go in and give people what you think they want so they will like you because they will not like you. They will end up not liking you at all because it isn't really what they need because you don't know really what they need.*\n\n*You have to have--the banks will make you have a community development program that is founded in a very sound assessment by people who are very sound in doing this, and you will pick a handful of things to concentrate on. So, you'll have a livelihood chapter, there will be a livelihood bucket, and you might have two or three activities in that that you are going to do for the next 10 years. Maybe you'll have a health one. And you'll pick a few things, which is usually like higher level, I said, you know, setting up systems.*\n\n*Infrastructure? I never what* [sic] *to see anybody anything, but if you have to put 5 percent of something in, do it, but it doesn't really make any difference, because if they could build it, they would have done it. These Parties' meetings, visits, you've going to do some of that. It's not a contribution. It may make some people like you--and it may not--because in an environment like this, what if you pick the wrong people to give things to? What if you give too much to one group?*\"1453\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2055 line 22 to p. 2056 line 8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2056 line 10 to p. 2058 line 9.\n\n1144.\n\nDr. Connor therefore maintained that \"*this scattershot kind of* 'let's just give them what they want' *is bound to get you in trouble. I've never seen it not*.\"1454\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2058 lines 20-22.\n\n1145.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced, however, that Claimant's approach was as random as Dr. Connor's testimony suggests. In particular, the Tribunal notes that actions presented on these slides included several of the recommendations provided by Mr. Zandvliet in his trip report of April 2009, such as, *e.g*., on the subject of Local Procurement & Hiring for which Claimant identified several measures to achieve defined goals of sourcing certain contract volumes from Balochistan within a specified timeframe.\n\n1146.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these goals as well as other community initiatives that Claimant planned to achieve after being granted a mining lease were communicated to the GOB together with Claimant's revised offer for the Reko Diq project submitted to Mr. Lehri on 4 October 2010. This offer contained a Proposed Social Investment Plan setting out in detail the initiatives contemplated by Claimant for Training & Education, Economic Development & Procurement, and Infrastructure & Public Services, as well as Goodwill contributions.1455 In the final section on Budget and Fund Disbursement, it is noted that \"[o]*ver the first 10 years, the project will invest US$ 100 million, equivalent to roughly 1.5% of the annual Ebidta* [sic]. *These financial commitments are additional to those investments that will have to be made to comply with obligations described in the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment*.\"1456\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(X)(b)**, pp. 61, 68-71.\n\n**Exhibit RE-58(X)(b)**, p. 71.\n\n1147.\n\nAs this statement was made before the final ESIA was completed in November 2010, it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether and to which extent some of the initiatives described in the revised offer were not contained in the ESIA. However, as noted above, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that amendments to the ESIA based on already available information could have been made without causing significant additional cost or delay if and when an agreement with the GOB had been reached on the basis of this revised offer. This also corresponded to Ms. Cessford's expectation that further interaction with the regulatory authority would be required post-submission of the ESIA.\n\n1148.\n\nIn any event, however, the Tribunal notes that the revised offer was submitted to Mr. Lehri after the Feasibility Study had been delivered to the GOB in August 2010. As the Feasibility Study included the cost estimates for the measures described in the ESIA, it appears to the Tribunal that the additional costs of USD 100 million referred to in this revised offer may not have been included in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study. This will be addressed further below.\n\n1149.\n\nWith regard to individual measures contemplated by Claimant, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Connor testified at the Hearing on Quantum that she would personally not recommend education \"*unless you are doing something during a long-term community development program that is defined in improving educational systems.*\" Similarly, she would not recommend health programs \"*unless you are--you are going to have some because you have to in an area, but you're not a health--you know, you don't know anything about health*.\" When pointed to Claimant's health impact assessment, Dr. Connor stated that \"*I didn't really look at it. You know, I did look at it, but I know what the health conditions are there because I occasionally review things for UNICEF and so on, so I know what the health conditions are*.\" She then affirmed that she had looked at the health impact assessment but testified that it was not listed in the documents she had reviewed because \"*it's not relevant to \u2026 whether they can maintain a license to operate.*\"1457 She further confirmed that she had received the health impact assessment only after her report and clarified her answer that \"*that health report is all secondary information. I can get better information than that from going somewhere else. But again, I didn't think it was relevant to whether or not people would accept the benefits when they don't know what they are against the adverse impacts when they don't know what those are*.\"1458\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2050 line 19 to p. 2052 line 1.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2065 lines 11-21.\n\n1150.\n\nThe health impact assessment was also submitted by Claimant in response to the criticisms raised by Dr. Connor in her report, specifically that the ESIA did not adequately address, *inter alia*, \"*deterioration in public health and increases in social ills associated with population influx*\" as well as \"*human health and wellbeing*.\"1459 The Health Impact Assessment prepared by International SOS in September 2008 took into account at various points of its impact analysis the influx of migrant people.1460 While the Tribunal appreciates that this report was not available to Dr. Connor when she prepared her written report, it cannot follow her explanation as to why she considered the 138-page report irrelevant to her assessment of whether the population would accept the benefits contemplated by Claimant with regard to health. Against this background, the Tribunal is also not convinced by Dr. Connor's criticism that Claimant failed to appropriate assess the impact of the project on the local population and whether they would be outweighed by the social benefits it planned to provide.\n\nConnor, Section 2.2.1, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-601**, p. 8-17.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1701**, pp. 109, 113, 115, 117 and 128.\n\n1151.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that while Dr. Connor expressed the opinion that Claimant focused on the wrong areas of community initiatives, she did not provide an estimate of the costs that would have been associated with initiatives that she would have considered more adequate.\n\n1152.\n\nIn her report, Dr. Connor stated:\n\n\"*The continuous effort to maintain LTO would involve substantial expenditure in cost and time and highly skilled social and community experts with experience in conflict management, particularly in Balochistan and/or similar environments. This Expert is not in a position to evaluate the costs for such an effort as given in the TCC budget. The ESIA does not discuss the human resources TCC has or intends to recruit in any detail, which is a serious omission because it suggests that TCC is not aware of the expertise and experience that will be needed to deal with sensitive issues like license to operate in this project's context. Moreover, highly skilled experts are not numerous and most are already engaged in other projects. TCC documentation indicates that staff will be trained, but does not address who will do this training and mentoring or when it would have begun*.\"1461\n\nConnor, Section 2.1, \u00b6 9.\n\n1153.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor clarified with regard to the costs she had referred to that \"[t]*he costs are indirect. You are going to be doing all these other things to make sure that you're bringing the right benefits and so on. So, there are the engagement costs and so on, but they are the costs of running your Project properly*.\" She further clarified that in addition to the benefits brough to the local communities, \"[y]*ou're going to work with the Government higher up to maybe improve the Ministry of Mines. You are going to do all kinds of stuff. If give yourself enough time, you find out what are rights things to do, and then you are not wasting money and upsetting people. So, those are the costs I'm talking about*.\" Dr. Connor added that she was not able to predict the costs as \"*they were nowhere near to figuring out what those were going to be*.\"1462\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2059 line 14 to p. 2060 line 16.\n\n1154.\n\nThen pointed to Claimant's presentation of the amount that it was planning to spend on community initiatives, *i.e*., USD 406.5 million,1463 Dr. Connor testified:\n\n\"*Well, it's got a number down there that isn't meaningful. It's got a number for these things it's decided to do, which I don't think they should be doing at all, at least some of them. So, is that a lot of money for a size of project like this? Yeah, it could be. I don't know. But there's nothing--I can't evaluate amounts of money because I'm not accepting their community programs, most of them*.\"1464\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, p. 105.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2061 line 13 to p. 2062 line 10.\n\n1155.\n\nIn addition, with regard to the \"*highly skilled experts*\" she had referred to in her report, Dr. Connor emphasized that even if Mr. Zandvliet may have been retained by Claimant, \"*you still have to have the staff*,\" *i.e*., \"*a very large community staff*,\" including a \"*very skilled community manager,*\" within the confines of an Environmental and Social Management System.1465 In her opinion, \"*this Project is just way, way up the road, and they did not have anywhere near the right staff to develop this, so they have to acquire these social managers and supporting Experts*\" such as \"*a conflict management expert to assess that and see what needs to be done*.\" Dr. Connor added that \"*I'm sure it could be done, but it would take a long time*\" and stated that it would take \"*a minimum of two years, might be much longer than that*\" to implement the necessary risk management measures. She maintained, however, that \"*it wouldn't have been anytime soon, and they would not have been able to demonstrate adequately to a lender that they would get license to operate*.\"1466\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2063 line 21 to p. 2064 line 12.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2019 line 6 to p. 2021 line 1.\n\n1156.\n\nAs for the costs aspect, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Connor did not consider the amount that Claimant planned on spending on community initiatives too low. She stated that \"*it could be \u2026 a lot of money for a site of project like this*\" but could not provide an answer because she did not accept most of the community programs as such. As the Tribunal is not convinced by Dr. Connor's criticisms on these community programs, it also has no basis to doubt that the amount Claimant planned to spend on these would be inadequate.\n\n1157.\n\nFinally, as for Dr. Connor's concern regarding the availability of skilled experts and personnel to implement the community relation programs envisaged by Claimant, the Tribunal considers that while concerns regarding recruitment are also reflected in Mr. Zandvliet's trip report, these concerns did not relate specifically to the community relations team but more generally to the workforce of 5,000+ people required for construction. The Tribunal is not convinced that to retain professional community relations personnel would have been significantly more difficult than to retain the various experts and consultants as well as employees that Claimant retained in other areas of the project, including those that have been discussed in detail in this Award. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that recruitment of qualified community relations personnel would have formed a valid basis for an assumption that the project could not obtain and maintain a social license to operate.\n\n1158.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by any of the criticisms raised by Respondent and its expert Dr. Connor regarding alleged shortcomings of the ESIA in terms of assessing the social impacts. In particular, the Tribunal has no basis to assume that a lender would have considered the cost that Claimant contemplated to spend on the community programs it had described insufficient.\n\n1159.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, however, that some of these programs were included only in the revised offer submitted to the GOB in October 2010 and that an amount of USD 100 million was thus apparently not included in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study. As Claimant itself has relied on the additional financial commitments made in the revised offer to demonstrate the adequacy of its community initiatives, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that a buyer would also have factored these additional costs into its valuation of the project.\n\n1160.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to Claimant's submission in its Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, the offer to spend an additional USD 100 million of October 2010 would have increased the amount of USD 406.5 million that Claimant and its owners were prepared to spend at the Feasibility Study stage.1467 In support of its argument that the amount of USD 406.5 million was contemplated already at Feasibility Study stage and thus included in the cost estimates, Claimant referred to its opening statement and the slide in its opening presentation, which in turn refers to the Chapter on Community Relations in the Feasibility Study and the revised offer of October 2010.1468 The Chapter on Community Relations does not, however, provide for a cost estimate of the community relations measures it describes. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the full amount of USD 406.5 million is included in the estimates of the capital costs and operating costs in Chapters 23 and 24 of the Feasibility Study.1469\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 178.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, note 403, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 1), pp. 102-103 *and* Claimant's Opening Presentation, p. 105, *in turn referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-13**, pp. 13-36 to 13-44, and **RE-58(X)(b)**, pp. 68-71.\n\n**Exhibits RE-576-23** and **RE-576-24**.\n\n1161.\n\nIn any event, Claimant itself clearly presented the additional community initiatives outlined in the revised offer as part of the initiatives whose total costs it calculated to be at USD 406.5 million.1470 This confirms the Tribunal's conclusion that the cost estimates of the Feasibility Study did not yet include the additional USD 100 million that Claimant offered to spend in October 2010.\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, p. 105.\n\n1162.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent did not dispute that the amount of USD 406.5 million reflected the cost estimates in the Feasibility Study plus the revised offer of October 2010 but only relied on Dr. Connor's testimony to argue that \"*the contributions and expenditures TCC outlined in slides 104 and 105 of their opening presentation does little to show that TCC understood the social risks, assessed those risks, and properly planned to mitigate those risks*.\"1471 These criticisms have been addressed in detail above. In the absence of a challenge on the total amount presented by Claimant at the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine in further detail whether the amount (except for the additional USD 100 million contained in the revised offer) accurately sums up the various estimates for community relations-related costs in the estimates of capital costs and operating costs.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 218.\n\n**iv. Whether Prof. Davis Has Adequately Accounted for the Costs and Risks Associated with the Environmental and Social Impacts of the Project**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1163.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will now turn to the final question whether Prof. Davis has adequately accounted for the costs and risks associated with the environmental and social impacts of the project.\n\n1164.\n\nThe Tribunal was not convinced by the criticisms raised by Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor regarding the impact assessment that Claimant had made and the measures it had identified to mitigate those impacts. As neither Ms. Filas nor Dr. Connor engaged with the cost estimates in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal also has no reason to doubt that these estimates fully account for the contemplated mitigation measures.\n\n1165.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal recalls Ms. Cessford's testimony regarding expected interactions with the regulatory authority and potential investors, which might have led to additional work and thus additional costs for further studies and/or additional mitigation measures that might have to be included in order to obtain a certain permit or funding. The Tribunal therefore considered it a relevant question whether Claimant and/or Prof. Davis included adequate contingency for such additional costs and possibly also delays in the start of construction.\n\n1166.\n\nMs. Cessford testified that the ESIA team had \"*been scoped to interact with the regulator post-submission*\" and to \"*undertake the feedback stakeholder of consultation*\" in parallel with a Public Hearing. In addition, the team was \"*expecting to have to, as part of our work with the interaction with the stakeholders and the regulators\u2014to possibly have to make amendments to the ESIA*.\" Ms. Cessford further testified that the ESIA team had also \"*been scoped with providing input into TCC's development of their Management Plans*.\" With regard to investors, she stated that the team had only been scoped to produce a \"*Glorified Executive Summary*\" of the ESIA Report, *i.e*., \"*a much longer Executive Summary, suitable for investors that explained the process and the interaction with the project engineers*.\" Ms. Cessford added that while they \"*had not been scoped in this case*,\" based on her experience with other projects, they \"*had expected to have further interactions with any investors, respond to questions, possibly undertake additional studies, such as on issues they raised, and to develop action plans to address any gaps that they might identify that they felt needed further work*.\"1472\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1897 line 16 to p. 1899 line 16.\n\n1167.\n\nBased on Ms. Cessford's testimony, it appears to the Tribunal that while the ESIA team had not yet been specifically scoped for further interactions with potential investors and potential follow-up actions, the ESIA team expected and was prepared for these interactions. The question is whether they were costed.\n\n1168.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, the risk register included, *inter alia*, the following environmental risks: (i) \"*Underestimation of closure cost due to uncertanty in regulatory closure requirements (e.g., pit backfilling requirements)*\"; and (ii) \"*Changes in design criteria necessitated from the output of environmental baseline may result in significant changes in infrastructure designs/layout.*\" For both risks, Claimant has assigned a CAPEX impact of USD 20.6 million and USD 0.7 million (following risk mitigation), respectively.1473 In addition, the risk register also included certain permitting & approval risks, including: (i) \"*Delay in the ESIA approval process caused by ESIA complexity, resulting in a delay of the project*\"; and (ii) \"*Delays in ESIA submittal due to changes in the project description, resulting in a delay of the project*.\" For the first of these risks, Claimant assigned an OPEX impact (following risk mitigation measures aimed at adherence to the relevant guidelines and establishing a relationship with the GOB) of USD 1.0 million.1474 Prof. Davis classified both of these risks as risks that could cause project start-up delay and thereby incorporated them into his estimate of the expected timeframe between completion of the Feasibility Study and start of construction, which will be addressed in more detail below.1475\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**; Davis I, Workpaper 26, p. H-55.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. H-68.\n\n1169.\n\nAs for the environmental risk of additional closure costs, the Tribunal has already concluded above that it has no basis to assume that the quantification of this risk was insufficient. As for the other risks identified by Claimant with regard to the ESIA, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced that Claimant thereby also accounted for the \"*additional studies*\" that Ms. Cessford expected to possibly have to conduct on the ESIA following interactions with potential investors and \"*the action plans to address any gap that* [the potential investors] *might identify that they felt needed further work*.\"1476 However, neither Respondent nor its experts have addressed the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study for ESIA-related measures, nor have they provided the Tribunal with any estimate or range of the cost that would usually be expected for additional work following the initial submission of an ESIA to the regulatory authorities and/or a lender.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 1899 lines 9-16.\n\n1170.\n\nIn the absence of any such figure, the Tribunal sees no basis to conclude that Claimant or Prof. Davis should have incorporated a further cost into the valuation of the Reko Diq project.\n\n1171.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the risk register also included certain community relations risks such as, in particular, the risk of \"*Disruption to construction and operations caused by political and community opposition to the project leading to project delay. This can be related (but not limited to): a) perceived insufficient employment opportunities for Chagai people; b) a perceived lack of contracting opportunities for Chagai vendors and contractors; c) labor conditions during construction d) lay-offs at the end of the construction phase; e) local dependency on the mine at the time of mine closure; f) efforts of 'other companies' to stir up anti-TCC sentiments.*\" This risk was described by Claimant as \"*the key Community Risk \u2013 to be reviewed to include updates. Review further once port risks are better understood*.\" Claimant identified several risk mitigation measures; it did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to this risk.1477 Prof. Davis classified it as \"*not material*\" as it had an impact rating of 3.1478\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. H-66 and Appendix D, p. D-13.\n\n1172.\n\nClaimant further identified the risk of \"*Disaffected communities caused by water shortages or the perceived waste of water for the pipeline-Fan Sediments(Pakistan impact only) resulting in damage to reputation.*\" It stated that \"[t]*he rating of this risk has increased significantly from a D2 due to the inclusion of the slurry pipeline*.\" Claimant identified \"*comprehensive public consultation and stakeholder engagement within the water affected areas*\" as risk mitigation measures; it did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to this risk.1479 Prof. Davis classified it as \"*not material*\" as it had an impact rating of 1.1480 A similar risk was identified for the alternative water sources contemplated for the expansion scenario and qualified as \"*not material*\" as it had an impact rating of 3.1481\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. H-66 and Appendix D, p. D-13.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**; Davis I, Workpaper 27, p. H-66 and Appendix D, p. D-13.\n\n1173.\n\nClaimant also identified the risk of \"*The influx of jobseekers upsets existing social dynamics, causes pressure on already scarce local resources resulting in protest by host communities, especially in Nokkundi.*\" It identified several risk mitigation measures and then assigned a CAPEX impact of USD 0.2 million to this risk, which was also incorporated into Prof. Davis' valuation model.1482\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**; Davis I, Workpaper 26, p. H-53.\n\n1174.\n\nClaimant further pointed to the fact that Prof. Davis had accounted for the risk of events caused by extreme political violence or government action by modeling an annual probability of 0.5% that there would be a permanent shutdown of the mine. The Tribunal has addressed this aspect in detail in its analysis of the security-related risks above.\n\n1175.\n\nAs will be discussed further below, Prof. Davis also accounted for the risk of project delays and the additional costs associated with these delays.\n\n1176.\n\nIn the absence of any opinion provided by Dr. Connor on additional costs that she would have considered necessary to be spent on community relations and also taking into account that the risk register identified the community initiatives contemplated by Claimant as risk mitigation measures, the Tribunal considers it plausible that Prof. Davis has classified the community relations risks set out above as \"*not material*\" and thereby did not model any separate financial impact in this regard. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that as will be discussed below, Prof. Davis assumed in his valuation that substantial delays would be incurred between the completion of the Feasibility Study and the start of construction, which are based on a large dataset of mining companies around the world. In the Tribunal's view, there is no basis to assume that any of the community relations risks would have delayed the project beyond the delays modeled by Prof. Davis.\n\n1177.\n\nAs a final point, the Tribunal recalls that the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study apparently did not include the additional amount of USD 100 million that Claimant proposed to spend in its revised offer of 4 October 2010 and that a buyer would therefore also have factored into its valuation of the project. The Tribunal also sees no indication that Prof. Davis included these additional costs into his valuation model.\n\n1178.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that while it has no basis to assume that Claimant and Prof. Davis did not fully account for the measures and risks that Claimant had identified, a deduction has to be made to account for the additional amount of USD 100 million that Claimant proposed to spend on its Social Investment Program pursuant to its revised offer of 4 October 2010.\n\n**8. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for Obtaining Permits and Land Rights Required for the Project**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1179.\n\nClaimant submits that none of the allegations raised by Respondent with regard to permitting established an impact on the valuation of the project beyond the delays that Prof. Davis has already incorporated into his valuation model. Claimant contends that: (i) it did not experience significant problems securing approvals, licenses or permits for the project; (ii) it took appropriate steps to address future permitting needs; and (iii) in any event, Prof. Davis incorporated longer delays into his model than any of the delays posited by Respondent.1483\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 186, 188.\n\n1180.\n\nClaimant submits that before the GOB decided to unlawfully take over the project in December 2009, Claimant had obtained all permits required for the exploration and feasibility stage and a team of in-house and external local consultants from Hagler Bailly Pakistan had identified the permits and approvals needed to proceed to construction and operation. In Claimant's view, \"*there is every indication that TCC would have been able to secure all necessary permits and authoriziations without any greater delay than Prof. Davis has already modeled*\" if the authorities had continued to cooperate with Claimant in good faith. It further argues that to seek the permits required for operation before obtaining the Mining Lease would have been premature and cost-inefficient.1484\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 731, 741, *referring to* Livesey IX, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42 *and* Livesey V, \u00b6 25.\n\n1181.\n\nClaimant points out that it did not experience any significant difficulties in obtaining permits and approvals over the nearly two decades at Reko Diq until the GOB decided to take over the project in December 2009.1485 In Claimant's view, the examples relied on by Respondent \"*bear little if any resemblance to Reko Diq and the sparsely populated areas which the proposed pipeline would traverse*.\" In particular, Claimant points out that Reko Diq is located in an isolated area with \"*minimal*\" negative interference with local communities. In addition, Claimant considers that when discussing the Reko Diq project, Respondent ignored Balochistan's contractual obligation as Claimant's joint venture partner to assist Claimant in obtaining \"*all leases, licenses, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever*\" that were required for the project.1486\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 732.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 189-190 lit. a, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 944, 947; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 733-734, 736, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1**, clauses 7.2(a) and 24.6.2.\n\n1182.\n\nClaimant also emphasizes that Respondent has not referred to any permitting problems experienced by other mining projects in Balochistan and refused to produce documents that would disclose any such problems experienced by other projects.1487 In its view, Respondent's reference to Pakistan's ranking for ease of doing business is irrelevant given that: (i) \"*industry practice shows that mining companies operate successfully in many jurisdictions that have a lower ranking than Pakistan,*\" such as the Central African Republic, Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Afghanistan and Iran; and (ii) Barrick had experience in operating in jurisdictions with \"*similarly challenging business environments*,\" such as Dominican Republic, Zambia, Papua New Guinea and Argentina.1488\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 743.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 744-746.\n\n1183.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the land acquisition for the slurry pipeline, Claimant refers to the oral testimony of Respondent's expert Mr. Rahman in which he acknowledged that he was not aware that the pipeline route was specifically designed to avoid populated areas or that earlier public interest litigation involving Reko Diq had been \"*speedily resolved*\" with the assistance of the GOB and that he had not considered the potential value increase of the owners' remaining land as an incentive to support the project.1489\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 lit. b, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2103-2107, 2087, 2092-2094.\n\n1184.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's reference to a pending litigation between Claimant and Benway Corp., Claimant contends that it is unrelated and in any event \"*well-settled Pakistani law that pending litigation does not bar the alienation of immovable property rights.*\"1490 Claimant further argues that Respondent and Mr. Rahman failed to mention the special procedure under the Land Acquisition Act under which land can be acquired on an urgent basis, \"*eliminating almost all the delays and litigation Pakistan claims TCC would have faced*.\" Specifically, Claimant refers to Section 17 which provides the Federal Government with full discretion to take possession of land \"*free from all encumbrances*\" after only 15 days' notice, with interested litigants having to \"*vie for the deposited funds afterwards*.\"1491\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 742 lit. f, *referring to Ahsan Corporation Karachi v. Chairman, Evacuee Trust Property Board*, PLD 1973 Kar. 403 [CA-430], p. 407 (Ebrahim, J.).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 191, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1723**, Section 17(1) (admitted *de bene esse*).\n\n1185.\n\nAs for the alleged water-related disputes, Claimant notes that it had obtained all necessary authorizations for the Fan Sediments and adds that they were chosen because there were no competing users and there would therefore be no expectation of extensive public comment. Claimant further submits that the pipeline was designed to go under riverbeds and would therefore not impact them, and Mr. Mayer confirmed that Claimant had the required permits and also planned on keeping No-Objection Certificates (NOCs). Claimant also submits that the expiry of an NOC during the PSI field study for the pipeline did not impact the survey as it was renewed within four days.1492\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 lit. c and d; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 734, 742 lit. b and c.\n\n1186.\n\nWith regard to alleged permitting issues at Port Gwadar associated with the port operator, Claimant refers to \"*multiple trade-off studies concerning the port*\" and \"*positive responses to preliminary inquiries into acquiring the necessary land*.\" Claimant notes that Respondent failed to identify any permit or authorization that Claimant should have had as of the valuation date and further points to the fact that in 2013, Pakistan signed a 40-year concession contract with a new operator and the port is now operating normally.1493\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 lit. e, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-22.05**, p. 5, **RE-576-9**, p. 9-58 and **CE-1318**, Livesey V, \u00b6 26 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), pp. 356-357; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 742 lit. e, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1408, CE-1474** *and* **CE-1462**.\n\n1187.\n\nClaimant also points out that by contrast to a difficulty of the Duddar project in relocating a small village, it had already secured voluntary relocation from all inhabitants of the Siah Reg village.1494\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 lit. f.\n\n1188.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent ignored the iterative nature of the permitting process by continuing to rely on the Draft Permits Register even though Claimant had: (i) submitted later versions of the Register which addressed topics that Respondent claimed were overlooked; and (ii) referred to other chapters and appendices of the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study as well as other documents which contained \"*substantial additional information and analyses concerning permitting*.\"1495 In particular, Claimant notes that both Studies dedicated entire chapters to permitting, which confirm, in its view, that its team was well acquainted with Pakistani and Baloch bureaucracy and drew on its previous experience with the Tanjeel project to determine appropriate assumptions on the scheduling of other environmental permits.1496\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 192, *comparing* **Exhibit CE-1386** *with* Respondent's Opening Presentation, p. 91 *and referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-3**, pp. 3-14 to 3-15, **RE-576-12**, **RE-577-12, RE-576-32**, p. 32-19, **RE-576-22.01, CE-1381, CE-1384** *and* **CE-1385**.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 737-738, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-12**, pp. 12-2 to 12-4, 12-6, *and* **RE-577-12**, pp. 12-3 to 12-5.\n\n1189.\n\nClaimant also notes that the Draft Permit Register \"*carefully mapped*\" all necessary permits and identified the competent authority, applicable legislation, submission procedure, date by which the permit would be needed, estimate time for approval, validity period, and other relevant information. Claimant describes it as a \"*live working document*\" which would continue to be updated during the project and was in fact updated until 2011 when the Mining Lease Application was denied.1497\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 739-740, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-576-22.05**, **RE-576-12**, p. 12-15 *and* **CE-1386**.\n\n1190.\n\nIn any event, Claimant contends that even if Respondent's allegations were true, it did not show that the alleged difficulties would have been insurmountable, that they would have deterred potential investors, or that they would have substantially affected the viability or value of the project.1498 It emphasizes that Prof. Davis has incorporated into his model \"*long delays to capture the potential advserse effects of any permitting challenges,*\" *i.e*., an average delay of over two years before the start of construction, which reduced the estimated value of the project by approximately USD 1.3 billion.1499\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 729.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 186, 188, 193-194, *referring to* Davis Presentation, p. 3, Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2351-2352, Davis I \u00b6\u00b6 192-193 and pp. D-16 to D-22, *and* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 164, 167-171.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1191.\n\nRespondent submits that any forward-looking valuation methodology to be accepted by an arbitral tribunal requires the entity to show that it had the necessary permits. By contrast, Respondent claims that \"*TCC did not even know all of the permits it needed, did not appreciate the practical difficulties of operating in Balochistan, and failed to account for the specific difficulties of getting permits for the project*.\"1500\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 256; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 350.\n\n1192.\n\nRespondent notes that from 2006 to 2011, Pakistan \"*slid down the rankings for ease of doing business*\" and adds that while Balochistan's capital city, Quetta, \"*remained near the bottom*,\" the situation in rural areas was worse. Specifically, Respondent refers to unclear processes for obtaining permits and \"*a web of regulatory agencies and an array of permits at all different levels*\" as well as to the involvement of numerous public hearings and \"*protracted public interest litigation*.\" Referring to its expert Mr. Rahman, Respondent contends that \"*one of the biggest delays*\" would be land acquisition, which can take \"*years, even decades*.\"1501\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 390-391, *referring to* Rahman I, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 28(ii).\n\n1193.\n\nRespondent points out that land acquisition \"*is completely absent in the Permits Register*\" and argues that there is no indication how Claimant intended to address this issue for the slurry and water pipelines or who were in fact the title holders of the lands. In Respondent's view, Claimant provided only \"*a general overview of land rights and the Land Acquisition Act with no plan for implementation*.\" According to Respondent, this is insufficient, taking into account that: (i) 50-70 tribes can be found along the pipeline route; (ii) there are no land records for 90% of the land in Balochistan which means that \"*hundreds of people can assert claims to the same land*\"; and (iii) a \"*lengthy administrative and public process \u2026 must be undergone to get approvals*.\"1502\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 259, 268, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-3**, pp. 3-14 to 3-15, Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2081 lines 9-14 and p. 2082 line 19 to p. 2083 line 3 and lines 11-17, *and* Owen Trip Report, pp. 4, 8; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 352, *referring to* Rahman II, p. 3.\n\n1194.\n\nRespondent also points to \"*lengthy court battles*\" on \"*these issues*\" and maintains that regardless of the width of the land that Claimant planned to acquire, it would have to undergo the land acquisition process described by Mr. Rahman.1503 Respondent emphasizes that Claimant was involved in many litigations regarding Reko Diq, including almost seven years of litigation regarding the validity of the CHEJVA, petitions filed to enjoin the Governments from issuing a mining lease to Claimant, petitions filed by the Watan party and the Sanjrani tribe in November 2010 and January 2011 as well as still pending litigation filed by Benway against Claimant in 2008 regarding an alleged infringement of its rights over Exploration License EL-24.1504 With regard to the latter litigation, Respondent submits that the company had sued Claimant to invalidate Claimant's surface rights and argues that Claimant could therefore not have transferred the surface rights to a third party without a risk of litigation impeding the plans for Reko Diq. In any event, Respondent considers that while surface rights \"*may have some effect at that time*,\" they do not convey ownership but a claim to ownership.1505\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 268, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2080 lines 18-20 *and* p. 2083 lines 4-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 270, *referring to* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 554, 497, 499 *and* **Exhibits RE-18, CE-173. CE-268**, p. 9 *and* **RE-562**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 401-402, *referring to* **Exhibits RE-561** *and* **RE-562**.\n\n1195.\n\nRespondent further relies on Mr. Rahman's opinion that while there are also permitting issues and significant delays in urban areas, the framework in the remote parts of Balochistan is different as there is no accurate record-keeping, inter-tribal rivalries can frustrate the process of acquiring permits and the exploitation of natural resources can quickly become existential threats and trigger a backlash. In Respondent's view, this is confirmed by previous hunger strikes at Reko Diq, a \"*shutter down*\" among merchants in Nok Kundi, the concerns raised by people in the communities along the pipeline route and the protests at Gwadar.1506\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 355-356, *referring to* Rahman II, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11-12.\n\n1196.\n\nRespondent submits that a site visit of the pipeline route revealed that certain portions that PSI could not map were riverbeds but Claimant failed to describe the process of seeking permits in a riverbed or drainage. According to Respondent, it is \"*highly unlikely that TCC could have rapidly received a permit to run a pipeline of toxic sludge through a riverbed that provides some of the only water for miles around*.\" Given the scarcity of water in Balochistan, Respondent claims that the opposition to a slurry pipeline in riverbed would have been \"*massive*.\"1507\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 353-354, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-750** *and* Rahman I, p. 20\n\n1197.\n\nRespondent further refers to Mr. Rahman who identified numerous permits and approvals that Claimant had failed to identify, including for the construction and operation of an oil storage facility, for coastal and marine security, for the railway, and for construction in a canal or drainage. Respondent also refers to the \"*largely blank*\" section of the Permits Register dealing with Port Gwadar, the \"*secret sludge dump*,\" increased pollution at the mine site and the planned discharge into the Arabian Sea.1508 Respondent contends that Claimant failed to address in its Permit Register the treatment and disposal of sludge, acquisition of the water rights required to ensure the viability of the project, and land acquisition for the construction and erection of the pipeline.1509\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 257; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 351-352, *referring to* Rahman I, pp. 30, 23, 21 and 20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 260, *referring to* Rahman Presentation, p. 9.\n\n1198.\n\nSpecifically with regard to water rights, Respondent notes that Claimant acknowledged a \"*high risk for permitting and approvals regarding water rights*\" given that it stated in the Feasibility Study that \"*draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project needs \u2013 caused by current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to use water (quantity and duration), which results in the need to develop alternative sources*.\"1510 Respondent further notes that Claimant's risk mitigation strategy involved addressing the issue in the Mineral Agreement and obtaining support from the GOB and emphasizes that: (i) the risk still had a residual risk rating of M10, meaning a \"*likely*\" likelihood rating and an impact of 3; and (ii) the risk of not reaching a Mineral Agreement was ranked even higher.1511\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 392, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-30**, p. 30-13 *and referring to* **Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 393, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-30**, pp. 30-8, 30-13.\n\n1199.\n\nRespondent submits that in order to obtain a permit for extracting ground water, prior permission must be sought from the District Water Committee, which invites interested stakeholders to submit objections and may then grant the permit \"*subject to any conditions it deems necessary*\" or \"*flatly reject the application*\"; any aggrieved party can file an appeal against the decision. Respondent adds that there is no provision under the law providing for \"*exclusive*\" water rights and a permit is subject to a specified timeframe.1512 According to Respondent, the 2014 Balochistan Ground Water Rights Administration Rules grant discretionary power to manage groundwater sources even after a permit has been granted and refers to several provisions granting the Provincial Water Authority the authority to suspend or even cancel a permit.1513\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 395-396.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 397, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-612**, rules 33, 35, 37, 40.\n\n1200.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant claims to have broad water extraction rights not only with regard to the Fan Sediments but also for three other areas but emphasizes that the permit relating to these other areas covered only the exploratory phase as it was restricted to tubewells. In Respondent's view, it is unclear whether this permit would have to be renewed once the Mining Lease had been granted. As for No-Objection Certificates relied on by Claimant, Respondent notes that an NOC \"*creates some rights*\" but does not convey ownership.1514\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 399-400, 402, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-313**.\n\n1201.\n\nMore generally, Respondent refers to Mr. Rahman's opinion that Claimant's time estimations for the permits listed \"*are very na\u00efve*\" and the Permits Register lacked sufficient information in particular on the permits required for the construction of the pipeline.1515 Respondent emphasizes that Claimant was planning to commence construction in September 2011 and maintains that it \"*had not meaningfully begun the permitting process*.\" According to Respondent, the Permits Register was missing \"*basic information that TCC should have confirmed well in advance of project implementation*\" and Claimant therefore failed to show that it was ready to execute the project.1516\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 260, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2077 lines 13-14 *and referring to* **Exhibit RE-22.05**, p. TCCA-42455.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 261.\n\n1202.\n\nRespondent argues that the \"*real-life examples*\" utilized by Mr. Rahman demonstrate the obstacles faced by infrastructure projects in Pakistan which in some cases caused the projects to be suspended or completely abandoned or stalled for \"*years on end*.\"1517 Respondent notes that Claimant did not rebut these assertions, nor did it present its own expert of permitting issues in Balochistan, but only pointed to the delay incorporated into Prof. Davis' model. In this regard, Respondent submits that Prof. Davis based his calculation on data for mines located in jurisdictions in low threat environments or with highly developed mining industries and infrastructure such as Chile and therefore considers this data not sufficiently representative to calculate the expected delay that may occur in Balochistan. Respondent further claims that Prof. Davis ignored delays that Claimant had already experienced and notes that \"*the PSI team lost almost half of the planned days of fieldwork due to permitting issues*.\"1518\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 262, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2080 lines 7-11 *and referring to* Rahman I, p. 3 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2086 lines 7-22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 263-264, *referring to* Davis I, Appendix D and Workpaper 28, *and* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, pp. 17-20.\n\n1203.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimant and Prof. Davis failed to account for potential additional costs caused by \"*conditions to the permits or other mitigating factors*\" in light of stakeholder objections.1519\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 265.\n\n1204.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Balochistan was not under a contractual obligation to issue permits and approvals and, in any event, its alleged obligation to provide administrative assistance did not guarantee that Claimant would face no delays or obtain the necessary approvals, given that even \"*national emergency projects*\" face delays or stalling. Respondent notes that the types of approval and permits required for mining operations would have: (i) required public consultation; (ii) involved different stakeholders; and (iii) to be issued by both provincial and federal governments.1520 Respondent emphasizes that Government-owned projects were specifically targets of insurgents and outside forces and notes that the GOB could not have prevented people from protesting or making competing claims to the same piece of land. In addition, Respondent refers to delays already incurred by the PSI team regarding NOCs and points to the Tribunal's finding that Claimant had obtained prior approvals such as visa for its employees through a bribery scheme.1521\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 266, 269, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2087 lines 17-19.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 266, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, pp. 17-20 *and* Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons), \u00b6 1314; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 357-359.\n\n1205.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reliance on the lack of prior permitting problems, Respondent argues that the prior process is \"*a poor proxy to understand the issues in 2011*\" as Claimant's prior exploratory work had had a \"*much lesser impact on the community and environment and was not significantly intrusive enough to raise much objection*\" and claims that permitting for large-scale mining operations that would \"*stretch the length of the province, affect all nearby communities, pollute the air and ocean, and deplete precious scarce water resources would have resulted in much higher scrutiny by GoB and community stakeholders during the required public consultations.*\" In particular, Respondent refers to the introduction of a slurry pipeline ending at Port Gwadar, which opened \"*a new world of permitting requirements,*\" and new tensions at Nok Kundi and Gwadar, which would have made the permitting process more difficult.1522\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 267, *referring to* Rahman II, p. 4; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 357.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1206.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal takes note of Respondent's submission that \"[a]*ny damages valuation that relies on a forward-looking methodology must be able to show that the entity had the necessary permits.*\"1523 It also argues that \"[n]*umerous tribunals have recognized that the absence of government approvals can keep a project from a forward-looking, income-based valuation*\" and generally refers to its submissions on why it considers a DCF valuation and in particular the Modern DCF methodology applied by Prof. Davis inappropriate.1524\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 256.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 350.\n\n1207.\n\nThe Tribunal has addressed the Parties' arguments regarding the valuation methodology to be applied in this case in detail above and has reached the conclusion that in the particular circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to determine the value of Claimant's investment by using a DCF method and, more specifically, by using the modern DCF approach presented by Claimant and its expert Prof. Davis. In its analysis, the Tribunal has taken into account the development stage of the Reko Diq project, including the fact that it had not yet received all necessary permits and approvals to commence mining operations.\n\n1208.\n\nConsequently, and while it does not wish to make a generalized statement on this matter, the Tribunal also considers that in the circumstances of the present case, Claimant does not have to show that it already \"*had the necessary permits*\" in order for Prof. Davis' methodology to be applicable. Claimant rather has to establish that it was prepared for what a buyer would have expected when purchasing a project at the development stage of Reko Diq, *i.e*., that relevant permits and approvals had either already been obtained or that Claimant had a reasonable plan and schedule to obtain them in time for the project to start construction and, subsequently, mining operations.\n\n1209.\n\nIn addition, and while it has not yet assessed whether the delays modeled by Prof. Davis are adequate, the Tribunal agrees with the general approach that any risk associated with relevant permits or approvals not being obtained in time to commence construction and/or mining operations on schedule would be factored into the valuation by modeling expected or potential delays in the start of construction or mining operations. In the Tribunal's view, the viability of the project could be affected only if there are specific indications supported by concrete evidence that a certain permit or approval could not be obtained or at least could not be obtained within an economically reasonable timeframe.\n\n1210.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not identified a specific permit or approval, which Claimant had not yet obtained but which a buyer would have expected to be already obtained at the valuation date. Respondent notes that as per the ESIA, Claimant was planning to commence construction in September 2011 and claims that \"*TCC had not yet meaningfully begun the permitting process*.\"1525 It does not, however, state which specific permit Claimant should have already obtained or applied for at the valuation date (in addition to the Mining Lease for which TCCP applied in February 2011) in order to commence construction of the project as contemplated. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that while the ESIA provides for the start of construction in general in September 2011, it also provides for subsequent dates at which construction was to start for: (i) the plant and concentration transportation facilites (May 2012); and (ii) port infrastructure (October 2012). Mechanical completion of the mine was scheduled to occur in December 2014.1526 The Tribunal therefore agrees with Claimant that \"[t]*o seek the permits needed to operate the mine, before TCC obtained the Mining Lease, would have been premature and cost-inefficient, and a third-party investor would not have expected TCC to have do so prior to the Valuation Date*.\"1527\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 261.\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, Table 1.2.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 741.\n\n1211.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the pipeline, Respondent raises concerns with regard to the acquisition of land which would necessarily have to precede the construction of the pipeline. As Respondent claims that \"[l]*and acquisition can take years, even decades*,\"1528 this implies the argument that a buyer would have expected Claimant to have already started the process of acquiring the land for the pipeline at the valuation date. Therefore, the Tribunal will address this issue first before turning to the Parties' submissions on other permits and approvals for the project.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\n\n**i. Whether Claimant Had a Feasible Plan for the Acquisition of Land, in Particular for the Pipeline to Port Gwadar**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1212.\n\nIn support of its argument on land acquisition, Respondent relies on the opinion of its expert Mr. Rahman who explained in his first expert report the procedure for the acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and, based on his knowledge and experience, stated that \"*land acquisition has been a significant hurdle in pipeline projects in Pakistan*.\" Noting that the slurry pipeline would go through several districts and would therefore require approval from different Revenue Officials in each district, Mr. Rahman considered it \"*difficult to say how long it would take to acquire the land and upon what conditions, specifically keeping mind local community resistance and potential objections/litigation on the basis,* inter alia*, of land ownership or compensation related disputes*.\" He noted that the had worked on pipeline projects \"*where land acquisition has taken as long as 18 months*\" and expressed the opinion that it would have taken \"*considerably longer*\" for the slurry pipeline \"*since this was a private party acquiring land, which involves extra difficulties, and the land acquisition was in Balochistan with all the challenges facing projects in the said province*.\" Mr. Rahman added that he was not aware of any pipeline of the nature that Claimant proposed having been laid by a private party in Pakistan.1529\n\nRahman I, pp. 19-20.\n\n1213.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Rahman specified that he considered the public objections phase the most critical aspect, because \"*not only is the local populace and generally the Pakistani public hostile to the Reko Diq project, but there are practical difficulties that will arise during the public consultations phase or otherwise*.\" In particular, Mr. Rahman referred to the absence of land records for most of the land in Balochistan, which he considered to be \"*particularly problematic for the land acquisition procedure because there are several nomadic tribes living in the vast areas between Reko Diq and the Balochistan coast \u2026, who can claim ownership of the land and raise objections to its acquisition for the purposes of the Reko Diq project*.\" He added that \"[a]*ny forcible construction of the pipeline in such areas would have most likely led to some form of conflict with local tribes, which potentially could have turned violent*.\" Mr. Rahman further expressed the opinion that the involvement of government departments or security forces would not necessarily make land acquisition easier and refers to an example in which 13,500 acres of land in Balochistan were acquired by the Pakistan Navy which \"*led to several protests and public displays of anger*.\" Mr. Rahmen further considered that any problem associated with the acquisition of land \"*would have been multiplied by the amount of land that would have been needed to be acquired for the construction of the slurry pipeline*.\"1530\n\nRahman II, pp. 2-3.\n\n1214.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Claimant's reliance on the participation of the GOB in the project, Mr. Rahman reiterated \"*the problems faced by other government agencies*\" and \"*the dismal state of the land ownership record in Balochistan*\" as a result of which Claimant \"*could have potentially been tied up in continuous litigation thereby impeding any progress on the project for several years*.\"1531 More generally, Mr. Rahman emphasized that \"*government involvement cannot stop the public from raising objections against the project or initiating legal proceedings against it in court*.\" Referring to projects in rural areas which are part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and supported by the GOP and Pakistan Army but \"*face numerous practical and legal issues*,\" Mr. Rahman considers it \"*a fallacy to assume that government support ensures a quick and smooth permitting and approval process*.\"1532\n\nRahman II, \u00b6 4.\n\nRahman II, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n1215.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rahman again expressed the opinion that \"*land acquisition is particularly challenging*\" and further that \"*TCC was not prepared for it.*\"1533 He specified that he considered \"[a]*ny land acquisition in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan, \u2026 challenging*\" and clarified that he was primarily referring to the slurry pipeline because \"*it's a huge land acquisition, and it's not mentioned*.\"1534 Mr. Rahman noted that \"[t]*he Permits Register does not identify land acquisition as something that needs to be done for a 700-kilometer pipeline\u2014almost*,\" which in his opinion was \"*a glaring omission.*\"1535 He illustrated the land acquisition process as follows:1536\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2078 lines 6-8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2095 lines 11-20.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2081 lines 10-13.\n\nRahman Presentation, p. 10.\n\n1216.\n\nMr. Rahman highlighted the hearing of objections before the land acquisition collector who \"*has to hear everybody*\" as well as the notice, which has to be made \"*to the interested people whose land it is*\" and who are then invited to speak. According to Mr. Rahman, the award \"*is often challenged before the courts*,\" which further \"*often grant injunctions as to the acquisition during the pendency of the litigation*.\" He therefore expressed the opinion that \"[l]*and acquisition is an extremely lengthy process in Pakistan, and land litigation is very lengthy. So, these things can stall, or even scrap, projects*.\"1537\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2082 lines 4-18.\n\n1217.\n\nMr. Rahman noted that in the case of the pipeline, Claimant needed to acquire land in multiple districts in each of which it would have to complete the entire process. Mr. Rahman further referred to inefficient bureaucracy, manual measuring of the land, which \"[t]*akes forever*,\" and the absence of land records which made it \"*hard to establish who the land belongs to, who the affected Parties are who need to be compensated.*\" He further testified that these parties, even if compensated, would \"*often rush to the civil court, and \u2026 get an injunction, which stalls things for ages*.\" In his opinion, \"*it's likely that there will be litigation where there is land acquisition in Pakistan. It's well-known, well-documented that land-related litigation can last very many years*.\"1538\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2082 line 19 to p. 2084 line 6.\n\n1218.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that even though Mr. Rahman testified at the Hearing on Quantum that he considered \"[a]*ny land acquisition in Pakistan*\" challenging, both his expert reports and presentation at the Hearing and the Parties' submissions regarding land acquisition were focused on the area needed for the slurry pipeline from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar. In addition, and while Mr. Rahman explained his focus on the pipeline by referring to it as \"*a huge land acquisition*\" and emphasizing that land acquisition for the pipeline was not addressed in the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study, there has been no specific challenge by Respondent or Mr. Rahman that Claimant did not have the necessary land rights over the mine site itself.\n\n1219.\n\nAs noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, it is established by the record that Claimant had obtained a Surface Rights Lease over an area of 144,568 acres in February 2008 at an amount of 5,000 Pakistani rupees per acre, which covered the mine as well as the additional infrastructure assets to be built on site. The Surface Rights Lease was expressly granted \"*initially for a period of 30 years extendable for another period*.\"1539 Respondent initially argued that \"[t]*here is no precedent for* 'surface rights' *as proposed by TCC*,\" and that \"*while those rights may have some effect at that time, they would not have held sufficient backing in the law to truly pass as anything more than a* 'quit claim' *deed of sorts, not actual ownership but a claim to ownership*.\"1540 Claimant's Surface Rights Lease was not addressed by Mr. Rahman, however, and Respondent did not provide any further detail or support for this argument in its subsequent submissions. Against this background, the Tribunal has no basis to assume that the rights over the land at the central mine facilities that Claimant had obtained through the Surface Rights Lease would have given a buyer cause for concern.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 391; **Exhibits CE-43**, **CE-66**, **CE-182**, pp. 8-9, **CE-220** and **CE-221**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 402.\n\n1220.\n\nAs for the land acquisition regarding the pipeline, it is undisputed between the Parties that as of the valuation date, Claimant had not yet obtained or started the process of obtaining land rights. There is further common ground that the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study did not make reference to the acquisition of land for the pipeline.1541 Claimant has pointed out, however, that it continued to update the Draft Permit Register after delivery of the Feasibility Study and has submitted a version dated December 2011.1542\n\n*Cf*. **Exhibit RE-576-22.05**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1386**.\n\n1221.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the version appended to the Feasibility Study did not include land acquisition as a separate item for any of the off-site facilities, the updated version of December 2011 did contain an item \"*Land acquisition*\" and makes explicit reference to the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 for the construction of: (i) the off-site access road; (ii) certain early works site services; (iii) the water supply pipeline; (iv) plant site-site preparation; (v) preliminary road construction to access the site and lay-down area; and (vi) the supply and installation of water and sewer lines.1543 This version of the Draft Permit Register does not contain the permits required for the slurry pipeline. It further appears from a report on the Monthly Progress on Permitting Assignment for the Reko Diq project also dated December 2011 that Claimant had not specifically added an item on land acquisition to the permits required for the pipeline.1544 However, even if there was an omission at this point, it is apparent that Claimant was aware of the Land Acquisition Act and its requirements for the acquisition of land for the off-site facilities. The Register dated December 2011 also includes a note with regard to all items listed above that \"[a]*lthough the Act does not apply on private land if acquired directly from the owner, however it is recommended to involve the Revenue Department to avoid any unforseen complexities in future*.\"1545\n\n**Exhibit CE-1386**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1385**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1386**.\n\n1222.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, Chapter 3 of the Feasibility Study on Legal and Title further provides a description regarding the right of a mineral right holder to use the lands and states that pursuant to rule 23 of the 2002 BM Rules, \"*the right of licensee to enter and occupy the land which comprises the exploration area is subject to the rights of the surface holders and a mineral right holder would be required to either directly acquire private owned land through negotiations with the owners, or in the case of Government owned land to obtain the relevant Government's permission to use the land*.\" It is further noted that the rights of the surface holder are \"*protected either through Government intervention in stopping operations or through the payment of compensation not only for the land but for buildings, crops, etc*.\"1546 It is then stated:\n\n\"*In many cases the use of surface rights is negotiated directly with the landowners without intervention of the Government. However, in the case of difficult land owners, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are often invoked.*\n\n*Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the Provincial Government can acquire land from private parties for* 'public purposes' *or for a company. A landowner can object to the acquisition process, but the nature of the objections that can be raised has not been specified. The Government is required to determine compensation and this determination is subject to challenge on the ground that the Government determination was not based on market price. The decision of the Court does not affect the transfer of land under the land acquisition proceedings, but renders the acquirer to pay the compensation*.\"1547\n\n**Exhibit RE-60**, pp. 3-14 to 3-15.\n\n**Exhibit RE-60**, p. 3-15.\n\n1223.\n\nFollowing further information on the payment of annual rent by the mineral title holder and the requirement of a written and registered deed as valid title, the following is noted:\n\n\"*TCCP has been granted surface rights by the Government of Balochistan over 585.05 km\u00b2 of land situated in Mouza Koh-Sultan, Tehsil Nok Kundi District Chagai for a period of 30 years extendable for a further period. TCCP has also been granted surface rights by the Board of Revenue, Balochistan over 750.0 acres of land for construction of air strip for a period of 30 years and surface rights over 9 333.3 acres in Tahlab area for installation of tube wells and laying of pipelines*.\"1548\n\n**Exhibit RE-60**, p. 3-15.\n\n1224.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant thereby \"*simply provided a general overview of land rights and the Land Acquisition Act with no plan for implementation*.\"1549 The Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that this chapter does not make reference to land acquisition specifically for the slurry pipeline nor does it set out when Claimant planned to acquire the land. However, it is clearly stated that in the event of \"*difficult land owners*,\" Claimant would proceed under the Land Acquisition Act pursuant to which \"*the Provincial Government can acquire land from private parties for* 'public purposes' *or for a company.*\" The Tribunal also notes that Respondent did not specifically challenge the statement in Chapter 3 that, while the landowner could object to the acquisition process, it could not prevent the transfer of land but only challenge the compensation to be determined by the Government: \"*The decision of the Court does not affect the transfer of land under the land acquisition proceedings, but renders the acquirer to pay the compensation*.\"1550\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 259.\n\n**Exhibit RE-60**, p. 3-15.\n\n1225.\n\nContrary to this statement, Mr. Rahman testified at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*courts often grant injunctions as to the acquisition during the pendency of the litigation*\" and that this could \"*stall, or even scrap, projects*.\" Mr. Rahman specifically stated that even if compensation was paid to the land owners, \"*they often rush to the civil court, and \u2026, get an injunction, which stalls things for ages*.\"1551 However, the Tribunal also notes that Mr. Rahman did not make any reference to injunctions in either of his expert reports. He also did not provide any authority in support of his opinion, including in its Presentation at the Hearing on Quantum, and did not state that any of the projects he described as being \"*stalled*\" was subject to an injunction legally preventing the acquisition of land.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2082 lines 14-18; p. 2083 line 21 to p. 2084 line 2.\n\n1226.\n\nBy contrast, Claimant contends that \"[i]*t is well-settled Pakistani law that pending litigation does not bar the alienation of immovable property rights*\" and refers to a decision of the Karachi High Court in *Ahsan Corporation v. Chairman, Evacuee Trust Property Board* in support of its position.1552 The Tribunal does not have to make a finding whether Claimant's reference to \"*well-settled Pakistani law*\" is accurate. In any event, the Tribunal has not been pointed to any legal authority to the contrary or any support for Mr. Rahman's opinion that the land acquisition could be prevented or stalled by pending litigation.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 742 lit. f, refer *ring to Ahsan Corporation Karachi v. Chairman, Evacuee Trust Property Board*, PLD 1973 Kar. 403 [CA-430], p. 407 (Ebrahim, J.).\n\n1227.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that the information included by Claimant in the Feasibility Study demonstrated an insufficient understanding of the land acquisition process and/or specifically the impact of litigation on the act of acquiring the land in Pakistan. While Mr. Rahman reiterated that he was personally involved in projects where \"*two or three people have stalled a very large Project because of land acquisition,*\"1553 in neither of the examples he presented does the acquiring party appear to actually have been legally prevented from acquiring the land. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Rahman's references to the likelihood of there being litigation and what he characterized as \"*massive, massive delays in litigation in Pakistan generally*\"1554 are not sufficient to assume that litigation would have legally impacted Claimant's ability to proceed with the project.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2107 lines 6-9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2094 lines 7-8.\n\n1228.\n\nMr. Rahman further pointed to certain particularities in Balochistan, such as the absence of land records for considerable parts of the land and the existence of nomad tribes, which would make it difficult to identify previous landowners who would be entitled to compensation, as well as inefficient bureaucracy of Balochistan authorities. This general description of the situation in Balochistan appears to be largely undisputed by Claimant and the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Mr. Rahman to the extent that it would therefore be reasonable to expect certain delays also in the acquisition of land. However, as pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis has already accounted for certain delays in his valuation model and the question must therefore be whether any of the concerns raised by Mr. Rahman would have given a buyer reason to expect longer delays than those accounted for by Prof. Davis.\n\n1229.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal considers it important to recall that the Government of Balochistan was not only a regulatory authority in this case but was rather Claimant's joint venture partner under the CHEJVA. Pursuant to Clause 7.2(a) of the CHEJVA, it was to provide at it own expense, *inter alia*, \"*appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of all leases, licences, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.*\"1555 Pursuant to Clause 5.7.2 of the CHEJVA, the GOB was further responsible for \"*liaising with relevant Provincial Government and local government authorities and with affected landholders to ensure that good relations are maintained between the Joint Venture and other persons during the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.*\"1556 More generally, Clause 24.6.2 of the CHEJVA provides that \"[t]*he Parties shall be just and faithful to one another and will not do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture contemplated herein as a whole are prejudiced*\" and Clause 24.6.3 provides that \"[e]*ach Party shall execute all necessary additional documents and do all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of this Agreement.*\"1557\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 7.2(a).\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 5.7.2.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3.\n\n1230.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal found that pursuant to these provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole, *i.e.*, to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Diq. The Tribunal further noted that there was no dispute between the Parties that the GOB indeed provided this support for, and thus facilitated, Claimant's investment over a period of many years, *inter alia*, by defending the validity of the CHEJVA before the Balochistan High Court in 2007.1558 The same applies to the GOP, which also supported and facilitated Claimant's investment, including by a submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court in 2010, which concerned the same proceeding regarding the validity of the CHEJVA.1559 Based on its analysis of the contractual framework as well as the regulatory framework and the conduct of the GOB and the GOP during the period in which Claimant explored the area at Reko Diq, the Tribunal concluded that Respondent had created the legitimate expectation that: (i) Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon submission of an application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules; and (ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate Claimant's investment.1560\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 947, 953; **Exhibit CE-212**.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 954; **Exhibit CE-264**.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 958.\n\n1231.\n\nWhile Mr. Rahman confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that he was aware of the GOB's contractual obligation to provide support for Claimant in obtaining permits, he noted that \"[s]*uch an ambitious project on this scale in Balochistan has never been contemplated*\" and expressed the opinion that the Government's support would not have sufficed to make permitting \"*a smooth process.*\" He also testified that Balochistan is \"*particularly hostile to foreign an Government projects*\" and that, therefore, \"*cooperation would not really have been part of the picture for this Project and permitting, land acquisition.*\" In support of his opinion, Mr. Rahman referred to the examples he had presented on stalled projects as well as to \"*a lot of testimony* [that] *has been heard to that effect over here*.\"1561\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2087 lines 9-15; p. 2088 lines 14-19.\n\n1232.\n\nIn terms of examples, Mr. Rahman pointed to two CPEC projects for a hydropower station and a dam both of which he described as \"*stalled because of land acquisition issues*\" and referred to \"*many examples of land projects stalled due to land acquisition in Pakistan*\" included in his expert reports. He then specified that: (i) a \"*telecom giant*\" had \"*major issues in acquiring land in Balochistan for its* [broadcast] *tower sites because of inefficient bureaucracy*;\" (ii) \"*another mining company has had major issues with the Government of Balochistan because of land acquisition and people who are unhappy and protesting*\"; (iii) an express motorway was \"*completely stalled because the Court intervened and scrapped the Project because the land acquisition was not done in a proper manner*\"; (iv) the Pakistan Navy's acquisition of 13,500 acres was \"*brought into question, intense protests*.\"1562\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2084 line 20 to p. 2086 line 14. *See also* Rahman Presentation, pp. 16-17.\n\n1233.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that most of these examples are sufficiently comparable to the Reko Diq project when it comes to the impact that land acquisition for the pipeline would have had on the communities. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow the argument that it can be concluded from protests against a hydropower station and a dam, broadcast tower sites or an elevated express motorway in Lahore that there would be the same level of protest against a pipeline buried in the ground.\n\n1234.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also notes that while Mr. Rahman referred to \"*a huge land acquisition*\" for the pipeline, he confirmed that he had \"*not done a precise calculation*\" but only noted that \"*it's a very lengthy pipeline*.\" He further confirmed that he was not aware of the exact dimensions of the pipeline or that there would be an access road to follow the path of the pipeline. When pointed to the width of the proposed pipeline (\"*a 203 mm (8 inch) outside diameter*\")1563 and of the contemplated access road (7 meters),1564 Mr. Rahman maintained that \"[i]*t's still a whole lot of land*.\"1565 However, in the absence of any inquiry into the amount of land to be acquired in the districts and thus any assessment of the impact that the land acquisition would have had on the existing land owners, the Tribunal again considers that this is not sufficient to establish that there would likely have been significant protest against the land acquisition for the pipeline.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 7.\n\nThe exhibit initially referred to by Claimant's counsel for this statement (Exhibit RE-576-12.03) is not in the record but is marked as \"*intentionally omitted*\" in the index of Respondent's exhibits. Respondent objected to the size represented by Claimant's counsel to Mr. Rahman. Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2101 and 2104 lines 7-10.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2097 line 16 to p. 2102 line 14.\n\n1235.\n\nMr. Rahman was further pointed to the ESIA for the project, which states in the section on the concentrate pipeline corridor and specifically the sub-section on physiography and landscape that \"[a]*gricultural areas are generally localized near the Kech river crossing, Buleda and Parom, although the size of the developments indicates these are mainly for subsistence use and are unlikely to be directly affected by Project activities (Physical and Cultural Baseline Study for Reko Diq Transport Corridors and Marine Terminal, HBP, 2010e). All other areas of the pipeline route are not considered suitable for cultivation by local communities*.\"1566 When asked whether the owners of the land close to the pipeline, if they had sold some of their land, would see the value of their remaining land increase, Mr. Rahman noted that this \"*depends on the whole situation over there regarding the Market Value of the land, which is affected by a number of factors*.\" He confirmed that some of the local community along the pipeline route were relatively isolated; when asked whether the construction or expansion of a road along the pipeline route would provide those communities with greater access, he testified that he \"ha[d] *n't really looked at this*\" as it was not part of his report.1567\n\n**Exhibit RE-601**, p. 5-54.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2106 line 7 to p. 2107 line 5.\n\n1236.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the consideration raised by Claimant that it may have been an incentive for the land owners to agree to the transfer of land in return for being provided with access to a road connecting Reko Diq with Port Gwadar is supported by the fact that one of the contemporaneous requests from the GOB was in fact that a road be built from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar. For example, it is recorded in Claimant's notes of a meeting with Chief Secretary Lehri in March 2010 that when asked what \"*more*\" Balochistan was asking to get from the project, Mr. Lehri stated that \"[t]*he politicians/population from Makran are looking for a rode* [sic] *from Gwadar to Reko Diq; recently several Makran representatives called on the CS asking what will happen with their road now that the GOB wants to take the project over*.\" While Claimant pointed out that the Feasibility Study identified the slurry pipeline as the least costly solution, Mr. Lehri responded that \"*maybe so, but finding a way to build a road from Gwadar to Reko Diq is very important*.\"1568\n\n**Exhibit CE-84**, p. 2.\n\n1237.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that the request from the GOB was presumably aimed at the construction of a larger road than the contemplated access road for the pipeline. However, in the Tribunal's view, this confirms that access to infrastructure for communities along the way from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar was indeed an issue at the time and indicated that even the construction of an access road could have been viewed favorably by the affected communities. In any event, the Tribunal also recalls that no concern was raised by the GOB at the time that it might be difficult or a lengthy process to obtain the land required for building a pipeline and/or an access road.\n\n1238.\n\nMr. Rahman also referred to land acquisition issues faced by the Duddar project, which might be considered comparable to the extent that it was also a mining project and located in Balochistan. Mr. Rahman referred to numerous complaints regarding the non-completion of roads and bridges as well as the \"*non-settlement of land acquisition issues*,\" specifically the relocation of a village for which compensation had been paid to the land owners but the Government had not allocated alternative land as a result of which \"*the locals were resisting the project causing costly work stoppages*.\"1569\n\nRahman II, \u00b6 6.\n\n1239.\n\nAs pointed out to Mr. Rahman at the Hearing on Quantum, it is stated in the PSI Bankable Feasibility Report for the pipeline that \"[t]*he final route was selected avoiding towns, private farms, military installation and facilities, and away from the Iran border as much as practically feasible.*\"1570 While Mr. Rahman maintained that \"[t]*his land was owned by somebody, and, therefore, land acquisition would have needed to take place with all the challenges it brings,*\"1571 the Tribunal is not convinced that it would have to be expected that Claimant would face a similar issue as described for the Duddar project, taking into account that the pipeline route was intentionally designed to minimize interference with populated areas. In particular, Respondent did not dispute Claimant's submission and supporting evidence that while there was a contemplated relocation of the Siah Reg village, all inhabitants had agreed to the relocation and therefore no similar issues would have to be expected.1572\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, p. 16.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2103 lines 11-13.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 190 lit. f; **Exhibits CE-1716** and **CE-1720** (admitted *de bene esse*). The Tribunal notes that in Mr. Zandvliet's trip report of April 2009, he makes reference to Siah Reg, stating that \"[l]and ownership issues are being dealt with at the moment.\" However, as his further report makes clear, renewed issues had arisen becase there was \"*a renewed discussion within TCC whether Siah Reg needs to be resettled at all*\" and he emphasized that it was \"*important to make this decision (preferably with support of an external resettlement expert) and provide clarity to the Siah Reg people*.\" There is no indication in the report that the allor some of the village inhabitants were no longer willing to relocate but Mr. Zandvliet identified \"*a risk that the stop-and-go approach of the past two years will lead to fatigue among residents and may, in the future, lead to additional demands*.\" **Exhibit RE-644**, p. 7. The Siah Reg settlement was not raised as an issue by Respondent and the Tribunal does not consider that Mr. Zandvliet's report would warrant a different conclusion as to whether it was to be expected that the Siah Reg relocation would have caused significant delays with regard to the acquisition of land.\n\n1240.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal sees no indication in Mr. Rahman's description of the issues faced by the Duddar project that they prevented the company from acquiring the land or proceeding to operating the mine without unreasonable delays. In addition, there is no indication that in the case of the Duddar project, the GOB would also have been under a contractual obligation to provide administrative support to the project and perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purpose and interests of the project.\n\n1241.\n\nAs for Mr. Rahman's reference to a hostility in Balochistan towards projects of foreign investors and the GOB in general and towards the Reko Diq project in particular, the Tribunal notes that he apparently relied on the testimony of Respondent's other witnesses and experts. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal does not consider it established that there was significant general hostility towards the project which would have significantly impacted Claimant's ability to acquire the land rights it needed for the project. In the Tribunal's view, this is also confirmed by the fact that Claimant had already acquired the Surface Rights Lease over the mine area without facing any such major issues. In addition, and while the Tribunal does not wish to belittle the issues faced by investors and also the Government in Balochistan with regard to insurgents and even terrorist groups, it is also not convinced that these issues would have affected specifically the acquisition of land in a manner that would have caused delays beyond those accounted for by Prof. Davis.\n\n1242.\n\nMr. Rahman stated in his first report that he had been involved in pipeline projects \"*where land acquisition has taken as long as 18 months*\" and expressed the opinion that it would have taken \"*considerably longer*\" for the slurry pipeline \"*since this was a private party acquiring land, which involves extra difficulties, and the land acquisition was in Balochistan with all the challenges facing projects in the said province*.\"1573 However, as it would not have been a private party acquiring the land but rather the GOB in accordance with its contractual obligations under the CHEJVA and having considered the particular challenges for a project in Balochistan that Respondent and Mr. Rahman identified, the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Rahman's opinion that it would have taken \"*considerably longer*\" than the \"*as long as 18 months*\" he had experienced in other projects to acquire the land for the pipeline.\n\nRahman I, pp. 19-20.\n\n1243.\n\nFinally, as to the timing of starting with the permitting and land acquisition process for the pipeline, Respondent itself pointed out at the Hearing on Quantum1574 that Mr. Livesey testified already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction on Liability that \"*as the pipeline construction was only going to be late in the entire construction period of the project, the permitting would only start when the construction on the rest of the project started. We had about a two year window in which to get all the permits up to speed*.\"1575 Mr. Livesey also testified that \"*the proposal was that we would not start to acquire the land until after the Mining Lease had been granted. Obviously we wouldn't want to commit capital into surface rights leases until we had security of tenure on the mine. And we put in a program at that stage to look at the right of ways and the leeways for the pipeline*.\"1576\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, p. 91.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1310 lines 3-8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1169 line 20 to p. 1170 line 4.\n\n1244.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this testimony plausible and concludes that there is no basis to assume that this timing, together with the delays modeled by Prof. Davis, which will be addressed in more detail below, would have been considered insufficient by a buyer as of the valuation date.\n\n**ii. Whether Claimant Failed to Identify Relevant Permits and Approvals**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1245.\n\nAs noted above, Respondent did not identify a specific permit or approval that Claimant should have, but had not, already obtained at the valuation date. However, Respondent claims that Claimant \"*did not even know all of the permits it needed, did not appreciate the practical difficulties of operating in Balochistan and failed to account for the specific difficulties of getting permits for the project*.\"1577\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 256.\n\n1246.\n\nRespondent argues that Mr. Rahman has identified several permits in his first report that were not included in Claimant's Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study. While Claimant takes the position that some of these permits would not be required, it does not allege that the Draft Permit Register was complete or final. It rather refers to the Chapter on Permitting and Approvals in the Feasibility Study, which states in the section on the Permit and Obligation Register:\n\n\"*The permit register is considered to be a* 'live working document' *that is subject to continuous revision as the project proceeds through the FS, detailed design, procurement, construction management and operational Phases. During the FS phase of the IMD project, a revised permit list and permit registry has been developed (see Appendix 22.05).*\n\n*As indicated at the start of Section 12.1, although the full obligations register has not been completed, the requirements to be incorporated are understood. The obligations register will continue to be developed and updated during the project, incorporating information obtained from a number of sources, including information obtained through the ESIA and conditions of approvals, TCC's community relations team, TCC's legal counsel and any preliminary discussions with possible lenders*.\"1578\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-15.\n\n1247.\n\nSection 12.1 as referenced in the extract above provides at its beginning that \"[a]*ll regulatory requirements for the project have been identified in the Permit Register which was prepared by Hagler Bailly on behalf of TCC (Section 12.2).*\"1579\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-2.\n\n1248.\n\nIn the section on Legal Requirements, it is further stated that \"*the focus to date has been on environmental and water supply related permissions. Other legislation that may affect the project is also being reviewed, with a preliminary list of permits discussed in Section 12.2.1.*\"1580 Section 12.2.1 on the Current Status of Permitting in Pakistan provides:\n\n\"*At present, there are a number of permissions which have already been granted to the Reko Diq project, as identified in the Permit Register (Section 12.3.1). These include the approved Tanjeel EIA, permissions relating to the* 'No Objection Certificates' *issued to TCC to enable water exploration, access to potential port areas etc.*\n\n*From an environmental perspective, the ESIA process is proceeding with the preparation of a detailed impact assessment report that expands on the initial assessment undertaken for Tanjeel. It will be submitted to the authorities when complete (Section 12.3.3). At this stage, no other submissions or permits are required from an environmental perspective. In addition to the environmental permits, there may need to be a number of submissions and subsequent permits obtained in terms of non-environmental legislation. These generally relate to building and equipment approvals and are identified in the permit register*.\"1581\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-2.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-11.\n\n1249.\n\nSection 12.2.1 then lists the water permits issued to date, which will be discussed in more detail below.\n\n1250.\n\nIn a subsequent section on the Approvals plan, it is noted that \"[a] *project approvals plan is being developed. The details of the plan are captured in a draft permit register which is presented in Appendix 22.05, which forms part of the overall project's obligation register*.\"1582\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-14.\n\n1251.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is made clear at various points of the Chapter that the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study was not yet final and complete. It was also made clear that the focus had so far been on environmental and water supply regulatory requirements, which are addressed in detail in the Chapter, and that the work on permitting and approvals would continue after the finalization of the Feasibility Study. That this was in fact the case is confirmed by the updated version of the Draft Permit Register dated December 2011 as well as the reports on the Monthly Progress on Permitting Assignment for the Reko Diq Project, which were continued to be prepared until December 2011, *i.e*., shortly after the Mining Lease Application was denied. In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore clear that a buyer would have looked at the updated Draft Permit Register as of the valuation date in order to determine whether Claimant had a reasonable plan and schedule for obtaining the relevant permits for the project.\n\n1252.\n\nNeither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman addressed the updated version of the Draft Permit Register or the monthly progress reports both of which were submitted together with Claimant's Reply on Quantum. Mr. Rahman continued to refer to the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study in his presentation at the Hearing on Quantum.1583 Similarly, Respondent continued to point to the allegedly missing permits in Appendix 22.05 in its Post-Hearing Brief.1584\n\n*Cf*. Rahman Presentation, p. 9, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-22.05**. In its updated Draft Permit Register, Claimant had identified a longer time period (180 days instead of 120 days as presented by Mr. Rahman) for the acquisition of land for the off-site facilities. **Exhibit CE-1386**.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 260.\n\n1253.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Respondent's allegation that Claimant \"*had failed to address in its Permit Register \u2026 acquisition of the necessary water rights to ensure viability of the project,*\"1585 the Tribunal notes that the Draft Permit Register specifically identified a \"Permit for Water Supply Wells, and water supply pipeline\" (as well as two other permits for potable water treatment and sewage treatment) and provided additional information on the relevat legislation, competent agencies, required submission and procedure, estimated approval time and further comments. In addition, the Chapter on Permitting and Approvals provided further detail on the applicable water legislation and summarized the implications for the project as follows:\n\n*\"\u2022 water law for industrial abstraction is currently absent; however, the Balochistan Ground Water Rights Administration Ordinance (1978) theoretically applies, and it is through this Ordinance that the water supply NOCs were issued;*\n\n*\u2022 there is no consistent application of the Ordinance by the Provincial Water Board and District Water Committees leading to uncertainty on likely conditions of approval, or even if formal approval for abstraction is necessary;*\n\n*\u2022 the District Water Committees may comprise local tribal leaders with a political agenda putting a consistent and transparent approval process at risk;*\n\n*\u2022 new water policies and regulations are proposed indicating that the future of water law in Pakistan could be significantly different to that currently in place, putting any existing water rights at risk (particularly if the long term sustainability of water resources is perceived to be at risk); and*\n\n*\u2022 water charges for abstraction are being considered and could result in additional costs for the project that are not currently accounted for*.\"1586\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 260.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, pp. 12-4 to 12-5.\n\n1254.\n\nMaking reference to \"*the challenges facing confirmation of water rights*,\" in particular that \"*the process may not have been appropriately followed and it is not clear if the issuing authorities have been appropriately established*,\" each of the six water permits issued to date was listed and assessed as to its scope.1587\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-12**, p. 12-12.\n\n1255.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the risk register of the Feasibility Study specifically included the risk of \"*Draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project needs \u2013 caused by the current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to use water (quantity and duration) results in the need to develop alternative sources*.\" In terms of its risk mitigation strategy, Claimant had identified that protection of water rights should be included in the Mineral Agreement and support should be obtained from the GOB after restructuring of the shareholders agreement. Based on the consideration that the issue was addressed in the current draft of the Mineral Agreement, the OPEX impact assigned to this risk was reduced to USD 2 million (from USD 19.9 million without mitigation).1588\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n1256.\n\nBased on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent that Claimant failed to address the acquisition of necessary water rights. To the contrary, Claimant had analyzed the legislation and had specifically identified the risk that due to the absence of a law on industrial abstraction of water, there might be interference by other users. Claimant also noted that there might be future legislation putting existing water rights at risk and providing for water charges which were not accounted for in the current cost estimate.\n\n1257.\n\nClaimant had further planned on mitigating the first risk by including a protection of its water rights in the Mineral Agreement. Respondent argues that Claimant thereby \"*planned to mitigate this risk with another risk, which ranked even higher on the impact scale, and was not likely to materialize (the parties not reaching a mineral agreement.*\"1589 As pointed out by Respondent, the risk of \"*Inability to negotiate Mineral Agreement*\" was ranked \"*High*\" in the Draft Permit Register.1590 However, the Tribunal has already found above that the high risk rating assigned by Claimant to that particular risk at the time it delivered the Feasibility Study to the GOB was based on the actual situation in which negotiations had stalled due to the GOB's decision not to go ahead with them. The Tribunal further found that, if the GOB had not decided to take over the project from Claimant, it would have continued to negotiate with Claimant and an agreement would likely have been reached between the negotiating parties, including the GOB. On that basis, the Tribunal also considers it reasonable that Claimant assigned a lower risk rating and a lower OPEX impact to the risk of insufficient water due to interference by other water users based on the assumption that the protection of its water rights would be addressed in the Mineral Agreement.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 393.\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\n1258.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its Chapter on Permitting and Approvals, Claimant also made reference to proposed new water policies and regulations which might put existing water rights at risk and/or result in water charges for abstraction, which were not yet considered in the cost estimate. However, as neither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman have addressed the topic of future legislation or contemplated any water charges, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that Claimant failed to fully account for the risks associated with these aspects.\n\n1259.\n\nRespondent further refers specifically to one of the No-Objection Certificates issued for one of the alternative water sources and emphasizes that this Certificate limited the number of tubewells to \"*two at the moment*\" and therefore covered only the exploratory phase of the project.1591 However, while the Tribunal found above that Claimant's experts could not exclude that Claimant might have to resort to alternative water sources at some point, it had chosen the Fan Sediments as its primary water source to be developed for the initial mine development scenario considered in the Feasibility Study. Consequently, it appears reasonable to the Tribunal that, as confirmed by Mr. Mayer in his first expert report,1592 Claimant retained its NOCs for the alternative sources which it had indeed obtained for exploratory purposes but had not yet applied for further water extraction rights with regard to these alternative sources.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1314**, p. 14.\n\nMayer I, \u00b6 101.\n\n1260.\n\nRespondent has not specifically challenged Claimant's submission that it had obtained all necessary authorizations for the extraction of water from the Fan Sediments.1593 Rather, it places emphasis on the absence of \"*exclusive*\" water extraction rights as well as the discretion of the relevant authorities to impose conditions on, suspend or even cancel water permits.1594 In the Tribunal's view, however, these aspects were addressed by Claimant by aiming to include a provision protecting its water rights in the Mineral Agreement. There is also no indication in the contemporaneous discussions with the Governments that water rights were a point of debate in the Mineral Agreement negotiations. Finally, the Tribunal also recalls the GOB's contractual obligation to provide support in obtaining the relevant permits as well as its own participation in the project as a result of which it would have been in the GOB's own interest to ensure that the necessary water permits were obtained and maintained.\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 742 lit. b, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1314** *and* **RE-576-24.05**.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 394-398.\n\n1261.\n\nAs a further matter, Respondent takes the position that Claimant \"*had little grasp of the issues related to Port Gwadar*,\" with reports on the challenges faced by the existing operator China's interest to take over the port, and further claims that Claimant's \"*section of the Permits Register dealing with Gwadar is largely blank*\" because it failed to identify any details regarding the permits it had identified.1595\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 298-299; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 351.\n\n1262.\n\nIn response, Claimant referred to the fact that a site-selection trade-off study was conducted which assessed four potential marine terminal sites in the Gwadar area and identified Port Gwadar as the most suitable port site for the project.1596 Claimant also pointed to Mr. Livesey's testimony during the liability phase that \"*TCC's preliminary inquiries into the leasing of land at port sites were met favorably and gave no indication that there would be issues in leasing land packages to accommodate the pipeline's construction*.\"1597 Mr. Livesey also testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the team had met with Port Gwadar officials and discussed, *inter alia*, the disposal facility for the sludge generated by the water treatment. He confirmed that the disposal would require a permit but did not know whether it was included in the permit register.1598\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-9**, p. 9-58; **Exhibit CE-1318**.\n\nLivesey V, \u00b6 26.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 357 lines 9-17.\n\n1263.\n\nWhile Respondent continues to assert that Claimant had not identified the need for its \"*secret sludge dump*,\"1599 the Tribunal notes the Draft Permit Register did include an item \"*Permits for construction of run-off-waste collection and treatment facilities, fire protection, water supply, and sewage services required from the Balochistan Coastal Development Authority*.\"1600 Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant had failed to identify this permit. In addition, and while the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study indeed did not contain any further information on this and three other permits identified for the port facilities, these permits formed part of the areas on which the Permits team focused in December 2011.1601 Respondent does not allege that Claimant would have had to apply for these permits before being granted the Mining Lease and it does not provide any argument as to why it would not have been sufficient to address these permits in December 2011 as Claimant contemplated to do.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 352; Respondent's Opening Presentation, p. 91.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-22.05**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1385**.\n\n1264.\n\nAs for Respondent's more general argument regarding uncertainties surrounding Port Gwadar and its operator in 2011, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has failed to identify any measure that Claimant should have taken to address this uncertainty or any specific risk that Claimant should have accounted for in addition to those regarding security which have already been addressed above. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address this assertion in any further detail.\n\n1265.\n\ninally, as for the remaining permits that Respondent claims to have identified as missing in Claimant's Draft Permit Register, the Tribunal recalls that as discussed in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the GOB was under a contractual obligation to provide administrative support to Claimant in procuring the required licenses and permits for the project. Consequently, even if Claimant had failed to identify a certain permit or approval, it could expect that the GOB would draw its attention to such an omission and assist it in obtaining the required permit or approval if and when required.\n\n1266.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that Claimant failed to identify relevant permits or approvals that it required in order to commence construction or mining operations. The Tribunal further has no reason to believe that a buyer would have expected Claimant to have obtained or applied for any additional permits or approvals as of the valuation date.\n\n**iii. Whether Claimant Had a Reasonable Plan and Schedule for Obtaining the Required Permits and Approvals**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1267.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimant \"*the process of getting the permits and approvals necessary to build a large project in Pakistan is no easy task*.\"1602 Mr. Rahman expressed the opinion in his first report that \"[t]*he permitting process can be long and difficult, and the results are hard to predict. Based on the process of public input and poor relations that TCC had with local communities, it is unlikely that the process of getting permits would have proceeded smoothly. These difficulties would have caused any investor substantial concerns if it had wanted to buy the Reko Diq project from TCC*.\"1603\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 390.\n\nRahman I, \u00b6 29.\n\n1268.\n\nClaimant in turn considers that Respondent \"*has not shown that these alleged difficulties would have been insurmountable, that they would have deterred potential investors from investing in the Project, or that they would have materially affected the Project's viability or fair market value*.\" In Claimant's view, the Reko Diq project did not face \"*any greater permitting-related risks than would be expected in connection with any large-scale mining project*.\" It further points to Prof. Davis' model which, in Claimant's view, \"*already properly accounts for unmonetized risks associated with permitting*.\"1604\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 729-730.\n\n1269.\n\nConsequently, the question for the Tribunal to address is not whether the permitting process would have run \"*smoothly*\" but rather whether the delays accounted for by Prof. Davis would have been considered insufficient by a buyer to account for the risks associated with the permitting process.\n\n1270.\n\nClaimant's risk register identified the risk of \"*Failure to secure all required permits in good time resulting in project delay*\" but did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to this risk.1605 Prof. Davis classified this risk in his valuation as a risk that could cause project start-up delay.1606 He explained that he incorporated \"*negative events related to permitting, financing, and negotiating a mineral agreement*\" into his model by \"*adding time between the Valuation Date and the start of construction (initial project delay).*\" Based on information about \"*the time between completion of the feasibility study and start of construction for open pit mines among the largest 100 copper mines in the world by in situ reserves and resources*,\" which in his opinion face similar issues with regard to these particular risks, he came up with an average of 4.4 years (if pre-construction projects for which only estimates are available are excluded) or 5.4 years (if pre-construction estimates are included); the median duration is 4 years.1607\n\n**Exhibit CE-952**.\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27, p. H-68.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 192, Appendix D, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20 and Workpaper 28.\n\n1271.\n\nTaking into account that Claimant had expected to start construction within 1.5 years after obtaining the mining lease, which implied three years between the Feasibility Study and construction start, Prof. Davis considered that this \"*put Reko Diq in the range of actual experience at most other projects in* [his] *database*.\" Based on the data from these other projects, he then assumed that \"*delay is a random draw from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 4 years*,\" with a minimum level of 3 years as estimated by Claimant and an additional six months duration to account for the fact that the DCF model runs annually. On that basis, the mean would increase to approximately 5.3 years, which means that \"*construction would start no sooner than two years after the Valuation Date, and that on average it would take 3.8 years from the Valuation Date to reach start of construction*.\"1608\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 193 and Appendix D, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Davis II, \u00b6 169.\n\n1272.\n\nIn his second report, Prof. Davis pointed out that his assumption amounted to \"*an average delay of over two years relative to management's projected construction start date*,\" with a minimum delay of 6 months and up to a maximum delay of 13.5 years. He further stated that \"*removing delay from the model and starting construction two years after the Valuation Date in each simulation*\" would have increased the value by over USD 1.3 billion.1609\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 170, 85 and note 102.\n\n1273.\n\nRespondent addresses Prof. Davis' modeling of these delays only in its Post-Hearing Brief, noting that the model \"*does not allow one to zoom in to understand how exactly this delay was applied to TCC's valuation*\" and arguing that the mines on whose data he based his assumption \"*are located in jurisdictions that are in low threat environments or have highly developed mining industries and infrastructure, such as Chile*.\" In Respondent's view, the data is therefore \"*not sufficiently representative for calculating the expected delays that may occur in an environment such as Balochistan*.\" Respondent refers in particular to the \"*unique challenges of large infrastructure projects in Balochistan*\" and the absence of \"*real-life examples in Pakistan to factor the permitting uncertainty and risk TCC would likely face*.\" Respondent also relied on \"*the delays TCC had already faced*\" when \"*the PSI team lost almost half of the planned days of fieldwork due to permitting issues*.\"1610\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 264.\n\n1274.\n\nRespondent's expert Mr. Rahman did not express an opinion as to whether the delays modeled by Prof. Davis would adequately account for the permitting delays that he considered likely to occur. Mr. Rahman also did not provide an estimate as to how long it would have taken in his opinion to obtain the required permits and land rights he had identified in his report. In his second report, he only reiterated that \"*the permitting process would have been a significantly difficult task, one potentially riddled with a multitude of problems arising out of, inter alia, potential litigation, difficulties with land acquisition, an insufficiently resourced and understaffed bureaucracy, poor law and order situation and several laws that allow for the local populace (which has been hostile to foreign and national projects in the area, including Reko Diq) to raise objections*.\"1611 Specifically in response to Claimant's argument that there was no evidence that the Reko Diq project would have faced greater permitting-related risks than other large-scale mining projects, Mr. Rahman expressed the opinion:\n\n\"*There is a false equivalency that the Reply Memorial seeks to make between any large-scale mining project and one such as the Reko Diq project, which is located in one of the most remote, unstable and politically volatile regions in Pakistan. The Reko Diq area and the Province of Balochistan in general is unfortunately a host to various problems highlighted in the Expert Report that are unique to the region. To compare the Reko Diq project with a large-scale mining project in rural United States (for example) does not make sense. Most rural mining projects do not involve constructing and maintaining an extremely lengthy slurry pipeline through large tracts of land that face constant water shortages, have little or no ownership records and belong to hostile local populations. The threat of terrorism in the region is likewise unique to the Reko Diq project. This plethora of problems would have been injurious to the future viability of the Reko Diq project. Accordingly, these problems would have consequently been a significant deterrence for any reasonable investor*.\"1612\n\nRahman II, \u00b6 1.\n\nRahman II, \u00b6 2.\n\n1275.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Rahman that a large-scale project in Balochistan would likely face different risks or a different degree of risk than a project in the United States, it must be noted that the projects on which Prof. Davis based his data are not only located in the United States but include projects located in Chile, Mongolia, Russia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Democratic Republic of Congo, China, Philippines, Argentina, Afghanistan, Ecuador, Fiji, Zambia, Brazil, Canada, Iran, Kazakhstan, Poland, and Burma (Myanmar). The Tribunal also does not agree with Respondent that all of these projects could be considered as being located in a low threat environment. As pointed out by Claimant, five of these countries ranked lower than Pakistan in the 2010 index of the ranking for ease of doing business on which Respondent and Mr. Rahman had relied.1613\n\n**Exhibit ZR-4**.\n\n1276.\n\nIn addition, and while Mr. Rahman criticized Claimant for not presenting \"*evidence refuting the findings of* [his] *Expert Report by showing examples of similar major projects in the Balochistan area that were able to acquire and hold onto the permits without any substantial difficulties*,\"1614 Mr. Rahman himself stated at the Hearing on Quantum that \"[s]*uch an ambitious project on this scale in Balochistan has never been contemplated*.\"1615 The latter statement can be considered undisputed between the Parties not only for Balochistan but also for other provinces of Pakistan. Consequently, Prof. Davis could not have taken into account other large mining projects in Pakistan in his dataset. Respondent also did not provide any data for other infrastructure projects which it would have considered more representatives of the \"*unique challenges of large infrastructure projects*\" faced by Reko Diq. In addition, as pointed out by Claimant, Respondent has also not made any submissions on permitting issues faced by other, smaller-scale mining projects in Balochistan, such as the Duddar and Saindak projects and has not produced any documents to Claimant in this regard.\n\nRahman II, \u00b6 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2087 lines 9-10.\n\n1277.\n\nIn addition, taking note of the emphasis placed by Respondent and Mr. Rahman on the security situation in Balochistan, the Tribunal recalls that it has already addressed in detail above the security risks faced by the project and the adjustments to the value of Claimant's investment that need to be made to account for these risks. The Tribunal sees no justification for further adjustments with regard to security-related risks in the present context.\n\n1278.\n\nAs for the inefficiencies of bureaucracy referred to by Mr. Rahman, the Tribunal is not convinced that these would be unique for Balochistan and would therefore not be accounted for in the delays faced by at least some of the other projects in Prof. Davis' dataset. In this regard, the Tribunal also again recalls the GOB's contractual obligation to provide administrative support in procuring the required permits and approvals. While Mr. Rahman emphasized his opinion that \"*it is a fallacy to assume that government support ensures a quick and smooth permitting and approval process*,\" the Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis did not assume a \"*quick and smooth*\" process but rather that construction would, on average, start two year later than provided in Claimant's schedule and, in absolute terms, 3.8 years after the Mining Lease would have been granted in the but-for scenario. In the Tribunal's view, neither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman have provided the Tribunal with a convincing argument as to why this average delay would have been considered insufficient by a buyer in the present circumstances.\n\n1279.\n\nAs a final matter, the Tribunal notes that at the Hearing on Quantum and again in its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, Respondent referred to \"*permitting issues*\" of the project in the past,1616 always pointing to an issue regarding a No-Objection Certificate faced by the PSI team when making its field trip along the pipeline route in August / September 2009. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would serve as evidence of major permitting issues faced by the project at the feasibility stage. The issue concerned an expired NOC for PSI's Construction Manager, which was raised on 29 August 2009. Mr. Mayer, who was contacted by the PSI team, requested the team to return to the hotel to put a scope and schedule together for what was left to complete in the field. The team spent the next day at the hotel awaiting the NOC but carried out further work on the following day without the Construction Manager. Following another day awaiting the extension of the NOC, the Certificate was extended on 2 September 2009 and the full team continued its field trip.1617 Respondent did not point to any further permitting issue at the feasibility stage or prior stages of the project.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, p. 93; Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 1), p. 268 line 4; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 264.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-6.01**, Appendix Q, pp. 17-20.\n\n1280.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the absence of major permitting issues in the past may not be sufficient evidence in and of itself to demonstrate that the project would also not face permitting issues in the future, the absence of any such issues does show that the GOB acted in accordance with its contractual obligations in the past and was able to support and facilitate the project. As the Tribunal found in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the GOB and also the GOP also created a legitimate expectation that they would continue to support and facilitate Claimant's investment. While this does not guarantee that Claimant would not have faced any permitting issues in the future, the Tribunal considers that the legitimate expectation for continued support by both Governments confirms the Tribunal's conclusion that the delays modeled by Prof. Davis in his valuation would have been considered sufficient by a buyer as of the valuation date.\n\n**9. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Could Have Obtained the Necessary Funding for the Project**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1281.\n\nClaimant submits that in the absence of Respondent's breaches, the Reko Diq project would have attracted the necessary financing, as it had the full support of its sponsors, Antofagasta and Barrick. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \"*two of the world's largest mining companies \u2026 were willing to contribute large amounts of equity to the project*.\"1618\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 261, 269-270, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1245.\n\n1282.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Tribunal already rejected \"*substantially identical financing arguments,*\" holding that Claimant had or could obtain the financial resources to carry out mining operations at Reko Diq and that the information provided in the Feasibility Study satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, and Respondent failed to provide any evidence to undermine the Tribunal's previous conclusions.1619 Specifically, Claimant considers the Tribunal's previous conclusions confirmed by Antofagasta's chairman Mr. Luksic, Antofagasta's executive Mr. Sep\u00falveda, and Claimant's expert on financing, Mr. Pingle, and maintains that it would have been \"*premature to engage in detailed financing decisions*\" before obtaining the mining lease. Claimant refers to Mr. Pingle's explanation that \"*it made no sense for TCCA or its Sponsors to engage directly and in detail with Lenders before obtaining the mining lease*.\"1620\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 262, *comparing* Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1225 *with* Respondent's Closing Presentation, pp. 60-63; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 747, 749, *referring to* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1240-1247.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 262, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6 72; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 767.\n\n1283.\n\nClaimant also rebuts five arguments advanced by Respondent as to why the question before the Tribunal would be different from the question decided in the liability phase: (i) Respondent fails to justify why the burden of proof should be any different from the liability phase and, in any event, the Tribunl did not rely on the burden of proof; (ii) the argument that \"*nothing on the record indicates that \u2026 financing was available*\" was already rejected by the Tribunal, which considered the requirement that Respondent was trying to impose on Claimant to be not realistic given Mr. Luksic's confirmation of the statement in the Feasibility Study that it would be premature to have more than general discussions on financing before the project is approved and its financial requirements are determined; (iii) the Tribunal already considered the absence of a Mineral Agreement which \"*would have made such financing more challenging*\" but there was \"*no indication that it would have been impossible*\"; (iv) the Tribunal did not find that Claimant's owners would have provided full equity financing but rather that Claimant would successfully have arranged third-party financing; and (v) Respondent itself chose not to adduce expert evidence on the ability to finance the project in the liability phase.1621\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 751-756, *quoting from* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1246, 1245, 1239.\n\n1284.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Respondent's argument that the absence of a Mineral Agreement and thus a negotiated fiscal regime was \"*a key flaw*,\" Claimant also refers to Mr. Pingle who noted that he had \"*rarely seen a Fiscal Stability Agreement* 'pre-agreed,' *particularly in jurisdictions unused to large scale investments in projects. Usually, these agreements are among the last items agreed*\" and \"[m]*ost often, these documents are agreed at the request and insistence of the ECAs and/or the DFIs*.\" Consequently, Claimant argues that the absence of a Mineral Agreement would not have prevented financing, but the arrangement of financing by ECAs and DFIs would rather have facilitated the conclusion of the Mineral Agreement.1622\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 786-789, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6 213.\n\n1285.\n\nIn any event, Claimant relies on Mr. Pingle's experience in limited recourse project finance to argue that the project was \"*eminently financeable*\" and that it would have secured financing if Respondent had complied with its obligations under the Treaty.1623 Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to what Respondent's experts suggested in their first report, it does not have to show that it would have actually sold the project to an actual specific buyer in November 2011, given that in the absence of Respondent's breaches, it would have financed the project and would therefore not have sold it. In this regard, Claimant refers to Mr. Luksic's testimony that they \"*wanted to be the ones to build* [the mine]\" and that his conversations with Barrick \"*confirmed that they felt the same way*\"; he stated unequivocally: \"*We were simply not in the market to sell; we were in the market to build*.\"1624 Claimant considers this testimony unchallenged and confirmed by Mr. Pingle's statement that \"[m]*ajor mining projects like this, I've never been involved in one that got sold. They get completed and they get financed, but they don't get sold*.\"1625\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 748, 758.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 759-760, *referring to* Henry/Howden, pp. 20-23 *and quoting from* Luksic II, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 272, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2163.\n\n1286.\n\nClaimant argues that in order to determine the fair market value of Claimant's investment, it also does not have to show that it *would* in fact have financed the project after the valuation date but rather that the project *could* have been financed, *i.e*., that it was financeable. Claimant claims that, in light of the Tribunal's previous findings, \"*there can be no reasonable dispute that TCC* could *have financed the project*.\"1626\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 762-764 (emphasis in original).\n\n1287.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent presented an \"*entirely new*\" argument in its Closing Presentation, suggesting that the \"[i]*mpact of the uncertainty on financing*\" is that value must go down. Claimant considers this argument irrelevant, arguing that \"*Prof. Davis addressed any uncertainty about the precise nature of financing from third parties by conservatively assuming all equity financing from TCC's owners*.\"1627 In addition, Claimant argues that any uncertainty is the result of Respondent's Treaty breaches and maintains that, as Mr. Pingle testified, there was \"*no doubt that, with the mining lease, Reko Diq would have certainly attracted the required financing*\" because \"*Reko Diq had experienced Sponsors making a significant equity investment*. *They had a world-class comprehensive Feasibility Study that was prepared under the supervision of SNC-Lavalin. They* [had] *attractive economics in a very conservative case, and it had numerous financing options.*\"1628\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 262-263, *referring to* Respondent's Closing Presentation, p. 64 and Davis I, \u00b6 191.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 264, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2127.\n\n1288.\n\nAs for the alleged \"*fatal flaws*\" detected by Respondent, Claimant rejects each of them as \"*baseless*\" but maintains that even if they were not baseless, market practice shows that \"*Sponsors and Lenders would have worked together to solve any issue, if there was any issue at all*.\" Claimant refers to Mr. Pingle who described the process of lenders' review in mining projects undertaken by major mining companies as \"*cooperative*\" and giving the Sponsors \"*the benefit of the doubt*\" and who noted that he had never seen a project in which the sponsors committed 60% of the project costs but then failed to secure financing for technical reasons.1629\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 781-783, *quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6\u00b6 211, 204 *and referring to* \u00b6 206.\n\n1289.\n\nClaimant also rejects the argument that it adhered to an outdated standard provided in the CHEJVA, emphasizing that the CHEJVA does not dictate any standard to which the work was to be performed and adding that, in any event, its feasibility work was performed \"*in accordance with the highest contemporaneous industry standards, and indeed set a new bar for Barrick's later feasibility work at other mines*.\"1630\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 785, 765 *referring to* Henry/Howden, \u00b6 3.1.2 *and* Livesey IV, \u00b6 71.\n\n1290.\n\nClaimant considers that the first report of Respondent's experts Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden contained \"*a hodgepodge of assertions on a range of topics*\" and asserted without any supporting evidence that there was no capacity in the market to finance Reko Diq in 2011 because the Oyu Tolgoi mining project in Mongolia had sucked up all available financing. According to Claimant, Mr. Pingle demonstrated, however, that there was \"*ample capacity\u2014hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014in the market in 2011*,\" which was only confirmed by the Oyu Tolgoi project.1631 Specifically, Claimant refers to various contemporaneous statements and statistics about major ECAs as well DFIs, which in its view confirm that these agencies were not capacity constrained, in particular when taking into account that the drawdown schedule of mining projects is dictated by the construction schedule and the required debt financing must thus be broken down by year of construction.1632 In Claimant's view, Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden then abandoned their capacity argument, conceding that \"[t]*here is no denying* [the relevant lenders] *are well funded institutions in their own right,*\" but instead raising a new argument that \"*mining finance transactions are always arranged by a group of commercial lenders acting as Mandated Lead Arrangers*.\"1633\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, pp. 11-14 and Pingle, \u00b6\u00b6 138-198; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 776, 780, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1418**, p. 18.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 777-779, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1418**, pp. 18, 5, **CE-1416**, p. 7, **CE-1404**, p. 118, **CE-1399**, p. ii, **CE-1403**, pp. 26-27, *CE-1402*, p. 6, **CE-1430** and **CE-1398**, p. 1, *and* Pingle, \u00b6\u00b6 140-145.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 267, *quoting from* Henry/Howden II, pp. 15 and 8.\n\n1291.\n\nClaimant claims that Mr. Howden admitted at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*he had simply assumed the case away*\" by clarifying that his opinion referred to the financeability of the project as it existed \"*in its current form*\" on the valuation date, including the assumption that Claimant \"*did not have a mining lease*\" and that the critiques made by Respondent's experts were well-founded. In Claimant's view, the expert reports of Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden can therefore be given no evidentiary weight.1634\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 268, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2205, 2208, 2224-2225 *and quoting from* pp. 2197, 2208.\n\n1292.\n\nClaimant again refers to Mr. Pingle who testified that \"*the most important single issue in a project is the Sponsors, their capability, their experience, and the amount of money they are committing*.\" Claimant emphasizes that the Sponsors were contemplating an equity contribution of 60% of the total project costs, which Mr. Pingle described as \"*an extremely high contemplated equity investment*,\" demonstrating a \"*high level of confidence in the Project*,\" and which Mr. Howden acknowledged to be a \"*significant equity investment*\" and \"*relevant to a lending decision*.\"1635\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 271, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2113, 2213 *and* (Day 8), p. 2248.\n\n1293.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the project had the full support of its sponsors, as confirmed by Mr. Luksic's testimony as well as the fact they they had invested hundreds of millions of US dollars in the Feasibility Study and were willing to contribute 60% of the project costs. Claimant quotes from Mr. Pingle who stated that lenders \"*would have given great weight not only to the sponsors' financial capacity but also to their managerial, technical, and operating expertise.*\"1636\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 766, *referring to* Luksic II, \u00b6 7 *and* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 958 *and quoting from* Pingle, \u00b6 23.\n\n1294.\n\nClaimant further contends that Reko Diq would have had numerous options for debt financing of the remaining 40% of project costs, referring to a combination of Export Credit Agencies (ECAs), Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), Islamic Banks and government-supported funds as presented by Mr. Pingle at the Hearing on Quantum.1637 Claimant also notes that the Feasibility Study contemplated that \"*the anchor of the financing plan will be the multilateral agencies and export credit agencies (ECAs).*\"1638\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 273, *referring to* Pingle Presentation, pp. 6-11 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), pp. 2117-2125.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 768, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1295.\n\nAccording to Claimant, ECAs alone could have financed the entire debt portion of the financing, relying on Mr. Pingle's testimony that \"[t]*ypically 60 percent of a large mining project's Project Costs are eligible for ECA financing*.\"1639 According to Claimant, there would thus have been little uncertainty as to the lenders as well as to the terms of their lending given that ECA financing must comply with the standardized OECD Arrangement of Officially Supported Export Credits.1640 Claimant further notes that Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden stated in their second report that ECAs can finance up to 85% of an export contract, implying that commercial lenders would have to fund the remaining 15% of the debt, but Mr. Howden acknowledged at the Hearing on Quantum that the 15% down payment can be made with equity.1641\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 274, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2118;

It is located in a jurisdiction that the World Bank and other multilateral agencies want to promote. It was to be financed during a commodity boom. There is no doubt that, but for Pakistan's breaches, Reko Diq would have attracted the relatively modest financing required*.\"1650\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 281-283, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1739**, p. 18 *and* **CE-1754**, p. 69.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 284.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1302.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the Reko Diq project would not have been financially feasible from a bankability perspective because there was \"*no financing appetite*\" in the market for the Reko Diq project given the \"*significant flaws in the standards underlying the IMD FS and an array of other problems that made the project not bankable.*\" In addition, Respondent argues that any decision by Claimant's owners to fund the development of the project on an equity basis would have required them to break their internal policies and risk their market reputation.1651\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 378.\n\n1303.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the issue to be decided by the Tribunal at this stage is \"*quite different*\" from the question decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability because Respondent then sought to prove a negative, *i.e*., that Claimant could not secure financing, whereas Claimant now has to show that it could secure financing. Respondent argues that there are substantial issues to be decided by the Tribunal at this point: (i) the Tribunal has now for the first time received expert testimony on mining finance, with Respondent's experts showing that \"*the Resource could never have been financed given the severe deficiencies in the IMD FS and the investment appetite for a Resource such as Reko Diq in 2011*\"; (ii) Claimant has not provided any evidence of its ability to obtain financing other than the testimony of Mr. Livesey at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, who described the financing as \"*particularly challenging*,\"1652 and the Tribunal only concluded that \"*it appears improbable that* [TCC] *would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial institutions*\"1653 but did not make a finding that there was actual interest in financing the project; it must therefore now decide on the effect of the \"*critical challenges*\" raised by Respondent and its experts \"*in the context of the valuation of the Resource*\"; (iii) the Feasibility Study does not contemplate full equity financing \"*or equity financing of any kind*\" and Claimant has not presented any evidence in support of its assertion that Barrick and Antofagasta would have approved \"*such an aggressive financing method*\" and further that they could \"*successfully lobby their shareholders and convince them to risk a significant portion of their investment on a mine that would not be operational for years*\"; and (iv) the Tribunal has not yet considered Claimant's prospects of financing in light of a failed Mineral Agreement which, in Respondent's view, \"*would have been instrumental in obtaining third-party financing, or in proceeding with full-equity funding*.\"1654\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1241 lines 10-12.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1245.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n1304.\n\nRespondent further submits that both the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules required that a feasibility study supporting a mining lease application include a sufficient description of the project's financial structure in order to allow the GOB to make a decision whether and on what terms to participate in the mining proposal and to enable the regulartory authority to make a proper review of the financial viability of the project.1655\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 282.\n\n1305.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant stated in its Mining Lease Application that it contained a detailed description of the \"*type and source and extent of financing*\" as well as \"*particulars of the applicant's \u2026 financial resources and those of any person to be engaged to provide such resources, together with supporting documentary evidence and copies of relevant contractual agreements*.\"1656 Respondent contends that contrary to these statements, the Mining Lease Application \"*did not provide any certainty of this type*\" as the Feasibility Study had been prepared on the premise that the financial terms would be defined following several contingencies: (i) the approval of the Feasibility Study; (ii) the conclusion of shareholders' agreement among Claimant's owners; (iii) the GOB's review and decisions regarding the financials; (iv) the investment decision being made and issued; and (v) formal discussion of financing with third-party financiers. Respondent emphasizes that none of this occurred.1657 In Respondent's view, these \"*regulatory and contractual shortcomings are extremely relevant as a matter of damage quantification*\" because the price any buyer would have been willing to pay for Reko Diq would have been \"*severely diminished by the knowledge that the mining lease application, even if obtained, would have been secured based on premises that did not comply with TCC's regulatory and contractual obligations*.\"1658\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 283, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-8**, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 284.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 285.\n\n1306.\n\nRespondent contends that the Feasibility Study did not include any description of the estimated financial structure of the proposed venture but was \"*only the starting point for a long and complex process which, at the time of the mining lease application and even at the Valuation Date, still required massive work in the identification of pending work, followed by a quantification of several areas of cost and risk*.\" Respondent adds that the boards of Claimant's shareholders would consider the project only once that work was finalized and, if approved by them, discussions with external financiers would start; only at the end of these discussions could the costs of equity and debt financing be quantified and \"*financial studies of the type required by BMR Rules 47*\" be submitted as part of a mining lease application. According to Respondent, Claimant was therefore in default under the 2002 BM Rules and the CHEJVA as of the valuation date.1659\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 286-288.\n\n1307.\n\nRespondent considers it confirmed by the testimony of Claimant's witnesses at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*any decision by the prospective providers of equity and debt financing was indeed far from being seriously procured*.\"1660 Respondent refers to Chapter 29 of the Feasibility Study, stating that there would be a further review of many risks in the Risk Register for which an itemized cost had not yet been quantified.1661 According to Respondent, these itemized costs would then be submitted to the boards of directors of Antofagasta and Barrick, who have to this date not approved the Feasibility Study and would have to vote on whether to invest in the mining proposal on the basis of the aggregate financial exposure. Respondent emphasizes that only if a decision to invest was reached by them and, as the case may be, by the GOB, discussions with third-party financiers would commence and, only if those were fruitful, the estimated cash flows \"*called for under BMR Rule 47*\" could be estimated.1662\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 289, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 497 lines 3-14 and (Day 5), p. 1283 lines 8-12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 291, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-29** *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 853 line 8 to p. 854 line 7 and p. 855 lines 1-3.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 292, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 3), p. 866 line 15 to p. 870 line 5.\n\n1308.\n\nIn support of its submission on this decision path, Respondent refers to Claimant's Forward Work Plan in the Feasibility Study:1663\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-32**, p. 32-7.\n\n1309.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimant's own description of the funding arrangements in the Feasibility Study:\n\n\"*At the feasibility stage, funding arrangements have been considered only on a preliminary basis with a view to adding considerable fundability certainty to the project during the project's review and approval stage, after conclusion of the FS. The FS together with the mining lease, the shareholder agreement between the GOB and TCCA and the investment protection agreement (Mineral Agreement) are the key prerequisites to effectively approach the potential lenders to the project and finalise the design of the financing plan*.\"1664\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-4.\n\n1310.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant's witnesses and experts \"*openly contradicted each other\u2014and in some cases the IMD FS*\" with regard to the financial structure of the proposed venture. Respondent notes that: (i) the Feasibility Study is based on the premise that Claimant and GOB would supply 60% of the required financing; (ii) Mr. Luksic maintained that Antofagasta and Barrick would provide 100% of financing through debt or equity; (iii) Mr. Sep\u00falveda stated that external financing from commercial banks with some assistance from ECAs would be required; and (iv) Mr. Pingle testified that the financing would instead be obtained through ECAs with no significant involvement from commercial banks. In Respondent's view, this confirms that the time of submitting the Mining Lease Application, there was no financial plan that could meet \"*the strict requirement of Article 1 of the CHEJVA and Rule 47 of the BMR*.\"1665\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 295, *referring to* Exhibit RE-576-29, p. 29-4, Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1289 line 9 to p. 1290 line 1 and (Day 3), p. 490 lines 16-18 and Pingle Presentation, p. 8.\n\n1311.\n\nRespondent further submits that as of the valuation date, there were no agreements in place among Claimant's shareholders or with any third party regarding the funding of the Reko Diq project. In particular, Respondent considers that neither Antofagasta nor Barrick had expressed any commitment to actually fund the project or any indication as to the financial costs. Respondent also contends that that in the absence of a definitive postion on royalties and taxes, there could be no bankable feasibility study.1666\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 297, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 390 lines 16-20, p. 394 lines 16-17, p. 490 line 22, *and* (Day 5), p. 1280 lines 12-21 and p. 1283 lines 8-12, p. 1291 line 2 and p. 1294 lines 2-4.\n\n1312.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the alleged commitment by Claimant's owners, Respondent contends that \"*Antofagasta did not have the corporate credit rating or access to international debt markets sufficient to take on Reko Diq*.\" According to Respondent, any decision to proceed without financing would have meant for it to assign almost half of its cash to one project which would have been \"*a reckless commitment of the company's finances*\" that no reasonable board would have approved.1667 As for Barrick, Respondent notes that Claimant has not provided testimony from any senior member of its ownership or management structure but only Mr. Luksic's testimony on his impressions of conversations with his joint venture partner. Respondent acknowledges that Barrick \"*had a broader access to the debt markets in November 2011*\" but argues that it had \"*rigid policies that would not have permitted the kind of debt raising or cash spend necessary to finance the Reko Diq project*\" and that \"*Barrick told its investors in 2011 that it was looking for projects with a return on equity of 22%. Reko Diq's financials were merely half of that*.\" According to Respondent, Barrick would therefore have been unwilling and even unable to approve the construction of Reko Diq, which had only a \"*quite low*\" post-tax IRR of 12%.1668 Respondent notes that Oyu Tolgoi projected an ITT of more than 20%, reaching even as high as 29%, and claims that by contrast, the Reko Diq project when including \"*all of the costs left out*\" would have had an IRR far below 12%. In Respondent's view, the \"*subpar numbers at Reko Diq were far below any notion of a solid return.*\"1669\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 385-386; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 388, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.7.2.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 387, 389; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 389, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.7.2.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 389-391.\n\n1313.\n\nRespondent further refers to its experts who confirmed that there was only \"*very limited*\" market appetite to provide financing for a project of the size and in the geographic location of Reko Diq.1670 Respondent argues that \"[t]*he Oyu Tolgoi project was consuming a large part of the available capital, both from the commercial banks and the ECAs and DFIs*\" and it was therefore \"*not a good time to look for over one billion dollars for a high-risk project with a low return*\" as \"[n]*o financier would have simultaneously financed a low-grade, pre-development project located near taliban-occupied territory, especially with the kinds of financials contemplated by Claimant*.\" In Respondent's view, Claimant has not provided any meaningful evidence to rebut this argument, considering Claimant's assertion \"*bizarre*\" that the financing for Oyu Tolgoi would confirm the capacity for financing for Reko Diq; Respondent maintains that \"[i]*f the available mining finance capital is one jurisdiction, there is no room for another*\" and that, in the absence of any demonstration that there was excess, available capital, its argument stands untouched, *i.e*., that \"*there was no capacity in commercial banks to even consider Reko Diq*.\"1671\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 298, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, pp. 4, 7 *and* Howden Presentation, p. 3; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 378.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 375-376; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 384, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.4.\n\n1314.\n\nRespondent also submits that mining financiers would not have been interested in Reko Diq \"*without complete risk insurance, something which TCC had chosen not to purchase.*\" In the absence of any discussion in the previous phase of the proceedings on political risk insurance or financing by ECAs or the MIGA, Respondent considers that Claimant failed to undertake \"*the basic step to* 'de-risk' *the political risk that would have been one of the primary concerns of a financier*.\"1672\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 386, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.2.\n\n1315.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the absence of capacity in commercial banks \"*dooms*\" Claimant's other arguments as commercial banks are necessary to arrange financing. Referring to its experts, Respondent argues that: (i) it is market reality that commercial banks act as mandated lead arrangers, which are in charge of leading the financing; (ii) ECAs would not cover the entirety of any necessary financing but only up to 85% of the value of the contracts and services originating from their home jurisdictions; and (iii) DFIs also have limited ability to finance a project, funding only up to 30% of the total loan.1673\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 377, *referring to* Henry/Howden II, pp. 8, 9, 14.\n\n1316.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reliance on financing by ECAs and DFIs, Respondent submits that these institutions are conservative investors which follow the lead of commercial banks but are not first movers. As for ECAs, Respondent argues that they provide largely insurance cover but \"*would likely not make financing available*.\" In addition, Respondent considers that the Feasibility Study did not have \"*a full picture of the capital costs, relying largely on estimates*\" and argues that \"[w]*ithout knowing the source of inputs, once cannot begin to even construct a pictures* [sic] *of the ECAs involved*.\" In any event, Respondent contends that the ECAs would not have been eager to increase their exposure to Pakistan, and particularly Balochistan, \"*due to the risks and difficulties of doing business in that part of the world*.\"1674\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 381-383, *referring to* Henry/Howden II, pp. 6-7.\n\n1317.\n\nWith regard to DFIs, Respondent argues that they \"*have a focused mandate relative to the part of the world they support*\" and dedicate only a small portion of their balance sheets to the extractive industries. Respondent notes that the ADB apparently did not make investments in mining projects in 2012 which, in its view, \"*show*[s] *a disinterest in the area*.\" According to Respondent, DFIs would have \"*limited interest in Reko Diq*\" given that investing in Pakistan would have been a new market and they would have taken \"*a cautious approach with strict limits to keep from stretching themselves too thin in an unknown area*.\"1675\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 383, *referring to* Henry/Howden II, p. 11.\n\n1318.\n\nIn any event, Respondent submits that the process of finding ECAs and DFIs is \"*a time-consuming process involving lengthy due diligence*\" and requiring approval by various boards of directors of each institution. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant has never reached the decision makers at any of these institutions and maintains that \"[t]*he story of financing that TCCA has told is nothing more than that\u2014a story*.\"1676 Respondent points out that the Oyu Tolgoi project, which was already in construction, required the participation of numerous financing institutions, MIGA and multiple ECAs; by contrast, Claimant had not even started to look for financiers and political risk insurance underwriters, \"*a process that it was months and probably years from achieving*.\"1677\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 384.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 386.\n\n1319.\n\nRespondent further contends that in the absence of a proper assessment and mitigation of the environmental and social impacts of the project, the project would not have been eligible for financing from the multilateral agencies and ECAs identified as primary source of financing in the Feasibility Study.1678\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 298, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1320.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the credit committees of financial institutions do not accept feasibility studies at face value but perform their own due diligence, \"*hiring many of the same kinds of people that Pakistan has assembled*\" for technical, environmental, legal and financial advice. Respondent notes that the financing for Reko Diq would have been limited recourse, meaning that financiers had to base their risk assumptions on the project's risk and not, as suggested by Mr. Pingle's view on financing, any corporate guarantees or other collateral. In Respondent's view, they would thus have detected the same issues as Respondent did in the course of this arbitration and \"*no mining finance institution would have gone forward with a loan based on the status of the work done for the IMD FS*.\"1679\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 372-374, *referring to* Henry/Howden II, p. 15.\n\n1321.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent also contends that \"[a]*ny attempt to get financing for the Reko Diq project would have departed from a flawed foundation: the requirements of the CHEJVA*.\" Respondent argues that \"*the standards at the Reko Diq project*\" were not updated to the rules in place in 2006 when the Novation Agreement, pursuant to which Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA (replacing BHP) on 1 April 2006 (the \"**2006 Novation Agreement**\") was signed and adds that a mining finance instution would have required a feasibility study \"*fit for regulatory practice in 2011, not an antiquated version based on contractual standards forsworn by the mining finance world*.\"1680 Referring to Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden, Respondent asserts that the Feasibility Study would not have been considered \"*bankable*\" by the financial markets due to the standards of the CHEJVA but also other \"*core issues not treated adequately by the IMD FS*,\" such as the uncertain fiscal regime which Respondent considers to be \"*a key flaw undermining the bankability of the IMD FS, which is before even getting to the technical flaws*.\"1681 Respondent argues that further \"*key concerns*,\" which would have prevented mining finance institutions from financing the project, were the availability of water as well as security.1682 Also referring to the other \"*issues on the face of the IMD FS*,\" which Respondent raised throughout its submissions, it considers it clear that \"*without a doubt Reko Diq was not bankable*.\"1683\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 380.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 381, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.1.2 and p. 23.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 382, *referring to* Henry/Howden I, Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 383.\n\n1322.\n\nRespondent claims that the \"*little information*\" available regarding the views of financiers on the project reveal that \"*the project would have faced deep issues if it tried to obtain financing*,\" in particular given the \"*very large amounts*\" and \"*underwhelming plans*\" described in the Feasibility Study.1684 In Respondent's view, this is confirmed by the Feasibility Study itself, which states that \"*the financing of the project will be \u2026 particularly challenging, and \u2026 will require Antofagasta and Barrick to provide guarantees until the project starts operations and reaches completion. It is likely that commercial appetite for the financing of the project will be limited*.\"1685\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 299, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1280 line 12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 299, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1323.\n\nRespondent submits that by November 2011, \"*copper prices were already falling, and the sentiment was that the decrease in copper prices would continue*.\" According to Respondent, the major mining companies, *i.e*., the principal acquirers, were focusing on \"*traditional, stable mining jurisdictions like Chile, Canada, and Australia*,\" which accounted for 53% of the acquisitions, while only 9% of all acquisitions were in \"*emerging*\" regions and \"*no significant transactions*\" in \"*frontier (new) markets like Pakistan*.\"1686\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 379.\n\n1324.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's critique of the classification of Pakistan as a \"*frontier*\" market, Respondent notes that it merely criticizes the Fraser Institute for its ideology but not for its methodology. Noting that the Institute is supported, *inter alia*, by Barrick's founder, Respondent maintains that it \"*accurately identifies the issues at play in Pakistan that make investment difficult*.\"1687 Quoting from its experts, Respondent claims that there were \"*no circumstances, from a country risk perspective, under which a credit committee of a diligent mining institution would approve a mining project to be financed*.\" Arguing that Claimant would have to convince \"*not just one credit committee but rather almost every credit committee*,\" Respondent considers it confirmed that \"*there was no appetite for financing in November 2011 for Reko Diq*.\"1688\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 392 and note 806.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 386, *quoting from* Henry/Howden I, Section 3.2.\n\n1325.\n\nRespondent notes that the ADB analyzed the prospects of mining ventures in Balochistan and stated that \"*continued reports of instability, attacks, plots, bombings, and even less-destructive activities such as protests and work stoppages* [in Pakistan] *affect investor's views of the country's overall stability. These perceptions affect Balochistan even more, given the security concerns in the province*.\" It further reported that \"*some infrastructure, logistics, and security-related obstacles need to be removed before investors begin to consider investing in the province*,\" and that \"[f]*or mining operations to thrive, the benefits that accrue to the local community need to be emphasized. This requires well-designed contractual arrangements that result in a coordinated community development plan endorsed by the local community, the government and the mine operator*.\"1689\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 300, *quoting from* **Exhibit RE-782**, pp. v, 4, \u00b6 2 *and* p. 10, \u00b6 32, and referring to Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1290 line 1 to p, 1295 line 11.\n\n1326.\n\nAccording to Respondent, none of the issues it identified had been resolved before the Mining Lease Application was submitted or at the valuation date, as a result of which \"*financing would be rather hard to negotiate and guarantee, resulting in increased costs and/or a reduced chance of the project ever coming to fruition*.\"1690\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 301.\n\n1327.\n\nRespondent also maintains the argument that no mining company would actually have been interested in buying the project from Claimant and claims that this should lead to a reduction in value, considering the limited size of the asset for sale in relation to the market. According to Respondent, a liquidity premium would have been considered by any buyer using financing to account for \"*numerous features*\" such as the concentration risk identified by Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden.1691\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 378-380, referring to *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/04, Award of 15 April 2006 [RLA-402], \u00b6\u00b6 403-404.\n\n1328.\n\nRespondent clarifies that it does not take the position that Claimant would have to find financing for itself and a buyer but rather that \"[t]*he issue of financing arises from the necessity of the market*\" as a buyer would have had to find financing for this purchase, \"*especially since no company would have wanted to put a project with such low returns on its books on an equity basis*.\"1692\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 393.\n\n**c. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1329.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of the question whether Claimant has established that it could have obtained the necessary financing for the project, the Tribunal recalls that Respondent argued already in the liability phase of this proceeding that TCCP failed to establish that it had or could obtain the resources to carry out the mining operations effectively as required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules because the Feasibility Study addressed third-party financing only in the \"*vaguest and most incomplete and unsatisfactory of terms*.\"1693 Similarly to the alleged failure to fully assess the water source and the alleged failure to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline, Respondent raised this argument for the first time in this arbitration. While finding that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal in any event found that none of these additional reasons, including the reason invoked with regard to the financing of the project, would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application.1694\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 1231-1233.\n\n1330.\n\nAt the liability stage, the Tribunal was pointed in particular to the Introduction of the Feasibility Study, which includes the following sub-sections:\n\n\"***Prospective Fundability and Affordability***\n\n*Prospective funding and affordability are important aspects of each stakeholders' investment decision: whether any required equity contribution along with any required corporate guarantees are affordable, and whether the project is fundable through conventional financial institutions, particularly given the challenging aspects of the project.*\n\n*While certain preliminary work has been undertaken during the FS stage in relation to both* 'fundability' *and* 'affordability'*, it is generally not deemed appropriate to attend too much to these aspects of the project until completion of the FS and, wherein, there is a well defined project and well defined financial requirements.*\n\n*Nevertheless, since financing often finds itself on a large capital project's critical path, certain preliminary work that had the potential to save subsequent time and effort has been undertaken. Furthermore, the Balochistan Mineral Rules require that the anticipated source of funding is addressed within the FS. The following satisfies that requirement.*\n\n***Financing Strategy***\n\n*TCC's Financing Plan for the project is to finance the development and commissioning of the project with a combination of Senior Debt advanced by a group of lenders and Shareholder Equity and subordinated Shareholder Loans provided by the project sponsors.*\n\n*The Senior Debt will be a traditional* 'Project Financing' *structure, similar to the structure that the sponsors have successfully put in place for other projects. Project Financing is typically sourced via consortiums consisting primarily of large international financial institutions (IFIs), governmental Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks.*\n\n*Given the large capital requirement for Reko Diq the funding approach to be undertaken will involve discussions with a large number of ECAs, IFIs, and commercial banks. Additional funding sources, including the potential for an Islamic tranche or funding tied to off-take will be evaluated. Finally, the potential to fund particular items that make up the overall capital number is being evaluated, particularly in connection with the power solution for Reko Diq and the port.*\"1695\n\n**Exhibit CE-86 / RE-576-2**, pp. 2-9 to 2-10.\n\n1331.\n\nMr. Luksic testified at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that the Asian Development Bank and a few agencies \"*were very, very interested*\" in being part of the financing of the project but that \"*you need to have a fully approved project before you get the financing*.\" In the context of the suggestion that the absence of a Mineral Agreement would have made financing impossible or at least very difficult, he also testified that the World Bank appeared \"*very committed to Pakistan developing mining*.\"1696\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 3), p. 635 lines 5-10 and 15-18 and p. 675 lines 6-17.\n\n1332.\n\nIn light of Mr. Luksic's testimony and also taking into account that Antofagasta and Barrick as two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to contribute large amounts of equity to the project, the Tribunal considered it improbable that Claimant's owners would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank. The Tribunal further noted that while the absence of a Mineral Agreement might have made third-party financing more challenging, there was no indication of it being impossible.1697 Besides the fact that the Parties might have resumed negotiations after the grant of a mining lease, the Tribunal considered the requirement that Respondent tried to impose on Claimant regarding the financing details to be included in the Feasibility Study to be not realistic and noted that Mr. Luksic had confirmed the statement made in the Feasibility Study that it would have been premature to have more than general discussions on financing before the project is approved and its financial reqirements are determined. In the Tribunal's view, this applied in particular where, as in the present case, a project-financing structure was contemplated, which naturally requires that basic parameters of the project are fixed before any financing institution would enter into a commitment or make a binding offer on financing conditions.1698\n\nDeecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1245.\n\nDeecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1246.\n\n1333.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal considered that the information provided in the Feasibility Study satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules and did not justify a denial of the Mining Lease Application.1699\n\nDeecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 1247.\n\n1334.\n\nClaimant takes the position that the arguments raised by Respondent on financing in the present quantum phase are \"*substantially identical*\" to those raised in the liability phase and have therefore been already rejected by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.1700 Respondent, on the other hand, has pointed to the expert evidence on financing which was adduced only in the quantum phase, the issues raised by Respondent and its experts in various areas with regard to the Feasibility Study in the context of which the Tribunal must re-evaluate the alleged lack of actual evidence on financing interest, a new argument on the ability to proceed on 100% equity financing which triggered submissions on Barrick and Antofagasta's ability and willingness to contribute the required amounts of equity as well as the impact of the lack of a Mineral Agreement.1701 Claimant has rebutted those arguments and maintains that Respondent \"*has offered no good reason to reconsider the Tribunal's holding* [in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability]*, and there is none*.\"1702\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 262.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 749-757.\n\n1335.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the arguments at liability stage concerned the regulatory requirement of rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules that the mining lease applicant must show that it \"*has or can obtain the technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations effectively*.\"1703 In the present quantum phase, Respondent has argued that \"*the Resource could never have been financed given the severe deficiencies in the IMD FS and the investment appetite for a Resource such as Reko Diq in 2011*\" and that \"*from a bankability perspective, the Reko Diq project was not financially feasible.*\"1704 In its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains \"*Reko Diq would not have attracted the required financing.*\"1705 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent refers to regulatory requirements of the 2002 BM Rules as well as to contractual requirements under the CHEJVA and argues that in breach of these requirements and contrary to Claimant's own representation in the Mining Lease Application that it would provide a detailed description of the \"*type and source and extent of financing*\" and the \"*particulars of the applicant's \u2026 financial resources and those of any person to be engaged to provide such resources, together with supporting documentary evidence and copies of relevant contractual agreements*,\" Claimant did not provide any certainty of this type in the Mining Lease Application, including in the Feasibility Study. In Respondent's view, this would have \"*severely diminished*\" the price that a hypothetical buyer would have been willing to pay for Claimant's stake in Reko Diq.1706\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 48(3)(a)(iii).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 378.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, Section I.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 282-285.\n\n1336.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent refers to rule 47 of the 2002 BM Rules and Clause 1 of the CHEJVA which, in its view, were not complied with in the Mining Lease Application. Respondent's reference to Claimant's submissions in the liability phase indicates that it is referring to: (i) rule 47(2)(j)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that an application for a mining lease \"*shall contain or be accompanied by \u2013 (i) a statement giving a detailed forecast of capital investment, operating costs and revenues and the anticipated type and source and extent of financing;*\"1707 (ii) the definition of \"*Feasibility Study*\" in Clause 1.1 of the CHEJVA, which provides that the Feasibility Study shall, *inter alia*, include \"*financial studies relating to the estimation of discounted cash flow, net present values, returns, fixed and working capital and operating costs and revenue escalated to commencement of production*\";1708 and (iii) Article 3.2 of the 2000 Addendum to the CHEJVA dated 4 March 2000 (\"**2000 Addendum**\") in which it was agreed to include an additional requirement in the definition of \"*Feasibility Study*,\" *i.e*., \"*a plan for providing financing of all development costs of the mining project including external debt agreements and equity contributions required from the Parties*.\"1709\n\n**Exhibit RE-1**, rule 47(2)(j)(i). *See* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 282 and note 635.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1**, Clause 1.1 (p. 5).\n\n**Exhibit CE-2**, Article 3.2 (p. 3).\n\n1337.\n\nAs Respondent's reference in its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum to Claimant's Memorial on Liability indicates, these regulatory and contractual requirements were already the subject of submissions in the liability phase. However, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that neither of the above quoted requirements was raised by Respondent in the context of its argument in the liability phase that Claimant failed to show that it had or could obtain the necessary financing. Respondent also does not allege in the present quantum phase that these requirements played any role in the denial of the Mining Lease Application or that the GOB considered the Feasibility Study and/or Mining Lease Application to be deficient at the time due to an alleged failure to comply with these requirements. Respondent rather argues that these alleged shortcomings would have been \"*extremely relevant as a matter of damage quantification*\" as they would have \"*severely diminished*\" the price that a buyer would have been willing to pay based on \"*the knowledge that the mining lease application, even if obtained, would have been secured based on premises that did not comply with TCC's regulatory and contractual obligations to the GoB*.\"1710\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 285.\n\n1338.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, the argument that uncertainty on financing would have an impact on the quantification of value was raised for the first time in Respondent's Closing Presentation at the Hearing on Quantum;1711 it was addressed by Claimant in its Post-Hearing Brief and will be discussed further below. However, the argument that the alleged uncertainty amounted to non-compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements was raised only in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum.\n\nRespondent's Closing Presentation, p. 64.\n\n1339.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. In the absence of any indication that the GOB or the Licensing Authority considered the description of the financing strategy and/or the Chapter on Financing Analysis in the Feasibility Study to be non-compliant with regulatory or contractual requirements, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that a buyer would have considered this to be an issue lowering the price it would be willing to pay for the project.\n\n1340.\n\nHowever, while Respondent placed great emphasis in its Post-Hearing Brief on the argument that the Feasibility Study did not include a financial plan \"*that could meet the strict requirements of Art. 1 of the CHEJVA and Rule 47 of the BMR*,\"1712 it also maintained its previous arguments, *i.e*., that there was no commitment on the part of Claimant's owners to actually fund the project, that the market appetite to provide third-party financing to the Reko Diq project was \"*very limited*,\" that the alleged environmental and social shortcomings in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study rendered the project ineligible for financing from multilateral and export credit agencies, and that the evidence in the record allegedly revealed that the project \"*would have faced deep issues if it tried to obtain financing*.\" According to Respondent, the issues it had identified meant that \"*financing would be rather hard to negotiate and guarantee, resulting in increased costs and/or a reduced chance of the project ever coming to fruition*.\"1713\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 295.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 297-301.\n\n1341.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that the arguments raised by Respondent in the quantum phase have already conclusively been dealt with in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. As noted in a more general manner in its Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, the Tribunal \"*did not make a finding in the liability phase that the Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project at the time. It only assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support of its position that denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on justifiable reasons*.\"1714 Similarly to the issues regarding water and metallurgy, which were explicitly discussed in the Decision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, as well as the question on security for the pipeline and the project in general, which was not explicitly discussed in that Decision, neither of the Parties presented any opinions from independent experts on the financeability of the project through third-party financing and/or equity financing by Claimant's owners in the liability phase as they have now done in the quantum phase.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Reconsideration Request, \u00b6 99.\n\n1342.\n\nThe Tribunal also did not address the impact that any remaining uncertainty as to whether and at what cost the project would have been financed had on the value of Claimant's investment. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis addressed the uncertainty regarding the nature of third-party financing by assuming all equity financing by Claimant's owners. Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that there is no evidence that the owners would have been willing or even able to provide 100% equity financing. These arguments were naturally raised only after Prof. Davis had presented his valuation model in the quantum phase of this proceeding. Consequently, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to make its conclusive findings on whether and, if so, at what cost the project would have obtained financing based on the Parties' completed written submissions and the hearing of the fact and expert witnesses during the Hearing on Quantum.\n\n1343.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Prof. Davis assumed all equity financing in his model, not because Claimant considered this to be the most likely financing scenario, but rather because Respondent had previously raised the argument that the failure to conclude a Mineral Agreement could have presented a risk to arrange external debt financing. In Prof. Davis' opinion, this assumption was conservative because if he \"*had prepared a model that included external borrowing, the interest tax deductions associated with debt financing would have increased the Project's value, even if* [he] *had then discounted that benefit to account for some risk that it would not materialize because the parties had failed to conclude a mineral agreement.*\"1715\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 191.\n\n1344.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has already reached the conclusion above that if the GOB had not decided to take over the project from Claimant in breach of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty, a Mineral Agreement providing in particular for fiscal stability would have been concluded after the mining lease was granted to TCCP. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to address in further detail Respondent's argument that Claimant's prospects of obtaining both third-party financing and full-equity funding for the project would have been \"*that much more remote*\" in the absence of a Mineral Agreement.1716\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 26\n\n1345.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Prof. Davis' assumption does not mean, however, that the Tribunal can dispense with assessing the Parties' arguments regarding the availability of third-party financing. Apart from the dispute between the Parties as to whether there was any commitment at all from Claimant's owners to provide equity funding for the project, which will be addressed in more detail below, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Antofagasta and Barrick would in fact have funded the project all by themselves if all attempts to arrange third-party funding failed. There is no indication to this effect in the Feasibility Study and all equity funding was apparently not contemplated at the time.\n\n1346.\n\nThe Chapter of the Feasibility Study on Financial Analysis, the contents of which will be addressed in more detail below, includes the following summary of project funding as assumed in the financial model attached to the Feasibility Study:1717\n\n**Table 29.1 Summary of Project Funding**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **US$M** |\n| **Equity contribution by the GOB** | **580** |\n| **- With own resources** | **0** |\n| **- With Equity Debt provided by TCCA** | **580** |\n| **Equity contribution by TCCA** | **1 740** |\n| **Third party loans** | **1 550** |\n| **Total funding** | **3 870** |\n| **- For start up capital cost** | **3 290** |\n| **- For certain taxes and financial expenses** | **580** |\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, Table 29.1.\n\n1347.\n\nThe same section also provides a summary of the Loans Terms as Considered in the Financial Analysis:\n\n**Table 29.2 Loans Terms as Considered in the Financial Analysis**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **Terms** |\n| Gearing ratio | 40% of total cash needs |\n| Principal amount | US$1 550  M - Agencies tranche: US$1 250 M - Commercial tranche: US$300 M |\n| Interest payment | Payable during the loans withdrawal period (4 years) and the principals repayment periods (9 and 6 years) |\n| Principal repayment | Agencies tranche: In 9 years starting the first year of commercial production Commercial tranche: In 6 years starting the first year of commercial production |\n| Interest rate | Libor + 5.0% |\n| Up front fee | 2% of principal amount |\n| Commitment fee | 1% of unwithdrawn principal amount |\n| Advisory expenses | US$30 M |\n| Withholding tax on interests | 0% |\n\n1348.\n\nIt is also noted that the 40% debt capacity was \"*estimated so that the commonly used debt coverage ratios are deemed to be acceptable to the lenders for loans as described in Table 29.2*\" and that the 40% debt capacity \"*is only indicative and for the purpose of performing the financial analysis of this FS*.\"1718\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1349.\n\nMr. Luksic testified in his second witness statement that \"[i]*n the very unlikely event that project-level financing was not available, Antofagasta and Barrick could have funded the project through corporate-level debt, whether bonds, loans, or some combination therefore, or through all equity*.\"1719 However, as Mr. Luksic himself confirmed both in his witness statement as well as at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Hearing on Quantum, Antofagasta and Barrick were contemplating to obtain third-party financing for a part of the project and the Tribunal cannot see sufficient indication in the contemporaneous record that both owners would have been ready to fund the entire project cost by themselves if project finance turned out to be unavailable for the project.\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6 9.\n\n1350.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will address two questions: (i) whether Claimant has established that its owners were able and willing to provide the contemplated amount of 60% equity funding to the project; and (ii) whether Claimant has further established that it could have financed the remaining amount of 40% of the project costs through limited recourse funding to be obtained from third parties. As Prof. Davis has not included the costs of project financing in his calculated model, the Tribunal will also assess whether he has accurately accounted for any remaining uncertainty as to the identity of the lenders and costs of financing for the project.\n\n**i. Whether Claimant Has Established That Its Owners Were Able and Willing to Provide the Contemplated Amount of Equity Funding to the Project**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1351.\n\nAs to the amount of equity funding contemplated in the Feasibility Study, there is common ground to the extent that the project did not reach the stage at which the boards of Claimant's owners Antofagasta and Barrick gave their approval to start executing the project and/or to formally commit the contemplated amounts of equity to the project. As pointed out by Respondent, the Forward Work Plan provided that the \"*Investment Decision*\" and \"*Project Commitment*\" would be made after the Feasibility Study and funding approval.1720\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-32**, p. 32-7.\n\n1352.\n\nThe question is therefore whether Claimant has established that Antofagasta and Barrick would have made the contemplated commitment in the absence of Respondent's Treaty breaches, *i.e*., if TCCP's Mining Lease Application had been granted in November 2011. In this regard, Claimant refers to the testimony of Antofagasta's chairman Mr. Luksic, who stated:\n\n\"*By the time we had completed our Feasibility Study in 2010, we had done all the work we needed to satisfy ourselves that this was an extremely attractive project. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was a mine that was worth building and that we wanted to be the ones to build it. My conversations with our partners at Barrick confirmed that they felt the same way and I would not have expected anything else. We had found what we had been looking for\u2014a world class deposit\u2014and we were eager to get to work.*\n\n*A large mine, of course, requires large capital expenditure but the economics of the Reko Diq project were sufficiently robust that we expected that we would be able to repay the initial investment in seven years, a comparatively short payback period. Once the payback period was over, we expected very healthy cash flows. Indeed, as I mentioned in Paris, the cost of production was very low, which meant that we would have had very attractive margins, even in times of depressed commodities prices, not to mention major profits in times when commodities prices were high.*\n\n*As I began to explain to the Tribunal in Paris, we had already started speaking informally to financial institutions and other investors about the project and found that there was a lot of interest among both groups in financing it. For example, I recall speaking to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and a few others, who all expressed interest. Although it was too early to enter into serious project financing negotiations, there was no doubt in my mind that financing was readily available. Antofagasta and Barrick are well-known and highly credit-worthy sponsors and I believe there are many banks and other investors who would have funded us. In the very unlikely event that project-level financing was not available, Antofagasta and Barrick could have funded the project through corporate-level debt, whether bonds, loans, or some combination thereof, or through all equity*.\"1721\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\n1353.\n\nWhile the Tribunal noted above that the contemporaneous record does not provide sufficient support for Mr. Luksic's statement that both Antofagasta and Barrick would in fact have been willing to provide 100% funding to the project if all attempts to secure third-party financing failed, Mr. Luksic's testimony makes clear that Antofagasta was committed to developing this project, including by providing equity funds to the project. In Respondent's view, however, Mr. Luksic's testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that 100% of the funds would be provided by Antofagasta and Barrick contradicted not only the contemplated financing structure in the Feasibility Study but also the testimony of Claimant's other witnesses.\n\n1354.\n\nMr. Luksic clarified in his oral testimony that his statement regarding the expectation that the initial investment would be paid back in seven years was based on an estimate of certain financing conditions in the Feasibility Study.1722 Mr. Luksic could not confirm, however, whether the weighted cost of capital to which Mr. Sep\u00falveda had referred in his explanations on the financial model of the Feasibility Study, also included the costs of third-party financing but merely presumed, confronted with a document he had not seen before, that the cost of capital he was looking at was based on pure equity financing. When asked whether it was his understanding at the time the Feasibility Study was drafted and submitted to the GOB that Antofagasta and Barrick would contribute 100% of the financing, Mr. Luksic stated: \"*I presume so. I don't remember exactly this particular issue*.\" More specifically, when asked whether it was his understanding that Antofagasta would have contributed USD 1.75 billion to finance the project, he clarified that Antofagasta \"*could have done it. Yes*\" but that there was no decision to do that because they \"*never got that far*.\"1723 Mr. Luksic then explained:\n\n\"*Q. Why would you have been talking to multilateral agencies and commercial banks and ECAs if the funds would have come from Antofagasta's treasury?*\n\n*A. It is not unusual when you're looking at a project that you, as owners, start with the first scenario, which is you looked at the possibility of all equity finance, and then you move to alternative financings, like bank financing, agency financing, and other mechanisms.*\n\n*So it's just a stage that you're at. And I presume they didn't have firm offers from banks to say--or to look at the Cost of Capital, Cost of Financing of the Project*.\"1724\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1282 lines 6-15.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1287 line 6 to p. 1291 line 9.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1291 lines 10-22.\n\n1355.\n\nDr. Luksic was then presented with an excerpt of Mr. Livesey's testimony at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability in which he had stated that \"*the owners were going to finance 60 percent of this from their own treasuries*,\" and testified as follows:\n\n\"*What I was trying to explain is that, looking at the other page, I didn't see the split between bank financing and the cost of bank financing that you were referring to, and so I took the view that probably that spreadsheet you showed me there was accounting for full equity financing.*\n\n*Now, of course, I'm sure that the company was already devising ways of financing this, and they were already thinking which could be, and a 60 percent owner's finance with a 40 percent bank or institution finance made sense, but my recollection is that we never got to the point where we had firm offers from banks. That's what I was saying. I may be wrong. Maybe there were.*\"1725\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1292 line 16 to p. 1294 line 5.\n\n1356.\n\nRespondent also referred to the testimony of Mr. Sep\u00falveda, Finance Manager at Antofagasta at the relevant time, who was involved in assembling the final version of the financial model for the Feasibility Study.1726 Mr. Sep\u00falveda testified about the efforts to obtain project financing, which will be discussed in more detail below, and was then asked whether there was any decision by the shareholders or the Board of Directors of Antofagasta to commit any actual amount to financing the development of Reko Diq. In response, Mr. Sep\u00falveda stated that \"*to my knowledge, the Feasibility Study says that 60 percent of the initial Capex was going to be funded by the shareholders, and never heard that Antofagasta wouldn't provide its pro rata for that capital*.\" He further confirmed his understanding that the plan was for Antofagasta and Barrick to each provide half of the 60% of USD 3.8 billion but that he did not recall \"*any written commitment in paper*\" and was not aware of a resolution of Antofagastas' shareholders or Board to commit 30% of the required capital costs to the project.1727 When asked where the 30% to be contributed by Antofagasta would have come from, he stated that \"*Antofagasta is a company that normally holds a lot of cash. Actually, if the the Board so decided, it could have financed the Project 100 percent in cash*.\" He also confirmed that \"[i]*f we approached the banks after obtaining the Mining Lease, it would have been with the commitment of Antofagasta to provide the funds*\" but that there had not yet been a mandate to look for the financing \"*because we didn't obtain the Mining Lease, and the Mining Lease was the main milestone to approach the banks*.\"1728\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 499 line 15 to p. 501 line 5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 501 line 6 to p. 502 line 13.\n\n1357.\n\nFinally, Respondent also referred to the testimony of Claimant's expert Mr. Pingle, who based his expert opinion on the assumption that 60% of costs would be funded by Sponsor Equity and further testified that, in his opinion, the remaining 40% could have been funded by ECAs, without additional sources of funding, as will discussed in more detail below.1729\n\nPingle Presentation, p. 8.\n\n1358.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is no contradiction between the testimony of Mr. Luksic and the contemplated financing structure in the Feasibility Study or the testimony of Claimant's other witnesses. Mr. Luksic made clear that while Antofagasta would have been able to do 100% equity financing, any presumption of full equity financing for the purposes of calculating the project's capital costs would have been due to the stage of the project in which financing offers from third parties were not yet available and the costs of financing were therefore not yet clear. Mr. Luksic also confirmed that the contemplated 60% owner finance plus a 40% bank or institution finance \"*made sense*\" but simply noted that the project had not yet proceeded to a stage where it had received firm offers from banks. Consequently, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the alleged contradictions would confirm the absence of a financial plan for the project.\n\n1359.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, Claimant has not submitted a document in which Antofagasta's Board of Directors or shareholders approved the commitment of an amount equal to 30% of the project's capital cost. Mr. Sep\u00falveda testified that he was not aware of such a document and that a confirmation of that commitment would have been required when approaching financing institutions for funding offers. He also emphasized that a mandate from Antofagasta to obtain funding offers would have come only after the mining lease was granted. Mr. Pingle likewise considered that it would have been premature to obtain the final commitment from Antofagasta's Board of Directors at the stage of the Reko Diq project. He explained:\n\n\"*Typically, the Board doesn't want to make a final commitment until both the equity and the--they can give approval for signing the loan documents as well. And they'll ask for that information. You'll have indications from the Board before that, but typically it doesn't go for final approval until you have a number of things in place that were not in place yet. So, it was premature, in my opinion, to take this to the Board of Directors for a final commitment*.\"1730\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2159 lines 7-16.\n\n1360.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the absence of an actual commitment of funds to the project therefore does not provide any indication that Antofagasta would not have been willing to make that commitment at the relevant time, *i.e*., after the Mining Lease Application was granted.\n\n1361.\n\nRespondent further argues that Antofagasta did not have a corporate credit rating and would therefore have faced difficulties to access international debt financing facilities, as a result of which it would have had to assign \"*almost half of its cash on hand to one project with all the risks described above and for an IRR near 12%.*\" Respondent claims that \"[n]*o reasonable board would have approved such a reckless commitment of the company's finances*.\"1731\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 388; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 386.\n\n1362.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent apparently does not dispute that Antofagasta would have had sufficient cash reserves to approve the contemplated equity funding for the project. That this was in fact the case was confirmed by Mr. Sep\u00falveda who testified that \"*if the Board so decided, it could have financed the Project 100 percent in cash*.\" Mr. Pingle also pointed out that the amounts of cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and undrawn lines of credit that were available to Antofagasta as of 31 December 2011 were considerably larger than the amount of USD 1.16 billion it would have had to contribute to the project.1732\n\nPingle, \u00b6\u00b6 146, 148.\n\n1363.\n\nRespondent rather claims that it would have been \"*reckless*\" for Antofagasta to commit this sum to the project, taking into account the various risks identified by Respondent in its submissions. Respondent's experts also expressed an opinion on Antofagasta's willingness to fund the project in their first report:\n\n\"*Given its more limited financial capacity, Antofagasta had one key development asset in 2011, which was the US$1.3B Antucoya development project. By comparison, the Project was noted by Antofagasta's management in their 2010 Annual Report as growth 'beyond the core business' and as an 'earlystage growth' opportunity \u2013 already signalling to capital markets that it was peripheral to their main corporate strategy. We do not see any clear evidence from Antofagasta's market disclosures and financial reporting that it was (i) undertaking any serious internal processes to commit existing capital to the Project, (ii) considering mitigating the inherent geopolitical risks that it would be exposed to if it directly equity funded the Project in a jurisdiction that it was very unfamiliar with or (iii) positioning the Project as a core part of its growth to raise its profile ahead of an institutional capital raising (either debt or equity). Given its conservative nature and its core corporate objectives \u2026, we do not believe that financing of its interest in the Project was being seriously considered at the time in question or that preparatory steps were being undertaken to mitigate subsisting financing risk that should have been very obvious to Antofagasta's management*.\"1733\n\nHenry/Howden I, Section 3.7.2.\n\n1364.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden further clarified with regard to Antofagasta that \"*I don't think I've ever made that statement, that it was not serious about going forward with the project. I'm saying that it was not serious about starting the funding for the Project at that point*.\"1734 When pointed to Antofagasta's 2011 annual report in which it is stated that \"[t]*he Group is seeking to develop the Reko Diq deposit in Pakistan via the Tethyan joint venture company. International arbitration has been initiated to protect Tethyan's legal rights in relation to the project*,\"1735 Dr. Howden maintained that \"*the fact that it's going through arbitration to obviously--as it says here, to help develop the project doesn't necessarily mean that that Project would be one of the first to be developed in its pipeline of opportunities. That's what I'm saying*.\" He maintained that \"*it wasn't serious about taking the Project forward in terms of its position in the pipeline of transactions*.\"1736\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2218 lines 4-7.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1023**, p. 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2222 line 9 to p. 2223 line 1.\n\n1365.\n\nMr. Pingle stated in his report that he had \"*no doubt that the Sponsors would have wanted to go forward with the development of the Project and would have committed to fund the equity portion of the Project financing*.\" He added that, in his experience, \"*it would be remarkable for the Sponsors to invest hundreds of millions of US$ on feasibility studies that demonstrated a world class reserve, low cost mining operations and the economic viability of the Project, only to abandon it.*\"1737 Specifically with regard to the alleged lack of clear evidence in Antofagasta's market disclosures that it was willing to finance the project, Mr. Pingle considered that this could not detract from the amounts already invested to demonstrate the profitability of the project. Mr. Pingle further stated that having reviewed the sponsors' financial statements, he had \"*no doubt that the Sponsors could have funded the Project at the corporate level, either with equity or some combination of equity and debt, had financing at the Project level been unavailable for some unforeseen reason*.\"1738\n\nPingle, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\nPingle, \u00b6 76.\n\n1366.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Pingle that the previous investments made by both Antofagasta and Barrick with regard to the exploration work, in particular the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, as well as their close involvement in the preparation of these Studies are a strong indication that they were committed to developing the project. Mr. Livesey described this at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability as follows: \"*Barrick and Antofagasta are backing this project all the way through. They made all the payments up to this point. It's, I think, perfectly reasonable to expect that TCC can obtain the technical and financial resources and experience to carry out the mining operation*.\"1739\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1225 line 22 to p. 1226 line 5.\n\n1367.\n\nWhile the Tribunal also appreciates the fact that the amount to be invested to actually build the mine would be considerably higher than the previously invested amounts, the Tribunal sees no indication that either of the sponsors was not serious about its commitment to the project, including the contemplated portion of equity funding. In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by the conclusion drawn by Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden's from Antofagasta's 2010 annual report, which listed the completion of the Reko Diq Feasibility Study and ESIA among certain items of \"*Growth beyond the Core Business*.\"1740 Dr. Howden himself clarified at the Hearing on Quantum that he was not questioning the seriousness of Antofagasta's intent to go forward with the project but rather considered that it \"*was not serious about starting the funding for the Project at that point*.\"1741\n\n**Exhibit MED-2**, p. 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2218 lines 4-7.\n\n1368.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal does not consider the absence of an actual commitment of funds to the project as an indication that Antofagasta would not have been willing to make that commitment at the relevant time. In the Tribunal's view, no conclusion to the contrary can be drawn from the excerpt of Antofagasta's 2010 annual report on which Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden relied.\n\n1369.\n\nIn addition to the previous investments made by both owners, the fact remains that the financial model of the Feasibility Study, which was prepared with the involvement of, *inter alia*, Mr. Sep\u00falveda for Antofagasta, expressly contemplated that the owners would contribute 60% equity. Mr. Livesey testified already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that \"[t]*he funding section of the Feasibility* [Study] *was put together primarily by the owners' teams back in Santiago and Toronto*,\"1742 which confirms that both owners were well aware of the assumptions underlying the financial model of the Feasibility Study. In the absence of any indication in the record that Antofagasta was not willing to contribute its share of the contemplated equity funding, the Tribunal sees no basis to doubt Antofagasta's willingness (or ability) to provide its 30% share of the project costs.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1218 lines 15-17.\n\n1370.\n\nAs for Barrick, Respondent acknowledged that it had \"*broader access to the debt markets in November 2011*\" but claims that its \"*rigid internal policies*\" would not have ermitted it to raise debt or spend cash on the Reko Diq project. Specifically, Respondent argues that \"*Barrick told its investors in 2011 that it was looking for projects with a return on equity of 22%. Reko Diq's financials were merely half of that*.\"1743 Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden expressed the following opinion on Barrick's willingness to fund the project:\n\n\"*With respect to its internal Treasury policy and decisionmaking processes, we note that Barrick maintained a series of rigorous internal risk controls with respect to market risks (commodity, FX &c.) as well as other nonmarket risks that could have involved the use of credit derivatives in order to mitigate counterparty risks. From an internal returns hurdle perspective, in its 2011 Annual Report, Barrick notes to its shareholders that it is achieving a 22% return on equity (2010 Barrick Annual Report: 19% RoE) and that a key management objective at this time was to maximise return on equity. On the basis of this key objective communicated to its shareholders, in context, Reko Diq'sproject return was only 11% as per the IMD FS. When taking the Project return into account along with its inherent frontier market risk being assumed to build such a project in Pakistan in 2011 and in the absence of project finance debt from the global debt market being genuinely available in order to bolster the return on equity allocated by TCC's sponsors, we do not believe that the Project would have passed the rigorous internal hurdles that Barrick describes in general terms to its shareholders. We note that, in Barrick's 2010 Annual Report, the Project did not rank among its advanced-stage projects that were being provided with capital commitments by internal treasury \u2013 putting this in context, by 2011, with the copper market already showing signs of weakness, it is our belief that the Project would still not have advanced through Barrick's internal treasury decision making process to be allocated committed capital \u2013 this means that, in all events, we believe that the Project would not have been advanced. Furthermore, beyond its internal hurdles and stated corporate objectives, we believe that the wider capital markets would have questioned why Barrick would develop an additional project beyond its existing project pipeline where the incremental gain would be only c.US$250M (Barrick's share of the Project NPV gain) compared to its share of capital expenditure outlayed being over US$1.5B on the Project*.\"1744\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 389; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 387.\n\nHenry/Howden I, Section 3.7.2.\n\n1371.\n\nMr. Pingle noted in his expert report that \"*IRR and return on equity are two different concepts*.\" He explained that an all-equity, Project IRR is unlevereaged and \"*designed to test project viability on a conservative basis*,\" *i.e*., without adding leverage that would increase the IRR; by contrast, return on equity is \"*an annual calculation based on earnings and shareholder equity*.\" Mr. Pingle further stated that the 22% return on equity that Barrick earned in 2011 was not stated in the annual report to be a \"*hurdle rate*\" for investment and was in any event \"*anomalously high both for the industry in that year and Barrick historically*.\" In his opinion, the suggestion that Barrick would have refused to finance a project with an IRR below 22% would be \"*not only speculative but also utterly implausible*.\"1745\n\nPingle, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n1372.\n\nMr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not respond to this argument in their second report. The Tribunal also notes that in the excerpt of Barrick's 2011 annual report submitted by Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden in support of their initial report, the President and CEO stated in his message to the shareholders that \"[c]*apturing the benefits of margin expansion and strong operating results, Barrick achieved a return on equity of 22% in 2011*.\"1746 As pointed out by Mr. Pingle, there is no indication in this excerpt that Barrick considered this return on equity achieved to be a hurdle rate for future investments. Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden themselves noted that the achieved return on equity was 3% higher than in 2010, which is in line with Mr. Pingle's testimony that the 2011 figure was extraordinarily high in 2011. In any event, Mr. Pingle explained why the IRR calculated in the Feasibility Study cannot be compared to an actual return on equity achieved. As will be discussed in further detail below, the Tribunal finds it plausible that the financial model of the Feasibility Study was not intended to capture the full value of the cash flows that Reko Diq would generate over the years but was designed to test whether the project was viable when applying conservative assumptions.\n\n**Exhibit MED-3**, p. 8.\n\n1373.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal again cannot accept the conclusion drawn by Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden from Barrick's annual reports and again sees no indication that Barrick was not willing to contribute its share of the equity financing contemplated in the Feasibility Study. In particular, the fact that Barrick had not yet ranked the Reko Diq project among the projects to which it committed capital from its internal treasury in its 2010 annual report does not provide an indication that Barrick was not serious about doing so at the relevant time, *i.e*., after the Mining Lease Application was granted.\n\n1374.\n\nThere was no dispute between the Parties that Barrick was able to provide the required funds. Mr. Pingle pointed to the amounts of cash and cash equivalents available to Barrick as of 31 December 2011 as well as a Credit Facility of USD 4 billion finalized by Barrick in January 2012.1747\n\nPingle, \u00b6 149.\n\n1375.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to doubt that Claimant's owners would have been willing and able to provide the contemplated amount of equity funding to the project.\n\n**ii. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Could Have Financed the Remaining Amount of the Project Costs Through Limited Recourse Funding**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1376.\n\nThe second question for the Tribunal to address is whether Claimant has established that it could have financed the remaining amount of the project's capital cost through limited recourse funding.\n\n1377.\n\nRespondent's experts, in their first report, reached the conclusion that \"*there was unlikely to be global debt market capacity to directly fund the Project based on 2011 market conditions,*\" relying in particular on the fact that another, more advanced copper-gold porphyry project in Oyu Tolgoi was in the process of obtaining financing from the same agencies and financing institutions in 2011. In addition, they expressed the opinion that \"*TCC had not yet completed a* 'bankable' *feasibility study and had not taken necessary steps to de-risk the Reko Diq project with respect to tenure (licencing and agreed fiscal terms)*\" and that therefore \"*a diligent mining finance institution would not have considered advancing a frontier market debt transaction based on the level of studies that had been undertaken.*\"1748\n\nHenry/Howden I, pp. 13-16.\n\n1378.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Pingle stated in his report that \"[t]*here was ample capacity in the market from ECAs and DFIs to finance* [the remaining 40%]\" and expressed the opinion that the Feasibility Study's financing chapter was \"*unduly conservative*\" as there was \"*ample liquidity among ECAs and DFIs, and there would have been no need for a commercial tranche, meaning that no commercial bank would be asked to consider taking Project or country risk*.\" He specifically rejected the argument that there was shortage of liquidity or capacity in the 2011-2012 period and presented contemporaneous statements and figures from various ECAs and DFIs in support of his opinion1749 Mr. Pingle further explained why, in his opinion, the financing for the Oyu Tolgoi project confirmed, rather than contradicted, the assumption that there was ample capacity in the market to also fund the Reko Diq project. Specifically, he stated:\n\n\"*I find the arguments of Respondent's Experts bizarre. Oyu Tolgoi does not show that Reko Diq could not have been financed. In fact, precisely the contrary is true. The successful financing of the Oyu Tolgoi project demonstrates that there was significant appetite and ample capacity for the financing of world-class mining projects, even in a challenging place like Mongolia, with an open pit mine dependent upon shipment by road to smelters in China, political turmoil, and no precedent of a large mining project in Mongolia. Oyu Tolgoi indicates that there was substantial financing capacity available, suggesting that Reko Diq could have secured the required financing*.\"1750\n\nPingle, \u00b6\u00b6 151-187.\n\nPingle, \u00b6\u00b6 188-196.\n\n1379.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not reiterate their argument that there was not sufficient capacity in the market to fund the project. They rather expressed the opinion that Claimant took \"*a very na\u00efve approach to debt finance and ma*[d] *e the critical error of believing that financial capacity of an institution is akin to willingness and credit approval to invest in a specific project in a specific jurisdiction*.\" They further considered that \"[s]*imply having the balance sheet capability to fund a project is irrelevant and ignores the process and internal requirements before funding can be committed. Further this* 'capacity concept' *ignores the requirement for ECA's to provide funding on the back of commercial contracts with national sponsors and, even then, funding is in most cases provided via commercial lenders with insurance cover from the ECA*.\"1751 In the absence of \"*any meaningful*\" engagement with commercial lenders during the period in question, they noted that \"*any conversations with ECAs would not have been materially advanced*.\" In addition, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden noted that \"[e]*ven if TCC's argument that the capacity of the DFIs and ECAs was sufficient to show appetite for funding, TCC has not shown that these institutions were deploying significant amounts into the mining space generally, let alone to a mining project in Pakistan specifically*.\"1752\n\nHenry/Howden II, p. 10.\n\nHenry/Howden II, pp. 10-11.\n\n1380.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Henry's and Dr. Howden's arguments make clear that they did not uphold their initial opinion that there was unlikely to be sufficient capacity in the global debt market to provide funding for the Reko Diq project. Their argument with regard to Oyu Tolgoi rather evolved towards the issue of concentration risk which might be a factor to be considered by agencies that were already involved with the Oyu Tolgoi project. They further rejected Mr. Pingle's opinion that no commercial tranche of funding would have been required and pointed out that \"*ECA financing can cover 85% of the contract value of the export of goods and services from the ECA's home country. The impact of this clause means that commercial lenders typically have 15% of the debt uninsured and therefore lenders take political and commercial risk on a substantial portion of the debt even where ECA cover is provided*.\"1753 Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden emphasized:\n\n\"*It must be remembered that commercial banks take full political and credit risk on the uninsured 15% of the debt and as such, like any typical credit institution, require full assessment of the project to repay the debt facility in full; ECA insurance is a risk mitigation tool for lenders and they cannot rely on this as the primary source of repayment.*\n\n*The process undertaken by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of a project is rigorous, time consuming and highly involved. To a certain extent, ECAs rely on the work of the lenders, but also have additional items they require to provide the insurance cover which can materially delay the project funding*.\"1754\n\nHenry/Howden II, pp. 13-14.\n\nHenry/Howden II, pp. 14-15.\n\n1381.\n\nMr. Henry and Dr. Howden considered that there was \"*no evidence that banks were, in fact, lining up to fund the Reko Diq project specifically*\" and noted that \"*TCC had barely started engaging with ECAs, DFIs and lenders to discuss funding for Reko Diq, a process that from our own experience can take many years of hard work to complete*.\" In particular, they referred to the process of structuring the financing for the Oyu Tolgoi project which took almost five years.1755\n\nHenry/Howden II, p. 16.\n\n1382.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimant had not yet received offers from any financing institutions but, as the Tribunal has already held in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and as was confirmed by Mr. Luksic and also Mr. Sep\u00falveda at the Hearing on Quantum, it would have been premature to approach financing institutions for specific offers before the mining lease was granted. The question can therefore only be a hypothetical one, *i.e*., whether Claimant could have obtained the necessary financing in the future if the mining lease had been granted in November 2011.\n\n1383.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the Feasibility Study states in this regard:\n\n\"*It is expected that the financing of the project will be possible yet particularly challenging, and that it will require Antofagasta and Barrick to provide guarantees until the project starts operations and reaches completion. It is likely that commercial appetite for the financing of the project will be limited; therefore, the anchor of the financing plan will be the multilateral agencies and export credit agencies (ECAs), with international and local commercial banks plus Islamic banks only contributing a small proportion of the financing. Among the multilateral agencies, it is anticipated that Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank will be approached, as well as the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Furthermore, the level of visibility of the procurement plan will allow the approach to certain ECAs such as JBIC, NEXI, KExim, KEIC, China Exim and European ECAs*.\"1756\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1384.\n\nMr. Pingle stated in his report that he considered this to be \"*an unduly pessimistic assessment*\" and did not believe that the financing of the project would have been \"*particularly challenging*\" or that a commercial bank tranche would have been necessary. In his opinion, the entire debt financing could have been obtained from ECAs and DFIs.1757 At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Pingle further stated that the necessary funding could have been provided by ECAs only, with DFIs as well as Islamic Banks and Funds being possible additional sources of funding.1758\n\nPingle, \u00b6 83.\n\nPingle Presentation, p. 8.\n\n1385.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Pingle agreed with Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden that the OECD Arrangement Terms allow ECAs to fund up to 85% of the contract value to be covered but noted that the remaining 15% were a \"*down payment*\" that was initially required to be paid out of equity and it was only later that banks started to lend these 15%. He added that \"*the Sponsors here have plenty of equity to fund that 15 percent down payment*.\"1759 He further explained that \"[t]*ypically 60 percent of a large mining project's Project Costs are eligible for ECA financing*\" and noted that together with the 60% equity from the project sponsors, this would already amount to 120% of the project costs.1760 Also referring to the DFIs and the Islamic Development Bank as a form of risk mitigation, Mr. Pingle stated that \"*there's a very limited role for commercial banks here*.\" In particular, he noted that even if commercial banks were funding loans covered by ECAs, they would be taking the risk of the country standing behind the ECA. Similarly, for the ADB or IFC B loans, their risk would be non-payment by the IFC or ADB and thus \"*a substantially different risk than an uncovered commercial loan would be*.\"1761 He concluded:\n\n\"*The commercial banks would not be central to the financing process or the project funding. There is an administrative role for the banks in terms of the ECAs, in terms of collecting drawdown documentation, submitting it for drawdown and getting payments. This is not a lending or a risk issue. And it's true in all of the countries where we're talking about ECAs. Any licensed commercial bank in that country can perform that function, including foreign banks licensed to do business in that country*.\"1762\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2119 line 18 to p. 2120 line 4.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2118 lines 17-19 and p. 2120 lines 8-11; Pingle Presentation, p. 8.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2123 line 10 to p. 2124 line 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2124 lines 4-14.\n\n1386.\n\nMr. Pingle clarified that he was not ruling out the possibility of any funding provided by commercial banks but rather the necessity of a tranche where commercial banks would be taking country risk. He explained:\n\n\"*If the ECAs only provided insurance, there could have been a commercial bank tranche. All of the institutions that are talked about can give direct loans, and people like U.S. EXIM Bank prefer to give direct loans, and during the financial crisis, direct loans were far more prevalent than--this is the period we're talking about here--were far more prevalent than the commercial bank loans because the commercial bank loans had a liquidity problem and the export credit agencies being government funded did not. So it would--I'm not ruling out the possibility, but it would have been less likely that there would have been any commercial bank funding*.\"1763\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2163 line 15 to p. 2164 line 5.\n\n1387.\n\nMr. Pingle emphasized that an ECA-insured tranche funded by a commercial bank was a \"*different category*\" than a commercial bank tranche and considered it \"*misleading to count it as a commercial bank tranche.*\" When pointed to the fact that the Feasibility Study had assumed a \"*Commercial tranche*\" of USD 300 million, in addition to an \"*Agencies tranche*\" of USD 1,250 million in its financial analysis,1764 Mr. Pingle maintained that \"*I don't happen to agree that they would have needed it*\" but confirmed that \"[t]*hat's what they considered they would use*.\" Mr. Pingle also confirmed that he did not agree with Mr. Sep\u00falveda as to whether ECAs would provide direct funding or insurance to commercial banks.1765 Mr. Sep\u00falveda had stated in this regard that \"*it's usual that you don't talk directly to the Export Credit Agencies. You do that through the banks because the ECAs provide insurance to commercial banks so that the commercial banks gives* [sic] *you the credit line. So, that is a normal practice.*\"1766\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, Table 29.2.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2166 line 7 to p. 2167 line 17.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 496 lines 16-21.\n\n1388.\n\nBefore addressing the differences in opinion expressed by the Parties' witnesses and experts, the Tribunal notes that it appears to be undisputed that Claimant could not have obtained uncovered commercial loans, *i.e*., without insurance or coverage by ECAs or DFIs. Mr. Pingle specifically confirmed that \"[w]*e never see the commercial banks taking uncovered risk in that area, and that's true--been true for the Philippines, it's been through for Indonesia. Now, as these countries have gotten more developed and so on, the situation has improved. But I don't believe that uncovered commercial risk would have been available for this Project, and if it had been, it would have been so short a term as to have been irrelevant*.\"1767\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2169 lines 13-22.\n\n1389.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden initially argued that the limit of 85% being funded by ECAs meant that the remaining 15% would have to be funded by commercial lenders at their own risk. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden agreed, however, that \"*the remaining amount* [can be] *provided in some form. It can be provided in equity, yes*.\"1768 He then stated that ECAs would normally insure only 95% of that 85% so that commercial banks would \"*still have to take a 5 percent risk on that portion of the debt being uninsured*.\" He clarified that there would \"*potentially be a portion that the banks will hold that is uninsured by the Export Credit Agency*\" but confirmed that he had not provided any support for this statement in his report.1769\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2254 lines 17-21.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2255 line 13 to p. 2256 line 8.\n\n1390.\n\nIn addition to the admitted lack of support for Dr. Howden's statement at the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal also sees no reason why such a 5% or other portion could not have been paid with equity rather than having to resort to an uninsured commercial loan which, according to Mr. Pingle, would not have been available on reasonable terms. Given the contemplated amount of equity to be contributed by the owners, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume that any limitation on the amount of funding provided by ECAs would have resulted in the necessity to obtain an uninsured commercial loan.\n\n1391.\n\nThe question is therefore whether Claimant would have been able to obtain financing from ECAs or insured by ECAs and/or DFIs. Dr. Howden agreed at the Hearing on Quantum that ECAs \"*can direct lend, but also lend via the commercial lenders covered by insurance*\" but maintained that \"*the idea that the DFIs and the ECAs themselves could have funded Reko Diq, in our view, is not grounded in the reality of the market*\" and that \"*you also then need the commercial lenders*.\" Specifically, he maintained that ECAs would \"*be generally looking to provide insurance to lenders rather than funding themselves*\" as a result of which \"*actual commercial banks would be involved in the transaction*.\"1770 Dr. Howden further presented the funding structure of the Oyu Tolgoi project and added:\n\n\"*So, in our view, the Reko Diq would have had a similar structure to the Oyu Togoi transaction which included, as I said, multilaterals, Export Credit Agencies, and lenders, as a group, to actually fully fund the Project*.\"1771\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2185 line 1 to p. 2187 line 2.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2188 lines 10-14. *See also* Howden Presentation, p. 4.\n\n1392.\n\nDr. Howden further emphasized that \"*we're talking about a long and slow process*\" consisting of \"*three distinct phases*,\" which he illustrated as follows:1772\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2191 lines 1-3; Howden Presentation, p. 6.\n\n1393.\n\nHe further testified that \"*given the testimony we heard on Day 2 from Mr. Sep\u00falveda, Reko Diq was--the Sponsors were, at that point here, right at the beginning of the process. They had just engaged with lenders. They had not gone through any of the standard review processes or the mandating of any of the lenders to actually structure the transaction on their behalf*.\"1773\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2192 lines 4-10.\n\n1394.\n\nWith regard to the timing issue raised by Dr. Howden, the Tribunal agrees that the time period it took for the Oyu Tolgoi project to finalize the structure of its debt financing could indeed be considered significant in that it may indicate a potential significant delay that the Reko Diq project could also have faced. However, the Tribunal also takes note of Dr. Howden's testimony that for the Oyu Tolgoi project, \"*the first phase was completely funded by equity. The second phase was when the banks came in*.\"1774 This indicates that construction of the Oyu Tolgoi project could commence and proceed while the negotiations on the debt financing were still ongoing. Also taking into account that Dr. Howden considered it likely that the funding for Reko Diq would have had a similar structure as Oyu Tolgoi, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that ongoing negotiations on the structure of the debt financing for Reko Diq would not have delayed the project beyond the delays modeled by Prof. Davis as construction could have commenced based on the 60% equity contribution by Claimant's owners.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2223 lines 9-10.\n\n1395.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Pingle's testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that while the delay in finalizing the financing for Oyu Tolgoi was caused in part by a change in the financing concept, he did not believe that the delays were caused by financing issues but rather because certain financing commitments expired and had to be re-established due to delays caused by other factors.1775 This testimony was not called into question by Respondent or its experts. Taking into account that the delays modeled by Prof. Davis, which were based on data for a considerable number of copper mines around the world, the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that these delays did not also account for the risk of delays in finalizing external debt financing.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2131 line 4 to p. 2132 line 20.\n\n1396.\n\nThe Tribunal further does not consider it necessary to express an opinion on the disagreement between Mr. Pingle and Dr. Howden as to the likeliness of commercial lenders being involved as funders of ECA-insured loans rather than direct funding by the ECAs themselves. There is no dispute that under either approach, the relevant risks of the project would have been allocated to the ECAs and not the commercial banks. While Dr. Howden placed emphasis on the fact that the likeliness of funding depended on the review and approval by the credit committees of commercial banks, the Tribunal is not convinced that the requirements would have been significantly different from those imposed by ECAs giving direct loans. The real disagreement appears to be whether the ECAs and/or a credit committee from a commercial bank would have shared the concerns raised by Respondent's experts on which Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden relied in their opinion.\n\n1397.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden referred to \"*a number of red* flags\" that \"*would have potentially led to the transaction not being approved by the banks.*\" In this regard, Dr. Howden referred to: (i) the \"[a]*vailability of water resources and rights & transnational impacts*\"; (ii) \"[l]*ack of clear fiscal terms to determine cashflows*\"; (iii) \"[s]*ecurity risks to pipeline from which revenues used to repay the debt come from*\"; and (iv) \"[s]*ecurity of tenure risk due to lack of a mining lease*.\"1776 On that basis, Dr. Howden concluded that \"*in our view, that would mean that at this point in time, given what the Project was, that it was very unlikely that a credit committee of a mining finance bank would actually approve a transaction to lend to the project*.\" He added that \"*in the current form, the Project was not bankable, which would impact any quantification on the value*.\"1777\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2196 lines 9-12; Howden Presentation, p. 7.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2197 lines 10-18.\n\n1398.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the \"*red flags*\" identified by Dr. Howden show that his opinion was based on the one hand on the \"*as is*\" situation of the project in November 2011 in which it did not have a mining lease and on the other hand on the assumption that the water, environmental and security concerns raised by Respondent's experts would have been shared by lenders. As stated in their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden considered that \"*at the time in question, \u2026 there were clear issues around technical merits, fiscal regime, security, and water etc. that would have needed to be comprehensively resolved in the eyes of diligent Mining Finance institutions before debt could be advanced to Reko Diq,*\" referring in particular to environmental issues raised by Ms. Filas and issues regarding the security of the project site and the pipeline.1778\n\nHenry/Howden II, p. 17.\n\n1399.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls that it has addressed all of the aspects referred to by Dr. Howden in detail above. In particular, the Tribunal was not convinced by Ms. Filas' and Dr. Connor's opinion that the ESIA failed to conform the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards nor by their further criticisms regarding alleged environmental and social impact issues that they considered to be insufficiently addressed in the ESIA. As Ms. Cessford testified at the Hearing on Quantum, it was to be expected that potential lenders would require certain additional work on the ESIA but the Tribunal sees no indication based on its findings above that any of the alleged issues would have prevented lenders from considering funding for the project.\n\n1400.\n\nThe Tribual has also concluded that none of the issues raised by Prof. Spiller or Dr. Nanni would have affected the feasibility of Claimant's plan for the supply of water for the project. In addition, it concluded that while Claimant apparently did not account for potential extra costs associated with having to implement an aquifer injection system to mitigate possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan, these costs would not have affected the value of the Reko Diq project from the perspective of a buyer in November 2011. Consequently, even if lenders had required Claimant to include a cost estimate for this mitigation measure, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have been a \"red flag\" preventing lenders from providing funding to the project.\n\n1401.\n\nThe Tribunal further concluded that Claimant's security plans for the project's central facilities would have been considered adequate for a project at the development stage of Reko Diq. With regard to the pipeline, the Tribunal also considered Claimant's security plan adequate for the development stage of the project and noted that if the risks turned out to be higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt its security plan and react to the new level of threat. The Tribunal further maintained the conclusion it had already drawn in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that not all risks could be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage and that the risk mitigation strategy would evolve over time. This might also involve the development of additional security measures following discussions with lenders but the Tribunal is not convinced that these issues would have prevented lenders from considering funding for the project.\n\n1402.\n\nAs for the lack of clear fiscal terms, the Tribunal refers to its conclusion that in the absence of Respondent's Treaty breaches, a Mineral Agreement providing, *inter alia*, for fiscal stability would have been concluded. In this regard, the Tribunal also recalls Mr. Pingle's statement that the involvement of lenders such as ECAs and/or DFIs often facilitates the conclusion of an agreement providing for fiscal stability with the host Government.1779 Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not dispute that statement and the Tribunal therefore has no basis to assume that the absence of a Mineral Agreement would have been considered a \"*red flag*\" in that it would have prevented ECAs and DFIs from considering funding for the project. This conclusion is also confirmed by Mr. Sep\u00falveda's testimony regarding the approach to obtaining project finance. In addition to the mining lease which he described as the \"*main milestone*,\" Mr. Sep\u00falveda explained that \"*with the banks, especially--or probably the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the ECAs,* [we] *form a team, and, together with these banks and the GoB, form a table with the GoP to make progress in the Mineral Agreement. So, that was the strategy of the financing*.\"1780\n\nPingle, \u00b6 216.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 495 lines 8-13.\n\n1403.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the lack of tenure due to the absence of a mining lease must be eliminated in the but-for scenario and is therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal's present assessment.\n\n1404.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal is not convinced that any of the \"*red flags*\" identified by Dr. Howden would have led the relevant committees of ECAs, DFIs and/or commercial lenders not to approve funding for the project.\n\n1405.\n\nWhile this may not be sufficient in itself to draw the opposite conclusion, *i.e*., that the relevant committees would in fact have approved funding for the project, the Tribunal recalls that Claimant's owners were contemplating to contribute 60% equity to the project. Dr. Howden confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that this was \"*a significant percentage.*\"1781 He also confirmed that the amount of equity they are putting in would be relevant to the lenders' assessment but noted that \"*it's a function of how much the project can withstand*.\" He explained that \"[i]*f somebody is putting in more equity* [than in a typical project *], it is either a function of the fact that the Project can't support the 60 percent of the debt or they are prepared to provide more equity to make it more amenable to the banks.*\"1782\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2213 lines 18-19.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2251 line 2 to p. 2252 line 10.\n\n1406.\n\nWhile Dr. Howden's testimony indicates that he considered the contribution of 60% equity by the owners ambiguous in that it could also mean that the project would not be economic if it had to take more than 40% debt, the Tribunal is not convinced that any such indication would outweigh the obvious positive factors associated with this level of commitment by the project sponsors. Mr. Pingle emphasized at the Hearing on Quantum that, in his opinion, \"*the most important single issue in a project is the Sponsors, their capability, their experience, and the amount of money they are committing*.\" Referring to a usual range of 35% to 45% equity, Mr. Pingle considered that the commitment to contribute 60% \"*demonstrates a high level of confidence in the Project*.\"1783\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 7), p. 2113 lines 4-18.\n\n1407.\n\nIn his report, Mr. Pingle already stated that \"[o]*ver my entire 40+ year career, I have never witnessed a project in which a sponsor was committing 60% of project costs as equity, in excess of US$2.0 billion in cash, that failed to secure financing for technical reasons or because the lenders' engineer took issue with the project's technical work*.\"1784\n\nPingle, \u00b6 33.\n\n1408.\n\nMr. Pingle further explained what he considered to be important factors in limited recourse project financing: (i) \"[t]*he identity of the project sponsors and their managerial, technical and financial capability and experience with similar projects in comparable locations*\"; (ii) \"[t]*he commitment of the project sponsors and their equity contribution*,\" with mining projects typically requiring, in his experience, between 35% to 45% equity; (iii) \"[a] *Feasibility Study that objectively and comprehensively confirms the Resource quality, quantity, and ease of mining. Lenders will consider the quality of the development program and the extensive analysis and confirmation work completed by internationally recognized consulting firms that established the existence of the mineral deposit to be mined*\"; and (iv) \"[a] *Financial Model that establishes that production can be produced and sold under reasonable price scenarios likely to be encountered and that cash flows are robust in the Base Case scenario*.\"1785\n\nPingle, \u00b6 39.\n\n1409.\n\nAs pointed out by Mr. Pingle, Antofagasta was one of the ten largest copper miners in the world as of the valuation date, operating four copper mines in the Atacama Desert in Chile as well as managing a transportation network, a water purification and distribution company and Antofagasta port. Barrick was the world's largest gold producer as of the valuation date, operating 26 mines in nine countries on five continents, including a mine located in the Peruvian Andes and a mine in the Enga Province of Papua New Guinea.1786 Teams from both companies had been involved in the exploration work and the preparation of the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which had cost an amount of more than USD 240 million and were carried out with the assistance of numerous independent and internationally recognized consultants. Antofagasta and Barrick were further committed to contribute 60% of the total project costs, *i.e*., an amount of over USD 2.3 billion, and would be seeking funding for the remaining 40%.\n\n*Cf*. Pingle, \u00b6\u00b6 42-51.\n\n1410.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden dismissed the argument that Claimant had the full support of its sponsors by arguing that \"[h]*istorical sunk expenditure on exploration and feasibility work is irrelevant, with future sponsor commitment being more of a concern for debt providers*.\" Specifically with regard to the contemplated commitment of 60% equity, they considered that \"[t]*his point has no merit and goes against the core discipline of limited recourse project finance which is standalone assessment of the project to repay the debt, including mitigation of any risks to production or sale of the commodity (i.e. technical risks, water risks and security).*\" Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden then reiterated their arguments regarding the absence of a firm commitment of the sponsors or an indication that the project was \"*next in line for development,*\"1787 which have already been addressed above.\n\nHenry/Howden II, pp. 8, 18.\n\n1411.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Henry's and Dr. Howden's opinion. First, the Tribunal does not accept the argument that the amounts invested by Antofagasta and Barrick on the exploration work and preparation of the Studies would be considered irrelevant in determining whether they were committed to the development of the project. Sunk costs may be irrelevant to a DCF valuation, but they are evidence of the commitment of the owners. In addition, and while agreeing with Respondent's experts to the extent that the future commitment of the sponsors may indeed be the more relevant aspect to consider, it is not plausible that a commitment to contribute 60% equity would be considered irrelevant by potential lenders due to the limited recourse nature of the comtemplated financing.\n\n1412.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Feasibility Study explicitly contemplated that Antofagasta and Barrick would have to \"*provide guarantees until the project starts operations and reaches completion*\" and that it would then be \"*a long term financing based upon the projected cash flows of the project during the operation phase and after reaching completion, rather than upon the balance sheets of the sponsors.*\"1788 In any event, the Tribunal also does not accept the suggestion that a commitment to contribute 60% equity to a project would be irrelevant even to limited recourse financing. Even if the sponsors do not provide guarantees or other types of direct collateral to the lenders, the fact that they are willing to commit more than USD 2 billion of their own funds to the project and are thus very much interested in making this project a success, will surely increase the level of confidence that a lender would have in the project.\n\n**Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 29-5.\n\n1413.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from its initial conclusion that it is improbable that Antofagasta and Barrick would not have been able to obtain third-party financing. Based on the evidence now in the record, the Tribunal is further convinced that if the Mining Lease Application had been granted, Claimant and its owners would have been able to obtain the contemplated project financing.\n\n1414.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to make a finding as to the precise identity of the lenders, including the question whether ECAs would have provided direct funding or would have insured commercial loans as well as whether certain DFIs would also have been part of the lender group. It is undisputed that the initial conversations with potential lenders did not progress to a stage where specific lending terms were discussed.\n\n1415.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the Asian Development Bank, Mr. Luksic testified that they \"*were discussing just the principal ideas and their appetite and the possibility of them joining us in this Project. And my recollection is that they were very positive about it.*\"1789 Mr. Sep\u00falveda also testified that while there were \"*recurrent conversations*\" with banks with whom they had relationships, such as \"*with Japanese banks, with French banks, \u2026 with China Development Bank, \u2026 with Citibank, Standard Charter, American banks also*,\" \"*the main conclusion was, first, obtain the Mining Lease, and then go and get financing*.\"1790 He further confirmed that \"[w]*e didn't talk about the rates. What we discussed was about who would be the lenders, and what would be the strategy to approach the lenders*.\"1791\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1299 line 14 to p. 1300 line 1.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 496 lines 4-13.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 497 line 22 to p. 498 line 2.\n\n1416.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal considers it undisputed that as of the valuation date, it was not yet clear from which lenders and at which cost Claimant would obtain financing for the 40% debt portion. As confirmed by Mr. Luksic, the loan terms underlying the financial analysis in the Feasibility Study were an estimate of what they considered to be reasonable terms of financing at the time.\n\n1417.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal to address is therefore whether the remaining uncertainty as to the actual costs of debt financing were adequately accounted for by Prof. Davis in his valuation model. As noted above, Prof. Davis explained in his first report that due to the uncertainties regarding external debt financing, his valuation assumed all equity financing. In his opinion, this assumption was conservative as external borrowing would have resulted in interest tax deductions and thereby increased the project's value.1792\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 191.\n\n1418.\n\nNeither Respondent nor its experts disputed the statement that assuming all equity financing resulted in higher costs than assuming 40% debt financing. In particular, there has been no allegation that the cost of obtaining debt financing from ECAs and/or DFIs and/or commercial banks insured by ECAs would have been higher than the cost of equity applied by Prof. Davis. To the contrary, Respondent asked Mr. Sep\u00falveda to confirm at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*as a matter of corporate finance, the Cost of Equity is higher than the Cost of Financing*\" to which Mr. Sep\u00falveda responded that \"[i]*t usually is, yes*\" and confirmed that he did not think that this case would be an exception.1793\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 2), p. 499 lines 4-10.\n\n1419.\n\nIn the absence of any dispute that the costs for all equity financing as assumed by Prof. Davis were higher than the costs for the contemplated combined equity and external debt financing, it is also apparent that any external debt financing obtained by Claimant and its owners would only have served to decrease but not to increase the costs assumed by Prof. Davis in his model. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to make a finding as to the likely actual costs of the debt financing because the remaining uncertainty regarding these costs has been sufficiently accounted for by Prof. Davis' assumption of all equity financing.\n\n1420.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has established that it could have obtained the necessary financing for the project and that Prof. Davis has adequately accounted for the associated with financing, including the uncertainty as to the precise identity of the lenders and the terms at which they would provide funding to the project.\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1421.\n\nFor the reasons set out in detail above and based on its review and evaluation of the evidentiary record, the Tribunal considers it established that Claimant would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Federal and Provincial Governments, and further that Claimant has established the feasibility and financeability of the project. In particular, the Tribunal made the following findings:\n\n1) *Mineral Agreement and fiscal terms* : Claimant would most likely have reached agreement with the Governments on the terms of the Mineral Agreement, but these terms would have differed to a certain extent from the terms assumed by Prof. Davis in his main valuation. Specifically, the terms would most likely have included: (i) a sliding scale of royalties increasing from 2.5% to 4% over the life of the mine, thereby reducing Claimant's damages by USD 287 million; and (ii) a provision regarding the renewal of the Mining Lease; however, a buyer would have factored in the risk that the Mining Lease might not be renewed or might not be renewed on the same terms, thereby reducing Claimant's damages by a further USD 744.5 million.\n\n2) *Estimation and classification of resources* : Claimant has established that the estimation and classification of the resources reported in the Feasibility Study, which formed the basis for Prof. Davis' valuation of Claimant's damage, is in accordance with industry practice and corresponded to an exercise of \"good judgment\" by the relevant Competent Persons within Barrick and Antofagasta who adopted and implemented the method, which Mr. Rossi had proposed upon his review of the methods previously applied by Claimant's two owners in March 2009.\n\n3) *Metallurgical sampling and testing* : Claimant has established that the metallurgical sampling was adequate and in line with industry standards. The Tribunal further has no reason to believe that the metallurgical testing conducted by AMMTEC was inadequate or that such tests showed variability that would have affected the value attributed by a willing buyer to Claimant's investment.\n\n4) *Project execution* : The Tribunal has no reason to believe that Claimant's plans for executing the project and the capital cost estimate, as adjusted by Prof. Davis, would have been considered inadequate by a buyer in November 2011.\n\n5) *Water supply* : Claimant has established that none of the issues raised by Respondent would have affected the feasibility of Claimant's plan for the supply of water to the project. While it appears to the Tribunal that Claimant has not accounted for the potential extra costs associated with having to implement an aquifer injection system to mitigate possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan, the Tribunal does not consider that this would have affected the value of the Reko Diq project from the perspective of a buyer in November 2011.\n\n6) *Security risks* : Claimant has established that its security plans for the project would have been considered adequate for a project at the development stage of Reko Diq and that, if particularly the risks affecting the pipeline turned out to be higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt its security plan and react to the new level of threat. However, the Tribunal concluded that in order to adequately capture the residual risk caused by political violence, a buyer would have applied a higher annual probability of permanent shutdown than assumed by Prof. Davis in his valuation model, thereby reducing Claimant's damages by USD 711.5 million.\n\n7) *Environmental and social impacts* : Claimant has established that it adequately addressed the environmental and social impacts of the project. The Tribunal is not convinced that any of the alleged non-conformities of the ESIA with the relevant environmental standards and regulatory requirements would have caused significant additional work and/or costs for which Claimant should have accounted in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study. The Tribunal also has no basis to assume that a lender would have considered the cost that Claimant contemplated to spend on the community programs it had described insufficient. However, Claimant itself based its submission regarding the amounts it intended to spend for community programs on a revised offer of 4 October 2010 which included certain additional community initiatives beyond the costs reflected in the Feasibility Study and Prof. Davis' model, which reduces Claimant's damages by USD 100 million.\n\n8) *Permits and land rights* : Claimant has established that the delays modeled by Prof. Davis in his valuation to account for potential difficulties in obtaining relevant permits and/or land rights would have been considered sufficient by a buyer as of the valuation date.\n\n9) *Financing* : Claimant has established that it could have obtained the necessary financing for the project. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Claimant's owners would have been willing and able to contribute the contemplated amount of equity funding to the project and that, if the Mining Lease Application had been granted, Claimant and its owners would have been able to obtain the contemplated project financing for the remaining portion of the project costs. While it was not yet certain which lenders would provide funding and at what terms, Prof. Davis has adequately accounted for this uncertainty by assuming the higher costs of all equity financing.\n\n1422.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that in order to account for the risks and concerns addressed in detail above, Claimant's damages must be reduced by an amount of USD 1,843 million.\n\n**D. Value of Claimant's Investment**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1423.\n\nHaving assessed the risks and issues raised by Respondent regarding the feasibility and profitability of the project, the Tribunal will now assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for all relevant systematic and asymmetric risks of the project.\n\n1424.\n\nCertain asymmetric risks, such as the risk of an early shut-down of the mine or delays in commencing construction and operations of the mine, have already been addressed in detail above. However, the Tribunal still has to assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately addressed the systematic risk arising from, in particular, the fluctuation of prices for gold, copper and oil. More generally, the Tribunal will also address the question whether Claimant has established that Prof. Davis has accounted for all relevant systematic and asymmetric risks in his projection of future cash flows, including country risk, thereby justifying a risk-free discount rate which only accounts for the time value of money, or whether certain additional adjustments are warranted to fully capture the risks of the project as of November 2011.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1425.\n\nClaimant submits that Prof. Davis appropriately discounted the project's future cash flows for both systematic and asymmetric risks as well as for the time value of money. As for systematic risk, Claimant explains that Prof. Davis applied risk-adjusted cash flows derived from futures and forward prices; it argues that \"[b]*ecause buyers in the forward market are exposed to systematic risk, the prices in futures contracts are already discounted for systematic risk.*\"1794\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 320-321, 323; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 205.\n\n1426.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's allegation that the cash flows in Prof. Davis' model are the same as the cash flows in the DCF model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Claimant refers to Prof. Davis who testified that there are \"*clear and large differences*\" between the copper and gold revenues in the two models and demonstrated that the capital costs in his model are approximately 40% higher than in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.1795\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 324-325, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 107 *and referring to* Figures 2, 3 and 4.\n\n1427.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent's experts, for the purposes of their comparison, \"*arbitrarily reduced the EXP Pre-Feasibility Study prices by 20% below the base assumption,*\" initially without providing any explanation. As for the explanation provided by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells in their second report that the change was \"*a short cut to compensate for the fact that real output prices in the SNC-Lavalin* [scenario] *are indeed higher than those of Brattle and the former does not include the government equity take and risk adjustments*,\" Claimant considers that it \"*makes no sense*\" as the government equity take could have been accounted for by taking 75% of each year's cash flows. In addition, Claimant contends that their reference to higher \"*real output prices*\" in fact demonstrates that Prof. Davis indeed used risk-adjusted prices.1796\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 326-328, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 19 and note 24, Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 91 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2615, 2618, 2628.\n\n1428.\n\nClaimant also rejects Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' argument that they \"*normalized*\" the model in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, noting that Mr. Brailovsky acknowledged at the Hearing on Quantum that there was initially an average difference of USD 3.8 billion in gross revenues, which he \"*assumed away by setting the prices equal to each other*.\" According to Claimant, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells thereby effectively assumed away the systematic risk discount applied by Prof. Davis; they also admitted that they were not trying to test with that exercise whether Prof. Davis' figures were discounted for systematic risk.1797\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 329, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 3 and Graph 5 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2636-2637.\n\n1429.\n\nIn any event, Claimant considers that the \"*normalized*\" model still \"*differs significantly*\" from Prof. Davis' model, as demonstrated by the table presented by Mr. Brailovksy and Prof. Wells in their second report. According to Claimant, the copper and gold revenues are \"*radically different between the models, with the copper revenues nearly 40% higher and the gold revenue more than 50% lower in the* 'normalized' *model*.\" Claimant also points to the expenditure estimates which \"*vary widely, with around 10% higher Opex estimates and 27% lower Capex estimates in the* 'normalized' *model*.\"1798 In addition, Claimant notes that by contrast to Prof. Davis, Respondent's experts did not update the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study model, which dated from June 2010, to the valuation date even though Prof. Wells conceded that the prices and price expectations \"*were quite materially different*.\" They also did not contest that Prof. Davis' approach to updating the model was appropriate, which shows an \"*even greater*\" difference in cash flows between the updated model and Prof. Davis' risk-adjusted cash flows.1799\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 330, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 3.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 332-335, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2628-2619, 2381-2382, 2661, *and* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 301-302, **Exhibits CE-1556, CE-1779** ***and*** **CE-1779**, Davis Presentation, p. 38.\n\n1430.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that contrary to Mr. Brailovsky's suggestion at the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis did not apply in his update the spot prices on the valuation date but rather the (lower) average of the price projections used by mining companies in publicly available reports at the time.1800\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 337-338, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2655 *and referring to* Davis I, Workpaper 18 *and* Davis II, Workpaper R-18.\n\n1431.\n\nClaimant further rejects the allegation that Prof. Davis' model implies a 4.2% discount rate, which would be only 1.2 percentage points above the risk-free rate. According to Claimant, Respondent's experts in their reverse engineering exercise fail to back out even some of the significant asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis, such as the risks of cost overruns and ramp-up delay. Claimant contends that accurately backing out these risks would produce a higher a discount rate but argues that in any event, Respondent has not provided any basis for its claim that 4.2% is a low number for discount-rate equivalents of asymmetric risks in mining projects.1801\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 340-341, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 4, *and* Davis II, Workpaper R-1 and \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n1432.\n\nMore importantly, Claimant contends that Mr. Brailovky's and Prof. Wells' exercise does not quantify the discount for systematic risk, which Prof. Davis discounted separately from asymmetric risk. Claimant refers to Prof. Davis' explanation that backing out systematic risk would lead to a still higher discount rate but that it \"*is not possible reliably to derive this missing figure*\" due to the difficulties in attempting to \"*estimate the actual spot prices for copper, gold, and oil that the project would be exposed to*.\" Claimant further quotes from Prof. Davis' explanation that this is \"[o]*ne of the reasons that this modern approach has gained traction and is demanded by industry \u2026 because it obviates the need to calculate that unknowable number*.\"1802\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 342-344, *referring to* Davis Presentation, pp. 41, 43 *and quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2511-2512.\n\n1433.\n\nAs a result, Claimant claims that Respondent's experts cannot calcute an implied discount rate for Prof. Davis' valuation. Claimant maintains, however, that the discount for systematic risk \"*is likely to be significant*\" as it encompasses the risks regarding price fluctuations, with a \"*massive*\" range of variability around the prices for copper, gold and oil.1803\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 345-346.\n\n1434.\n\nClaimant further submits that Prof. Davis' approach of using risk-adjusted prices from the futures and forward markets is appropriate and fully accounts for the systematic risk of the project arising from its exposure to price uncertainty. Claimant emphasizes that Prof. Davis has not modeled what *actual* future prices are likely to be but rather what future prices are likely to be *on a risk-adjusted basis* and adds that forward market prices \"*are the market's actual risk-adjusted expectations of what future prices will be*.\" It argues that \"[t]*he market prices combine the market's average price expectation with the market's pricing of the associated uncertainty, creating a reliable and market-based way to account for systematic risk*.\" Claimant refers to Prof. Davis' explanation that the use of risk-adjusted prices is \"[o]*ne of the core advantages of the modern DCF method*\" as it eliminates the need to forecast spot commodity prices and enables him to use prices that are \"*directly observable in the futures market for shorter maturities and can be estimated using accepted models for longer maturities*.\"1804\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 347-348, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 223-224, 227, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 120, 59.\n\n1435.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the fact that futures prices incorporate systemic risk is supported by the academic literature and was also accepted by Prof. Wells, at least for oil, at the Hearing on Quantum. Claimant contends that using forward prices is also an accepted practice for valuation in the mining industry and refers to a report from CIMVal in 2012 that \"*in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast may be derived from its forward price curve*\" as the \"*forward price is considered a risk-adjusted expected price*.\"1805\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 349-350, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1764**, p. 793 (admitted *de bene esse*), Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2697 *and quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 10.\n\n1436.\n\nClaimant submits that Prof. Davis' approach is consistent with industry practice and explains that for gold, he used futures prices and quotes on forward markets for the first ten years and then extended the prices out by using formulas derived from the market data together with statistical computations to simulate \"*the wide range of potential future price scenarios*.\"1806 Claimant emphasizes that Prof. Davis did not model a fixed or \"*static*\" projected price at each point in the future but rather took a probabilistic approach, modelling a range of prices that might occur at each future point in time. Claimant notes that Respondent's experts agreed with taking a probabilistic approach and raised only very narrow criticisms, focusing on Prof. Davis' modeling of risk-adjusted gold prices.1807\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 351.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 206-207, 213-214, *referring to* Davis I, Appendix C and Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 143, 83.\n\n1437.\n\nAs for the argument raised in Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' first report that it was inappropriate to rely on forward market prices because Claimant could not have sold its entire expected production into the market, Claimant emphasizes that such an assumption does not form part of Prof. Davis' model which rather simulates sales of the mine's output in the future over the life of the mine \"*under a wide range of potential scenarios for what the prices in those future years might be*.\" Claimant explains that the risk-adjustment in Prof. Davis' prices is not derived from prices being locked in through actual forward market transactions but rather from the fact that they \"*reflect*[] *both the market's forecasted price of copper and the market's risk preferences over the uncertainty in that forecast*,\" revealing \"*the net result of these two items, the risk-adjusted forecasted price*.\"1808\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 217-220, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6\u00b6 96-101, 218-222 *and quoting from* \u00b6 90, note 97.\n\n1438.\n\nClaimant further rejects the argument raised by Respondent's experts that Prof. Davis should have used analysts' predictions for the gold price (but not the copper price), emphasizing that analysts do not forecast risk-adjusted prices or the average or expected value at particular future times and maintaining that \"*market prices are the best, and indeed only options for risk-adjusted prices*.\"1809 In addition, Claimant claims that analyst forecasts are \"*materially inaccurate*\" and refers to Prof. Davis' illustration of the fact that the Consensus Economics forecast relied on by Respondent's experts consistently under-predicted actual future gold prices when the market was rising; they also over-predicted prices when the market was falling. Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis' testimony that analyst prices \"*are not even traded prices. \u2026 They are just projections of something, and we are not sure what they are*\" and that he was not sure who relied on them and for what purpose. According to Claimant, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also offered contradicting testimony on which prices the forecasts actually predict.1810 It therefore maintains that \"[t]*he pricing of actual forward transactions by market participants with billions of dollars at stake provides a much more reliable indication of market participants' actual risk-adjusted expectations of future prices than analysts' predictions*.\"1811\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 352-354, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2347; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 206-208, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6 90, note 97; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 2227-227.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 355-359, *referring to* Davis II, Figure 6 *and quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2347, 2526-2527, 2671, 2674.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 229, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6 131.\n\n1439.\n\nClaimant also rejects the criticisms regarding Prof. Davis' use of forward curves to extend the price forecasts into the future, arguing that \"*forward prices are the most accurate indiciation of risk-adjusted future price expectations*\" as they \"*show the market's actual consensus risk-adjusted price expectations of what future prices will be*.\" In Claimant's view, the existence of gold arbitrage also does not render it inappropriate to use gold forward prices given that Respondent's experts acknowledged that \"*gold behaves like a currency in the forward markets*\" and investors therefore expect it to at least hold its value in real terms, resulting in a rise in nominal terms. Claimant notes that CIMVal also reports about \"*concerns about liquidity, incomplete forward curves, or the observation that a forward price is a mathematical calculation*\" but adds that \"*these reasons do not prevent the use of forward curves in generating a price forecast*.\"1812\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 361-364, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6 59, 65, *and quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 10.\n\n1440.\n\nClaimant further considers that Prof. Wells backed away from his previous concern whether there was sufficient liquidity for futures markets to show market expectations, testifying that \"*there always is*\" liquidity four years out in the gold futures market and acknowledging that on the valuation date, the gold future price four years out was supported by USD 1.5 billion in the market.1813\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 365, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2692 *and referring to* p. 2694.\n\n1441.\n\nClaimant contends that Prof. Davis' method of extending out the forward curve by applying an algorithm to the forward prices, which are based on market activity up to ten years out, followed recognized practices in the mining industry. It quotes from CIMVal's conclusion that \"[m]*etal price forecasts based on the forward curve may be extended beyond the publicly quoted prices based on the characteristics of the metal (base metal or precious metal) and the market characteristics of the forward curve*.\"1814\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 366-367, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 10.\n\n1442.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the projection of the gold price, Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells recognize that \"*gold behaves like a currency in the forward markets*\" and adds that the gold price does not rise or fall with industry demand or expectations of global growth but that gold is rather used as a hedge against inflation and expected to hold its value in real terms. Claimant then refers to Prof. Davis' illustration that in real terms, his price projects are nearly flat, and notes that the nominal annual compound growth rate of 3% assumed by Prof. Davis is \"*far lower than the 8% historical annual compound growth from 1970 through the valuation date*.\"1815\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 368-371, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 65 *and referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2343-2345, *and* Davis Presentation, p. 22.\n\n1443.\n\nClaimant notes that Respondent's experts explicitly acknowledged in their first report that the gold price is not mean-reverting but rather \"*varies as a random walk process with a drift*\"; in their second report, however, they came up with a statistical test to confirm the opposite. Claimant requests that this test be disregarded as untimely because it prevented Prof. Davis from being able to properly respond; in any event, it should be given no weight due to its underdevelopment and substantive flaws. Claimant contends that Respondent's experts first relied on the wrong statistical test, *i.e*., a \"*standard t-test*,\" even though the very textbook they rely on notes that \"*one cannot use a standard t-test to determine whether the estimate of N is significantly different from zero*.\"1816 Claimant notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells appear to acknowledge that error by performing the correct unit root test recommended by their own source in an excel sheet introduced at the Hearing on Quantum and claims that the test, albeit not effective with only 30 to 40 years of data, yields the opposite conclusion from the one stated in their second report, namely that it cannot be rejected statistically that gold prices are not mean-reverting.1817\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 372-377, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 143, Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 61 *and* **Exhibit CE-1766**, p. 77 (admitted *de bene esse*). *See also* Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 212.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1782A** *and* **CE-1766**, p. 77 (both admitted *de bene esse*).\n\n1444.\n\nClaimant further considers it \"*common sense*\" that gold prices are not mean-reverting and refers to Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' illustration of their alleged mean-reverting price against the upward slope of the historical gold spot price. In Claimant's view, there is not \"*a shred of evidence*\" to support Respondent's allegation that gold will start to behave \"*fundamentally different in the future than it has for generations*.\"1818\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 380-382, *referring to* **Exhibit BW-82.08**.\n\n1445.\n\nAs for Prof. Davis' modelling of risk-adjusted copper prices, Claimant notes that he projects them to \"*drop*[] *steadily over the life of the mine*\" to a price \"*far below the lowest inflation-adjusted price of copper in the past 60 years*.\" In Claimant's view, \"[t]*his is consistent with copper forward prices showing the combined effects of the market's expectations for what prices will be, on average, at future times and the market's pricing of systematic risk.*\" Claimant adds that this downward trend is also consistent with copper being a commodity rather than an investment asset like gold. It emphasizes that Reko Diq contains far more copper than gold and argues that Prof. Davis' copper price projection confirms that he did not use inflated pricec projections to create an artificially high value.1819\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 387.\n\n1446.\n\nClaimant also rejects the argument that it was inconsistent for Prof. Davis not to rely on forward market prices to also model the costs of the project. Claimant argues that reliable forward market prices exist only for fuel but not for other cost items such as equipment and labor as well as other capital and operating expenditures. According to Claimant, Prof. Davis therefore relied on \"*the same uncontroversial techniques that are regularly used in traditional DCF analyses*\" when there is no appropriate forward market data. He used Claimant's \"*detailed mine plans*\" as a starting point but then adjusted the costs upwards to account for inflation, cost escalation and asymmetric risk.1820\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 231-236, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 203, 45 *and* Davis I, \u00b6\u00b6 155-199.\n\n1447.\n\nClaimant agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that together with the increase of metals prices between the Feasibility Study and the valuation date, costs also increased and submits that Prof. Davis therefore adjusted costs upward by 18% based on an updated capital costs schedule prepared by Barrick. Claimant notes that together with the adjustments for cost escalation, inflation and asymmetric risk, Prof. Davis increased costs by a total of 58% and thus by more than the \"*up to 50%*\" that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells referred to in their first report.1821\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 240-244, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6\u00b6 156, 159, Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 39, **Exhibit BW-17**, *and* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 155-163.\n\n1448.\n\nWith regard to the volatility of capital costs, Claimant submits that Prof. Davis initially did not include variability of capital costs into his model \"[t]*o avoid needless complexity*\" as he did not expect such an adjustment to have a significant effect; however, following the criticism of Respondent's experts, he did perform such a test and concluded that incorporating cost variability has a \"*negligible effect*.\"1822 Specifically, Prof. Davis concluded that randomizing capital costs would change his valuation estimate by approximately 1.5%.1823\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 436, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 188-190.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 238, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 188-190.\n\n1449.\n\nClaimant also notes that the capital costs modeled by Prof. Davis were 58% higher in nominal terms and 33% higher in real terms than the capital costs in Claimant's feasibility studies. In Claimant's view, there is therefore no basis for Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' argument that Prof. Davis should have used a higher probability distribution mean in order to account for average cost overruns of 25%, which would result in double-counting the risk already included in Prof. Davis' modeling of the capital costs themselves.1824\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 437-439, *referring to* Davis Presentation, p. 30 *and* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 3 and \u00b6 145.\n\n1450.\n\nClaimant further submits that Prof. Davis has also fully accounted for asymmetric risks, including the country risk affecting the project because of its location in Pakistan and in particular Balochistan.1825\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 389-390; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 246.\n\n1451.\n\nClaimant notes that on Respondent's own case, the most prominent risks associated with the project's location are political violence and security risks. It refers to Prof. Davis' explanation that the proper way to account for these and other asymmetric risks is \"*to directly adjust the cash flow components affected by these risks*.\"1826\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 390-391, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 42.\n\n1452.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent and its experts have not identified any security risks or potential security costs that Prof. Davis failed to account for in his model, rejecting in particular the argument that he did not account for the risks identified in Claimant's risk register.1827 According to Claimant, Prof. Davis modeled and quantified several country-related risks identified by Claimant in its risk register, such as \"[c]*riminal extortion & kidnap caused by criminal groups*,\" \"[t]*heft of explosives & blasting accessories*,\" \"[s]*abotage of* [e] *quipment &*[s] *tructures*,\" and \"[m]*ilitary operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan Helmand province spilling over*.\"1828\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 245.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 392, *quoting from* Davis Presentation, p. 34.\n\n1453.\n\nClaimant argues that Prof. Davis took these security risks into account in three ways: (i) he incorporated an annual 0.5% probability of a complete and permanent project shutdown which reduced the value of Claimant's investment by USD 1.4 billion and, in Claimant's view, is \"*an extremely conservative assumption*\";1829 (ii) he included \"*substantial premiums for insurance that would protect against the effects of political violence, terrorist attacks, and other security threats*,\" covering business interruptions of more than 30 days and totaling nearly USD 9 million per year;1830 and (iii) he adjusted various costs and production quantities to reflect the residual risk of various security threats, which in total reduced the projected cash flows by USD 13.9 million per year for the first five years and USD 5.7 million per year thereafter.1831\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 393-394, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6 178 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2352-2354; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 248, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 176-178 *and* Davis I, \u00b6 189.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 249, *referring to* Davis I, \u00b6 189, **Exhibits RE-577-24**, pp. 24-28 to 24-29 *and* **RE-577-29**, p. 29-18.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 250, *referring to* Davis I, Workpaper 26.\n\n1454.\n\nClaimant rejects the argument that the annual probability of an early shutdown is too low and notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells do not provide any analysis or suggestion how the security risks should have been modeled instead.1832 Claimant also maintains that Dr. Burrows' suggestion that it should use a discount rate based on Pakistan's sovereign yield spread is \"*invalid and does not provide any basis to question Prof. Davis's treatment of country risk*\"; the same applies to his belated reliance on a regression analysis performed by Dr. Bekaert, which does not work for Pakistan.1833\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 251\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 405-432.\n\n1455.\n\nFinally, Claimant maintains that the additional security costs proposed by Respondent's expert Mr. Davies would not have been necessary but notes that, in any event, factoring them in would reduce the project's value only by USD 370 million. As Prof. Davis did not reduce the premature shutdown risk in this sensitivity calculation, he concluded that the potential effect on value of the security threats identified by Respondent's experts have already been taken into account in his model.1834\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 185, 187.\n\n1456.\n\nIn addition to country risk, Claimant asserts that Prof. Davis also accounted for further asymmetric risk by incorporating the potential effects of project delays. Specifically, Claimant argues that he included a delay of at least six months before start of construction in each of his simulations and assumed that construction would, on average, start 2.3 years after Claimant had anticipated, which reduced the value of Claimant's investment by USD 1.3 billion.1835\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 255, referring to Davis II, \u00b6 85.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1457.\n\nRespondent takes the position that Prof. Davis has not adequately accounted for the systematic risks in his valuation model because he has used \"*inordinately speculative*\" projections of futures prices.1836\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 433.\n\n1458.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant's expert purported to apply prices for the futures markets and even called his projections \"*certainty-equivalent*\". To the contrary, however, Respondent refers to its experts who explained that \"*futures' markets are not the best predictors of prices, and the valuation best practices would have been to rely on the price forecasts by the community of experts and entities active in the field, which are blended into consensus forecasts.*\" Respondent claims that these forecasts \"*are followed by the industry in their estimations of future prices*\" and would \"*without doubt have been the basis on which the hypothetical buyer and seller would have based their price forecasts*,\" as Claimant and its shareholders did in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and their annual reports.1837\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 333, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 50, **Exhibits BW-45** *and* **CE-1023**, p. 15.\n\n1459.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the time horizon of transactions in the futures markets is much shorter than the mining activities under valuation and claims that the prices applied by Claimant's expert are in fact admittedly \"*projections created ad-hoc by those same TCC experts*,\" including \"*a bizarre gold price projection, which literally spikes off the graph, and ends up being 12 times the consensus price*.\"1838 Respondent refers to its experts who state that \"*the futures prices used by Brattle are neither market determined nor the best forecasts of prices in the future, let alone certainty-equivalent*\" and add that, in their opinion, \"*no one can take Brattle's reports seriously when its author believes that the 'certainty-equivalent' cash flows that he calculates for Reko Diq are as safe as the cash flows from a U.S. Treasury bond of equal duration, and that therefore both have to be discounted at the risk-free rate*.\"1839\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 334, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 133-135 and note 219, *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2343-2346.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 334, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 25; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 434.\n\n1460.\n\nRespondent further relies on Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' statement that \"*Claimant's damages vanish when one uses Consensus Economics price projections instead of futures-based prices, with no other changes in the Brattle model. Brattle relies on futures prices that are neither market determined nor the best source available for price forecasts*.\"1840 Respondent submits that if the prices crafted by Prof. Davis are replaced with the more reliable expert consensus forecasts for gold, copper and oil, the average net present value of Claimant's investment would be negative, *i.e*., USD -1.23 billion, and the project would generate a negative rate of return and thus no profits.1841 Respondent argues that the fact that Prof. Davis prices which \"*presumably contain all sorts of risks*\" are higher than the prices predicted by forecasts further confirms the irrationality of his analysis.1842\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 335, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 153; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 434, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 46.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 336, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells Presentation, p. 6 *and* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 2; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 434, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 434, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 60.\n\n1461.\n\nRespondent also contends that Prof. Davis' modeling of the costs of the project contained \"*myriad, unresolved and fatal errors*\" which were revealed at the Hearing on Quantum when Claimant introduced a new set of spreadsheets which included expenditures that had increased by approximately USD 1 billion.1843 In addition, Respondent notes that by assuming all equity financing, Prof. Davis failed to account for the amortization or interest of financing in the project costs.1844\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 328, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1556A, CE-1778A** *and* **CE-1779A**, Respondent's Closing Presentation, p. 81.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 330, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2478 lines 3-9.\n\n1462.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Prof. Davis' valuation is based on the proposition that its \"*modern*\" cash flows contain the same amount of risk as cash flows derived from a US Treasury bond both of which should then be discounted at the risk-free rate of return. Respondent considers it \"*simply untenable*\" that a buyer would be convinced by Prof. Davis' explanation of \"*certainty-equivalent*\" cash flows and accept the \"*ridiculously low rate return*\" in order to invest in a non-diversified, non-operational mining project in Balochistan instead of purchasing the same amout in US Treasury bonds.1845\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 420, 424, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 136.\n\n1463.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends that Prof. Davis admitted at the Hearing on Quantum that he had not fully de-risked the cash flows in his model when stating that \"*very clearly \u2026 when the Buyer buys this for $8.5 billion, they do not get a bond. They get the cash flows up at the top right that are highly uncertain and highly risky*.\" Respondent considers that this admission precludes the reliance on the \"*de-risked*\" approach yield a certainty-equivalent fair market value of USD 8.5 billion.1846\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 338-340, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2484 lines 14-18.\n\n1464.\n\nRespondent contends that \"[w]*hen properly analyzed*,\" Prof. Davis' valuation is equivalent to applying a discount rate of merely 1.2% above the risk-free rate; \"*a preposterous proposition*,\" taking into account that market expectations for Pakistan were at least 9 times higher than that and the risks in Balochistan were even higher. According to Respondent, Claimant has thereby ignored over 90% of the risk impact perceived by financial markets and institutions.1847 Respondent also refers to the discount rate of 23% calculated by Dr. Burrows as well as the discount rates of 10% to 12% used by SNC Lavalin in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which led to a value of the project near zero.1848\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 343-344, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-782**, p. v *and* Burrows II, \u00b6 74.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 423-424, *referring to* Burrows I, Appendix 2, Panel B *and* Brailovsky/Wells I, Figure 1.\n\n1465.\n\nRespondent further argues that the implied discount rate is only \"*about half of what would be appropriate for this type of project if it was located in an advanced economy*\" but reveals that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis \"*were not even close to being appropriate for valuing a project of this type in Balochistan, much less a project that had no track record.*\" Specifically, Respondent refers to: (i) the \"*speculative*\" purchase of Reko Diq by Claimant's shareholders in 2006; (ii) Prof. Davis' \"*scattered and piecemeal enumeration of the value assigned to the few risks actually incorporated into the cash flows*,\" which Respondent claims to be incorrect as \"[w]*hen analyzed systematically*,\" the amount of adjustments is \"*much smaller than claimed by Claimant's valuators*\"; (iii) the \"*risk component*\" captured in Prof. Davis' cash flows which adds only about 1.4% to the risk-free discount rate, which Respondent considers \"*extremely, unexplainably low*\" and a sign of Prof. Davis' omission of country risk; (iv) the underestimation of the impact of early termination due to \"*extreme political violence or government action*\"; and (v) the fact that the results of applying the same discount rate to the cash flows in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and Prof. Davis' model are \"*practically indistinguishable from each other*\" which confirms in its view that Prof. Davis has failed to account \"*in any meaningful way for the risks in the cash flows*.\"1849\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 418, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 4(ix), 19-20, 23, 17.\n\n1466.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the discount rate before Prof. Davis' risk adjustments, Respondent maintains that any buyer of Reko Diq would have considered to apply this rate because, as explained by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, \"[i]*n real life investors want to know the discount rate used to evaluate the actual cash flows; telling them that it is the risk-free rate, which of course they can consult directly, is not of much use.*\" They further opined that \"*the equivalence would reveal the IRR before Brattle's risk adjustments, which is the overall profitability expected from the project, again a crucial variable that any investor in the real world would want to know before embarking in it*.\" Respondent notes that Prof. Davis has not provided this information.1850\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 419, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 108.\n\n1467.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that it is a \"*methodological charade*\" to suggest that Prof. Davis has accounted for all risks at source given that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells revealed that the \"*traditional*\" DCF calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, \"*once adjusted to describe the same universe of facts*,\" yields a similar pattern of results, which makes it impossible to argue that one has been \"*de-risked*\" and the other has not. Respondent quotes from its experts that \"[t]*he most plausible explanation is that the two models are in reality neither independent nor conceptually different from each other, and since the SNC-Lavalin model\u2014which never pretended to be a 'modern' DCF with 'certainty equivalent' prices\u2014precedes Brattle's, it is the latter that seems to be a close replica of the former*.\"1851 Respondent further refers to their opinion that Claimant \"*applies a risk-free interest rate to those practically unadjusted cash flows to arrive at $8.5 billion, when practically the same cash flows yield no value in the SNC-Lavalin* [EXP-PFS].\"1852\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 341, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 80 *et seq*. and *quoting from* \u00b6 88; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 437-439.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 342, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells Presentation, p. 21; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 420.\n\n1468.\n\nRespondent argues that, as confirmed by the IFRS, the traditional DCF calculation should produce the exact same result as the \"*certainty-equivalent*\" DCF method; Prof. Davis also acknowledged that both methods \"*produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to that FMV via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk*.\"1853 Respondent refers to its experts who explain that in order to obtain the certainty-equivalent cash flows, they must be discounted by \"*the risk adjustment rate, which is the difference between the discount rate and the risk-free rate*\" and that it should thereby be possible to derive a strict equivalent to the traditional DCF calculation. Respondent notes that Prof. Davis has not provided such a calculation.1854\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 422, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-1425**, \u00b6\u00b6 B23-B30 and *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6 53.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 423, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 108.\n\n1469.\n\nRespondent concludes that given the similarity between the revenues and costs projected in both models, it is apparent that Prof. Davis made \"*only minor adjustments to the cash flows*\" which, \"*when aggregated, are a very small part of the overall revenues and expenditures*,\" and that these cash flows are therefore no more \"*certainty-equivalent*\" than those of SNC Lavalin. As a result, Respondent claims that there can be no justification for the application of risk-free discount rate to the cash flows in Prof. Davis' model.1855\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 438-439, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, Table 2 and \u00b6 87.\n\n1470.\n\nSpecifically, with regard to country risk, Respondent submits that Claimant failed to properly account for this type of risk which, according to Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, is \"*one of the most significant factors underlying the low risk implicit in Brattle's calculation*.\" In their opinion, \"[i]*t defies credulity that 1.2%\u2014the risk premium implicitly contemplated in Brattle's report\u2014is enough to account for the enormous risks facing a mining project in Balochistan*.\"1856 Therefore, Respondent also rejects the argument that its experts would double count the value impact of country risk, quoting from Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' statement that \"[o]*ne cannot double count risks when almost none are accounted for in the first place*.\"1857\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 345-346, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 119.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 425, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 52.\n\n1471.\n\nRespondent submits that country risk can cause significant uncertainty regarding an investment's returns, due to macroeconomic, political and environmental factors and considers it \"*indisputable that the country risk must be considered independently of the proposed valuation approach*.\"1858 Respondent argues that investment treaty tribunals \"*have consistently and uncontroversially recognized the necessity to apply country risk*\" and quotes from a scholarly commentary stating that \"[i]*rrespective of the approach, in assessing value the expert must account for the relevant risks attached to the asset in question, including relevant country risk*.\"1859\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 426-427, *referring to* Steve Harris, Ben Johnson, and Emre Aydin, Valuation in International Arbitration: Measuring Country Risk In The Middle East (2017) [RLA-422], p. 33.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 348, *referring to* *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others (formerly Mobil Corporation and others) v.

Respondent refers to various recent decisions in which the tribunals determined damages based on forward-looking projections of income and found that country risk premiums between 10% and 20% should be included in the discount rate. Respondent notes that applying any of those discount rates would render the net present value of the cash flows estimated by Claimant negative. As stated by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, \"*any discount rate that includes country risk is far above the rates that make the NPV zero or less in all these calculations*.\"1861\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 349, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1333 lines 18-20; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 430, *referring to* Burrows I, Appendix 5, Panel B.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 349-351, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 120; Respondent's Closing Presentation, p. 91.\n\n1473.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Prof. Davis' application of a risk-free discount rate is directly contradicted by the reasoning of the tribunal in *OI European v. Venezuela* as to why an investment in Venezuela justified a higher premium than if the same investment had been made in Italy.1862\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 431, *quoting from* *OI European Group v.

According to Respondent, Prof. Davis failed to contemplate possible changes in the fiscal regime, which would be \"*perfectly legal for a sovereign State to do*.\" Respondent also refers to political unrest and terrorism affecting mining operations and transportation which increased between 2006 and 2011 and was \"*a grave concern as of the valuation date*\" as well as external reasons which can also impact country risk.1863\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 432\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1475.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of whether Claimant's expert Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for all systematic and asymmetric risks affecting the project, the Tribunal recalls that it has found above that it is appropriate to value Claimant's investment based on the modern DCF method applied by Prof. Davis and, in that context, has already made certain findings which will again be relevant in the present analysis.\n\n1476.\n\nBased on its review of the evidentiary record regarding the modern DCF method, the Tribunal found that it makes sense in the present valuation of Claimant's investment to distinguish between different types of risk in the valuation and to adjust each cash flow component directly for the risks that affect this particular cash flow. In particular taking into account the information provided by CIMVal in 2012 about valuation practices in the mining industry, the Tribunal noted that uncertainties associated with the modern DCF approach, *e.g*., regarding the projection of future metals prices, do not justify rejecting this method or the use of risk-adjusted prices; they are controllable by making reasonable, and perhaps conservative, assumptions. The Tribunal agreed with Claimant that in the present case, this approach is preferable to applying a traditional DCF method with a discount rate that results in almost no net present value for cash flows that would be generated in the second half of the mine's life.\n\n1477.\n\nThe Tribunal has not yet assessed whether Prof. Davis has used reasonable inputs to account for systematic risks, in particular with regard to the uncertain development of copper and gold as well as oil prices. It noted, however, that CIMVal generally supports the use of forward curves, including their extension beyond publicly quoted prices, and that the Tribunal would therefore not follow Respondent's general rejection of using forward curves as a basis for projecting risk-adjusted prices. The question whether the risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis is sufficient to account for the fluctuation of prices over the 56-year life of the mine will form part of the present analysis, which will also take into account the comparison drawn by Respondent's experts to the \"*traditional*\" DCF calculation in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\n1478.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's argument that it was incorrect for Prof. Davis to use a risk-free rate to discount the cash flows because these cash flows are not, or at least not fully, adjusted for risk, the Tribunal has already taken note of CIMVal's explanation in the context of selecting discount rates for valuing reserves and resources that the certainty-equivalent DCF approach \"*does not make use of an aggregate discount rate though an implied aggregate discount rate can be derived*\" but instead \"*uses targeted risk-adjustments for select cash flow components. These adjustments are done within the CAPM framework. Market related uncertainties such as metal and energy prices are risk-adjusted with the CAPM while project-specific uncertainties may be modelled directly with no risk-adjustment.*\"1864 At the same time, CIMVal stated:\n\n\"*A residual risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk-adjusted cash flows for risk not explicitly recognized in the model before a final adjustment for the time value of money. The residual risk adjustment is similar in nature to a Credit Valuation Adjustment applied in derivative valuation for counter-party risk*.\"1865\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 10-11.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 11.\n\n1479.\n\nAs confirmed by CIMVal, the Tribunal therefore agreed with Prof. Davis that it is, in principle, consistent to use a risk-free rate which discounts cash flows only for the time value of money, if these cash flows have already been fully adjusted for risk. However, in line with the explanation provided by CIMVal, the Tribunal will now also assess whether it may be necessary to apply a residual risk adjustment to account for any risks that were not explicitly recognized in Prof. Davis' model. In the Tribunal's view, this also applies to risks that were recognized as such but for which the risk adjustments made are, in the Tribunal's opinion, insufficient to fully capture the relevant risk; such risks might warrant additional or increased risk adjustments as well.\n\n1480.\n\nIn line with the distinction drawn by Prof. Davis between systematic risks, such as in particular the fluctuation of gold, copper and oil prices but also the risk of cost increases, and asymmetric risks, such as the risk of political violence and other, mostly country-related risks, the Tribunal will assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for each type of risk in turn.\n\n**a. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Systematic Risk of Fluctuations in the Prices for Copper, Gold and Oil**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1481.\n\nProf. Davis explained in his first report that the approach of the modern DCF method to addressing systematic risk is as follows:\n\n\"*The advantage of the modern DCF approach is that reasonable market signals about the market's systematic risk preferences over individual cash flow components is often available in futures or forward markets, whereas market signals about risk preferences over the systematic risks in the overall, combined net cash flows of the entire project, which are required to calculate the appropriate discount rate in the traditional DCF method, are not.*\n\n*In the case of Reko Diq, commodity prices are major drivers of both revenues (copper and gold prices) and costs (oil prices, which drive fuel costs), and are also major sources of project uncertainties. Futures prices are available to capture the market risk of each. The modern DCF's approach of first adjusting the cash flows for asymmetric risk and then adjusting the results for market-based, systematic risk via the discounting adjustments inherent in the futures prices replaces the relatively ad hoc approach to discounting asymmetric and systematic risks inherent in the traditional DCF approach. In that approach the discount rate is increased by some amount to try to account for the value impact of both types of risk*.\"1866\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n\n1482.\n\nProf. Davis explained that the modern DCF approach eliminates the need to estimate an expected future price and a risk-adjusted discount rate because \"[t]*he impact of risk is already captured by using futures prices which reflect a discount from the expected spot price in the future in exchange for a guaranteed price set today. All that remains to be done is discount the risk-adjusted copper revenues at the risk-free rate to account for the price of time*.\"1867 He further explained in detail his approach to forecasting and simulating commodity prices in Appendix C to his first report.1868\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 90.\n\nDavis I, Appendix C.\n\n1483.\n\nRespondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells distinguished in their first report between four steps in Prof. Davis' approach: (i) determining the volatility of prices based on historical data up to the valuation date; (ii) obtaining futures prices for each commodity as of the valuation date for the period covered by the futures quotations; (iii) projecting prices for a time period of 56 years based on the futures market data; and (iv) applying a random variable for each price and year and running a total of 1.2 million simulations covering six scenarios. As for the first step, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted that they would have accounted for standard deviations \"*with an appropriate parameter*\" but added that \"*it is unlikely that the results would have changed significantly*.\" They further stated that they did \"*not object to the way that stochastic projections are carried out,*\" *i.e*., the fourth step identified above. However, in their opinion, \"*the second and third steps* [are] *completely inappropriate, i.e. the use and characterization of futures prices and the way the projections paramaters were obtained*.\"1869\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n1484.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis for basing his projections on \"*data for the futures market alone, with no recourse at all to the historical data before the valuation date*.\"1870 In their opinion, Prof. Davis' approach assumes that Claimant would sell all of its expected gold and copper production as well as acquire all required quantities of oil at the valuation date at the prices in the futures or forward markets. Noting that production quantities would have exceeded open interest for copper and gold by far, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered it incorrect to call the prices from futures markets risk-adjusted.1871\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 129.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 132-134.\n\n1485.\n\nIn their opinion, futures prices for both copper and gold further have \"*extremely poor predictive power \u2026, especially at turning points,*\" which they illustrated with the following graph:1872\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 136 and Figure 10.\n\n1486.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further noted that for gold, Prof. Davis relied on data from the forward market, and argued that the forward market price for gold is \"*simply the spot price of the day plus an interest charge*,\" reflecting an underlying financial transaction rather than a price prediction.1873\n\nInstead of relying on futures and forward markets, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered that Prof. Davis should have averaged the results of a group of forecasts such as Consensus Economic forecasts, \"*which include the contributions of around twenty financial and commercial research institutions and academics*.\"1874 They added:\n\n\"[W]*e are under no illusion that any long-term, or indeed short-term, forecast of commodity prices can be accurate. This is a major stumbling block in any DCF analysis, one that is more of an impediment to conducting a serious DCF analysis in this case because capital costs are also a variable quantity. Probabilistic approaches to the problem are therefore a good instrument to measure the size of the uncertainty. However, these must be constructed in a reasonable way. As mentioned, the Brattle Report ignores completely the history of prices to construct the deterministic part of the analysis of prices. For this purpose, it relies exclusively on the futures markets, which, as we have shown, are extremely thin and shallow after a few years ahead, as well as being driven by interest rates. We would agree with the Brattle Report that copper and oil tend to follow a mean-reverting behavior and that gold varies as a random walk process with a drift. The fatal flaw in Brattle's method \u2014 and as we shall see later, this flaw accounts for 4/5 of the claim \u2014 lies in the starting point of the projection and in the drift parameter that the Brattle Report uses*.\"1875\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 137-138.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 140-141.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 143.\n\n1487.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells illustrated the alleged deviation in Prof. Davis' approach from historical data as follows:1876\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, Figure 12.\n\n1488.\n\nThey emphasized that by contrast to the forward market, all 21 Consensus Forecasts contributors forecast a decline in the price after a brief period of additional growth:1877\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, Figure 13.\n\n1489.\n\nIn response to Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' criticisms, Prof. Davis reiterated in his second report that \"[o]*ne of the core advantages of the modern DCF method is that it eschews the need to forecast spot commodity prices and relies instead on risk-adjusted prices, which reflect both market expectations of future prices and the market's pricing of the associated systematic risk. These risk-adjusted prices are directly observable in the futures market for shorter maturities and can be estimated using accepted models for longer maturities*.\" He emphasized that \"[e]*ither way, these risk-adjusted prices are not forecasts of the spot price*\" and therefore considered it an \"*apples-to-oranges comparison*\" to compare his assumptions regarding risk-adjusted prices with analyst forecasts of the non-risk-adjusted spot price.1878\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 118-120.\n\n1490.\n\nProf. Davis further denied that consensus forecasts were superior to forward prices when it comes to commodity prices, considering that such a conclusion was not supported by any of the literature relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, which was in any event mostly based on a discussion taken from the Consensus Economics website.1879\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 121-124.\n\n1491.\n\nIn support of his argument that forward prices can reliably project risk-adjusted prices over the life of the asset, Prof. Davis distinguished between three time horizons: (i) the first five years for which futures contracts are actually traded and for which the forward prices on which he relied are \"*virtually identical*\"; (ii) the following five years for which forward prices had been published as of the valuation date and, given the agreement of Respondent's experts that there is \"*ample liquidity*\" for the gold market, there was no reason to suspect that these forward prices were not representative of the market participants' expectations; and (iii) the subsequent time horizon up to the end of the mine life.1880\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 129-133.\n\n1492.\n\nProf. Davis specifically agreed with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that forward prices are not a forecast of future prices but rather reflect the characteristics of an underlying financial transaction. He then explained why, in his opinion, this does not render them inappropriate for valuation purposes:\n\n\"*Futures purchases and sales are financial transactions, and the pricing of those transactions has a specific relationship to spot prices as shown in the above equation. That does not make them inadequate indicators of future risk-adjusted prices \u2013 on the contrary, they reflect the view of market participants who have substantial amounts of money at stake and every incentive to make accurate predictions. Of course, they are not predictions of spot prices, and I do not use them as such*.\"1881\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 136.\n\n1493.\n\nFor the extension of the forward curves beyond ten years and, thus, the long-term horizon, Prof. Davis noted that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had not criticized the mean-reverting model he had used for copper prices; for the model used to predict gold prices, he had assumed that the rate of drift in the forward curve would remain equal to the drift derived within the 10-year forward price. In his opinion, this was a conservative assumption given that bond yields increase in maturity.1882 He then expressed the following opinion:\n\n\"*Ultimately, the magnitude of the gap between my long-run projections and those developed by Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells stems almost entirely from their incorrect view that the appropriate data to use in a modern DCF analysis is the un-risked expected spot prices as reflected in the average of analyst forecasts. The differences are that 1) their ten-year price forecast is incorrectly based on analyst forecasts, whereas mine is based on forward prices, as required by the valuation model; 2) their long-run projection assumes that the price would continue to fall, extrapolating the ten-year price curve developed from analyst forecasts, which is not a projection of risk-adjusted prices, while mine is correctly based on the forward curve; and 3) even though both I and they agree that gold prices follow a geometric Brownian motion with drift, their projection of spot gold prices in the long run is inconsistent with a geometric Brownian motion with drift, while my projection of forward prices in the long run is exactly a Geometric Brownian motion*.\"1883\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 138; Davis I, Appendix C, \u00b6 22.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 139.\n\n1494.\n\nProf. Davis emphasized that \"*there is no choice as to whether to use the forward prices or a forecast of spot prices in a modern DCF*\" because \"*analysts do not forecast the forward curve. What analysts claim to forecast is the spot price, which is not needed in the modern DCF method*.\" In his opinion, the forecasts relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also cannot be treated as estimates of expected spot prices because they imply an expected loss of about 3% per year (35% over the next ten years), which runs contrary to investors' expectations that they will receive positive returns from investing in gold, due to an expected price appreciation. Prof. Davis illustrated the expected negative return based on the Consensus Economics forecast as follows:1884\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 143-145 and Figure 5.\n\n1495.\n\nProf. Davis noted that \"[i]*f the Consensus Economics forecasts reflected investors' views of the expected spot price of gold, then no one would be willing to buy gold at the spot prices prevailing in October 2011, when the analyst forecasts were published, and those who were holding gold at the time would sell, anticipating the price fall. But if that were the case, the spot price would have fallen as well because supply of gold would exceed demand. In other words, interpreting the Consensus Economics forecast as a measure of expected spot prices is inconsistent with the observed spot price of gold*.\" Prof. Davis further considered that, based on historical data, analyst forecasts \"*are consistently biased downward and increasingly inaccurate as the forecast horizon grows*,\" noting that longterm forecasts are up to 50% below the realized spot price and adding that if such bias were removed, \"*there is little discrepancy left between the consensus forecast and the forward curve*.\"1885\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 144, 146-147 and Figures 6 and 7.\n\n1496.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted that Claimant's damages claim is very sensitive to price forecasts, in particular to that of the gold price, and calculated that the damage would disappear when using the \"*reasonable price projections*\" of Consensus Economics. Specifically, they calculated that when using those forecasts for gold, the average net present value of Claimant's investment, all else being equal, would drop to USD 0.89 billion, *i.e*., by almost 90%; when also using the forecasts for copper, it would drop to USD -0.72 billion; and when also using the forecasts for oil, it would drop to USD -1.23 billion.1886\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, Section III and Table 2.\n\n1497.\n\nRespondent's experts reiterated that they \"*explicitly reject* [Prof. Davis'] *central assumptions that futures prices should be used as forecasts in DCF analyses*\" and clarified that they also opposed Prof. Davis' projection of the copper price based on futures prices. In response to Prof. Davis' methodological argument that the modern DCF method requires the use of risk-adjusted prices rather than forecasts of spot prices, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered it \"*paradoxical*\" that Prof. Davis' allegedly risk-adjusted prices produce considerably more revenues than those forecast by the consensus experts even though the latter \"*presumably contain all sorts of risks*.\"1887\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 59.\n\n1498.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells then stated that \"*prices of minerals \u2014in particular the all-important gold price\u2014 are* 'mean reverting.' *This is in marked contrast to the assumption in the Brattle reports that they are ever climbing*.\" Specifically with regard to gold, they relied on an econometric method called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and claimed that this method, while resulting in \"*somewhat higher*\" price projections than Consensus Economics forecast, confirmed that the price of gold was also mean-reverting and not a \"*random walk with time-dependent drift*.\"1888\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64 and Graph 3.\n\n1499.\n\nIn the opinion of Respondent's experts, the futures prices relied on by Prof. Davis \"*are neither market determined nor the best source available for price forecasts*.\" They noted that the project would have begun to sell its production only seven years after the valuation date, making the period for which futures prices exist, and also a large part of the period for which forward curves exist, irrelevant for the valuation of the project's cash flows. In their opinion, the fact that futures prices are higher than those forecast by Consensus Economics indicates that the former are in fact riskier than the latter, which contradicts Prof. Davis' statement that his price assumptions are risk-adjusted.1889 With regard to Prof. Davis' criticisms of the consensus forecasts, they argued:\n\n\"*We are under no illusion that commodities prices can be accurately predicted, as we have said; the future is unknown and unknowable. Neither the futures prices nor consensus forecasts have a really good predictive record. That is why Brattle's effort to show how poorly the mean Consensus Economics forecasts have predicted actual prices, without comparison to other methods, is not useful. But the available empirical studies clearly favour the Consensus Economics forecasts*.\"1890\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 153-156.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 157.\n\n1500.\n\nRelying on statements made by economists regarding a lack of accuracy of predictions made by futures prices, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells rejected the argument that forward market prices are the market's actual risk-adjusted expectations of what futures prices will be. In particular quoting from economists at the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco, who stated with regard to oil futures prices that \"*taking into account the relationship between current spot prices and futures prices instead of considering only the raw futures price can significantly improve forecasting accuracy*,\" Respondent's experts also denied that, by considering forecasts for spot prices, they were making an \"*apples-to-oranges comparison.*\"1891 They also rejected Prof. Davis' suggestion that it is not necessary to know the non-risk-adjusted price, arguing that \"[t]*o be able to say that futures prices are risk-adjusted, one has to know the amount of such risk adjustment. That information is not provided in the Brattle reports. Just saying that futures prices are risk-adjusted is not enough*.\"1892\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 159-162; **Exhibit BW-71**.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 164.\n\n1501.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further rejected the argument that Consensus Economics forecasts cannot be used to predict spot prices, arguing that \"*at any point in time, economic agents have divergent expectations,*\" that \"*the markets do not adjust instantaneously to expectations*,\" and further that \"*the decline in gold prices in the forecasts is consistent with the comparatively small response of share prices of gold producers shown in the Burrow's reports*.\"1893 They also denied that analyst forecasts are biased downwards, arguing that just like the futures market, forecasts of commodity prices tend to underestimate prices when they are rising, as they were in the time period from 1998 to 2011 examined by Prof. Davis, but to overestimate them when they are falling, as they did after the valuation date.1894\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 165.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 166-168.\n\n1502.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as becomes apparent through Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' calculation of the impact on the value of Claimant's investment if the price projections made by Prof. Davis were to be replaced by the Consensus Economics forecasts, the question which assumptions a buyer would have made as of November 2011 with regard to gold, copper and oil prices has a very significant impact on the purchase price it would have been willing to pay for the Reko Diq project. In particular, and despite the fact that Reko Diq was intended to produce far larger quantities of copper than of gold, the deviating gold price predictions based on the Consensus Economics forecast would have had the largest impact, reducing the value of Claimant's investment from USD 8.5 billion to USD 0.89 billion, all else being equal. That the deviation between the sources relied on by the Parties' experts is by far larger larger for gold than for copper was illustrated by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells by the following graphs:1895\n\n**Exhibit BW-82.07**.\n\n1503.\n\nClaimant did not dispute the accuracy of Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' calculation and thus the impact it would have on the value of its investment if a buyer were to base its price projections on the Consensus Economics forecast instead of futures and forward market data. The significance of the projections for gold, copper and oil prices appears to be undisputed and was confirmed by Mr. Livesey already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability when he testified that \"[t]*he fuel price and the metals price primarily are the things that are driving the returns on this project*.\"1896\n\nTranscript Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (Day 5), p. 1398 lines 13-15.\n\n1504.\n\nBearing this significance in mind, the Tribunal has carefully considered the opinions provided by the experts from both sides and maintains its initial conclusion that Prof. Davis' approach to use futures and/or forward market prices for the purposes of projecting risk-adjusted prices for his valuation model is generally plausible and supported by the 2012 CIMVal report of valuation practices in the mining industry. However, the Tribunal has also taken note of the arguments raised by Respondent's experts, in particular the fact that the prices for gold that Prof. Davis derived from the futures and forward markets are considerably higher than the prices derived from analyst forecasts.\n\n1505.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument made by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells in their first report that using futures and forward prices would require making the assumption that the entire production quantities would be sold, and the entire quantities of required oil would be acquired, as of the valuation date, thereby exceeding by far the available demand for copper and gold. The Tribunal does not understand the assumption to be that Claimant would have entered into actual transactions at the prices assumed by Prof. Davis but rather that, as he explained in his second report, the futures and forward prices as of the valuation date reflect the market expectations of future prices at the time as well as the market's pricing of the systematic risk associated with these expectations.1897 In his opinion, these prices therefore directly lead to the input required for the modern DCF method, *i.e*., the price whose application results in a cash flow which has already been adjusted for the systematic risk associated with price fluctuations, and thereby also does away with the need to predict a spot price as well as a separate risk adjustment.\n\n*Cf*. Davis II, \u00b6 118.\n\n1506.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it undisputed that the Consensus Economics forecasts relied on by Respondent's experts attempt to predict spot prices rather than the risk-adjusted prices Prof. Davis is seeking as an input for his modern DCF model. In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore apparent that the two sets of price predictions used by the Parties' experts cannot be directly compared. At the same time, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that a buyer might have been concerned with the fact that the prices for gold from the futures and forward markets, which incorporate the market's pricing of the risk associated with price predictions over a certain time period, were considerably higher than the analysts' forecasts of prices which do not incorporate such risks. These concerns would then have been intensified by the different trends predicted by the forward curve and the consensus forecast, respectively, over a 10-year period, which are then extrapolated over the remainder of the predicted mine life, assuming that the initially predicted trend will continue over the entire production period. As illustrated by Respondent's experts, this leads to a continuously widening gap between the risk-adjusted prices projected by Prof. Davis (solid red line) and the non-risk-adjusted prices projected by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells (green line):1898\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, Figure 12.\n\n1507.\n\nProf. Davis addressed this discrepancy and the criticisms raised by Respondent's experts regarding the use of futures and forward prices and provided various arguments supporting his reliance on these prices both for short-term and long-term predictions. Prof. Davis also presented arguments as to why the forecasts relied on by Respondent's experts should not be used as a basis for making projections, noting in particular that they do not even attempt to predict risk-adjusted prices and are, in his opinion, inconsistent with accepted models of how the commodity markets and specifically the gold price are expected to develop over the long term.\n\n1508.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Prof. Davis' methodological argument, *i.e*., that it would be inaccurate to refer to analyst forecasts to determine risk-adjusted prices sought as input for the modern DCF model and that forward market prices are the best and in fact only indication of how the market prices that risk, is generally plausible. However, taking into account the large gap between particularly the gold price predictions, the Tribunal considers that the plausibility of the price assumptions made by Prof. Davis cannot be assessed without also addressing the question whether there is a plausible reason for the gap to the forecasts of spot prices made by analysts at the same time.\n\n1509.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the suggestion implied in Claimant's and Prof. Davis' argument that forecasts of spot prices are irrelevant to determining the risk-adjusted prices sought for the modern DCF model is not confirmed by the academic literature in the record and also does not correspond to the 2012 CIMVal report. In the Tribunal's view, an article dated 30 December 2005 authored by an economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, assessing whether oil futures prices help predict future oil prices, is particularly instructive. The author first confirmed that \"[o]*il futures prices reflect the price that both the buyer and the seller agree will be the price of oil upon delivery. Therefore, these prices provide direct information about investor's expectations about the future price of oil*.\" He added, however, that oil futures prices include risk premiums to reflect the possibility of higher or lower prices and that those risk premiums are \"*quite large and volatile over time*,\" which suggested that \"*oil futures prices are not necessarily the best predictor of future oil prices*.\"1899 The author then stated that \"[t]*he current, or spot, oil prive may also help predict future oil price movements*\" and, based on an assessment of four models based on oil futures prices and the spot oil price, reached the following conclusion:\n\n\"*Raw futures prices are found to be unbiased predictors of future oil prices; that is, for the past two decades, the raw oil futures prices are as likely to overpredict as to underpredict future oil prices. However, while the average of forecasting errors based on raw futures prices may be close to zero, such errors are quite large over time. Indeed, raw oil futures prices provide relatively less accurate forecasts than models using both the futures prices and spot price (the* 'futures-spot spread' *model). Therefore, incorporating information on the relationship between current futures prices and spot price improves the forecast*.\"1900\n\n**Exhibit BW-71**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit BW-71**, p. 2.\n\n1510.\n\nThe author also noted that futures prices were more accurate in predicting near-term oil price movements than longer-term movements and provided the following explanation: \"*The observation that futures prices are more useful in forecasting near-term oil price movements may reflect the fact that the near-term oil futures markets are much more liquid than longer-term futures markets. For instance, the average daily trading volume of the* 'light, sweet crude oil' *futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange over the past two years is about 72,600 contracts for a horizon of one month, 22,000 units for two months, 4,800 for four months, and only 1,000 units for the one-year horizon (one unit repre-sents 1,000 barrels). As the futures market becomes less liquid at longer horizons, the quoted futures prices may become a less accurate measure of expected oil prices, because they are more vulnerable to shocks that may not be related to the expected oil price movements in the future*.\"1901\n\n**Exhibit BW-71**, pp. 2-3.\n\n1511.\n\nHe then concluded with the section quoted by Respondent's experts in their second report: \"*Oil futures prices contain important information about future oil price movements, especially for the near term. In particular, taking into account the relationship between current spot and futures prices instead of considering only the raw futures price can significantly improve forecasting accuracy. Prediction errors, however, are still substantial, and accurately predicting the future price of oil seems as elusive as ever*.\"1902\n\n**Exhibit BW-71**, p. 3.\n\n1512.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that this paper was limited to discussing the usefulness of futures prices to predicting future oil prices and did not extend its conclusions to predictions of gold or copper prices, the Tribunal does consider it instructive that, at least for oil, there are indications that futures prices may not be, in isolation, the best indicator of future prices but that forecasts of spot prices and different models describing the relationship between futures and spot prices may also be considered useful to obtain a more accurate prediction of future prices. The Tribunal appreciates the fact that Prof. Davis did not attempt to predict actual future prices but rather prices which have already been adjusted for the risk associated with price uncertainty. However, the Tribunal cannot accept that forecasts of the spot price would therefore be considered irrelevant. More specifically, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would base its price assumptions exclusively on forward markets and not take into account at all forecasts of spot prices, in particular when taking into account the undisputed volatility of prices and difficulty in predicting them, the large impact of this volatility on the value of the project as well as the long life of the mine over which the predictions made by the forward markets have to be extrapolated, thus creating considerable additional uncertainty.\n\n1513.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the reasonableness of taking into account more than one source for a price assumption is also confirmed by CIMVal, which reports in response to the question how future prices are estimated that they \"*generally use a combination of sources to estimate forecast future metal prices, including management forecasts, spot prices, consensus forecasts from investment banks and forecasts derived from forward curves as the circumstances dictate*.\" CIMVal then explains in detail as to why it considers that \"*in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast may be derived from its forward price curve*\" and that \"[m]*etal price forecasts based on the forward curve may be extended beyond the publicly quoted prices based on the characteristics of the metal \u2026 and the market characteristics of the forward curve*.\" CIMVal explicitly confirms that \"[t]*he forward price is considered a risk\u2014adjusted expected price since a party choosing to buy or sell a commodity in the future would first need to estimate what the spot price might be and then adjust this estimated price for variance around the forecast (i.e., applying a risk adjustment).*\"1903\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 10.\n\n1514.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is a strong indication for the soundness of Prof. Davis' approach to rely on market data from the forward markets and to extrapolate the forward market curve to obtain data for the period of 10+x years after the valuation date. However, the Tribunal cannot deduce from CIMVal's explanation that it would be inaccurate to cross-check the results obtained with this approach by looking, *inter alia*, at spot prices and consensus forecasts. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it likely that a buyer would also take into account more than one source for the prediction of future prices and at least consider whether there is a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the prices forecast by analysts and the prices quoted in the futures and forward markets.\n\n1515.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant and Prof. Davis argued that the Consensus Economics forecast relied on by Respondent's experts is unreliable and has historically been biased downwards. Specifically, Prof. Davis noted that analysts have continuously underpredicted gold prices, on average, since they started to publish long-term forecasts in 1998 and further argued that the forecasts are contrary to investors' expectations that an investment in gold yields a positive return. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, on the other hand, noted that the under-prediction occurred only in times of increasing prices and that, by contrast, analysts over-predicted prices when they started to fall. While Claimant argues that this shows the general unreliability of the forecast, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells pointed out that a similar correlation of under-prediction of rising prices and overprediction of falling prices also occurs in the futures market for gold and copper prices. That this is in fact the case is confirmed by Prof. Davis' illustration of the gold forward curves between January 2008 and September 2011:1904\n\nDavis I, Appendix C, Figure C-4.\n\n1516.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that an average under-prediction of prices while they were rising would suffice to demonstrate a general \"*downward bias*\" of consensus forecasts or to fully explain the discrepancy between the consensus forecasts and the forward curve. In fact, recalling the statement made by Respondent's experts that \"[n]*either the futures prices nor consensus forecasts have a really good predictive record*,\"1905 the Tribunal considers its conclusion reinforced that while it is reasonable to rely on data from the forward markets, a buyer would likely also cross-check the plausibility of the assumptions made on the basis of such forward market data by looking at other indicators of future prices, such as those listed by CIMVal, which specifically include spot prices and consensus forecasts.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 157.\n\n1517.\n\nIn the opinion of Prof. Davis, the unreliability of the Economic Consensus forecast for the gold price is further demonstrated by the fact that it contradicts expectations of investors to receive a positive return when investing in gold as well as the actual development of the spot price as of the valuation date. The Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties' experts to the extent that gold can be characterized as an investment asset but that they disagree as to the expected long-term development of the gold price. While Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells initially agreed with Prof. Davis \"*that copper and oil tend to follow a mean-reverting behavior, and that gold varies as a random walk process with a drift,*\"1906 they claimed to have found in their second report that \"*the price of gold is also mean reverting, as are prices of copper and oil. It is not the* 'random walk with time-dependent drift' *that Brattle assumes to obtain its ever-rising pattern for gold*.\"1907 As Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells introduced this finding and the method on which it was based only in their second report, Prof. Davis did not have the opportunity to respond to it in writing. At the Hearing on Quantum, he testified that \"[t]*he test* [suggested by Prof. Wells and Mr. Brailovsky] *was not conducted using appropriate statistical procedure*\" and that their calculation reflected \"*an error in a key statistic*.\"1908 In support of his opinion, he referred to an appendix of his presentation.1909 Claimant further introduced an additional excerpt from the textbook on which Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had relied in carrying out their test, which confirmed in its view that the test could not be used for the purposes of verifying whether or not the gold price is mean-reverting.1910 According to Claimant, additional data produced by Respondent revealed that Respondent's experts also performed the correct test which yielded the opposite conclusion, *i.e*., that it cannot be rejected statistically that the gold price is not mean-reverting.1911 All of these exhibits were admitted *de bene esse* and are now admitted into the record.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 143.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 63.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2346 lines 16-21.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1782**; Davis Presentation, pp. 23, 54.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1766**, p. 77. *See also* **Exhibit BW-82.08**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1782A**.\n\n1518.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding as to the accuracy or reliability of either of the statistical tests applied by the Parties' experts to assess whether or not the gold price follows a mean-reverting pattern like copper or oil. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that a consensus forecast predicting considerably lower prices and, perhaps even more importantly, a different price trend than the forward market would not have been taken into account at all by a buyer valuing the project as of the valuation date. More specifically, the Tribunal does not consider it established that a buyer would have based its price assumption exclusively on the forward market curve, extrapolating it to predict a constant increase of the gold price for 56 years into the future, without accounting for the possibility that gold prices might develop differently, despite the considerable deviation between the predictions derived from forward markets and from the Consensus Economics forecasts, respectively.\n\n1519.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal is convinced that Prof. Davis' approach to use the forward market curve as a basis to determine risk-adjusted prices is methodologically sound and therefore considers it likely that a buyer would also have used this approach as a basis for its price predictions. The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that this approach fully captures the risk associated with the fluctuation of prices over a time period of 56 years. In the Tribunal's view, this applies not only to the gold price for which the discrepancy between the forward curve and consensus forecasts is particularly large, but also to the prices for copper and oil. Claimant itself noted that \"[t]*he range of variability in projecting* [price fluctuations] *years into the future is massive*.\"1912 While Claimant argues that the discount made by Prof. Davis for systematic risk is \"*likely to be significant*\" and claims that \"[t]*here is no reason to assume \u2026 that the corresponding discount is a small number*,\"1913 the Tribunal notes that Claimant bears the burden of proving that Prof. Davis fully captured the impact of systematic risk on the value of its investment.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 346.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 346.\n\n1520.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Prof. Davis has applied a probabilistic approach, which means that, only on average, he assumed that prices would have developed along the forward curve and its extrapolation, while in a certain number of his simulations, prices would also have turned out to be significantly lower (or, in the case of oil, higher) than this average. In the Tribunal's view, this shows that he did recognize a certain risk of prices developing differently and it would therefore not be appropriate to make a finding that the price prediction made by a buyer would have been, *e.g*., in the middle between the forward curve and the analyst forecasts. The Tribunal also notes that it has not been provided with sensitivity analyses using different price predictions; however, it has been provided with the average value based on forward curve price predictions (USD 8.5 billion) and the average value based on Consensus Economics forecasts (USD -1.23 billion when using them for gold, copper and oil).\n\n1521.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore proceed to make what it considers to be the most reasonable assumption in the circumstances of the case. Based on the considerations set out above and the difference of almost USD 10 billion between the calculations made by the Parties' experts, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that a buyer would have factored in the possibility that not all of the systematic risk associated with the development of prices over the 56-year life of the mine is fully captured in the available market data and quotations going up to ten years into the future and the extrapolation of such data over the remainder of the mine's life. It is undisputed that there is no market pricing of the systematic risk extending over a 56-year mine life and Prof. Davis specifically agreed at the Hearing on Quantum that the cash flows acquired by the buyer would remain \"*highly uncertain and highly risky*.\"1914 The Tribunal therefore concludes that it is likely that a buyer would have assigned a price to assuming this long-term risk by reducing its expectation of the cash flows that the Reko Diq project would generate over the life of the mine by 25%. This results in a reduction of the value of Claimant's investment by USD 2,430 million.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2484 line 15-18.\n\n**b. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Risk of Increases in Capital and Operating Expenditures (Other than Oil)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1522.\n\nIn addition to the risk associated with the projection of prices for gold, copper and oil, there is common ground that the project also faced uncertainty regarding the expected costs or, more precisely, costs other than oil which has already been addressed above. In this regard, Prof. Davis explained that he had referred to futures markets where available, such as for oil, but could not do so where there is no futures markets pricing the expected costs. He added that \"[i]*f there are no market signals to determine the at-source risk adjustments for the risks of some cost elements and the traditional projections are used instead (as would be available from engineering studies for example), then the net present value of costs will be overstated and project value understated, since costs are a substraction from revenues and the necessary adjustment for systematic risk, whether done at-source or through the discount rate, would lower their value*.\"1915\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 94.\n\n1523.\n\nWith regard to capital costs, Prof. Davis explained that he had made certain adjustments to the cost estimates contained in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, accounting for inflation until the valuation date, cost escalation based on forecasts for capital cost escalation rates as well as general inflation based on inflation swaps reflecting market expectation of inflation and its correlation to the overall market. Prof. Davis stated that these adjustments increased the cumulative capital costs in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study by 136% and 99%, respectively.1916 He explained that, in addition to the adjustments for systematic risk, cost projections also had to be adjusted to reflect the impact of asymmetric risk, which he had done separately. Finally, Prof. Davis noted that he had refrained from making adjustments for the systematic risk of variation around the mean correlated with overall market movements because he considered this risk difficult to quantify in a reliable manner and \"*excluding the adjustment possibly overstates the present value of costs and understates project value*.\"1917\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 156-159.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 160-161.\n\n1524.\n\nAs for operating costs, Prof. Davis stated that he had used the project operating cost schedules which had been updated by Barrick in 2011 based on updated fuel prices and other cost information obtained through its global supply chain organization. Noting that fuel made up 38% of operating costs in the Initial Mine Development scenario and 40% in the Expansion Scenario and that these costs were \"*highly correlated with crude oil prices,*\" Prof. Davis estimated fuel operating costs based on oil market price signals.1918 As for non-fuel operating costs, he modeled increases in real operating costs based on escalation rates forecasts, amounting to 11% over the four years following the valuation date. He then converted these costs into nominal terms by using the forecast of CPI inflation which als reflects systematic risk in price inflation. According to Prof. Davis, this resulted in a cumulative increase of the non-fuel operating costs included in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study by 225% and 141%, respectively.1919 Prof. Davis further referred to additional adjustments made to account for asymmetric risks identified in Claimant's risk register.1920\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 163-171.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 172-173.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 174.\n\n1525.\n\nIn their first report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis for failing to account for potential cost overruns in his model. In their opinion, the adjustments he had made to the capital cost estimates of the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study \"*result from normal inflation rates accumulated over a period of 65 years, not from any consideration of cost overruns*.\" They noted that Prof. Davis had made \"*some adjustment*\" for \"*residual risk*\" concerning capital expenditures which represented 1.7% of the value of the investment program and, in their opinion, \"*does not seem at all commensurate with the experience of cost overruns.*\" For operating costs, Respondent's experts considered that \"*a similarly minor adjustment for risk is included, equivalent to 2.4% of* [operating] *costs*.\"1921 Specifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells referred to studies comparing capital cost estimates in feasibility studies and capital costs actually incurred, resulting in an average cost overrun of 22%; they further quoted from the former Director of Project Evaluations at Barrick, who suggested in an article that \"*up to 50%*\" should be added to costs and schedule when looking at feasibility studies prepared for a remote area in a third-world country.1922 They also noted that, by contrast to the price of oil, Prof. Davis had not modeled variability for other costs or production quantities; in their opinion, the software Prof. Davis had used would have enabled him \"*to make a reasonable assumption of the type of probability distribution that best fits capital expenditures in the mining industry, as well as its dispersion*.\" They concluded that accounting for capital cost overruns \"*would greatly reduce the value of the claim*.\"1923\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39; **Exhibits BW-5** and **BW-17**.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 122, 125.\n\n1526.\n\nProf. Davis responded to these criticisms in his second report by pointing out that the adjustments he had made accounted for cost overruns that can result from general inflation associated with delays, \"*real*\" cost increases and growth in the quantity estimates, \"*resulting in total escalation well above the benchmarks that Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells cite*.\" Specifically, Prof. Davis explained that the expected initial mine development costs in his model were 58% higher than the estimate in the Feasibility Study. He rejected the argument that his adjustment accounted only for inflation and noted that it was difficult to understand \"*how inflation over 65 years is at all relevant, when most capital expenditures are incurred upfront, when the mine is built.*\" He also emphasized that the effects of inflation have to be included when cost overruns are reported and therefore also form part of his adjustments.1924\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 154-156.\n\n1527.\n\nProf. Davis explained that he had made the following adjustments to the Feasibility Study's capital cost estimate: (i) increase by 18% to account for inflation up to the valuation date; (ii) increase by 21.4% to account for \"*real*\" cost escalation (in excess of inflation) over the five-year period following the valuation date; (iii) increase by expected rate of CPI inflation over the same period; and (iv) further increases to account for asymmetric risks identified by Claimant in its residual risk register that would result in cost overruns, the effects of which are \"*typically small for large projects*.\"1925\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 158-159.\n\n1528.\n\nProf. Davis emphasized that his adjustments went beyond the contingency included in the Feasibility Study and built in \"*a substantial increase in both capital and operating costs in an environment with rising commodity prices*.\" Specifically, he noted that by updating the cost estimates from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study made as of October 2009, he increased Opex estimates by 10-11% and Capex estimates by 17-18%.1926 He stated that by adjusting both capital and operating cost estimates as well as closure costs based on cost escalation forecasts, he had reduced the value of Claimant's investment by more than USD 2 billion.1927\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 160-165.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n1529.\n\nProf. Davis emphasized that contrary to what Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells appeared to suggest, \"*neither capital nor operating cots rise proportionally with commodity prices*,\" which he illustrated as follows:1928\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 166 and Figure 11.\n\n1530.\n\nFinally, Prof. Davis noted that he had not modeled capital cost variability around the projected average values in his first report as he did not expect that it would have a significant effect on his value estimate but had now performed such a test, incorporating into the simulation the possibility that capital costs would vary above or below the projected values. Prof. Davis stated that the effect of this addition was a decrease in project value by 1.5% to USD 8.4 billion.1929\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 188-190.\n\n1531.\n\nAs for operating costs, Prof. Davis explained that he had increased the cost estimate by 11.6% (initial mine development scenario) and 9.8% (expansion scenario) to account for cost increases up to the valuation date based on Barrick's updated cost schedule and, in addition, for real escalation of costs for future periods based on cost escalation forecasts for the mining industry. According to Prof. Davis, these adjustments also accounted for inflation in labor costs associated with rising commodities markets.1930\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 204.\n\n1532.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells argued that the expenditures modelded by Prof. Davis were \"*only slightly higher than those of the SNC-Lavalin study, 2.7% in constant terms.*\" They recognized that \"*the capital expenditure is much higher, by US$ 2.96 billion*,\" maintaining that \"*most of the increase*\" was the result of inflation adjustments, but emphasized that operating costs were \"*much lower, by US$ 2.4 billion, largely offsetting each other,*\" without any explanation from Prof. Davis on this point.1931\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 84 and Table 3.\n\n1533.\n\nRespondent's experts further considered that the effect of variability for capital costs calculated by Prof. Davis was inconsistent with his own writings in which he reported that \"[c]*ost overruns of 100% or more happen in roughly 1 out of 13 projects*\" and referred to an intentional and rational bias, \"*driven by a scarcity of project financing and the need by project sponsors to inflate the project economics in a bid to secure financing*.\"1932 Respondent's experts further considered that in making his test for variability, Prof. Davis had incorrectly applied a distribution mean of 1 even though his study indicated that the distribution mean should be 1.25, stating that it had established \"*a bias in mining project capital cost estimates that results in as-built capital costs being 25% higher than the estimate in the feasibility study*.\" Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells added that using the correct distribution mean, the effect of modeling cost variability would have been to reduce the value by an additional USD 2 billion, *i.e*., to USD 6.4 billion.1933\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144; **Exhibit BW-13**, pp. 118-139.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 145; **Exhibit BW-13**, p. 130; **Exhibit BW-82.19**.\n\n1534.\n\nRespondent's experts further noted that Prof. Davis had not tested the effects of modeling variability of operating costs. In their opinion, incorporating variability for both capital and operating costs (using \"*half the mean bias*\" used for capital costs variability, *i.e*., 1,125) would reduce the value to USD 5.2 billion.1934\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 148; **Exhibit BW-82.20**.\n\n1535.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis confirmed that the study he had worked on in 2008 concluded that \"*the cash spent* [on mining projects] *tended to be 25 percent more than what was listed in the Feasibility Study*.\" He also referred to the other sources relied on by Respondent's experts, suggesting an increase of 22% and up to 50%, respectively, and reiterated that he had already \"*added 58 percent to Feasibility Study costs to allow for cost overruns*.\" Prof. Davis further noted that he had incorporated substantial project delay risks, estimating an average delay of 5.3 years between the completion of the Feasibility Study and start of construction, which he also described as \"*de-risking because that then causes additional costs while you're waiting and being delayed. It also causes extra Capital Cost Inflation, and it pushes your revenues more and causes them to be discounted more for time*.\"1935\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2350 line 8 to p. 2352 line 14; Davis Presentation, pp. 30-32.\n\n1536.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is undisputed that Prof. Davis made significant adjustments to the capital cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Specifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not dispute that Prof. Davis increased the capital cost estimate by 58% in nominal terms (corresponding to a 33% increase in real terms) and they recognized in their comparison of Prof. Davis' numbers to the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study that Prof. Davis' capital cost estimate was almost USD 3 billion higher than its equivalent in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. While they maintained their opinion that this increase was largely due to inflation adjustments, they did not engage with Prof. Davis' explanation that adjustments for inflation have to be included in this calculation because the cost overruns reported for othe mining projects also include the effects of inflation. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also did not respond to Prof. Davis' explanation that the effects of inflation are in any event limited as most of the capital costs are incurred during the construction period and thus in the first few years after the feasibility study. In the absence of any further substantiated argument on this point, the Tribunal cannot follow the opinion of Respondent's experts that Prof. Davis' adjustments to capital costs did not actually account for the risk of cost overruns experienced by other mining projects.\n\n1537.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further argued that Prof. Davis had not adequately modeled variability of capital costs and thereby significantly understated the effect of incorporating this aspect of volatility into his model. While Prof. Davis did not specifically refer to Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' criticism regarding his use of an allegedly incorrect distribution mean, Claimant pointed out in its Post-Hearing Brief that the distribution mean of 1.25 indicated in Prof. Davis' research would have applied to feasibility study costs. Given that Prof. Davis already made adjustments of 58% in nominal terms (corresponding to 33% in real terms) to the cost estimates in the Feasibiluty Study, Claimant argued that \"*Prof. Davis did not err by conservatively modeling capital cost volatility with a mean even higher than the 25% average cost overrun reported in his paper.*\"1936\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 438-439.\n\n1538.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it would appear incorrect to apply the distribution mean of 1.25, which reflects the assumption that costs will be 25% higher than estimated in the feasibility study, to a cost estimate which has already been adjusted (by more than 25%) to account for likely cost increases *vis-\u00e0-vis* the feasibility study estimate. Prof. Davis has shown that the adjustments he has made exceed the cost increases suggested by the sources relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, including the highest increase of \"*up to 50%*\" suggested for projects in remote, third-world countries.1937\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibit BW-17**, p. 14.\n\n1539.\n\nIn the absence of any substantiated argument as to why the cost adjustments made by Prof. Davis would not reflect the cost increases reported or suggested by the sources relied on by Respondent's experts and in particular the 25% increase established in Prof. Davis' research from 2008, the Tribunal sees no basis to conclude that Prof. Davis should have applied a distribution mean of >1 when modeling the variability of capital costs around his increased cost estimate. However, as Prof. Davis' own analysis has yielded an impact on the value of the project, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by 1.5% or USD 130 million,1938 the Tribunal considers that this amount has to be deducted from the amount of compensation to which Claimant is entitled.\n\nDavis II, Workpaper R-1, Scenario 10.\n\n1540.\n\nAs for operating costs, Prof. Wells maintained at the Hearing on Quantum that variance in operating costs was a significant factor for a non-operational project: \"*If you have an ongoing project, the variance is usually prices. That's where the great uncertainty lies. If you do not have an ongoing project there are large uncertainties in other elements of the cash flow and those, in effect, compound. Once looking in the cash flow at the difference between uncertain revenues, prices, and uncertain costs--well, capital investments and Operating Costs--then the variance becomes particularly large*.\"1939 Mr. Brailovsky confirmed that oil prices, which Prof. Davis had simulated in his valuation model based on futures and forward market data, accounted for about 40% of the operating expenses.1940 He also confirmed that Prof. Davis' assumption of operating expenses was different from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study but again questioned why Prof. Davis' estimate was in fact lower (USD 23.6 billion as opposed to USD 26 billion) even though he, Mr. Brailovsky, would have expected the risk-adjusted price for oil to be higher than the non-adjusted price.1941\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2591 line 16 to p. 2592 line 3.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2639 line 6 to p. 2640 line 5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2640 line 14 to p. 2641 line 14.\n\n1541.\n\nProf. Davis was not cross-examined on the question why his estimate of operating costs was lower than the estimate included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study or why he decided to not also model variability of operating costs. However, Claimant's position is indicated in its questions to Mr. Brailovsky regarding the comparison drawn by Respondent's experts between Prof. Davis' model and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, in particular the question whether he understood that \"*the reason Professor Davis's aggregate number for Operating Expenses is lower than the one in the Expansion Feasibility Study is largely driven, not by a failure to account for risk, but by simulating and using risk-adjusted prices in the forecast for oil.*\"1942 The Tribunal has already addressed the disagreement between the Parties and their experts regarding the determination of risk-adjusted prices based on futures and forward market data above and it has found that while Prof. Davis' approach was generally reasonable, a buyer would likely have cross-checked the plausibility of its price assumptions and made a deduction from the purchase price it would be willing to pay to account for the long-term risk of price uncertainty associated with the 56-year life of the mine and the corresponding need to extrapolate forward market data over a significant period of time. This deduction also covered the reduction in value that resulted from basing price predictions for crude oil (as an indicator for the price of different types of fuel that Claimant contemplated to use for the project) on consensus forecasts, which projected higher prices than Prof. Davis derived from the forward market.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2641 lines 5-10.\n\n1542.\n\nAs for the non-fuel operating costs, Prof. Davis explained in his reports that he increased the cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study for inflation up to the valuation date, real escalation as forecasted for the mining industry, and future inflation after the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not raise any substantiated criticisms with regard to either of these adjustments but only referred to the overall estimate for operating expenses which showed in their opinion that no significant risk adjustments were made. Consequently, the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that Prof. Davis' adjustments to non-fuel operating costs were inadequate. It also sees no basis to question that the overall lower figure in Prof. Davis' estimate of operating expenses is indeed due to his adjustments regarding fuel operating costs, which undisputedly made up close to 40% of the total operating expenses.\n\n1543.\n\nWith regard to the variability of operating costs and the impact that such a calculation would have had on the value of Claimant's investment, the Tribunal notes that Respondent's experts again assumed in their calculation that the distribution mean would be >1, *i.e*., in this case 1,125. They did not provide any basis for this assumption, except that it was \"*half the mean bias \u2026 used for capital cost variability*.\"1943 The Tribunal also considers that similarly to the calculation for capital costs, it appears incorrect to apply the distribution mean to Prof. Davis' cost estimate which has already been adjusted to account for the same cost increases that are also reflected in the distribution mean. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot accept the calculation made by Respondent's experts with regard to the impact of modeling variability for operating costs.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, note 210.\n\n1544.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that with the exception of the reduction for variability of capital costs calculated by Prof. Davis in the amount of USD 130 million, no further reduction is warranted to account for potential increases in capital costs or operating costs of the project.\n\n**c. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Asymmetric Risks Affecting the Project, in Particular for Country-related Risks**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1545.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties and their experts that the project also faced asymmetric risks, which Prof. Davis described as \"*negative events that are specific to the asset rather than affecting the market at large*.\"1944 Prof. Davis explained that most of the risks identified in Claimant's residual risk register qualified as asymmetric risks and described the approach to account for them risks as follows:\n\n\"*The first step to risk adjustment is to adjust the affected cash flow components for these potential negative events such that the correct probability-weighted cash flow is used in the analysis. For example, if there is a risk that unforeseen accidents will lead to increased costs, this must be accounted for by increasing the expected operating costs or decreasing the expected operating revenues*.\"1945\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 86.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 86.\n\n1546.\n\nProf. Davis stated that \"[t]*he potential negative events considered* [in the risk register] *include many country-specific risks during both the construction and operation phases of the project*\" and referred to \"*corruption, armed conflict, delays due to inexperienced workforces and government authorities, logistics disruptions, community relations impacts, and changing regulations*.\" He also noted that \"[t]*he analysis also contemplated the possibility of nationalization, which I exclude from my damages calculation by instruction*.\"1946 Prof. Davis explained that Claimant had monetized the financial impact for those events that, if realized in their mitigated state, would have direct financial consequences for the operations, into either a capital cost or operating cost. In order to effect asymmetric risk adjustment, Prof. Davis added these estimated impacts to his valuation, with the exception of those events that would lead to a project delay before ramp-up which were modeled separately in his valuation, and made the same adjustments to these additional costs that he also made for the other capital and operating costs.1947\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 181.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\n1547.\n\nProf. Davis further explained that he classified those risks for which Claimant had not quantified a financial impact in three categories and made separate adjustments for each category: (i) events that could lead to early termination were addressed by assuming an annual 0.5% probability of early shut down; (ii) events that could cause project delays before construction were addressed by assuming that it would take, on average, 3.8 years from the valuation date (or 5.3 years from the completion of the Feasibility Study) until the start of construction; and (iii) risks that could cause temporary interruption of operations would have been addressed either by the planned activities in the risk register or the insurance policies taken out by Barrick and/or Claimant. Prof. Davis noted that the adjustments he had made for these asymmetric risks reduced the value of Claimant's investment by approximately USD 3.4 billion.1948 Further explanations regarding the individual adjustments made for each category of asymmetric risks were provided in Appendix D to Prof. Davis' first report.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6\u00b6 187-198.\n\n1548.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it has already addressed these adjustments as well as the arguments raised by Respondent and its experts in this regard. Specifically, the Tribunal has already addressed both the 0.5% annual probability of an early mine shut down and Prof. Davis' reference to business interruption insurance that Claimant was planning to purchase in the context of its discussion whether Prof. Davis had adequately quantified residual security-related risks. The Tribunal has also addressed the average delay modeled by Prof. Davis until the start of construction in the context of the question whether Claimant had a reasonable plan and schedule for obtaining the permits and approvals required to construct and operate the project.\n\n1549.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has not yet assessed the more general argument raised by Respondents and its experts that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis cannot be considered sufficient to account for the country risk affecting the project. In the opinion of Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, the country risk should be reflected in the discount rate applied to the cash flows of the project, which would lead to a fair market value of zero regardless of the precise discount rate being used, as the value would turn negative at any rate above 13.2%.1949 They noted that \"[a]*lthough we believe that the discount rate that would actually be applied by a potential investor in 2011 would be above 30%, there is no need to choose an exact number to understand that the project would attract no investor even if one accepts the optimistic assumptions on which the SNC-Lavalin reports are based*.\" They also referred to Dr. Burrows' calculation of a discount rate of 23% for Pakistan and added that \"[n]*o doubt, given the higher risks facing an investor in Balochistan than in Pakistan in general, the actual discount rate, or hurdle rate, used by a potential buyer would be higher than that. Still, even if a potential buyer were to accept a rate considerably lower than 23%, the SNC-Lavalin report shows that the project is unattractive to a buyer*.\"1950\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 162, 166, 17.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 72-73.\n\n1550.\n\nProf. Davis responded to this criticism in his second report by emphasizing that country risk is an example of asymmetric risk and maintaining that \"[t]*he appropriate way to take these risks into account is to directly adjust the cash flow components affected by these risks such that the cash flows reflect the statistically expected, or average outcome*.\" In his opinion, Respondent's experts \"*instead arbitrarily increase the discount rate to try to account for the valuation effects of asymmetric risks*.\"1951 Prof. Davis noted that they did not provide any quantification of the risks they had discussed in their first report \"*other than the impact of a single, catch-all country risk premium that would raise the traditional DCF risk-adjusted discount rate to above 30%.*\" As he did not use the traditional DCF method, Prof. Davis considered that \"*the idea of using a 30% discount rate does not apply to* [his] *analysis*\" and added that this measure of country risk would in any event be \"*ad-hoc and excessive even within the traditional DCF model*.\"1952\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 42.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\n1551.\n\nProf. Davis quantified the adjustments he had made for asymmetric risks as follows: (i) higher expected capital expenditures, operating costs, and closure costs needed to mitigate the asymmetric risks identified by Claimant in its risk register, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by USD 0.5 billion; (ii) projected operational interruptions and consequent decreased annual production, including the additional adjustment for a 24-month ramp-up that he made in his second report based on the expert opinion of Mr. Cusworth, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by USD 0.6 billion; (iii) projected delays prior to or during construction causing additional costs, additional cost inflation and delays in the receipt of revenues, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by USD 1.3 billion; and (iv) a chance of a permanent shutdown of the project and subsequent loss of all cash flows except closure costs, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by USD 1.6 billion. As already addressed in the context of the adjustments made to capital and operating cost estimates, Prof. Davis also referred to an escalation of construction and operational costs based on forecasts for the mining industry, reducing the value of Claimant's investment by a further USD 2.1 billion. In total Prof. Davis specified that his adjustments for asymmetric risk reduced the value of Claimant's investment from USD 14.7 billion to USD 8.5 billion.1953\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n1552.\n\nProf. Davis further did not agree with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that the value of the project turned negative when applying a discount rate above 13.2%, noting that they had derived this figure from the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which, besides being a calculation in a technical study rather than a valuation, had not been updated to the valuation date. Prof. Davis then presented such an update of the calculation reflecting conditions at the valuation date which yielded a net present value of USD 4.03 billion for the project and USD 3.02 billion for Claimant's 75% share, implying an internal rate of return of 18.5%.1954 Prof. Davis further rejected the suggestion of a hurdle rate and/or discount rate of 30% as both unsupported and contradicted by Claimant's previous investment decisions and further explained why he considered that Dr. Burrows' method of determining country risk based on Pakistan's sovereign yield spread was not appropriate in the present case.1955\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis presented a revised calculation of this updated value based on the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study in which he had corrected an error identified in his preparation for the Hearing. This correction was subject to an extended debate between the Parties at the Hearing on Quantum and will be addressed in more detail in the context of the Tribunal's verification of its conclusion on the value of Claimant's investment taking into account the updated calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study presented by Prof. Davis.\n\nDavis II, Section VI.\n\n1553.\n\nIn their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells maintained their opinion that Prof. Davis' model \"*completely disregards the notion of country risk*,\" arguing that \"*the alleged risk adjustment in the cash flows* [is] *Brattle's* 'fudge factor' *and one that is ridiculously low.*\" They rejected the argument that they were double-counting risk, noting that \"*one cannot double count risks when none are accounted for in the first place*.\"1956 In their opinion, Prof. Davis' model implies a discount rate of only 4.2%, arguing that when all risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis are excluded, cash flows are only USD 3.3 billion higher (as opposed to USD 4.0 billion as claimed by Prof. Davis) than with his risk adjustments. Noting that this implied discount rate was only 1.2% above the risk-free rate applied by Prof. Davis, Respondent's experts considered this calculation as proof that Prof. Davis did not make more than \"*negligible*\" risk adjustments.1957\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 117.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 101-109 and Table 4.\n\n1554.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells discussed several decisions involving Venezuela in which they had participated as economic experts for the respondent and in which arbitral tribunals had considered it appropriate to apply a country risk premium of 15.75% or a discount rate of 19.88% and 18%, respectively.1958 In their opinion, Prof. Davis' model has not otherwise accounted for the risks incorporated in such country risk premiums:\n\n\"*Brattle's model is little more than the traditional DCF with revenues valued at Brattle's projections of futures prices, which it paradoxically labels as* 'certainty-equivalent' *notwithstanding their being higher than the Consensus Economics forecasts \u2014which presumably incorporate risk\u2014 and an extremely low discount rate. That is not* 'modern' *; it is manipulation of a methodology with an inaccurate description of what was actually done.*\n\n*Going through the motions and saying that one* 'followed the valuation rules' *and has* 'treated risk at its source' *does not mean that there are rules which allow one to see clearly what is going to happen in the far future, allowing one to eliminate uncertainty, especially in a region such as Balochistan. As Keynes and Knight have stated, uncertainty is a concept that is not amenable to probability calculations. But the fact that uncertainty cannot be assigned probabilities does not mean that it does not exist. To repeat,* 'there are things we don't know we don't know.' *The* 'irreducible uncertain' *cannot be avoided. How can anyone, not just Brattle, measure the uncertainty involved in the* 'known unknowns' *and, even worse, the* 'unknown unknowns' *?*\n\n*In sum, there is no way that the equivalent of adding 1.2% to the risk-free discount rate in a conventional DCF calculation can possibly account for the risks and uncertainty facing this project in Balochistan. It would not even be sufficient for the risks in a similar project in Canada or Australia*.\"1959\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 118-125; *Tidewater Investments SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A., v.

Respondent even considers it accepted by Prof. Davis that the cash flows he determined in his model are not \"*certainty-equivalent*\" but instead \"*highly uncertain and highly risky*\" which, in Respondent's view, \"*makes any reliance on the* 'de-risked' *approach yielding the certainty-equivalent FMV of USD 8.5 million misguided*.\"1960 The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. In particular, the Tribunal does not understand the concept of \"*certainty-equivalent*\" cash flows to mean that a buyer would expect that he would receive this specific amount of cash flows at no risk. Rather, the buyer would be assuming the undisputedly significant level of risk associated with constructing and operating the project at Reko Diq; in return, however, the buyer would also acquire the chance of receiving much higher cash flows than the \"*certainty-equivalent*\" amount calculated by Prof. Davis. As Prof. Davis has explained in detail and as the 2012 CIMVal report confirms, the concept of \"*certainty equivalent*\" cash flows is based on the notion that the risk affecting a particular cash flow is monetized and directly incorporated into the calculation of that cash flow instead of being reflected in an aggregate discount rate.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 338-339.\n\n1556.\n\nIn fact, Prof. Davis explained already in his second report:\n\n\"*There is no doubt that Reko Diq's development plan was subject to asymmetric risks, systematic risks, and unsystematic risks. It may seem counterintuitive that the Project's risky future cash flows could be made equivalent to cash flows that are certain, but it is no different than the notion of fair market value itself \u2013 the FMV is the certain, or fixed, amount that a buyer or seller is accepting now in exchange for the uncertain, or variable, stream of future cash flows that the asset will generate. The FMV is the 'certaintyequivalent' value of the asset itself. Both the traditional DCF and modern DCF produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to that FMV via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk*.\"1961\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 53.\n\n1557.\n\nFor the reasons set out in detail in its assessment of the modern DCF valuation method, the Tribunal is convinced that it is generally appropriate to value the Reko Diq project based on the concept of certainty-equivalent cash flows and neither of the arguments raised by Respondent and its experts cause it to reach a different conclusion. Pursuant to the concept presented by Prof. Davis, the asymmetric risks affecting the project, including county-related risks, should not be reflected in the discount rate as they would be in a traditional DCF calculation but rather in individual risk adjustments made to the cash flows themselves.\n\n1558.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether the asymmetric risk and in particular those risks that would be reflected in a country risk premium applied to the discount rate in a traditional DCF calculation have been fully captured by Prof. Davis' risk adjustments at source. At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis presented a list of the country-related risks that he accounted for in his model.1962 As became clear through this list as well as through Prof. Davis' explanations, he did not identify any of those risks himself but rather relied on the risks identified in the residual risk register that Claimant had appended to the Feasibility Study and continued to update until the valuation date.1963 The Tribunal notes that neither Respondent nor its experts identified any specific country-related risks which were not included in the risk register but which, in their opinion, should have been included and quantified by Prof. Davis in his model. With the exception of the risk of a \"[d]*irect violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, death, business disruption*,\" they also did not raise a substantiated challenge to the specific quantification of any particular risk that Prof. Davis presented in his reports. This applies both to the risks for which Claimant quantified a financial impact and to the risks for which Claimant did not identify a financial impact and Prof. Davis modeled an impact based on his classification of these risks in the three categories referred to above.\n\n*Cf.* Davis Presentation, p. 34.\n\n*See also* Davis I, Appendix D, \u00b6 1.\n\n1559.\n\nFirst, the category of risks that could cause early termination of the project included the risk of a \"[d]*irect violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, dealth, business disruption*,\" which has already been addressed in detail above, as well as the risk of \"*nationalization*,\"1964 which Prof. Davis was instructed to exclude in his valuation. The Tribunal found above that the risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis for the security-related risk of a direct violent attack was not sufficient and should be increased based on his own reliance on OPIC insurance values for this purpose. The Tribunal further considers that it has not been provided with any basis to conclude that a further adjustment is warranted to account for other risks in this category and specifically the risk of \"*nationalization*.\"\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27.\n\n1560.\n\nWhile there is disagreement between the Parties and their experts as to whether it was appropriate for Claimant to instruct Prof. Davis to exclude the risk of nationalization from his valuation, neither Respondent nor its experts have argued that the risk of nationalization would have been significant and, thus, that its inclusion would have had a measurable impact on the value of Claimant's investment as of the valuation date. To the contrary, as pointed out by Claimant, the committee formed by Pakistan for the negotiation of the Mineral Agreement assured Claimant during a meeting held on 8-9 September 2008 \"*about stability, concept and continuity of the policy towards investment of the company in future as no untoward incident of expropriation had ever occurred in Pakistan*.\"1965\n\n**Exhibit RE-717**, p. 3.\n\n1561.\n\nClaimant's witness Ms. Boggs testified during the liability phase that while performing due diligence and country risk analysis for a possible acquisition of claimant in 2006, she \"*also considered the history of foreign investment in Pakistan and found no incidents in which foreign investors' interests had been expropriated and nationalized*.\"1966 Similarly, Mr. Luksic testified that he had been told at the time that \"*although there had been frequent changes between civilian and military Governments, and the political situation had often been volatile, foreign investments had not been expropriated and the different Governments had generally respected the law*.\"1967\n\nBoggs I, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.\n\nLuksic I, \u00b6 14.\n\n1562.\n\nRespondent's expert Dr. Burrows expressed the opinion that \"[t]*he risk of expropriation is a business risk that a hypothetical buyer would take into account and is a risk that would have been knowingly undertaken by the owners of TCC*.\" He did not, however, quantify that risk but only stated that \"[i]*t is unlikely that unlawful actions by Respondent would account for much, if any, of the gap between Professor Davis' 0.5% annual loss probability and my estimates of Pakistan PRS of 4.6-8.2%, nor that the risk of unlawful actions changed drastically from 2006 to 2011*.\"1968 Similarly, Respondent and its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells argued that the risk of expropriation should be included in the determination of country risk, but did not provide any quantification of that risk.1969 In particular, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, while referring to the decisions of arbitral tribunals regarding the country risk of Venezuela, did not express any opinion as to the level of risk of uncompensated expropriation or other unlawful actions prevailing in Pakistan as of the valuation date.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 58.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 347; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 426, 428-429; Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 121-125.\n\n1563.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding on whether it was correct as a matter of law to exclude the general risk of unlawful actions from a valuation of Claimant's investment because, in any event, it has not been established that a buyer would have considered this a significant risk from a factual point of view.\n\n1564.\n\nSecond, the category of risks that could cause project start-up delay includes the risks of \"*Delays in financing due to lenders review of ESIA results*,\" \"*petty corruption resulting in delays and expenses*,\" \"*Cross border consultation & mitigation in Afghanistan caused by the use of water sources resulting in schedule delay and/or community/government opposition or demands*,\" \"*Unfavourable perceptions/interests of our project by local stakeholders*,\" \"*Inability to negotiate Mineral Agreement*,\" \"*Delay in ESIA submittal due to changes in the project description, resulting in a delay of the project*,\" \"*Failure to secure all required permits in good time resulting in project delay*,\" and \"*Water usage by project causes drawdowns that have impacts in Iran resulting in diplomatic challenges*.\"1970\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27.\n\n1565.\n\nThe Tribunal has already addressed most of these risks and the Parties' arguments with regard to the issues reflected in those risk items above. Based on its findings with regard to water, security, environmental and social impacts, permitting and the negotiation of a Mineral Agreement, the Tribunal is convinced that these risks are adequately captured in the delay modeled by Prof. Davis. Based on a review of the 100 largest deposits as of 2011 and the average time period between completion of the feasibility study and the start of construction for these deposits, Prof. Davis modeled in his simulations that it would take, on average, 5.3 years from completion of the Feasibility Study in August 2010 to the start of construction. As the Tribunal has already stated in the context of its assessment on whether likely permitting delays were sufficiently accounted in Prof. Davis' model, Respondent has not raised any substantiated challenge to Prof. Davis' modeling of these delays and the Tribunal therefore sees no basis to assume that they would not have been considered sufficient by a buyer to account for the risks identified above as of the valuation date.\n\n1566.\n\nThird, the category of risks that could cause temporary interruption includes the risks of \"*TCC Security staff Implicated in human rights abuses resulting in reputational damage*,\" \"*Criminal extortion & kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel harm, reputational and financial loss*,\" and \"*Theft of explosives & blasting accessories -linked to CPL13 leading to restrictions on our ability to operate, disruptions and reputational and financial loss*.\"1971\n\nDavis I, Workpaper 27.\n\n1567.\n\nThe Tribunal has already addressed Prof. Davis' modeling of these three security-related risks above. Specifically, Prof. Davis explained that business interruptions lasting longer than 30 days would be covered by business interruption insurance that Claimant was planning to purchase (the premiums for which were included in his cost estimates) and that he had adjusted production quantities to account for shorter interruption, which would not be covered by insurance. Respondent and its experts did not challenge Prof. Davis' approach to these risks and the Tribunal therefore sees no basis to conclude that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis were not sufficient for the purposes of determining the impact of business interruptions.\n\n**d. Whether a Different Conclusion Is Warranted by Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' Argument That the Implied Discount Rate Is Too Low**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1568.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells raised the more general argument that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis for asymmetric risk cannot be considered sufficient because they amount to only USD 3.3 billion and thereby imply a discount rate of 4.2%, *i.e*., only 1.2% above the risk-free rate.\n\n1569.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis disagreed with the calculation of the implied discount rate made by Respondent's experts in their second report and referred to an illustration of the risk adjustments made in his presentation:1972\n\nDavis Presentation, p. 43.\n\n1570.\n\nProf. Davis went on to explain why, in his opinion, the calculation made by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells was incomplete:\n\n\"*What Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells attempted to do is, on the right-hand side, starting at the bottom box, they attempted to unwind my discount for asymmetric and Project risk. So, they attempted to adjust my cash flows upwards to the middle box. And then I believe they thought they had taken all the risks out of the Project, including systematic risk, or all the valuations of the risks. I don't want to say they took the risks out. So, I think they believe they got all the way up to the top box, and then they said--what Discount Rate do I need to use to bring that top right box all the way down to the bottom left box? And they come up with 4.1 percent. If they use 4.1 percent, they get 8.5 billion. The problem is, they didn't get all the way to the top box because they didn't unwind the systematic risk-discounting, and, in fact, they didn't get all the way up to the middle box because they didn't unwind my ramp-up adjustment, which was about USD.6 billion. So, they unwound the cash flows for risk up to maybe the bottom of the middle box and then calculated what equivalent Discount Rate would be needed to bring it back to the bottom left, and they came up with 4.2 percent, something like that. That's my inference of what they did in that calculation*.\"1973\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2509 line 17 to p. 2510 line 20.\n\n1571.\n\nIn response to the question what information would be required in order to calculate the discount rate implied in his calculation, Prof. Davis explained:\n\n\"*Well, you could start by completely unwinding all the asymmetric Project risks, in particular, take the ramp-out up. That would get to you to a little bit of a higher cash flow, and that would require more than a 4.1 percent Discount Rate to bring it back. But then you would need to go further because you would need to go and estimate the actual spot prices for copper, gold, and oil that the Project would be exposed to. That's that red box at the top. You'd need to somehow estimate that, and then you're back to the parallel.*\n\n*We talked about the parallel. I'm not sure which of the arbitrators asked, but we're back to the parallel where you have the complete risk cash flows that you would normally discount and what discount would bring it back. We know it's going to be higher than 4.1 percent. It's impossible to say what it would be without actually doing the exercise.*\n\n*Q. And are you aware of any reliable information that exists to fill in that top right box?*\n\n*A. No. One certainly can't use--as I've argued, one certainly can't use the analyst forecasts. One of the reasons that this modern approach has gained traction and is demanded by industry is because it obviates that need to calculate that unknowable number. We have models. Make no mistake, we have models about what that might be, but we've gotten to the point now in modern finance where we don't even talk about that top right box anymore because it's not of interest. We don't need it. And so that modeling effort is largely going by the wayside*.\"1974\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2511 line 7 to p. 2512 line 17.\n\n1572.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while Prof. Davis argued that the implied discount rate calculated by Respondent's experts did not take into account all of the risk adjustments he had made, he did not provide an alternative figure which would, in his opinion, correspond to the overall implied discount rate. The main reason for Prof. Davis' decision not to present such a figure apparently is that he did not make an assumption as to the non-risk-adjusted prices for copper, gold and oil and therefore did not quantify the systematic risk adjustment he had made through his direct assumption of risk-adjusted prices. He stated that \"*to compute the correct Discount Rate to bring us back to 8.5, if we assume that's the number that we are trying to get, I would need to start with \u2026 an estimate of the cash flows in that question mark red box in the top right. And I don't have that because that was not necessary for my analysis. I started with the certain equivalent cash flows*.\" Prof. Davis added that while he \"*could do the exercise*,\" he had not done so because it was not necessary to estimate the non-risk-adjusted cash flows for his analysis and, therefore, neither he nor the Tribunal had the numerics to make a calculation of the implied discount rate.1975\n\nCf. Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2379 line 3 to p. 2380 line 9.\n\n1573.\n\nHowever, Prof. Davis also argued that Respondent's experts did not even account for all of the asymmetric risk adjustments he had made and referred in particular to the adjustment made for the longer ramp-period he modeled in his second report. To the extent that asymmetric risk is concerned, Prof. Davis did not state that it would be impossible or even difficult to calculate the premium implied by the country-related risk adjustments he made in his model. However, apart from stating that it would be higher than the premium of 1.2% calculated by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, he did not provide any quantification or indication of what would have been the risk premium implied by his adjustments. Respondent's experts in turn did not engage in substance with Prof. Davis' criticism that their calculation did not back out all of the relevant asymmetric (and systematic) risks and did not present an alternative calculation that would also back out the ramp-up delays; they maintained their opinion that the implied discount rate was only 4.2%.1976 Prof. Wells further testified at the Hearing on Quantum:\n\n\"*I note that Professor Davis disagrees somewhat with the number* '4.2 percent.' *We can defend the number, but let's say that we're wrong by 50 percent. That gives a Discount Rate or a profitability of a little more than 6 percent. Clearly, no investor is going to put up 8.5 billion to earn a little more than 6 percent in Balochistan*.\"1977\n\n*Cf*. Brailovsky/Wells Presentation, pp. 21, 32.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2560 lines 4-10.\n\n1574.\n\nMr. Brailovsky further expanded on why they considered their calculation of the implied discount rate to be correct:\n\n\"*Scenario 6, which purports to show his model without any of the systematic, nonsystematic risks included. So, we just took his Scenario 6, which is where he reincorporates all the risks that he adopted. So, we will say that we have, with this scenario, a traditional DCF because the risks are not adopted in the cash flows. So, if we take that scenario and assume that the hypothetical Buyer is going to pay 8.5 billion, well, the Rate of Return would be 4.2 percent.*\n\n*Now, I say* 'traditional' *because there is still the systematic risk. Now, we understand that--and if we look at one of the schematics in Professor Davis's presentation, where you have the first block, which is the unknown revenue including all the risks, and then you take that--you take those risks down to what you have, what you would have is an NPV without the systematic risks. Now, if we do that by using you know, the consensus economics, which presumably has all the risks in, the problem is that the consensus economics revenues would be below, not above us, as in that scheme, but below. And we know that, if they are below that, the NPV, even at the 3 percent risk-free rate would be zero. So, if we try to do a full traditional, we would have to deduct--to start with those prices, which are risk-inclusive, obviously risk inclusive, and come out with a zero NPV*.\"1978\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2563 line 5 to p. 2564 line 10.\n\n1575.\n\nAs reiterated by Mr. Brailovsky in his oral testimony, the calculation of the implied discount rate made by Respondent's experts was based on a comparison of two scenarios in Prof. Davis' updated valuation model submitted together with his second report. Specifically, they compared Scenario 1, which is labelled \"*NPI, Renewal, 2% Royalty, EPZ, Risk Adjustments*,\" with Scenario 6, which is labelled \"*No Asymmetric Risk Adjustments.*\"1979 As noted by Respondent's experts, damages to Claimant are calculated to amount to USD 8.49 billion in Scenario 1 and USD 11.79 billion in Scenario 6.1980 On that basis, they concluded that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis in fact amounted only to USD 3.3 billion and not USD 6 billion as stated in his reports and at the Hearing on Quantum.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 101 and note 129; **Exhibit CE-1530**.\n\nDavis II, Workpaper R-1.\n\n1576.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent's experts that, judging from the label of Scenario 6, *i.e*., \"*No Asymmetric Risk Adjustments*,\" it would appear that the difference between the amounts calculated in Scenarios 1 and 6, respectively, should indeed reflect the entirety of the asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis. However, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis also included a Scenario 11, which is labelled \"*No Political Violence Risk (0.5%)*,\" and a Scenario 12, which is labelled \"*No Residual Risk*.\"1981 This indicates that Prof. Davis quantified the impact of his assumption regarding a 0.5% annual probability of early shutdown as well as residual cost risks quantified in Claimant's risk register separately. Comparing these Scenarios to Scenario 1, Prof. Davis made additional adjustments of USD 1,423 million and USD 505 million, respectively. This also corresponds to the description he provided of these risk adjustments in his second report.1982 Given that, in particular, the risk of political violence has also been characterized as an asymmetric and, more specifically, a country-related risk, this confirms that the implied discount rate calculated by Respondent's experts does not in fact reflect all relevant asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis.\n\nDavis II, Workpaper R-1.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 85.\n\n1577.\n\nAs neither expert has provided the Tribunal with a number of what would be the risk premium reflecting all of the asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal has no basis to draw a comparison to the figures discussed by the Parties' experts with regard to what they would have considered an adequate country risk premium in a traditional DCF calculation. The same applies to the consideration of an overall implied discount rate which would undisputedly have required to remove the adjustments for systematic risk as well. While Mr. Brailovsky reiterated the opinion that no actual adjustment for systematic risk was made when considering that the non-risk-adjusted prices projected by Consensus Economics were lower than the risk-adjusted prices derived by Prof. Davis form the futures and forward markets, the Tribunal notes that it has already addressed this argument above and reached the conclusion that it was generally plausible for Prof. Davis to rely on futures and forward market data but that an additional adjustment accounting for the long-term risk and additional uncertainty created by the extrapolation of market data has to be made. Consequently, and in light of the Tribunal's acceptance of Prof. Davis' approach to the application of the DCF method, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to express an opinion as to the disagreement between the Parties' experts concerning an appropriate discount rate and/or country risk premium for a traditional DCF valuation of Claimant's investment.\n\n**e. Whether a Different Conclusion Is Warranted by the Comparison Drawn by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells to the Cash Flows Calculated in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1578.\n\nAs an additional argument supporting their opinion that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis were insignificant and that his valuation resulted in a positive net present value of Claimant's investment only because he did not apply an appropriate discount rate, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells presented a comparison of the revenues and costs estimated by Prof. Davis in his model with the revenues and costs estimated in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which were undidsputedly made for the purposes of a traditional DCF calculation. In their opinion, the comparison showed a \"*striking and revealing*\" similarity between the two calculations, which warranted the conclusion \"*that both are in reality traditional and that the only decisive driver of differences in valuation is the discount rate.*\"1983 They illustrated this alleged similarity with the following graph:1984\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, Table 3, Graph 5 and \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\n**Exhibit BW-82.09(a)**.\n\n1579.\n\nAs indicated in the legend to the graph, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells made certain adjustments or \"*normalizations*\" to the figures included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study in their second report. They had already presented a similar comparison and graph in their first report to support their argument that the difference in value yielded by both calculations was \"*almost entirely attributable to the different discount rates used in the two studies*.\"1985\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 19 and Figure 2.\n\n1580.\n\nProf. Davis responded to this comparison in his second report by emphasizing that the comparison had been made based on a reduction of the revenues in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study by 20%.1986 In fact, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had noted in the footnote to the graph in their Figure 2 that \"[f]*or the purpose of constructing the graph, the SNC-Lavalin real rates were converted into nominal discount rates in order to make them comparable to the results of the Brattle model. There are of course differences between the SNC-Lavalin pre-feasibility study model and the Brattle model, but it is nonetheless remarkable that these offset each other as shown in Figure 2. The offset is almost perfect if one assumes, as in the figure, the SNC-Lavalin scenario with metal prices about 20% below the base assumption*.\"1987\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 103.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, note 24.\n\n1581.\n\nProf. Davis argued in response that \"*as a conceptual matter, given any two numbers A and B, one can always find some factor by which to adjust A until it equals B. It is a tautology, not a proof that the numbers were the same to begin with, akin to saying that 100 and 80 are the same number because, after adjusting 100 down by 20%, it is the same as 80*.\" Prof. Davis further considered that \"*when the 20% adjustment is removed from their calculation, the two NPVs that they calculate are not particularly close*,\" which he illustrated as follows:1988\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 103 and Figure 1.\n\n1582.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells responded to this argument and graph by noting that \"[i]*t is not surprising that the two models yield different results if one uses much higher prices than the other*.\" In their opinion, however, \"[t]*he real test is whether or not they perform approximately the same at the same prices,\" which they had shown to be the case*.\" They further explained that \"[t]*he use in our first report of a SNC-Lavalin scenario with prices 20% below the central scenario was meant as a short cut to compensate for the fact that real output prices in the SNCLavalin are indeed higher than those of Brattle and that the former does not include the government equity take and risk adjustments*\" and added that \"[i]*n any case, Table 3 and Graph 5 above dispose of Brattle's criticism as they come from a rigorous comparison of the two models. We are left with the corollary that Brattle's approach is a traditional calculation disguised as* 'modern,' *a disguise that allegedly justifies the use of a riskfree discount rate*.\"1989\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 91.\n\n1583.\n\nRespondent's experts emphasized that in this revised, \"*strictly construed comparison of the two models*,\" they had now relied on the central price scenario of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. With regard to the \"*normalized*\" scenario they had used as a basis for their comparison, they explained that \"[i]*n order to improve comparability, \u2026 we adjust the gross revenue of the SNC-Lavalin study to be equal to that of the Brattle report, and add the government equity take and the risk adjustment for early termination. This results in an undiscounted net cash flow of US$10.1 billion*.\" In their opinion, the remaining difference to Prof. Davis' model likely resulted from the fact that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study did not include \"*Brattle's allowance for risk with financial impact that was not quantified by TCC, which is of a similar magnitude*.\"1990\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 81, 86.\n\n1584.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Brailovsky confirmed his explanation that the comparison made in their first report had been a \"*rough-and-ready calculation*,\" using the lower prices scenario to account for the 25% equity share of the GOB as well as the fact that \"*strangely enough, the prices in the SNC are higher than in the Brattle report*.\" He pointed out that the prices in the original version of the central price scenario reported in the second column of the table presenting the revised comparison in their second report were indeed higher and that the government equity take was zero:1991\n\n**Table 3**\n\nComparison of cash flows in real terms: Brattle Report and SNC-Lavalin Prefeasibility Study\n\nMillion undiscounted USS at prices of November 2011\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] | [5] |\n|  | Brattle Report | SNC- Lavalin Report | Difference SNC-Lavalin minus Brattle |\n|  | (average result) |  |  | Report |\n|  |  | Original (central | Normalized to | Original (central | Normalized to |\n|  |  | price scenario) | Brattle's gross | pnce scenario) | Brattle's gross |\n|  |  |  | revenue and |  | revenue and |\n|  |  |  | including |  | including |\n|  |  |  | government take |  | government take |\n|  |  |  | and risk adjustment |  | and risk adjustment |\n| Gross Revenue | 64,953 | 68,791 | 64,953 | -3,839 | 0 |\n| Copper | 38,134 | 55,200 | 52,120 | -17,066 | -13,985 |\n| Gold | 26,818 | 13,591 | 12,833 | 13,227 | 13,985 |\n| Transport costs | 7,917 | 7,413 | 7,413 | 504 | 504 |\n| Expenditures | 35,040 | 34,133 | 34,184 | 907 | 856 |\n| Opex | 23,661 | 26,045 | 26,045 | -2,385 | -2,385 |\n| Capex | 10,845 | 7,948 | 7,948 | 2,896 | 2,896 |\n| Other | 534 | 139 | 190 | 395 | 344 |\n| Risk adjustments for early termination | 1,439 | 0 | 1,639 | 1,439 | -200 |\n| Net cash flow before government take | 20,557 | 27,245 | 21,717 | -6,688 | -1,160 |\n| Royalties and taxes | 6,984 | 7,262 | 6,200 | -277 | 785 |\n| Equity government take | 4,246 | 0 | 5,363 | 4,246 | -1,117 |\n| Net cash flow after government take | 9,326 | 19,984 | 10,154 | -10,657 | -827 |\n| *Memorandum:* |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *Payable volumes* |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *Copper (million kg)* | *11,128* | 11,381 | 11,381 | -253 | -253 |\n| *Gold (million ounces)* | *14,390* | 14,693 | 14,693 | -303 | -303 |\n| *Implicit prices* |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *Copper (US$/kg)* | *3,427* | 4,850 | 4,579 | -1,423 | -1,153 |\n| *Gold(US$/oz)* | *1,864* | 0,925 | 0,873 | 0,939 | 0,990 |\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2621 line 3 to p. 2622 line 8; Brailovsky/Wells II,Table 3.\n\n1585.\n\nMr. Brailovsky further explained their approach to \"*normalizing*\" the central price scenario in column 3 of the same table:\n\n\"*Now, obviously you can obtain very different results if your costs are, more or less, the same. And you can see here the expenditures in the Brattle. And the expenditures in the SNC-Lavalin are different but not that much; whereas, the Capex is higher. The Opex is lower.*\n\n*So, what happens if you have the same costs but different prices? Obviously, you get very different results. So, really, what is important is to normalize the SNC-Lavalin to the prices in the Brattle Report.*\n\n*And this is exactly what we did. You can see that the gross revenue is 64,953, in the first column, and 64,953 in the second column--in the third column.*\n\n*So, they are exactly the same. Now, I don't--I didn't move the costs. The costs are the same. I included an estimate of the 25 equity government take, and the result is NPV undiscounted of 10.2, a little bit higher than the Brattle Report.*\n\n*So, actually, when you really do a strict comparison--and this is a strict comparison, and Professor Davis didn't contest this calculation--you will see that, on similar terms, actually, the SNC-Lavalin is a little bit higher than the Brattle Report.*\n\n*And the curves in the Second Report, which are on Page 43, Graph 5, are obtained from Column 3, which is a normalized SNC, normalized to two things: The same income and introducing the Government equity*.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Summarizing, costs are basically the same when expressing the same terms. So, whatever Professor Davis did with the costs only increased them by about 900 million undiscounted. Whatever his corrections, it's just a little bit higher than the original SNC calculation.*\n\n*Now, the prices have to be the same, so you can calculate one thing or the other; otherwise, you can do whatever with the prices. But at the same prices, the two are very similar, and discounted at 3 percent one will give you about USD 9 billion. Discounted at 13 percent, both of will give you zero*.\"1992\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2622 line 9 to p. 2624 line 14.\n\n1586.\n\nMr. Braillovsky confirmed that the revenues in the original central price scenario of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were \"*about 3.5 billion higher*\" than in Prof. Davis' model and that the normalization they had carried out \"*set the revenues equal to each other.*\" When asked whether he had thereby assumed away any systematic risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis in his prices, Mr. Brailovsky testified:\n\n\"*That was not really--what you're interested in is the final output of the--final result of your analysis.*\n\n*Q. So, you think you can just assume away one significant difference and then say the models come to the same thing, so they have to be the same?*\n\n*A. (Mr. Brailovsky) As I said, it is very easy to play around with prices because nobody knows them; right?*\n\n*Q. That's exactly what you did.*\n\n*A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Nobody knows them. So, it's very easy to play around with those, especially when you're in the context of modeling real terms for 50 years. So, even though the Brattle Report seems to have prices much higher than the SNC, they don't because of the--once you put them in real terms, it just goes down. And that I show in the graphs in this section.*\n\n*You have to normalize. You have to compare one thing with the other. Revenues are revenues, and you have to put them on the same basis*.\"1993\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2630 line 7 to p. 2631 line 5.\n\n1587.\n\nMr. Brailovsky reiterated that when setting the prices equal to each other, it became clear that the costs were very similar in both models and \"*the difference in valuation is basically the Discount Rate, however you want to characterize the modern or nonmodern*.\" He emphasized that, contrary to Prof. Davis statement that he had included considerably higher costs, the comparison at equal prices show that the costs \"*are almost the same*.\"1994 Mr. Brailovsky explicitly confirmed that his calculation had assumed away the difference of USD 3.8 billion in revenues between the original central price scenario and Prof. Davis' model and that he \"*wasn't trying to test for* [the] *proposition*\" made by Prof. Davis that his prices were adjusted for systematic risk.1995\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2631 line 15 to p. 2633 line18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2636 line 8 to p. 2637 line 21.\n\n1588.\n\nWith regard to the costs that he had described as \"*almost the same*\" in both models, Mr. Brailovsky clarified that this applied \"[i]*n aggregate*\" given that, while Prof. Davis' capital costs were indeed higher by 36% in real terms, his operating costs were in fact lower than the corresponding cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. As already addressed above, he accepted that oil prices accounted for about 40% of the operating expenses but questioned Claimant's proposition that \"*simulating and using risk-adjusted prices in the forecast for oil*\" could lead to a lower cost estimate, as he \"*would expect the price of oil in the risk-adjusted to be higher than the other one, no? Because if you include risk there, you should be above the other one.*\"1996\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2639 line 3 to p. 2642 line 16.\n\n1589.\n\nMr. Brailovsky further confirmed that when also taking into account additional \"[o]*ther*\" expenses included by Prof. Davis as well as his adjustment for early termination, the difference between the two models before his normalization, including the government take, amounted to USD 6.7 billion. He did not agree with Claimant that the difference after adjustment for the government take still amounted to about USD 5.6 billion, arguing that the government take would in fact be higher and lead to a difference of only USD 4.6 billion between the two models. He agreed that \"[n]*ondiscounted, yes*,\" this still amounted to a material difference but maintained that \"*any reasonable Discount Rate will make this difference almost disappear*.\"1997\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2642 line 21 to p. 2645 line 19.\n\n1590.\n\nBased on Mr. Brailovsky's testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, it is clear to the Tribunal that the comparison drawn to the \"*normalized*\" calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study cannot provide any verification as to whether or not Prof. Davis made adequate adjustments to account for systematic risk. Mr. Brailovsky readily stated that he had assumed away any difference in prices by setting the revenues equal to each other in both calculations. As pointed out by Claimant, however, the fact that there was a considerable difference in revenues between the original central price scenario and Prof. Davis' model indicates that Prof. Davis' prices indeed reflect a systematic risk adjustment. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes into account that the price assumptions in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study dated from 2010 and it is undisputed that price expectations rose during the time period until the valuation date in November 2011. Consequently, it is plausible to assume that if Mr. Brailovsky had updated the non-risk-adjusted price assumptions in the Expansion Pre-Feasibiluty Study, as Prof. Davis has done in his second report which will be addressed in more detail below, the difference in revenues would have been even larger than reflected in Mr. Brailovsky's Table 3. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the comparison to the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study cannot provide any justification for deviating from the Tribunal's conclusion above that Prof. Davis' approach to systematic risk was generally appropriate and that the result only has to be adjusted to account for the additional uncertainty associated with the 56-year life of the mine.\n\n1591.\n\nMr. Brailovsky's testimony clarified that what he had attempted to show with this comparison was that the aggregate costs estimated by Prof. Davis did not significantly differ from the cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. This concerns the asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis. As the comparison makes clear, however, the capital costs estimated by Prof. Davis are in fact considerably higher (USD 10,845 billion as opposed to USD 7,948 billion in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study) and correspond to the 36% risk adjustment in real terms that he presented in his reports. As pointed out by Mr. Brailovsky, this cost increase was offset to a large extent by the lower operating cost estimate (USD 23,661 billion as opposed to USD 26,045 billion in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study). The Tribunal has already addressed this particular aspect of the comparison between the two calculations, which apparently resulted from the fact that Prof. Davis assumed a lower oil price than the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, and it concluded for the reasons set out in detail above that this did not warrant any further adjustment beyond the deduction it considers appropriate in the context of Prof. Davis' reliance on forward market data. The Tribunal again notes, however, that neither the price assumptions, including for oil, nor the other operating expenes estimated in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were updated by Mr. Brailovsky to the valuation date. This serves as another reason why the Tribunal does not consider it justified to draw any deviating conclusion from the comparison of operating expenses in the two calculations.\n\n1592.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that, as Mr. Brailovsky confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum, the comparison he had made showed that the cash flows modeled by Prof. Davis before accounting for the 25% stake of the GOB were almost USD 6.7 billion lower than those estimated in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study (even without updating the latter to the valuation date). While there was slight disagreement as to amount to be deducted for the 25% stake of the GOB in the case of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Mr. Brailovsky confirmed that the difference still amounted to at least USD 4.6 billion between the two calculations.\n\n1593.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Brailovsky continued to argue that this difference would \"*almost disappear*\" when applying \"*any reasonable Discount Rate*\" to the cash flows accruing 20 years into the future. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument, however. As has been addressed in detail above, the concept of the modern DCF model applied by Prof. Davis is based on making adjustments for risk affecting the individual cash flows at source rather than the application of a discount rate reflecting those risks. The Tribunal further recalls that the comparison was made by Mr. Brailovsky in order to show that the risk adjustments that Prof. Davis had made to the cash flows were not significant, thus did not fully capture the risks associated with the project and therefore did not justify discounting these cash flows at the risk-free rate. However, it would be circular to establish the absence of significant risk adjustments by arguing that any differences in value that might reflect such risk adjustments would disappear when applying a risk-adjusted discount rate. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant and Prof. Davis that this would amount to double-counting the same risks and be contrary to the modern DCF valuation approach as described by Prof. Davis and the 2012 CIMVal report.\n\n1594.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that the comparison to the traditional DCF calculation made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study does not warrant the conclusion that Prof. Davis did not make significant risk adjustments to the cash flows in his model. To the contrary, the significant difference between the net cash flow resulting from the respective calculation convinces the Tribunal that Prof. Davis in fact did make significant risk adjustments and that it would therefore not be appropriate to apply a discount rate to these cash flows that would also reflect and thereby double-count the systematic and asymmetric risks already reflected in Prof. Davis' cash flows.\n\n**f. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Discounted the Cash Flows at the Risk-Free Rate**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1595.\n\nAs a final point in determining whether Prof. Davis has appropriately discounted the cash flows in his model, the Tribunal recalls that the 2012 CIMVal indicates that a \"*residual risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk\u2014adjusted cash flows for risk not explicitly recognized in the model before a final adjustment for the time value of money*.\"1998 The Tribunal further noted that this would also apply to risks that were recognized as such but for which the risk adjustments made are, in the Tribunal's opinion, insufficient to fully capture the relevant risk.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, p. 11.\n\n1596.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis for the systematic risk of how the prices for copper, gold and oil would have developed over the 56-year life of the mine were not sufficient and therefore warrant a further deduction of USD 2,430 million from the value of Claimant's investment. The Tribunal further found that based on Prof. Davis' analysis, an amount of USD 130 million has to be deducted to account for capital cost variability.\n\n1597.\n\nApart from these adjustments, the Tribunal does not see any basis for applying a further residual risk adjustment for any risks not explicitly or not sufficiently recognized in Prof. Davis' model. Having reviewed all of the Parties' expert reports and taking into account the various adjustments to the value of Claimant's investment at which the Tribunal has already arrived, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent and its experts have not identified and substantiated any additional risks that Prof. Davis should have, but failed to, account for in his valuation model.\n\n1598.\n\nFinally, as to the risk-free rate applied to account for the time value of money, Prof. Davis explained that he used \"*the U.S. Treasury yield curve built from constant maturity rates published by the Federal Reserve, interpolating linearly for maturities for which a rate was unavailable*.\"1999 Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted in their first report that the discount rate assumed by Prof. Davis amounted to approximately 3% and added that \"[t]*he Brattle Report uses nominal discount rates starting at almost zero at the beginning of the project and then rising to 3% in year 28, remaining fixed at that level thereafter. The simple average is 2.7%.*\"2000 Prof. Davis did not specifically confirm this calculation but also referred to a nominal discount rate of 2.7% in the context of Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' comparison of his model with the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.2001 In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells again referred to a risk-free rate of 3% to which they also compared their calculation of an implied discount rate of 4.2%.2002\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 219.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 15 and note 19.\n\n*Cf*. Davis II, \u00b6 103.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 20.\n\n1599.\n\nIn the absence of any challenge regarding the risk-free rate applied by Prof. Davis and also taking into account the statement made by Respondent's experts in the context of an example that assumed a risk-free rate of 5%, *i.e*., that they considered \"*3% is closer to the risk-free rate today*,\"2003 the Tribunal considers it undisputed that the risk-free rate selected by Prof. Davis was appropriate to make the necessary adjustment for the time value of money.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 111 and note 149.\n\n**E. Conclusion of the Value of Claimant's Investment Based on the Modern DCF Valuation Approach Applied by Prof. Davis**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1600.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that based on its review of the Parties' submissions and the evidence they submitted in support of their arguments, Claimant's damages, which Prof. Davis calculated at the amount of USD 8,490 million, must be reduced by an amount of USD1,843 million to account for the impact of the risks and issues raised by Respondent regarding the feasibility of the project and/or the value of Claimant's investment. In addition, the Tribunal finds that further deductions in the amount of by USD 2,560 million must be made to fully account for the systematic and asymmetric risks affecting the project.\n\n1601.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that, based on the modern DCF valuation model of Prof. Davis, the value of Claimant's investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.\n\n**F. Verification of the Tribunal's Conclusion on the Value of Claimant's Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1602.\n\nHaving reached its conclusion on the value of Claimant's investment based on the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal will now verify whether this conclusion is reconcilable with the results yielded by other valuation or evaluation methods relied on by Respondent's experts in this arbitration or contemporaneously applied by TCCA.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1603.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent has failed to present any credible valuation which could have been compared with Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation but only submitted \"*Dr. Burrows's odd and unconvincing* 'prior transaction' *approach*\" which concluded that the project was worth even less than in 2006 because Pakistan allegedly became nearly five times riskier until 2011.2004\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 468; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 273.\n\n1604.\n\nClaimant argues that the Hearing on Quantum revealed that, contrary to what Dr. Burrows stated in his first report, he acted based on an undisclosed restrictive instruction which contradicted his own views on mining valuation. Specifically, he testified that he was instructed \"*to determine the value based on the 2006 transaction*\" and was \"*not instructed to look at other potential avenues for valuing*.\" Respondent also confirmed that Dr. Burrows was instructed \"*to please pursue that and not other things*.\"2005\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 469-471, *quoting from* Burrows I, \u00b6 3 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), pp. 2772-2773 and 2793-2794.\n\n1605.\n\nIn Claimant's view, it is \"*fundamentally unacceptable*\" that Dr. Burrows did not exercise his own independent and professional judgment as to the correct valuation method and, moreover, that he did not even disclose this instruction in his reports. Claimant adds that given Dr. Burrows' further testimony that in his experience, every transaction in the mining industry he had seen had been based on a DCF valuation, his own \"*independent judgment*\" could only have led to the use of a DCF analysis rather than \"*this single, outdated, incomparable transaction as the sole basis for valuation.*\"2006\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 472.\n\n1606.\n\nClaimant contends that Dr. Burrows' prior transaction analysis is \"*irredeemably flawed*\" because the 2006 transaction is \"*simply not* 'comparable'\" to the 2011 project, as confirmed by the \"*massive adjustments*\" made by Dr. Burrows in his analysis. More importantly, Claimant argues that Dr. Burrows' analysis contradicts the \"*foundational principle*\" of the value curve according to which \"*project value increases exponentially as sponsors' certainty about the underlying mineral resources and about the feasibility of the mine plan increases*.\"2007\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 477-478, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 244-245 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), pp. 2783-2784.\n\n1607.\n\nClaimant refers to Mr. Luksic's testimony that Antofagasta bought \"*a promising exploration project*\" in 2006 but \"*much remained to be done to prove that the area's resources could be profitably mined*\" and that \"*with a lot of hard work\u2014and some good luck\u2014this could be an outstanding project.*\" Claimant submits that over the following years \"*TCC and its Owners did what was needed to prove the resource and to develop a plan to mine it economically, transforming it form a mineral-resource-stage project to a development-stage project*.\"2008\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 479, *quoting from* Luksic II, \u00b6 2.\n\n1608.\n\nBy contrast, Claimant emphasizes that Dr. Burrows's analysis assumes that the work carried out by Claimant and \"*all the capital and skill TCC poured into the project*\" added no value beyond the amounts invested. It quotes from Dr. Burrows' testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that even when investing in real estate, \"*you would get back pretty much what you spent*.\"2009 In Claimant's view, this testimony is contradicted by \"*millions*\" or real estate investors who expect to receive \"*a healthy return*\" on their investment and \"*even less credible in the mining context where the business model itself\u2014 as Pakistan's own experts have acknowledged\u2014is based on a risk-reward principle whereby value increases exponentially as risk diminishes*.\"2010\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 480, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2775, Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 276.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 481, *referring to* Dagdelen-Owen I, \u00b6 64.\n\n1609.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that in any event the comparison of the project in 2006 with the project in 2011 shows that it had \"*doubled the size of the deposit and transformed all of the resource that had been determined in 2006 into reserves (but for the issurance of the mining lease) through extensive additional drilling, testing, planning, and verification work.*\" In Claimant's view, this renders the assets \"*vastly different*\" and thus not eligible for a \"*comparables*\" approach.2011\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 277-281.\n\n1610.\n\nClaimant argues that the difference between resources and reserves is substantial and refers to Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' assertion that reserves are worth five times as much as measured and indicated resources and nearly eight times as much as inferred resources. Emphasizing that it does not endorse these specific figures, Claimant agrees with Respondent's experts that \"*the technical and economic demonstration of a reserve adds great value compared to unproven resources*.\"2012 It claims that while Antofagasta and Barrick acquired a \"*risky and unproven exploration project*\" in 2006, the capital-intensive exploration program transformed the project from an \"*exploration gamble into an actual mine*,\" allowing the team to \"*vastly improve the accuracy of the resource estimate and to develop detailed plans to locate, extract, process, and finally transport the copper and gold*.\"2013\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 282, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 110.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 284-285, 299.\n\n1611.\n\nSpecifically, Claimant argues that it: (i) increased the quantity of the drilling and the quality of the information gained from the drilling by using more sophisticated equipment; (ii) expanded the types of drilling to metallurgical drilling, condemnation drilling, environmental drilling, hydrological drilling, engineering drilling, and geotechnical drilling; (iii) used the so acquired information to create \"*a detailed blueprint for the mine using known technologies and the largest readily available machinery in the world*\" and to prepare detailed analyses of the required equipment as well as the feasibility study for the slurry pipeline conducted by 2009; and (iv) engaged high-quality third-party consultants and peer reviewers to \"*demonstrate the technical and economic viability of the business opportunity*\" presented in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.2014\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 286-298, *quoting from* Cusworth, \u00b6 38.\n\n1612.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that Dr. Burrows failed to make any adjustments for the value created by Claimant after 2006. In addition, with regard to the expenditures made by Claimant on the project during that time, Claimant rejects the argument that many of these were not productive or inefficient or unrelated to the development of the project. It further argues that in any event, even if certain expenditures were not efficient, this would not justify ignoring their result of doubling the size of the resource and proving the feasibility of mining 2.52 billion tonnes of ore. According to Claimant, a buyer would not care about how much it spent but about the potential for future revenues that Claimant had demonstrated at Reko Diq.2015\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 301-305, 310-311.\n\n1613.\n\nClaimant further rejects Dr. Burrows' argument that the expected metals production did not increase between 2006 and 2011. Claimant submits that the 2006 spreadsheet on which Dr. Burrows relied in support of the alleged comparability of the two assets was not created by Antofagasta or its advisors but rather by an equity analyst at UBS who had no involvement with or first-hand knowledge of the transaction. According to Claimant, the spreadsheet therefore reflects no more than \"*that analyst's own blue-sky projects based on resource data disclosure by TCCA's previous owner, Mincor*.\" Claimant also rejects Dr. Burrows' description of the spreadsheet as \"*detailed*\" projections and claims that it is rather \"*crude back-of-the-envelope guesses about metallurgical recovery rates, throughput, and production costs, information that no one\u2014not Mincor, not Antofagasta, not Barrick, and certaintly not UBS\u2014knew in 2006.*\"2016 In addition, Claimant emphasizes that neither the 2006 press release nor the 2006 spreadsheet support Dr. Burrows' suggestion that Antofagasta in 2006 treated the deposit as though it were a proven reserve ready to be mined or that Antofagasta \"*expected*\" with the degree of certainty attached to a proven reserve that the metals production would be equal to the resource estimate.2017\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 482, *comparing* **Exhibit CRA-11** *with* **Exhibit CRA-1273** and *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2806.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 306-307, *referring to* **Exhibits CRA-10** and **CRA-11**.\n\n1614.\n\nAs for the adjustments that Dr. Burrows has made, Claimant claims that these are \"*meaningless, subjective, and erroneous*.\" Claimant submits that the mining indices on which he relied to account for the change of prices and costs contains companies which \"*vary widely in size, composition, and focus on exploration versus operating projects, and even metals mined*.\" Claimant further considers that Dr. Burrows used a \"*fundamentally incorrect*\" approach to account for the alleged change in country risk because the sovereign yield spread includes a number of risks which do not impact the value of a mine at Reko Diq. More generally, Claimant argues that the \"*massive size*\" of the adjustments made confirms the incomparability of the project in 2006 to the project in 2011.2018\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 316-321.\n\n1615.\n\nFinally, Claimant contends that Dr. Burrows should have done a reasonableness check of his valuation taking into account the broader market context, which would have demonstrated that copper-gold deposits smaller than Reko Diq were valued at \"*tens of billions of dollars*\" in 2011 by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Barrick. In Claimant's view, Dr. Burrows' valuation therefore \"*cannot be squared with the actual market realities on the Valuation Date*.\"2019\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 323-330.\n\n1616.\n\nClaimant further emphasizes that contrary to what Dr. Burrows was led to believe, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not make any attempt to perform a DCF valuation of the project but only stated that the project either had no value, a negative value or the value estimated by Dr. Burrows, without proving actual calculations or supporting evidence for their assertions.2020 As an example, Claimant refers to their opinion that the IRR is \"*far below any reasonable hurdle rate for a mining firm investing in a mining project in Balochistan*\" and notes that Respondent's experts did not specify what they considered to be a \"*reasonable hurdle rate*\" but only suggest that such a rate would be above 30%, without offering any evidentiary support and only based on \"*hearsay statements purportedly made\u2014during negotiations---by a gold developer in a project Prof. Wells is advising on in an undisclosed country*\" which may well have related to the cost of equity and not the cost of capital.2021 Claimant relies on Prof. Davis' explanation that \"[n]*o large project anywhere in the world would survive a discount rate of 30% given that it can take almost a decade from first cash spent to first revenue spent*.\" Claimant also notes that its owners continued to invest millions of dollars in the Reko Diq project despite its projected IRR below 30% in the Scoping Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.2022\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 485, *referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 9(ii) and (iv), 10 *and* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b64(iii), (iv) and (x).\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 486, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 103 *and referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 73;

Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 334.\n\n1619.\n\nClaimant refers to Mr. Sep\u00falveda who explained that the purpose of creating the financial model \"*was not to determine a sales price for the project*\" but rather \"*to create a tool that would give TCCA and its owners a sense of the elements that drove project value, and how key assumptions affected that value, to help them evaluate and make decisions about the project*.\" He also testified that \"*no one involved in the project believed that this reflected the project's fair market value*\" and that he \"*would have been astonished if Antofagasta and Barrick had agreed to sell their interest in the project at any valuation even close to that low, especially not in November 2011 when metals prices were even higher*.\"2027\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 357-358, *quoting from* Sep\u00falveda, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 21-22\n\n1620.\n\nClaimant also refers to Prof. Davis' explanation that \"[i]*t is well-accepted in mine valuation that technical studies like feasibility and pre-feasibility studies do not attempt a project valuation. They attempt an economic analysis of the technical and financial merits of a project*.\" Quoting from the International Mineral Valuation Committee IMVal, Prof. Davis explained that standards organizations distinguish between valuation, which \"*addresses the estimation of a value of a Mineral Property*,\" and evaluation, which \"*addresses the broader assessment of a Mineral Property for an investment decision*.\"2028\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 359-360, *quoting from* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 92, 96 *and* **Exhibit CE-1526**.\n\n1621.\n\nIn addition, Claimant refers to Mr. Luksic who explained that \"[t]*he primary reason why the NPV of our Feasibility Study does not properly reflect the project's value is that it is calculated using very conservative assumptions that are kept static for the entire life of the mine*.\"2029 According to Claimant, these conservative assumptions are reflected in: (i) the price assumptions of the model, which were considerably lower than spot prices as of June 2010 as well as in the fact that model valued only reserves; (ii) did not include any value for 2.7 billion ore tonnes of inferred resources and mineral inventories at Reko Diq, which \"[i]*n actual sale, \u2026 would have added considerable value*\"; (iii) gave no value to substantial potential cost savings that Claimant had identified as \"*CAPEX reduction opportunities*\" and \"*value engineering*\" opportunities; and (iv) did not take into account the value associated with flexible management that could respond to changing market conditions, which Mr. Luksic described as an \"*immensely valuable*\" feature that \"*would have been front and center in any negotiation for a price for the project in the event of a sale*.\"2030\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 362, *quoting from* Luksic II, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 363-368, *quoting from* **Exhibit CE-964**, pp. 28-38 to 28-39 *and* Luksic II, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\n1622.\n\nClaimant notes that \"[d]*espite all of this deliberate conservatism*,\" the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study confirmed the robustness of the project, yielding a net present value of USD 1,206 billion at a 10% discount rate. It adds that Prof. Davis' update of the calculation to the valuation date, using average price projections made by other mining companies that were significantly below the spot prices and Barrick's updated capital and operating cost estimates, yielded a net present value of USD 4.0 billion with a \"*highly attractive 18.5% return on investment, even under the extremely conservative price projections in that updated model*\"; Claimant's 75% share of that NPV would have been USD 3.0 billion.2031 Claimant emphasizes that Respondent's experts fail to account for the fact that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was finalized more than 16 months before the valuation date, *i.e*., in June 2010, even though gold prices rose considerably during that time, rendering the price projects in the model much lower than the future price projections as of the valuation date. In Claimant's view, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also incorrectly rely on the NPV calculated at using a 12% discount rate even though it is clearly stated in the Study that \"*a 10% discount rate has been selected as the* 'base case' *discount rate for the EXP study*.\"2032\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 490, *referring to* Davis II, \u00b6 302; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 369-370, 374-375, 377, *referring to* **Exhibit CE-964**, p. 28-2.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 335-337, 373-374, *referring to* Sep\u00falveda, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, **Exhibit RE-577-1**, p. 1-1, Davis II, \u00b6 301, *and quoting from* **Exhibit CE-964**, p. 28-18.\n\n1623.\n\nClaimant maintains that the updated calculation of Prof. Davis does not provide an accurate value estimate because it does not attribute any value to management flexibility or inferred resources and is \"*conservative in other ways,*\" particularly in its price assumptions, but argues that the calculation serves to contradict Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' claim that the project had no value.2033\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 376-378.\n\n1624.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that while Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis for applying a \"*very low Discount Rate*,\" they did not provide any meaningful guidance to the Tribunal as to the appropriate treatment of risk given that they did not actually calculate a discount rate that they would consider appropriate for the project as of the valuation date.2034 Claimant also emphasizes that contrary to Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Well's suggestion, Dr. Burrows also did not calculate a 23% discount rate but explicitly stated that his computation \"*is not an estimate of the cost of capital as of November 2011*.\" In Claimant's view, he mashed together a purported \"*2006 cost of capital excl. country risk*\" with the sovereign yield spread in 2011 which double-counted risks and further included several risks that the Reko Diq project would not have faced.2035\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 491, *quoting from* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2531.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 348-355, *quoting from* Burrows, Appendix 5, note to line [6] and lines [4][5].\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1625.\n\nRespondent submits that the only proper determination of the fair market value of Claimant's interest in Reko Diq has been provided by Dr. Burrows who, \"*following best practices and his long forensic experience, \u2026 identified the existence of a prior transaction that, with some adjustments, would be the best approximation to that fair market value*.\"2036\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 352, *referring to* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2780 lines 8-17; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 404, *referring to* Burrows I, \u00b6 3.\n\n1626.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that while Prof. Davis examined eight properties in his report and concluded that they were not comparable to Reko Diq, he neglected to consider an \"*undoubtedly comparable*\" arm's length transaction, *i.e*., the acquisition by Barrick of 50% in Claimant in September 2006 for a value of USD 246 million. Respondent submits that it agrees with the requirements listed by Prof. Davis to establish comparability, \"[e]*xcept for some details*,\" but maintains that the past transaction involving Reko Diq meets those requirements and is thus \"*extremely useful for the establishment of this valuation.*\"2037\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 405-407, *referring to* Burrows I, notes 7 and 8, *and* Davis I, \u00b6\u00b6 260-270 and note 240.\n\n1627.\n\nRespondent rejects the argument that the project in 2006 was not comparable to the project in 2011 or that Dr. Burrows should have looked for other comparable transactions and refers to Dr. Burrows' explanation that \"[i]*f there is a prior transaction in the property that is usable as a reference point, there is no need to search for comparable transactions. No transaction in any other property can be more representative of value than a transaction in the property itself*.\" As Dr. Burrows explained, \"[m]*ost of the factors that vary across mineral properties do not vary significantly for Reko Diq itself between the two dates*.\"2038\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 440-442, *quoting from* Burrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\n1628.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that this valuation exercise was performed \"*for ease of reference and to provide a valid answer in case the Tribunal was in fact\u2014quod non\u2014in the position to identify the fair market value of TCC's interest in Reko Diq even when TCC failed to satisfy the burden of proof regarding the damages it seeks*.\" It clarifies that \"*the valuation submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows intends to challenge, and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC's case on quantum, which under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal*.\"2039\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 353.\n\n1629.\n\nRespondent refers to Dr. Burrows' explanation that the fair market value would be determined in the most accurate manner by referring to the set of transactions by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006, subject to a number of adjustments described by Dr. Burrows in his first report. Respondent claims that, by contrast, \"[n]*one of the remaining approaches or remedies proposed by TCC would have been taken into account by the hyptohetical seller and buyer in finding a fair market value at which to transact over the asset*,\" including Claimant's \"*abandoned attempt at obtaining restitution or sunk costs*\" or an \"*uninformed, exaggerated guess on the size of the mineral deposits actually available for mining*.\"2040\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 354-355, *quoting from* Burrows I, \u00b6 3.\n\n1630.\n\nRespondent contends that the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows to the 2006 transactions to account for changes that occurred in the intervening period were \"*conservative and adequate*.\"2041 It rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows failed to account for changes in the reported resources of the property, operating costs and mining technology between 2006 and 2011. In Respondent's view, \"[n]*one of the criticisms attempted are technically viable or procedurally relevant*.\" It argues that Antofagasta and Barrick claim to be among the top mining companies in the world who would have performed due diligence on the property. According to Respondent, \"[i]*t is therefore almost certainly the case that when the parties entered into the acquisition in 2006 they all had a good understanding of the total resource base of TCC*.\"2042\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 356.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 443-444.\n\n1631.\n\nRespondent refers to Dr. Burrows' explanation that additional development work carried out between 2006 and 2011 resulted in negative surprises as the projections made in 2006 of the total copper and gold recovery over the life of the mine \"*were very close, but higher, than the projections in the 2011 feasibility study*\" whereas the projections of costs \"*all increased significantly.*\" Respondent also submits that \"[t]*he 2006 mine plan projected production of 52,000 million metric tons per year over 45 years, in comparison to 40,000 million metric tons per year in the base case and 40 million metric tons per year rising to 80,000 tons per year over 35 years in the expansion case*.\"2043\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 356, *quoting from* Burrows II, \u00b6 73; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 445-446, *referring to* Burrows II, \u00b6 11 *and* Appendix 8.\n\n1632.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the comparison demonstrates that \"*the parties had an accurate understanding of the total mineralization of the Reko Diq project*\" but that \"*additional development after 2006 needed to design the mine led to negative surprises about recovery costs*.\" Respondent argues that there was therefore no need for an adjustment in Dr. Burrows' calculation to account for an increased size of the deposit or economies of scale.2044\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 446-448.\n\n1633.\n\nRespondent further rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows should have made an adjustment to account for increased geologic certainty or a more advanced stage of the project. According to Respondent, Dr. Burrows demonstrated that \"*a mine increases in value over time as expenditures are made on exploration, drilling, feasibility studies and mine plans (i.e., as sunk costs at the time of valuation increase and remaining development costs decline) and as expected production increase or costs decline as a result of additional discoveries over time*.\" Respondent considers that Dr. Burrows was conservative in not making downward adjustments to account for these changes.2045\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 449-450\n\n1634.\n\nIn addition, Respondent notes that Dr. Burrows did make an upward adjustment in value accounting for the reduction in time to construction between 2006 and 2011 which even overstates the value of Reko Diq. As for Claimant's exploration expenditures, Respondent refers to Dr. Burrows' explanation that Antofagasta had made a projection of efficient expenditures in the amount of USD 75 million in 2006 and that of the USD 219 million that Claimant claims to have spent, \"*an unknown amount was spent on Reko Diq*\" and \"[m]*uch of this expenditure was wasted or redundant*\" so that Dr. Burrows could not attribute any further value to these expenditures.2046 Respondent further quotes:\n\n\"*Efficient and appropriate expenditure on Reko Diq, higher metals prices, and time advancement of the project would have increased its value. The increase in capital and operating costs and in country risk would have decreased its value. I adjust for the factors which increase the value but not for the changes which would have decreased the value. I conclude that the maximum value of Reko Diq on the Valuation Date was about $149.2 million (assuming that all of the projected $75 million in Exploration and Development expenditures projected in 2006 were efficiently and non-redundantly made and that a hypothetical buyer would not expect to have to re-do any of these expenditures)*.\"2047\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 356, *quoting from* Burrows II, \u00b6 74; Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 451, *referring to* Burrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 356, *quoting from* Burrows II, \u00b6 75.\n\n1635.\n\nRespondent considers that the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows are based on \"*solid, non-speculative and a conservative evaluation of the available evidence*\" and notes that Dr. Burrows did not implement reductions to account for the fact that the 2006 transactions involved more assets than Claimant's interest in Reko Diq or for litigation risks and tax increases or any of the technical shortcomings that Respondent claims to have identified, which would have decreased the value below the amount calculated by Dr. Burrows. Respondent emphasizes that the 2006 purchase price was primarily: (i) increased to reflect the rise in mineral prices between 2006 and 2011 and efficient expenditures; and (ii) decreased to account for \"*the very significant increase in the perception of country risk for Pakistan in general and Balochistan in particular*.\"2048 Respondent rejects the argument that the adjustments are \"*large*\" and \"*subjective*,\" arguing that the characterization as \"*large*\" is in itself a \"*subjective*\" evaluation and that the adjustments were instead based on \"*objective, appropriate, and transparent data*.\"2049\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 357-360; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 414-415.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 452, *quoting from* Burrows II, \u00b6 26.\n\n1636.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent submits that Dr. Burrows adjusted for: (i) changes in expectations about metals prices; (ii) inflation of production costs in the global mining industry; (iii) changes in the general cost of capital for metals mines; and (iv) changes in country risk for Pakistan. Based on the share price indices for copper mines and gold mines, Dr. Burrows first increased the transaction value by the weighted average of 104% to account for changes in prices and costs; based on the increase of the sovereign yield spread in Pakistan, Dr. Burrows then decreased the value to account for the change in country risk.2050\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 409-412, *referring to* Burrows I, \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.\n\n1637.\n\nRespondent submits that the results of these adjustments is a fair market value not exceeding USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date, which results from the \"*simple exercise*\" illustrated by Dr. Burrows at the Hearing on Quantum as follows:2051\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **($ millions)** | **Valuation of acquisition as of Nov-11** |\n| Acquisition in September 2006 | $246 |\n| Weighted average change in share +104% indices |\n| Adjusted for change in share indices | $501 |\n| Adjustment for change in country risk/ timing | -88% |\n| Adjusted for change in share indices and country risk/ timing | $61 |\n| Assumed Exploration and $88 Development expenditures |\n| **2011 value** | **$149** |\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 361; Burrows Presentation, p. 13.\n\n1638.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this valuation shows that Claimant has \"*artificially inflated its claim by billions of dollars, or over 98.2% of the value claimed of USD 8.5 billion*.\"2052\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 362.\n\n1639.\n\nRespondent further argues that the value projected by Prof. Davis at USD 8.5 billion is also contradicted by the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, claiming that \"[b]*oth reports presented very similar analyses of most of the variables, although with totally different results*.\" According to Respondent, the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study \"*assigns no positive value if any realistic discount rate is used*.\"2053\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 435.\n\n1640.\n\nRespondent considers that the statements made by Claimant on the one hand and Prof. Davis on the other hand regarding the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study contradict each other. In Respondent's view, Claimant \"*praised whole-heartedly the work carried out by SNC-Lavalin of the Reko Diq project*\" which would lead one to conclude \"*that the SNC-Lavalin studies provide exactly the basis the Claimant would use to value the project and determine its claim*.\" Respondent emphasizes that each of the components used in Prof. Davis' model, except for the government equity take, is also included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which even contained a \"*risk register*.\" It further notes that of the several price scenarios for copper and gold contained in the Study, the 20% below the central price scenario \"*seems to approximate very closely the NPVs of Brattle, at a range of discount rates going from zero to 30%,*\" *i.e*., the entire range of discount rates. In Respondent's view, this contradicts Prof. Davis' statement that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study is a \"*stale technical study* [the results of which do not allow one] *to infer anything about the economic merits of the project on the Valuation Date*.\"2054\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 436-437, *quoting from* Claimant's Quantum Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 40-46 *and* Davis II, \u00b6 302 *and referring to* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72, 74, 83.\n\n1641.\n\nWith regard to Prof. Davis' update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Respondent contends that the Hearing on Quantum revealed \"*myriad, unresolved and fatal errors in the determination of the project's costs*.\" Respondent points out that the revised calculation introduced by Claimant during the Hearing \"*admitted that their calculations of expenditures had to be increased by approximately a missing USD 1 billion.*\"2055\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 328, *referring to* **Exhibits CE-1556A, CE-1778A** and **CE-1779A**; Respondent's Closing Presentation, p. 81.\n\n1642.\n\nIn Respondent's view, these admitted errors as well as the \"*very significant omissions, as yet unquantified*\" it clams to have identified, \"*make any attempt at actually assessing the net cash flows of the Reko Diq project described in the IMD FS and the EXP PFS an exercise in fantasy.*\" As an example, Respondent refers to Prof. Davis' assumption of all equity financing as opposed to the assumption in the Feasibility Study that 40% of the initial capital costs, *i.e.*, USD 1.5 billion, would be financed, as a result of which \"*net cash flows did not account for the amortization of interest of that financing*.\" Respondent therefore maintains that \"*the valuation put forward by TCC fails to reflect the fair market value of its participation in Reko Diq*.\"2056\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 329-331, *referring to* **Exhibit RE-576-29**, p. 1 *and* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2478 lines 3-9.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1643.\n\nAs noted in the context of the Tribunal's assessment of the appropriate valuation method for Claimant's investment in the present circumstances, neither Party has presented a valuation based on a traditional DCF analysis conducted for the purposes of this arbitration with inputs as of the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells placed much emphasis in their expert reports on the \"*conventional DCF calculations of the SNC-Lavalin analyses*,\"2057*i.e*., the calculations in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which were both completed in 2010. They did not, however, update these analyses to the valuation date. In particular, they did not update the prices for gold and copper, which dated from March 2010 in both Studies, to reflect price developments and contemporaneous expectations as of November 2011. The only reliable indication of the result that a traditional DCF analysis might have produced if it had been performed is Prof. Davis' update of the calculation included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 166.\n\n1644.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has been provided with a valuation performed by Respondent's expert Dr. Burrows, which is based on the past transactions by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006.\n\n1645.\n\nThe Tribunal will address both calculations in turn and assess whether there are reasonable grounds for any remaining deviations between the conclusion reached by the Tribunal above and the results yielded by those calculations.\n\n**a. Verification of the Tribunal's Conclusion Taking Into Account the Updated DCF Calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1646.\n\nAs for the update of the calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, the Tribunal is aware that it was not presented by Prof. Davis as an alternative to his valuation based on the modern DCF method but rather to show why, in his opinion, the comparison drawn by Respondent's experts to his valuation based on the 2010 calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was an \"*apples and oranges*\" comparison.2058 As noted above, a traditional DCF calculation conducted for this arbitration might have produced a result different from the (updated) calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which was performed for a different purpose and did not aim at calculating the fair market value of the project. Mr. Sep\u00falveda, who was involved in assembling the financial model for the Feasibility Study in 2010, explained the purpose of the financial model as follows: \"*The purpose of the model was to create a tool that would give TCC and its owners a sense of the elements that drove project value, and how key assumptions affected that value, to help them evaluate and make decisions about the project. The tool's uses included, among other things, assessing whether the project was economically feasible, the relative importance of various items that TCC was negotiating with the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan, and the value to Balochistan of different ownership structures*.\"2059\n\n*Cf*. Davis II, \u00b6 301.\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6 11.\n\n1647.\n\nMr. Sep\u00falveda added that \"*our purpose in creating the model was not to determine a sale price for the project*\" and testified that \"*no one involved in the project believed that* [the base case NPV of the Reko Diq IMD amounting to USD 656 million] *reflected the project's fair market value*.\"2060 Apart from the fact the at the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study already indicated a base case NPV of USD 1,209 million,2061 Mr. Sep\u00falveda considered that \"[i]*n a sale process neither the seller nor the buyer would just take the Feasibility Study or Pre-feasibility Study evaluation figure as the price. Instead, each of them would consider what they thought it was worth to them. To do so the seller would provide the underlying geological and technical data, and the buyer would make its own determination of value using whatever model, assumptions and approaches it favored*.\"2062 In addition, Mr. Sep\u00falveda considered it likely that a seller would \"*update metals prices, costs and even the pit design and resource estimate (which can change with changing economics)*,\" \"*assess realistic expansions*\" and \"*consider charging for the inferred resource as well as the proven resource because we already have strong indications that there is a lot more metal to be mined than TCC provided in the Feasibility Study*.\" He also referred to the issue of \"*how to put an appropriate value on Reko Diq's enormous, world-class size*,\" noting that \"[a]*t a 10% discount rate a conventional NPV analysis gives almost no value for revenues from 15 years and later*\" and arguing that \"[t]*he true value of Reko Diq lies in the fact that it promised to produce in times of both low and high prices for decades to come*.\"2063\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 22.\n\n**Exhibit CE-243**, Table 1.3.\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6 24.\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\n1648.\n\nMr. Luksic also testified in his second witness statement that \"[t]*he economic model in a feasibility study is merely intended to help the sponsors and potential financiers confirm that the project is economic and that there are sufficient cash flows to pay back the initial capital investment. While the Net Present Value ('NPV') can help guide the sponsor's investment decisions, it is not the only indicator of value*.\" In support of his view that the NPV in the Feasibility Study \"*does not properly reflect the project's value*,\" Mr. Luksic referred to what he considered to be \"*very conservative assumptions that are kept static for the entire life of the mine*.\" He explained that \"[t]*o stress test the project, you plug in conservative prices and a high discount rate into your financial model*.\"2064 Mr. Luksic further referred to the \"*immensely valuable*\" flexibility of a long-life mine that would have helped them to manage the volatility of commodity prices. He testified that \"[t]*he size of the Reko Diq deposit\u2014and the potential for multiple expansions\u2014meant that we would be able to exploit the highs and protect against the lows. This feature of the Reko Diq project is one that would have been front and center in any negotiation for a price for the project in the event of a sale but is completely absent from a model using static prices*.\"2065\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\n1649.\n\nAs addressed in detail above, Respondent's experts relied on a comparison of the cash flows yielded by Prof. Davis' modern DCF model with the (non-updated) calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study in both of their expert reports. However, Mr. Brailovsky also confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that \"*as you say, valuation is different from evaluation,*\" referring specifically to the differences in making price assumptions as \"*a feasibility study won't say which price*\" but will have a \"*menu of prices, just like this one*.\"2066\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2656 line 7.\n\n1650.\n\nAs pointed out by Prof. Davis, the distinction between valuation and evaluation is also confirmed by CIMVal in its Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties, which clarify that \"*Valuation in the CIMVal Standards and Guidelines is concerned with the value or worth of a Mineral Property as opposed to* 'evaluation' *where the key objective is an economic assessment or determination of the economic merit of a property*.\"2067 Similarly, the International Mineral Property Valuation Standards Committee IMVal stated in its Standards Template that \"[t]*he Template deals with Valuation, which is distinct from Evaluation. The distinction inherent in these defined terms is that Valuation addresses the estimation of value of a Mineral Property, whereas Evaluation addresses the broader assessment of a Mineral Property for an investment decision*.\"2068\n\n**Exhibit CE-919**, p. 5.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1526**, p. 6. *See also* Davis II, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n1651.\n\nTaking into account the explanations above, the Tribunal will bear in mind the differences between a calculation aimed at determining the fair market value of the project and the calculations perfomed in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. However, recalling that it has not been provided with a traditional DCF calculation by either Party, or any other income-based calculation for that matter, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to take into account the indication of value reflected in the calculations as updated by Prof. Davis and to verify that it is reconcilable with the Tribunal's conclusion on the value of Claimant's investment.\n\n1652.\n\nProf. Davis explained in his second report that he took the following approach to updating the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study:\n\n\"\u2026 *I updated the EXP PFS NPV calculation using metal prices consistent with technical reports published close to the Valuation Date. The average prices used across these technical reports published on SEDAR, the website of the Canadian Securities Administrators, were $3.12/lb for copper and $1,266/oz for gold, substantially higher than the $2.20/lb and $925/oz respectively assumed by the EXP PFS. I also updated the cost assumptions using the updated costs provided by Barrick and used in my own valuation.*\n\n*Using prices and costs updated to reflect conditions at the Valuation Date, the EXP PFS calculation yields a NPV of $4.03 billion for the Project and $3.02 billion for TCC's 75% share. The implied real IRR of the cash flows projections is 18.5%.*\"2069\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 301-302.\n\n1653.\n\nNoting that these numbers were \"*substantially higher than those calculated in the EXP PFS, and to which Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells refer*,\" Prof. Davis considered that this highlighted \"*the problem with using stale technical study results to infer anything about the economic merits of the project on the Valuation Date*.\" Specifically, he argued that the application of a 15% discount rate to the technical study \"*would produce a positive NPV, not a negative NPV*\" and thus, according to the logic presented by Respondent's experts, confirm that the project had a positive value as of the valuation date.2070\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 302.\n\n1654.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells addressed the updated calculation presented by Prof. Davis only in a footnote of their second report, arguing as follows:\n\n\"*Brattle in its Second Report (\u00b6 302), ran the SNC-Lavalin model with certain prices and other adjustments to show that the IRR of the project at those prices is more than 18% and therefore would have a positive NPV even assuming a discount rate of 15%. (In CE-1556, which contains the spreadsheet of the version used by Brattle of the SNC-Lavalin model, the rate of return after government equity stake is only 17.2%, not 18%. Similarly, Brattle says that the NPV of the project for TCC is US$3.3 billion at 15%. It is not. This is the NPV obtained at a discount rate of 10%. At 15%, the NPV is, instead, US$620 million.) Of course, the higher the prices, the higher the IRR. Thus, for example, for this exercise Brattle used a flat real price for copper of US$3.12/ton, whereas for its own model the average real price was US$1.43/ton\u2014less than half\u2014and US$2.2 in the SNC-Lavalin base scenario. In contrast, the price for gold used by Brattle in this exercise was lower than that contemplated in the Brattle model (US$1,265/ton vs. US$1,829/ton), which is not surprising given the untenable high values used by the Brattle reports, as we have indicated since our First Report. However, introducing both real average prices found in the Brattle Report to the same version of the SNC-Lavalin model presented by Brattle itself in CE-1556, the rate of return falls to 6.6% and the NPV at a 15% discount rate is -US$1,978 billion, a large negative figure*.\"2071\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 91 and note 119.\n\n1655.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to what Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells suggest in their footnote, Prof. Davis did not state that the net present value of Claimant's stake in the project would amount to USD 3.3 billion when using a discount rate of 15%. He rather stated that the application of a 15% discount rate would produce a positive NPV, without identifying this amount or specifying the discount rate by whose application he reached the conclusion that the calculation yielded a net present value of USD 3.02 billion. However, it can be deduced from the excel spreadsheet underlying Prof. Davis' calculation and was also confirmed by Prof. Davis at the Hearing on Quantum that the value of USD 4.03 billion for the project as a whole (*i.e*., including the GOB's 25% stake) was calculated based on a 10% discount rate.2072\n\n**Exhibit CE-1556**.\n\n1656.\n\nMore specifically, Prof. Davis' updated calculation yielded the following after-tax net present values of the project (including the GOB's 25% stake), depending on the discount rate to be applied:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 0% | 5% | 8% | 10% | 12% | 15% |\n| NPV in USD million | 36,516.6 | 11,968.2 | 6,285.7 | 4,031.4 | 2,490.6 | 1,004.7 |\n\n1657.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not explain how they arrived at an amount of USD 620 million when applying a discount rate of 15%. Based on the figures presented above, Claimant's 75% stake in the project would have resulted in the following values:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 0% | 5% | 8% | 10% | 12% | 15% |\n| NPV in USD million | 27,387.5 | 8,976.2 | 4,714.3 | 3,023.6 | 1,868.0 | 753.5 |\n\n1658.\n\nIn addition to their criticism regarding the use of a 10% discount rate, Respondent's experts also criticized the price assumptions made by Prof. Davis in his update and noted that when introducing \"*real average prices found in the Brattle report to the same version of the SNC-Lavalin model presented by Brattle itself,*\" the net present value at a 15% discount rate would be decreased to a negative USD -1,978 billion. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not provide any further explanation or support for this statement in their report; in particular, they did not substantiate their calculation or the prices on the basis of which they reached the aforementioned conclusion.\n\n1659.\n\nProf. Davis, on the other hand, identified in his second expert report a total of 33 technical reports dating from between November 2011 and Jaunary 2012 and the prices for gold and/or copper on which these reports had based their financial calculations. Specifically, Prof. Davis presented 25 gold prices and 11 copper prices as well as, *inter alia*, the average prices resulting from these technical reports, *i.e*., USD 1,266/oz for gold and USD 3.12/lb for copper.2073 All 33 technical reports were submitted into the record.2074 On that basis, he used in his update a constant price of USD 1,260/oz for gold and USD 3,10/lb for copper.2075\n\nDavis II, Workpaper R-31.\n\n**Exhbits CE-1579** through **CE-1614**.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1556**.\n\n1660.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not dispute in their second report that the technical reports on which Prof. Davis relied had used the prices presented in his Workpaper for the purposes of their financial calculations. At the Hearing on Quantum Mr. Brailovsky testified that Prof. Davis' update of the calculation was wrong \"[b]*ecause he took the peak prices prevailing at that time and kept them constant*.\" When asked whether he was aware that Prof. Davis had taken prices from published feasibility studies available around the time of the valuation date which were lower than the spot price as of the valuation date, Mr. Brailovsky stated that \"*I don't have to look into what other feasibility studies were*\" and reiterated his understanding that Prof. Davis \"*was taking the prices prevailing at that point*.\" Mr. Brailovsky added that \"*as you say, valuation is different from evaluation, so a feasibility study won't say which price. It will have a menu of prices, just like this one.*\" He confirmed that he was not aware which of these prices Prof. Davis had taken for his update of the calculation.2076\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2655 line 1 to p. 2656 line 17.\n\n1661.\n\nMr. Brailovsky further testified that Prof. Davis' updated calculation could not be taken seriously when considering that it yielded cash flows that were about 50% higher than the cash flows calculated by Prof. Davis based on his modern DCF model (USD 96,299 billion in gross revenues as opposed to USD 64,953 billion) and when considering that \"*the Consensus Economics, which represents the opinion of all the major financial institutions in the world, will produce something lower than the 64 billion*\" yielded by Prof. Davis' moden DCF model. In his opinion, the updated calculation was \"*completely irrelevant. It's a travesty*.\"2077 Mr. Brailovsky reiterated that he could not accept the updated calculation because the methods on which he had relied to make price projections, *i.e*., the Consensus Economics forecast and the Ornstein-Ohlenbeck process, \"*will produce less than 64.9, less, not more*.\"2078\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2659 line 18 to p. 2560 line 20; **Exhibit CE-1778**.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2661 lines 11-19.\n\n1662.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal cannot agree with Mr. Brailovsky that the fact that the undiscounted gross revenues in the updated calculation were considerably higher than the risk-adjusted cash flows calculated by Prof. Davis would render this update unreliable. In the Tribunal's view, this divergence rather supports Prof. Davis' argument that the cash flows in his modern valuation already included considerable risk adjustments. Mr. Brailovsky's oral testimony also clarified, however, that he considered the prices assumed by Prof. Davis for the purposes of updating the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study inappropriate and, in particular, inconsistent with the price forecasts of Consensus Economics on which Respondent's experts relied in their expert reports. While Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not identify what they described as the \"*real average prices*\" in their second report, Mr. Brailovsky's testimony indicates that they may have been referring to the Consensus Economics forecast and that using these prices in the updated calculation of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, the net present value of the cash flows would have turned negative at a discount rate of 15%.\n\n1663.\n\nHowever, Mr. Brailovsky explicitly agreed that the calculation made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was not made for the purposes of determining the value of the project and therefore did not use a projection of a certain price development in the future but rather a \"*menu of prices,*\" *i.e*., a static price and various sensitivity analyses. In addition and while Mr. Brailovsky considered that he did not have to look into the prices assumed by other feasibilities studies published at the time, he did not dispute that these studies had used the prices recorded in Prof. Davis' Workpaper or that the prices Prof. Davis had used in his update reflected the average of these price assumptions. Given the undisputed different purpose for which calculations in technical feasibility studies are made, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Davis that the best indication of the prices that would have been used in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study if the financial analysis included therein had been prepared as of the valuation date can be found in the prices used in other feasibility studies published around the valuation date. While the Tribunal has found above that a buyer would likely not have ignored the much lower Consensus Economics forecast in the context of a valuation aimed at determining the fair market value of the project, it is not convinced that this forecast would have been a better indicator of the prices that would have been used in the calculation of a technical feasibility study at the time than the prices actually used in other feasibility studies. On balance, the Tribunal therefore cannot accept Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Wells' criticism of the price assumptions used in Prof. Davis' update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\n1664.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the above also shows, however, that the relevance of a calculation in a technical study to the question before this Tribunal, *i.e*., the determination of the fair market value of Claimant's investment in the project, is limited. In particular, given the significant impact that the price assumptions for gold and copper have on the overall result of the calculation, the Tribunal considers that a calculation using a static price over the entire life of the mine cannot be considered a sufficiently reliable indicator of the fair market value to be determined on the basis of the entirety of the cash flows, part of which will be generated only several decades into the future. It rather confirms that the focus of the calculation in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was on confirming the economic feasibility of the project and determining the length of the payback period, *i.e*., the time it would take to recover capital costs, which was determined to be 7.1 years in the initial mine development scenario and 7.9 years in the expansion scenario.2079\n\n*Cf*. Sep\u00falveda, \u00b6 16; **Exhibit CE-243**, Table 1.3.\n\n1665.\n\nHaving said that, it appears to the Tribunal that, in any event, the indication of value reflected in the updated calculation made by Prof. Davis does not contradict the conclusion reached by the Tribunal based on the modern DCF valuation model.\n\n1666.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that an issue arose at the Hearing on Quantum because Prof. Davis corrected the statement he had made in paragraph 302 of his second report with regard to the value yielded by the updated calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Specifically, he stated that he had \"*adjusted upward slightly*\" the value and implied real IRR of the cash flow projections, which were now as follows:\n\n\"*Using prices and costs updated to reflect conditions at the Valuation Date, the EXP PFS calculation yields a NPV of $4.24 billion for the Project and $3.18 billion for TCC's 75% share. The implied real IRR of the cash flow projections is 18.9%.*\"2080\n\nDavis Errata Sheet dated 21 May 2018; Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2322 line 12 to p. 2323 line 1.\n\n1667.\n\nHe further explained the reason for his correction:\n\n\"*So, the exercise here, as you know, the EXP study was completed in 2010 using 2009 costs. And, in my analysis, to build a cash flow model that I needed for my modern approach, I used an update of those costs as measured by Barrick to 2011. So, Barrick provided me with an update of the technical study costs to 2011.*\n\n*In generating this update to respond to the idea that my cash flows are the same as the EXP cash flows, I felt it important to treat them on an apples to apples basis. So, in paragraph 302, I updated the EXP cash flows, whose costs were 2009 to 2011.*\n\n*To be consistent, I should have used the escalations that Barrick did, but I did not. I used escalations from another source called Wood Mackenzie. Now, I do use Wood Mackenzie escalations going forward in my spreadsheet, but I did not use them to bring, in my own analysis, to bring the technical studies' costs up to 2011 costs. So, I had an inconsistent set of escalators in there.*\n\n*For one point of my Report I used the Barrick adjustments, and specifically to address this comment, I erroneously used Wood Mackenzie adjustments. And since they were not completely identical, it results in slightly different cash flows, NPV results, and IRRs for an updated 2011 EXP, and that was the correction that I wished to insert into my Report*.\"2081\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2381 line 13 to p. 2382 line 18.\n\n1668.\n\nIn response to the correction presented by Prof. Davis which was provided to Respondent two days before Prof. Davis gave oral testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent sought to introduce certain additional documents into the record. Claimant objected to the introduction of these documents and disputed in particular Respondent's submission that these documents were directly responsive to or triggered by the correction presented by Prof. Davis. This applied, in particular, to an analysis of \"*implied prices*\" that Respondent sought to introduce into the record. While Respondent acknowledged that Prof. Davis' correction did not include any change to the copper and gold prices he had used in the updated calculation,2082 it argued that the changes had an effect on the \"*implied prices*\" for both metals, *i.e*., \"[t]*he price of the minerals times the cost you would have to incur to actually extract them*,\" and \"*a very significant impact on the Valuation discussion*\"; it therefore maintained that \"*the changes introduced actually effect the prices of the minerals, of course, not the Base Prices, but the Implied Prices that are what is relevant for purposes of valuation*.\"2083 Claimant disputed the relevance of the calculation of implied prices, which in its view was only \"*comparing gross revenues to copper payable,*\" and emphasized that this was a \"*wholly new analysis*\" which had not been presented by Respondent's experts in their second report but for the first time in response to the correction made by Prof. Davis to his updated calculation.2084 According to Claimant, this analysis \"*ha*[d] *absolutely nothing to do with the correction*\" made by Prof. Davis but was rather based on \"*old data that hasn't changed*.\"2085\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2302 lines 3-5.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2302 line 5 to p. 2303 line 15 and p. 2311 lines 2-4.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2305 line 21 to p. 2307 line 18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2392 lines 8-16.\n\n1669.\n\nRespondent emphasized that Prof. Davis' update of the costs in the calculation indicated that the initial costs \"*were off by over USD 1 billion*\" and maintained that it \"*would not have needed to make this new calculation of what the impact on the impact* [sic] *price of copper and gold were it not for the moving targets of what the calculations on the costs were*\" based on the corrections introduced by Prof. Davis.2086 Respondent confirmed that the analysis it was seeking to introduce was \"*not based on any piece of information that was not prior to this date already in the record of the case*,\" *i.e*., including the correction provided by Prof. Davis shortly before his oral testimony, but rather \"*at best, new calculations based on the data as submitted by Claimants yesterday.*\"2087\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2308 lines 7-18.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2397 lines 2-15 and p. 2400 lines 16-21.\n\n1670.\n\nThe analysis of \"*implied prices*,\" in particular, the timeliness of its introduction and whether it was triggered by the correction made by Prof. Davis or rather a stand-alone analysis that should have been made in Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof. Well's second report, was extensively discussed between counsel before the cross-examination of Prof. Davis.2088 Having heard both sides, the Tribunal decided that the spreadsheet containing the analysis of \"*implied prices*\" could be used during the cross-examination of Prof. Davis, subject to the Tribunal's final decision on whether it would admit the document into the record once it had more clarity as to what was a response to Prof. Davis' correction and what was not.2089\n\n*Cf.* Transcript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), pp. 2235-2247, 2301-2319, 2382-2404.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2404 lines 11-18 and p. 2408 line 10 to p. 2409 line 7.\n\n1671.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that following this discussion, Claimant proposed that as they did not believe the changes to be material or to \"*really materially affect any number that* [the Tribunal] *will be concerned about in the case*,\" it would be content to rely on the uncorrected numbers for the case. Respondent rejected this proposal, however, arguing that \"[w]*e have before us a case that is premised on the notion that the Valuation could be performed in certain equivalent terms for the projects, going 56 years into the future. And we have the Expert--Mr. Davis has found that months after the First Report--actually over a year after his First Report, his calculation on the Opex and Capex was off by over USD1 billion. So, I don't think that assuming that error had not been found is in any way useful, and I think that the fact that the error was found is very instrumental to the discussion that we still have to hold before the Tribunal*.\"2090\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2406 line 3 to p. 2407 line 20.\n\n1672.\n\nThe analysis of implied prices was not raised by Respondent during the cross-examination of Prof. Davis. Nor was it addressed in the presentation or examination of Respondent's experts or the expert conferencing held following their oral testimony. During Prof. Davis' cross-examination, his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was referred to only in the following discussion:\n\n\"[Y]*our valuation of the Project based on the information primarily taken from the Feasibility Study yields a Net Present Value that is between 15 and 20 times higher than that calculated in the Feasibility Study itself; is that correct?*\n\n*A. No. If you update the Feasibility Study to the Valuation Date in an apples to apples comparison, believe the number--and this gets into our errata--I would be happy with the 4 billion number for 100 percent, or 3 billion for 75 percent. That's the number from the updated Feasibility Study.*\n\n*Or if we go with the corrected values--I'm not sure what is in the record now. It is 4.24 billion or 3.18 billion is really irrelevant for the purposes I'm going to speak to now. That number, if one wishes to just compare it to my number of 8.5, I think the multiple is more like 2.5.*\n\n*Q. What Discount Rate for the Feasibility Study?*\n\n*A. Feasibility Study, which is a study that was intended to evaluate the progress of the Project as opposed to value--and I made this clear in my Report too--the Project, the Feasibility Study used 10 percent real as a Base Case Discount Rate*.\"2091\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2500 line 16 to p. 2501 line 17.\n\n1673.\n\nIn the absence of any further discussion or testimony on the analysis of \"*implied prices*,\" the Tribunal does not see any basis to assume that Prof. Davis' correction had an impact on the price assumptions he used in his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Nor does the Tribunal see any basis to revisit the conclusion it has reached above regarding Prof. Davis' approach to base his price assumptions for the update on the average of the prices used in other feasibility studies published around the time of the valuation date.\n\n1674.\n\nRespondent further argued that by correcting his initial calculation, Prof. Davis admitted that his calculation had been \"*off by over a billion dollars*\" and considered it accepted that the project had not been de-risked as assumed in Prof. Davis' valuation based on certainty-equivalent cash flows.2092 However, as pointed out by Claimant and Prof. Davis, the correction concerned only his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and not his modern DCF valuation model. This calculation, however, is not based on the concept of \"*de-risked*\" or \"*certainty-equivalent*\" cash flows.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 10), p. 3020 lines 1-4. See also (Day 8), p. 2308 lines 7-10 and p. 2408 lines 6-18.\n\n1675.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's argument that Prof. Davis' correction would raise more general doubts as to the reliability of his valuation. Prof. Davis explained that he corrected the costs in his updated calculation because he realized in preparing for the Hearing on Quantum that he had escalated the costs up to the valuation date by using a dataset different from the dataset used for the escalation of costs throughout the same time period in his modern valuation model. As pointed out by Respondent, relying on the same dataset as in his modern valuation model resulted in an overall decrease of Prof. Davis' Capex and Opex estimates from USD 38,689 billion to USD 37,655 billion over the life of the project.2093 Respondent did not dispute Prof. Davis' explanation regarding the source of his corrections. Nor did it provide any further substantiation as to why this correction should have any impact beyond the slight increase in value of Claimant's stake yielded by the updated calculation which, as specified in Prof. Davis' errata sheet, corresponded to an increase from USD 3.02 billion to USD 3.18 billion when using a 10% discount rate.\n\n**Exhibits CE-1778** and **CE-1778A**; Respondent's Closing Presentation, p. 81.\n\n1676.\n\nIn any event, as noted above, Claimant offered during the Hearing on Quantum not to rely on the corrected, higher value yielded by the corrected escalation of costs and, in fact, it relied on the initial, uncorrected figures in both its Closing Presentation and its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum.2094 Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason to attach any further significance to the correction of the updated calculated that was presented at the Hearing on Quantum.\n\nClaimant's Closing Presentation, p. 120; Claimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 503; **Exhibit CE-1556**.\n\n1677.\n\nAs a final point, the Tribunal has taken note of the dispute between the Parties and their experts with regard to the discount rate to be used when comparing the updated calculation with the result yielded by Prof. Davis' valuation model. Prof. Davis relied on the value yielded by the application of a 10% discount rate whereas Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered that a discount rate of 15% or more would have been appropriate.\n\n1678.\n\nBearing in mind that the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was based on a traditional DCF analysis, the Tribunal recalls that Prof. Davis agreed in his second report that, in principle, the modern DCF method and traditional method should lead to the same value, *i.e*., the fair market value, of the project. He stated that \"[b]*oth the traditional DCF and modern DCF produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to that FMV via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk.*\"2095 In his first report, he had also stated that \"*modern DCF and traditional DCF are both cash-flow based models that could, in principle, produce the same FMV for a mining asset*.\"2096 However, noting that the traditional DCF method required inputs such as the expected copper price and a time-varying discount rate over copper risk, which he considered to be \"*not easily known*,\" Prof. Davis considered it \"*unlikely for the two approaches to produce the same value, particularly if a constant discount rate is used, as is typical in the application of the traditional DCF method*.\" In his opinion, the prevalence of the modern DCF method was clear: \"*If the two values are not the same, we know that it is the traditional approach, which uses non-market information, that is failing to come up with the market value of the revenue stream. We cannot know whether the traditional method's copper price forecast was incorrect, its discount rate was incorrect, or whether both were incorrect*.\"2097\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 53.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 95.\n\nDavis I, \u00b6 91.\n\n1679.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis confirmed that assuming one would come up with the right discount rate, the traditional and modern DCF methods should lead to the same result. He stated:\n\n\"*That's exactly right. And, in fact, what we do sometimes when we--and especially when I teach this, I do a simple and I do a modern. I generate the value in the modern, and I back-calculate what Discount Rate I need in the simple to come up with the same value. And you get some astounding results. The Discount Rate that you'd have to use for long-life assets is very low, and you can imagine why because for a long-life asset, to get all that value, you can't use 10, 12, or 15 because it will discount away those long-life cash flows. So, you could, if you knew what the right Discount Rate was, you would get the same number, exactly.*\n\n*My belief is the only way you know what the right Discount Rate is, is to do the modern, get the value, and then impute what Discount Rate you would need to use in the traditional to get that same value*.\"2098\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2374 lines 2-15.\n\n1680.\n\nProf. Davis further confirmed that, in his opinion, due to the compounding factor of the discount rate, the use of a single discount rate for a 50-year project yielded either inaccurate results or amounted to \"*two wrongs making a right*\":\n\n\"*ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: \u2026 If you were to use the traditional DCF method, you would have to use a different Discount Rate over different periods of time; is that correct?*\n\n*THE WITNESS: That is exactly correct.*\n\n*ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: It would be incorrect to use the same Discount Rate to bring it up to that Present Value in the traditional DCF method from 30 years in the future to today?*\n\n*THE WITNESS: You could probably find a single Discount Rate that gives you the right value, but it's two wrongs making a right. So, some firms do use a constant Discount Rate, but they tend to use a low one, again, because they don't want it to be compounding that risk over the life of the asset*.\"2099\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2377 line 17 to p. 2378 line 8.\n\n1681.\n\nProf. Davis noted that the Feasibility Study had used a 10% real discount rate as the base case discount rate and added that his calculated value of USD 8.5 billion corresponded to a multiple of about 2.5 compared to the value yielded by using a 10% discount rate in the updated calculation.2100 This indicates that the discount rate to be used to arrive at the value yielded by Prof. Davis' modern valuation model would have had to be considerably lower than 10%.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2501 lines 8-17.\n\n1682.\n\nMr. Sep\u00falveda confirmed in his witness statement that while the financial model for the Feasibility Study presented discount rates in the range of 0% to 12%, \"*the TCC Board selected 10% as the indicative rate*.\" This statement is confirmed by the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which states with regard to the use of discount rates:\n\n\"*Given the complexity and location of the project a 10% discount rate has been selected as the* 'base case' *discount rate for the EXP Study. In addition, the asset model also considers discount rates of 0%, 5%, 8%, and 12% for the calculation of the NPV; these were selected to cover the financial expectations of the owners*.\"2101\n\n**Exhibit CE-964**, p. 28-18.\n\n1683.\n\nMr. Sep\u00falveda further noted that \"[b]*ecause of the enormous size of the resource and the long mine life of 56 years in the IMD case, the discount rate had a significant effect on the NPV the model produced. This is no surprise, given that NPV only attributes value to the cash flows created in the initial years of a long-life asset*.\"2102 He further explained why he considered the selection of 10% \"*reasonable for this kind of model of this asset*\": \"*Copper projects are usually discounted at a uniform rate of 8%, and gold projects at 5%, as this is their capital cost. The weighted capital cost for Reko Diq, as it was a mixture of the two metals, was 7.28%. To this we added a premium to account for risk associated with investing in Pakistan. That premium was based on the Pakistani Emerging Market Bond Index ('EMBI'), or sovereign spread, of 3.41%. As I explained to others in TCC at the time, the inclusion of the entire sovereign spread was inappropriate since metals prices do not depend on the Pakistani economy, and Reko Diq was to be* 'an export-oriented project with offshore dollar denominated revenues[\u2026]'\"2103\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6 17.\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6 18.\n\n1684.\n\nAs already noted above, Mr. Sep\u00falveda further agreed with Prof. Davis that for valuation purposes even the 10% discount rate may have been considered too high:\n\n\"*The seller would also try to figure out how to put an appropriate value on Reko Diq's enormous, world-class size. At a 10% discount rate a conventional NPVanalysis gives almost no value for revenues from 15 years and later. But the Feasibility Study and Pre-Feasibility Study make clear that this is not just a 15 year mine, and it would command a sale price much higher than a similar mine that had only a 15 year life. The true value of Reko Diq lies in the fact that it promised to produce in times of both low and high prices for decades to come*.\"2104\n\nSep\u00falveda, \u00b6 26.\n\n1685.\n\nThe same was also confirmed by Mr. Luksic who testified:\n\n\"*A final reason why the NPV in a feasibility study evaluation is often not reflective of fair market value is the fact that the compounding effect of the discount rate means that the NPV assigns little if any value beyond the first decade of the project. The fact that the NPV does not capture a lot of value beyond the first ten to fifteen years is not a problem when you are simply trying to determine whether an investment is viable because then you mostly care about the payback period. But it is a very different story when it comes to determining the fair market value of an asset. In such a case, it makes absolutely no sense to assign no value to the full life of mine. It goes without saying that a sixty-year mine will be worth more than a twelve-year mine*.\"2105\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6 17.\n\n1686.\n\nIn support of this statement, Mr. Luksic referred to the Los Pelambres mine owned by Antofagasta in Chile:\n\n\"*The Los Pelambres mine provides a useful illustration of the shortcomings of a feasibility study NPV. Like Reko Diq, Los Pelambres is a world-class porphyry copper deposit with a very long life of mine. When the Los Pelambres Feasibility Study was approved in 1996, it showed a range of NPVs between US$ 800 million and US$ 1.5 billion. In our view this was a healthy NPV and it gave us comfort that the mine was a safe investment but we knew that the mine was actually worth much more. During the mine's first sixteen years of operation, it has paid out more than US$ 14 billion in dividends to our shareholders and has also paid for the several marginal expansions that have occurred over this period. Furthermore, the resource is by no means exhausted: based on current expansion proposals, the mine will be in operation for at least another thirty years*.\"2106\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6 18.\n\n1687.\n\nMr. Luksic considered that buyers would not take the conservative approach used in a feasibility study for in-house development but rather, \"*instead of using conservative price assumptions and a large discount rate in order to determine what the project's value will be in the worst-case scenario, buyers use price assumptions that are at\u2014or sometimes even above\u2014the current prices and a discount rate in the low single digits*.\" He added that buyers were thereby \"*correcting for the conservatism that they know is built into the feasibility study and compensating for the value of future expansions and for the discoveries that are likely to be made through further exploration but is simply not captured in the feasibility study*.\"2107 As an example, Mr. Luksic referred to the sale of a 30% interest in Antucoya by Antofagasta to a Japanese general trading company in December 2011, noting that the purchase price the company was willing to pay implied that it had used a copper price of USD 3.50 and a discount rate of 5%.2108\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6 19.\n\nLuksic II, \u00b6 20.\n\n1688.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is clear that the example referred to by Mr. Luksic is not comparable to Reko Diq in that it concerned a minority interest in a much smaller mine located in a different part of the world facing different asymmetric risks. However, the Tribunal does take note of the explanation provided by Prof. Davis, Mr. Sep\u00falveda and Mr. Luksic as to why they considered that even the 10% discount rate used as the base case in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study yielded a result that did not reflect the fair market value of the project. In particular, they all referred to the compounding factor of the discount rate, which has a particular impact on cash flows that are generated more that 15 or 20 years into the future. In this regard, the Tribunal also considers it worth recalling the illustration provided by Prof. Davis of discounting cash flows at a constant 10% discount rate over the anticipated life of the mine:\n\n1689.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls the statement in the 2012 CIMVal report that \"[v]*ery long-life base metal asset may require that long-term cash flows be explicitly modeled with a CeQ DCF approach because of price reversion in base metal prices (i.e. the tendency of metal price to revert to a long-term equilibrium level). This approach may be used if in the particular situation a standard DCF model with aggregate risk adjustments to the net cash flow has difficulty recognizing the explicit risk characteristics of a cash flow stream*.\"2109 While CIMVal does not explicitly make reference to the discount rate, it does refer to difficulties that may be implied in using \"*aggregate risk adjustments to the net cash flow*\" in the standard DCF model for a very long-life asset.\n\n**Exhibit CE-1483**, pp. 7-8.\n\n1690.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that it was inappropriate for Prof. Davis to refer in his comparison to the value yielded by the updated calculation at a 10% discount rate. The Tribunal specifically emphasizes that it thereby does not make a finding that the application of a 10% discount rate would have been appropriate in the context of a traditional DCF valuation of the project. Neither Party has provided the Tribunal with such a valuation and Respondent's experts have not expressed a definitive opinion as to the discount rate they would have considered appropriate if it had been performed. In their first report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells referred to the nominal discount rate above 23% estimated by Dr. Burrows and noted that they would \"*expect a higher rate for the region of western Balochistan where Reko Diq is located*,\" also stating that they believed that the discount rate that would acutally be applied by an investor in 2011 would have been \"*above 30%*\"; they also noted, however, that \"*there is no need to choose an exact number to understand that the project would attract no investor even if one accepts the optimistic assumptions on which the SNC-Lavalin reports are based*.\"2110 In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells maintained that the rate above 30% they had suggested in their first report was \"*not outrageous and we have seen very high rates repeatedly in practice and in arbitral decisions, which are applied to projects far less risky than Reko Diq*.\" They added, however, that their conclusion did not depend on the application of 30% discount rate but that \"[a]*t one third of that rate Reko Diq becomes uneconomic*.\"2111 Most importantly, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not provide any support for their assertion that a buyer would actually have applied a discount rate of 30% or more to determine the value of the project, other than a reference to Prof. Wells' involvement in negotiations for a gold mining development in an unidentified other country.2112\n\nBrailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6\u00b6 162, 17 and note 22. *See also* \u00b6\u00b6 73, 153.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 47.\n\nCf. Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 73.\n\n1691.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal recalls that for the reasons set out in detail above, the calculations made in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study cannot be set equal to a DCF valuation of the project for the purposes of this arbitration. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not substantiate in their report that the 10% base case discount rate used in the Studies did not reflect what was commonly used in technical studies for projects like Reko Diq. At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Luksic confirmed Mr. Sep\u00falveda's testimony that the 10% base case discount rate used in the Feasibility Study had been approved by Claimant's Board of Directors and by both Antofagasta and Barrick.2113 He further testified that he considered both 12% and 10% to be a conservative discount rate for a feasibility study and that 8% was \"*more traditional*\" and \"*more what we're normally using,*\" whereas 5% could be considered \"*aggressive*.\"2114\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1289 lines 16-22.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 5), p. 1333 line 14 to p. 1335 line 4.\n\n1692.\n\nIn the specific circumstances of this case and again noting that it is thereby not making a finding on the appropriateness of a 10% discount rate for a traditional DCF valuation of a project located in Pakistan, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the best indication of value to be derived from the updated calculation of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, with all the caveats expressed above, is the value calculated by Prof. Davis in his second report. In the Tribunal's view, this indication of value calculated at approximately USD 3 billion for Claimant's 75% stake in the project, does not contradict the Tribunal's conclusion reached on the basis of Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation model, *i.e*., that the value of Claimant's investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.\n\n1693.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the remaining difference between the valuation and the indication of value yielded by the updated calculation is explained by the considerations set out in detail above, in particular that the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was not intended to capture the value of the project as reflected in the cash flows to be generated over the life of the mine. This difference therefore does not warrant a different conclusion regarding the value of Claimant's investment.\n\n**b. Verification of the Tribunal's Conclusion Taking Into Account the Past-Transaction-Based Valuation Performed by Dr. Burrows**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1694.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the valuation performed by Dr. Burrows, which was based on the past transactions by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006. In his first report, Dr. Burrows explained his approach to assessing the fair market value of the project as follows:\n\n\"*In the context of the circumstances of that project as of the Valuation Date, fair market value is best assessed based on past transactions, adjusted by several factors occurring between those transactions and the Valuation Date. These factors include changes in world metals markets and country risk, as well as any subsequent efficient, proven investments that might have been taken into account by a hypothetical buyer of the asset on the Valuation Date*.\"2115\n\nBurrows I, \u00b6 3.\n\n1695.\n\nNoting that Prof. Davis had identified eight transactions involving mineral assets but concluded that these were not comparable to Reko Diq, Dr. Burrows considered that Prof. Davis had failed to consider \"*an arm's-length transaction for a property that is much more comparable to Reko Diq than the eight properties he examined: the September 22, 2006 acquisition by Barrick of 50% of TCC for an amount consistent with a value for TCC of $246 million*.\"2116 He further explained:\n\n\"*To use this transaction as a basis to calculate the fair market value of TCC's interest in Reko Diq on the Valuation Date, I adjust the September 2006 enterprise value for changes in the following factors between September 2006 and the Valuation Date: (a) changes in expectations about metals prices, (b) inflation in costs of production in the world mining industry, (c) changes in the general cost of capital for metals mines, and (d) changes in Pakistan country risk. I also consider expenditures by TCC subsequent to September 2006 and changes in expected capital expenditures and operating costs.*\n\n*The first three factors (changes in expectations of copper and gold prices, general inflation in mining costs, and changes in the general cost of capital for copper and gold mining) are factors that are common to all copper and gold projects. I therefore adjust for the effects of these factors by escalating the September 2006 transaction value using published indices of share prices of copper and gold mining companies. I then adjust for the increase in country risk between 2006 and 2011*.\"2117\n\nBurrows I, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 23.\n\nBurrows I, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\n1696.\n\nOn that basis, Dr. Burrows accounted for an average increase in value of 78% for gold mining companies and 107% for copper mining companies, resulting in a weighted average increase of 104%. He then made an adjustment for \"*the effect of higher country risk*,\" which he determined on the basis of Pakistan's sovereign yield spread. Noting that the sovereign yield spread increased from 2.5% in September 2006 to 12.1% in November 2011, he determined that the cost of capital for Reko Diq had increased from 14.5% in 2006 to 24.2% in 2011 and that the present value of cash flows had therefore declined by 70% due to the increased country risk. He emphasized that the 24.2% estimate \"*is not an estimate of the cost of capital as of November 2011; rather, it reflects the 2006 cost of capital adjusted for changes in country risk.*\" According to Dr. Burrows, these adjustments resulted in an adjusted transaction value on the valuation date of USD 150.4 million.2118\n\nBurrows I, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28-30 and note 34.\n\n1697.\n\nDr. Burrows further noted that Claimant had incurred expenditures in the amount of USD 219 million after the transaction date but saw \"*no basis for adding value to the adjusted transaction value of $150.4 million*\":\n\n\"*To the extent that these expenditures were proven, efficient, and relevant to the development of Reko Diq, they might add value to a potential purchaser on the Valuation Date. However, I understand that many of these expenditures were not productive or efficient and that many costs were incurred for purposes not related to the development of the property that is the subject of this dispute. Costs that were unproductive and inefficient, and costs related to other assets than EL-5, would not add value to the value of TCC's interest in EL-5. As noted in footnote 30, the expected metals production did not increase between 2006 and 2011. Furthermore even costs that were productive, efficient, and related to the assets that are subject to this dispute would probably not be valued dollar for dollar by a prospective buyer, as the buyer would probably wish to invest development expenditures to satisfy its own standards and approaches for developing a mineral deposit. As the Claimant has provided little detail on the expenditures between 2006 and 2011, I have no basis for adding any value to the adjusted transaction value of $150.4 million for TCC's interest in EL-5*.\"2119\n\nBurrows I, \u00b6 31.\n\n1698.\n\nSpecifically with regard to his assumption that \"*the expected metals production did not increase between 2006 and 2011*,\" Dr. Burrows considered it \"*reasonable to believe that, when* [the buyers of TCC which were two of the world's largest mining companies] *entered that acquisition in 2006, they had a good understanding of the total resource base*.\" In terms of documentary evidence, Dr. Burrows referred to a news article on the acquisition by Antofagasta as well as \"[a] *spreadsheet apparently prepared by Antofagasta or its advisors on February 16, 2006*\" and compared the expected total recoverable copper and gold in that spreadsheet with the projected total recoverable copper and gold in the Financial Asset Model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.2120\n\nBurrows I, note 30; **Exhibits CRA-10**, **CRA-11** and **CRA-12B**.\n\n1699.\n\nProf. Davis commented on Dr. Burrows' approach in his second report, considering the calculation \"*futile, because the asset in that one trade, Reko Diq in 2006, is fundamentally different from Reko Diq in 2011*.\" In his opinion, \"*critical knowledge had been gained about the asset between 2006 and 2011 that fundamentally changed its value*.\" Prof. Davis noted that his own screening algorithm for comparable transactions had \"*rejected the transaction as not useful*\" because Reko Diq had then not been in the feasibility or pre-production stage but was classified as in the earlier \"*Reserves Development*\" stage.2121 In his opinion, \"*Reko Diq in 2006 is not reasonably similar to Reko Diq on the Valuation Date, and no adjustment or set of adjustments is possible to account reliably for the full scope of differences*.\"2122\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 237 and note 318.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 241.\n\n1700.\n\nAccording to Prof. Davis, a \"*key criterion for comparability*\" is the development stage of the project. He noted that Reko Diq went from a Mineral Resource Property in 2006 to a Development Property in 2011, which had \"*completed a successful bankable feasibility study, had more certainty in the resource estimate, and was being heralded as a world-class asset*.\"2123 Prof. Davis added:\n\n\"*Between 2006 and 2011, Reko Diq went up the mine value curve. By 2011, four technical studies had been completed, at a cost of over $125 million and totaling thousands of pages, and managing to get the project past the feasibility study stage. According to Enders and Leveille, respected geologists in the mining industry, there is only a 20% chance that a project at the scoping study stage will get to the feasibility study stage due to technical and economic risks. The market value of Reko Diq in early 2006 would reflect a discount for the low probability of getting to a successful scoping study, let alone to feasibility (and later into production). However, once that stage is achieved, that discount is removed. Thus, Reko Diq in 2006 is fundamentally different from Reko Diq in 2011*.\"2124\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 242-244.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 245.\n\n1701.\n\nProf. Davis considered that the amount of resources and reserves also constituted a fundamental difference. He stated that while the project had had indicated resources and a large amount of inferred resources in 2006, the additional drilling conducted after 2006, which amounted to 80% of the cumulative drilling, \"*both found additional Resources and provided additional confidence in the existing Resource such that the Inferred Resources could be transformed into Measured and Indicated Resources*.\"2125 Prof. Davis illustrated the increases in both categories of resources as well as the increase in measured & indicated contained metal as follows:2126\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 246-248.\n\nDavis II, Figures 13, 14 and 15; Workpaper R-24.\n\n1702.\n\nNoting that \"*Measured and Indicated Resources more than doubled between the 2006 purchase date and 2011*\" and that \"[t]*he Inferred Resources and Mineral Inventory as of 2011 could, if proved up, extend the mine life by nearly 50%*,\" Prof. Davis expressed the opinion that \"[t]*his difference in resources and classification makes Reko Diq in 2011 fundamentally different from Reko Diq in 2006*.\"2127\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 247-248.\n\n1703.\n\nOn that basis, Prof. Davis rejected Dr. Burrows' statement that \"*the expected metals production did not increase between 2006 and 2011*\" and expressed the opinion that the comparison he had drawn between the 2006 spreadsheet, which he described as \"*prepared by Antofagasta*,\" and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was \"*inappropriate because the 2006 spreadsheet includes all resources, including Inferred, known at the time, while the EXP PFS values cited by Dr. Burrows only include Measured and Indicated resources*.\" He added that \"[a] *fair, like-to-like comparison of Reko Diq's 2011 resource base with the 2006 Antofagasta spreadsheet would include the Inferred resources as of 2011. Such a comparison implies a 2.4x increase in the size of the total resource between 2006 and 2011.*\" Prof. Davis therefore maintained his opinion that \"[t]*he increased size and confidence level in Reko Diq's resource base by 2011 makes the property incomparable with itself in 2006*.\"2128\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 250.\n\n1704.\n\nProf. Davis identified several additional reasons why he considered the 2011 project to be \"*fundamentally different*\" from the 2006 project. These reasons included, *inter alia* : (i) the project's stripping ratio which was \"*far superior to the industry average*\" but had not been known in 2006; (ii) economies of scale which would have lowered the project's costs of production but which had not been known in 2006 when the rate of economic production was still unclear; and (iii) the specific location of Reko Diq the risks of which would not be reflected in the sovereign yield spread which instead reflected other developments such as the government's debt and severe flooding in 2010 and 2011.2129\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 251-261.\n\n1705.\n\nProf. Davis further considered that the magnitude of the \"*large and subjective adjustments to the deal value*\" made by Dr. Burrows \"*is evidence in itself that Reko Diq in 2006 is not comparable and that therefore the method cannot be applied reliably*,\" as \"*each of Dr. Burrows' adjustments, which range from twice to almost four times the original transaction value, overwhelms whatever signal of value the transaction reflected*.\"2130 Prof. Davis illustrated the magnitude of Dr. Burrows' adjustments as follows:2131\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 263, 265.\n\nDavis II, Figure 17 and Workpaper R-28.\n\n1706.\n\nProf. Davis also criticized these adjustments as \"*flawed*.\" Specifically, he considered that Dr. Burrows' use of two mining indices to adjust for the value impact of market factors between 2006 and 2011 was \"*in theory reasonable, though in practice imprecise*\" as it would have been applied to \"*any copper gold project with the same copper-gold ratio in any country, at any stage, underground or open pit, high grade or low grade, high cost or low cost, remote or accessible, artic or desert, heavily taxed or lightly taxed, and so on.*\" Prof. Davis further expressed the opinion that \"[t]*here is no reason to believe that the average share price change of the companies in the sample, and what it implies about the change in their project values, applies to a Resource stage project like Reko Diq*.\"2132 Prof. Davis also pointed to an adjustment made by Dr. Burrows to account for time effects by advancing the weighted average timing of cash flows by 5.2 years and noted that each of these two adjustments had more than doubled the value, which confirmed in his opinion that the 2006 comparison could not be considered a valid comparison trade.2133\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 266-271.\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 273-274.\n\n1707.\n\nIn particular, however, Prof. Davis critized the adjustment for country risk that Dr. Burrows made on the basis of Pakistan's sovereign yield spread and \"[w]*ithout taking into account any specifics of the Project*,\" which lowered the value of Reko Diq by 85%. Apart from his disagreement with the use of the sovereign yield spread to determine the country risk premium to be added to the cost of capital, Prof. Davis argued in particular that Dr. Burrows failed to account for the fact that certain country risks would already be reflected in the indices of mining companies and ignored that the \"*extreme value discount*\" of 85% was not supported by the performance of Pakistani oil and gas companies which indicated only a decrease in value of up to 20%.2134\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 276-283.\n\n1708.\n\nIn addition to his criticisms of the adjustments that Dr. Burrow had made, Prof. Davis expressed the opinion that \"*Dr. Burrows ignores all of these project-specific effects and does not make any adjustment for the improvements to the asset that TCC made in the five years since it was acquired by Barrick and Antofagasta, despite calculating that TCC spent $219 million in exploration, evaluation, and development expenditures between July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011*.\" In particular, Prof. Davis referred to the absence of adjustments for stage of development and reserves and concluded that \"[n]*ot making adjustments for these factors leaves Dr. Burrows' analysis incomplete and unreliable*.\"2135\n\nDavis II, \u00b6\u00b6 285-289.\n\n1709.\n\nIn his second report, Dr. Burrows maintained his analysis and conclusion. He emphasized that his analysis was not based on an assessment of comparable properties but rather a transaction involving Reko Diq itself and expressed the opinion that \"[m]*ost of the factors that vary across mineral properties do not vary significantly for Reko Diq itself between the two dates. For those that do vary (such as metals prices, mining industry costs, general costs of capital, local country risk, incremental investments in the property, and time to production), I adjust for the variations*.\"2136\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 8.\n\n1710.\n\nWith regard to the criteria listed by Prof. Davis as not or insufficiently accounted for in the adjustments, Dr. Burrows reiterated that \"*the parties involved in the transaction were not na\u00efve and uninformed*.\" In his opinion, \"*Professor Davis would have the reader conclude that in such a highly contested transaction, the buyers would have hoodwinked the sellers (who would be likely to know much more about the property than the buyers) by paying $246 million when according to Professor Davis it was actually worth over $8 billion dollars (after a further expenditure of just several hundred million dollars).*\"2137\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 9.\n\n1711.\n\nDr. Burrows maintained that he had relied on common sense as well as on a document prepared by Antofagasta which \"*demonstrate*[d] *that the parties at the time of the transaction had a very accurate understanding of the resource base of Reko Diq and of the costs of extracting and recovering the metals*.\" He noted that the information used as a basis for this document could only have come from the seller and eliminated the need to speculate about what was known by the transacting parties in 2006. According to Dr. Burrows, the additional development work conducted until 2011 even \"*resulted in negative surprises about metals production and costs between 2006 and 2011*\" as the total amount of ore milled (both copper and gold) decreased whereas initial and sustaining capital expenditures as well as operating expenditures increased.2138 Dr. Burrows did not dispute Prof. Davis' statement that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study included only Measured and Indicated Resources but argued:\n\n\"*The key facts are that the 2006 document represented the buyer's projection of production and costs at that time and the 2010 technical study also represented the projections of production and costs at that time. The two production projections are nearly the same. Any additional resources delineated as of 2010 that were not represented in the production projections were obviously not in the future production plans*.\"2139\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12 and Appendix 8.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 13.\n\n1712.\n\nAs for Prof. Davis' distinction between the development stages of a Mineral Resource Property and a Development Property, Dr. Burrows considered this to be \"*a semantic distinction without a difference.*\" In his opinion:\n\n\"*The relevant factor is that the buyers in 2006 made a projection of production that was very similar to their projection four years later, and based an acquisition decision on that projection. It is clear from the contemporaneous valuation document that the buyers did not apply a discount for any semantic distinction about stage of production. The information available at the time to the transacting parties on Reko Diq was sufficient to provide a highly accurate projection of its production potential*.\"2140\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 15.\n\n1713.\n\nDr. Burrows considered that the transacting parties had been \"*well aware of the scale of the resource in 2006*\" and projected a mine life of 45 years with approximately the same life-of-mine production as the 2010 Base Case with a 55-year mine life, thus contemplating an even larger mine with similar scale benefits. He also noted that contrary to Prof. Davis' suggestions, the 2006 spreadsheet did include an estimate of operating costs and maintained that \"*the projected costs of production increased dramatically between 2006 and 2011*.\" Dr. Burrows also addressed Prof. Davis' further criticisms and maintained that these adjustments were either insignificant or would have led to a downward adjustment in his calculation.2141\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 17-22.\n\n1714.\n\nSpecifically, with regard to Prof. Davis' argument that he failed to account for the increased geologic certainty and more advanced stage of the project, Dr. Burrows argued:\n\n\"*Professor Davis seems to be confusing changes in value from expenditures that are needed to develop the mine, changes in expected production and costs, and the appropriate discount rate for valuing the expected future cash flow stream. A mine increases in value over time as expenditures are made on exploration, drilling, feasibility studies and mine plans (i.e., as sunk costs at the time of valuation increase and remaining development costs decline), as expected production increases or costs decline as a result of additional discoveries over time, and as the time remaining until production commences declines. I have accounted for all of these effects*.\"2142\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 24.\n\n1715.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Burrows stated that: (i) he had found that expected production did not increase between 2006 and 2011 as a result of which no adjustment was necessary in that regard; (ii) he had made an upward adjustment to account for the reduction in time to construction; (iii) he had considered the value of expenditures incurred by Claimant but found that there was not sufficient detail to determine the amount spent on Reko Diq and, relying on Respondent's expert Prof. Dagdelen, that \"*much of the expenditures were redundant or ineffective*\" as a result of which he was \"*unable to attribute any increased value to the project as a result of investments made after the 2006 transaction date*.\" Noting that Antofagasta had expected in 2006 to spend USD 75 million during the development period, Dr. Burrows added that \"*a maximum estimate of any increment in value between 2006 and 2011 as a result of further investments made to advance the project is $75 million, the estimate Antofagasta, an experienced mining company, made at the time of the transaction*.\"2143\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 23-27.\n\n1716.\n\nAccording to Dr. Burrows, \"[t]*he resolution of geologic uncertainty can only have an impact on value if it changes the expectation of the mine's cash flows*.\" Depending on the expectation of the parties before technical studies are conducted and the impact of subsequent development work on these initial expectations, these studies could \"*increase, decrease or have no effect on value*.\" Dr. Burrows argues that \"*ex post values change because in the process of reducing uncertainty the expected values change*\" but not because of the reduction of uncertainty itself. He considered:\n\n\"*The original ex ante expectation was a statistical expectation, or average, of possible outcomes. There is no need to discount this ex ante value for idiosyncratic technical risks. This is because technical uncertainty is a diversifiable risk and therefore investors do not take such risks into account in valuing the project. With respect to the Reko Diq project, between 2006 and 2010 expected metals production declined and expected capital and operating costs increased. The resolution of technical uncertainty during this period resulted in a reduction in value ex post*.\"2144\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 29.\n\n1717.\n\nDr. Burrows further rejected Prof. Davis' characterization of his adjustments as \"*subjective*,\" arguing that they were based on \"*objective, appropriate, and transparent data*.\" As for the use of mining indices, Dr. Burrows agreed that \"*there is some imprecision in the adjustment*\" but did not consider this to be significant as there was \"*no reason to believe that Reko Diq is so different from other copper-gold mining projects that the effects of changes in these underlying factors would be significantly different for Reko Diq than for the average of other companies*\" and the effects cited by Prof. Davis were either \"*trivial*\" or \"*immaterial*\" or would only result in a downward adjustment of Reko Diq's value.2145 Dr. Burrows further rejected the suggestion that his approach was double-counting country risk, noting that \"*a large proportion of mining asset values is in low-risk countries*\" and it was \"*unlikely that the change in aggregate country risk in the indices is related with the change in the Pakistan country risk*.\"2146\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 30-35, 39-41.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 36.\n\n1718.\n\nDr. Burrows also rejected Prof. Davis' assertion that he had not made adjustments specific to Reko Diq and pointed to his adjustments for reduced production development time until construction and for the increased country risk in Pakistan.2147 Dr. Burrows maintained that the latter adjustment was appropriate, as the oil and gas companies in Pakistan referred to by Prof. Davis were either government controlled or Pakistani controlled, which rendered them \"*irrelevant*,\" and these companies had all been producing oil and gas between 2006 and 2011, which meant that they had a different exposure to country risk than the pre-production project Reko Diq.2148\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6 38.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n1719.\n\nDr. Burrows argued that his approach to measuring country risk based on the sovereign spread was commonly used by practitioners and that such a method would also have been used by \"*most if not all potential buyers (and bankers) of a project such as Reko Diq*.\"2149 He also rejected the argument that Pakistan' sovereign yield spread had increased between 2006 and 2011 for reasons unrelated to risks affecting private investments and maintained that it was an adequate measure for country risk affecting the Reko Diq project because \"*(i) there is significant agreement by researchers and practitioners that private risks are correlated with sovereign spreads, and (ii) though there may be disagreement as to whether the appropriate level of such risks is higher or lower than the sovereign spread, it is reasonable to use the sovereign spread itself both as a compromise across such disagreements and to reflect methods used by practitioners and that are highly likely to be used by potential buyers of the project*.\"2150\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n\n1720.\n\nAs a final point, Dr. Burrows noted that while he had assumed in his first report that as of 2011, the project was five years closer to production than in 2006, the time period modeled by Prof. Davis in his modern valuation model indicated that \"*the project was only about one year closer to production than as of the 2006 transaction date*.\" Dr. Burrows therefore revised his estimate of the 2011 adjusted value to USD 61.2 million. Further assuming that the amount of USD 75 million that Antofagasta expected to spend on the development of the project (USD 88 million in 2011 dollars) had in fact been spent as of the valuation date, he concluded that the maximum estimate of the value of the project as of the valuation date amounted to USD 149.2 million.2151\n\nBurrows II, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.\n\n1721.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the fact that the value calculated by Dr. Burrows is significantly lower than the value yielded by Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation model, even after making all of the additional deductions made by the Tribunal in its detailed assessment above. Prof. Davis has not presented an alternative figure for Dr. Burrows' market-based approach that would reflect the adjustments he would have considered more appropriate; he rather argued that the project in 2006 cannot reasonably be compared to the project in 2011. At the Hearing on Quantum, he summarized the reasons for his opinion as follows:\n\n\"*Dr. Burrows used the Reko Diq trade in 2006 as being comparable to the Reko Diq Fair Market Valuation in 2011. In my view, they were different assets. In 2006 it was pre-scoping. It did have a resource base, but it had not had one technical study completed. By 2011, it had several technical studies completed. It had a Mining Lease. It had a Mine Plan. And it had had 290 kilometers of additional drilling that had identified where the resource body was, where the high-grade and low-grade zones were, what the mining pits should look like, where the plant should be located so as not to cover any of the viable mineralization. There was sampling for the pilot plant and testing. An awful lot had happened to de-risk the Project, as we say, in the industry, and bring it to a development property from a mineral resource property. And that de-risking adds substantial value to a property.*\n\n*Incidentally, while that de-risking was happening, the amount of Measured and Indicated copper and gold virtually doubled, on the left-hand side, and the Inferred Resources more than doubled, on the right-hand side. So, the scope of the Project grew. Dr. Burrows does not include in his analysisany of that project advancing other than in \u2026 his second approach, where he attributes USD75 million roughly to the incremental value from that drilling or from that advancement*.\"2152\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 8), p. 2363 line 20 to p. 2365 line 9.\n\n1722.\n\nProf. Davis considered his opinion regarding the differences in market circumstances confirmed by the magnitude of the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows, in particular by his adjustment for country risk which Dr. Burrows determined based on an approach with which Prof. Davis disagreed. Prof. Davis illustrated the revised adjustments made in Dr. Burrows' second report as follows:2153\n\nDavis Presentation, p. 50.\n\n1723.\n\nIn addition to the adjustments that Dr. Burrows had made, the second major point of disagreement between the Parties' experts concerned the adjustments he had not made, in particular the question whether Dr. Burrows should have accounted for an increase in value created by the additional exploration work and studies carried out after the 2006 transaction as a result of which the project went from the development stage of a Mineral Resource Property to a Development Property.\n\n1724.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that there are several additional points of disagreement between the experts regarding allegedly lacking or incorrect adjustments. However, the Tribunal considers that if it reaches the conclusion that Dr. Burrows should have accounted for an increase in value created between 2006 and 2011 and there is therefore a reasonable explanation for the deviation between the results yielded by both approaches, it is not necessary to examine the additional points of disagreement in further detail.\n\n1725.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Dr. Burrows' approach to value the project based on a past transaction involving the very same project might generally appear plausible. It is undisputed, however, that the transaction occurred more than five years before the valuation date and that during this time period, considerable changes affecting the value of the project occurred. Apart from undisputed developments with regard to market prices and costs as well as the disputed factor of country risk, Claimant carried out a significant amount of exploration work. As the Tribunal has already set out in detail in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimant expanded the scope of its exploration program following the acquisition by Antofagasta from Tanjeel to other ore deposits within Reko Diq, in particular the orebodies at the Western Porphyries.2154\n\n*Cf*. Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 350 *et seq*.\n\n1726.\n\nBased on the results of its drilling programs, Claimant also continuously revised its estimates of the mineral resources contained in these orebodies. The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability explicitly records the following developments: (i) in a meeting of the Operating Committee held on 11 February 2006, Claimant stated that \"*the drilling program had now demonstrated the world class potential of the Reko Diq caldera with a global resource of over 2 billion tones*\";2155 (ii) at the OC meeting held on 15 July 2006, Claimant reported that the total indicated and inferred resources at all of the examined orebodies were estimated at \"*2.42 billion tonnes @ 0.51% copper and 0.27g/t gold*\";2156 (iii) in its Quarterly Report for the period ended 31 December 2006, Claimant reported that the indicated and inferred mineral resources at the Western Porphyries (*i.e*., excluding the other ore deposits included in the other estimates), currently stood at \"*1.61 billion tonnes @ 0.54% copper and 0.30g/t gold*\";2157 and (iv) following additional exploration work and completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study for Initial Mine Development in July 2009, Claimant reported in the Pre-Feasibility Study that the total amount of measured, indicated and inferred resources at all of the examined ore deposits amounted to a grand total of 4,701 billion tonnes @ 0.48% copper and 0.28g/t gold as of May 2009.2158 The Tribunal specifically noted that this represented a nearly 100% increase over the mineral resource estimate that Claimant had produced in early 2006.2159\n\n**Exhibit CE-55**, p. 3. *See* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 343.\n\n**Exhibit CE-58**, p. 12. *See* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 357.\n\n**Exhibit CE-209**, p. 12. *See* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 365.\n\n**Exhibit CE-74**, Table 8.3.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 390.\n\n1727.\n\nAs noted above, an essential point in Dr. Burrows' argument as to why he considered it appropriate not to make any adjustment for the additional exploration work carried out by Claimant after the 2006 transaction was that in his opinion, reducing geologic uncertainty did not produce value in itself but only if it resulted in an increase in the expected production of copper and/or gold, thereby increasing the expected cash flows. However, relying on a comparison between the production projected in a spreadsheet prepared shortly before the acquisition of Claimant by Antofagasta in February 2006 and the production projected in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, he concluded that the amount of recoverable copper and gold had not increased but in fact even decreased between 2006 and 2011 and that production projections were nearly the same while production costs increased. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Burrows illustrated this comparison in the following table:2160\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 16-Feb-06 Projections | 2011 Base Case Study | 2011 Expansion Case Study |\n| Mine Startup | 1-Jan-13 | 15-Nov-17 | 15-Nov-17 |\n| Mine Life (Years) | 45 | 56 | 35 |\n|  |\n| Projected Ore Milled - LOM (Million Tonnes) | 2,340 | 2,219 | 2,523 |\n| Projected Copper Production - LOM (Million Tonnes) | 11.9 | 10.3 | 11.4 |\n| Projected Gold Production - LOM (Million Troy Oz.) 18.7 13.6 14.7 |\n|  |\n| Expected Initial Capex (2011 $US billion) | $1.8 | $3.9 | $3.9 |\n| Expected Expansion Capex (2011 $US billion) | $2.6 |\n| Expected Sustaining Capex (2011 $US billion) | $1.8 $2.7 | $2.4 |\n| Expected Total Capex (2011 $US billion) | $3.7 $6.6 $9.0 |\n|  |\n| Expected Cash Cost (2011 $US/lb Cu Equivalent) | $0.96 | $1.20 | $1.17 |\n| Projected Cash Cost Less By-product Gold (2011 $US/lb Cu) | -$0.16 | $0.46 | $0.43 |\n\nBurrows Presentation, p. 5.\n\n1728.\n\nProf. Davis, on the other hand, pointed out that the projection of the Expansion PreFeasibility Study included only measured and indicated resources whereas the 2006 spreadsheet had largely consisted of inferred resources. He pointed out that, as the Tribunal already noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the amounts of measured / indicated resources and inferred resources increased between 2006 and 2011, which he illustrated in a direct comparison at the Hearing on Quantum:2161\n\nDavis Presentation, p. 49.\n\n1729.\n\nDuring his examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Burrows was pointed to an interview he had given in 2014 on the role of economics in disputes involving mining operations in which he had stated with regard to the valuation of mineral properties:\n\n\"*Mineral properties vary enormously by factors such as the nature of the resource base, including depth, type of mineralization, hard rock vs. soft rock, and ore, grade and presence of contaminants. Other factors affecting mineral properties include operating costs, stage of development such as early exploration vs. partially-developed projects, amount of proven and probable reserves and measures, indicated and inferred resources, type of mining and processing technology, tax environments and remaining concession lives*.\"2162\n\n**Exhibit CE-1439**, p. 5.\n\n1730.\n\nDr. Burrows testified that the factors he had listed in the interview were \"*not significantly*\" different for Reko Diq between 2006 and 2011.2163 Specifically with regard to the amount of measured and indicated resources, his testimony was as follows:\n\n\"Q. \u2026 *Now, am I right that the amount of Measured and Indicated Resources and the amount of Inferred Resources doubled from 2006 to 2011?*\n\n*A. In terms of what they reported, the issue is what did they know was there? And here, if you're just looking--if you're just doing a paper study and you're comparing two projects and all you have is what was reported, it would look different. But here we know from facts and circumstances that the Parties had a good grasp at what was there in 2006, that there was no real change.*\n\n*Q. Sorry; but you accept in your article where you're giving an interview--you say the amount of Reserves and Resources matters to comparability; right?*\n\n*A. It's one of the things being looked at, and I just explained why in this case it's not relevant. The expected size of the project didn't change.*\n\n*Q. So, if--so, in your view, it wasn't--it's not a relevant distinction that at the time of the 2006 transaction, it only had, let's say, half of the Measured and Indicated Resources that it had then in 2011?*\n\n*That's not relevant?*\n\n*A. What would be relevant is if the knowledge of what was there changed significantly between 2006 and 2011. What you're talking about is what they were able to report, not what they expected*.\"2164\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2812 lines 9-11.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2813 line 7 to p. 2814 line 12.\n\n1731.\n\nThen asked about the importance of \"*the level of confidence that you have into what you know*\" in the mining industry, Dr. Burrows expressed the opinion that it was \"*an example of a nonsystematic risk which isn't priced in the financial markets*.\" He did not dispute that level of confidence was one of the characteristics that moved a project from one development stage to the other but noted that \"*the other thing that is going to have to moved from one stage to another is you spent money*\" for which he had accounted in his calculation. He maintained that the level of confidence \"*actually doesn't improve the economic value unless it changes the expected value*.\"2165 Dr. Burrows acknowledged that this sounded rather circular but confirmed:\n\n\"*Q.* \u2026 [A]*re you really testifying that moving the property from Mineral Resource stage with a certain amount of Inferred Resources to a Development Stage property with twice the amount of Measured and Indicated Resources and twice the amount of Inferred Resources added no value worthy of an adjustment in your approach?*\n\n*A. I believe because of the facts and circumstances of this deposit, there was a value increase. I measured it at USD 88 million. But just simply changing the words on how you describe it didn't add value because the Parties \u2026 didn't change their expectations about the output between those two dates*.\"2166\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2814 line 13 to p. 2815 line 19.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2815 line 20 to p. 2816 line 20.\n\n1732.\n\nDr. Burrows confirmed that his opinion regarding the knowledge and understanding of the resource base that Antofagasta had at the time it acquired Claimant was based on a spreadsheet prepared in February 2006. He clarified with regard to the origin of the spreadsheet that in his first report he had not been aware of the source of the spreadsheet, which had been \"*handed over as part of a set of documents that were represented by Antofagasta's documents showing how they valued the property*.\" After Prof. Davis had referred to it as an Antofagasta document in his second report, he had assumed this to be correct. Dr. Burrows added that \"[w]*e have since learned that the document was prepared by an analyst, but that doesn't really change anything, in my mind. Analysts get their information from the company. I was a CEO of a public company for 10 years, so I know how it works. Analysts don't go off and do a whole lot of research on their own*.\"2167 Dr. Burrows considered that \"*when this analyst got this data, he obviously had somehow got information. How he got it, I don't know, probably somebody in the company told him*.\" He denied that this was speculation on his part, rather calling it \"*an informed judgment based on my experience with analysts*.\" Dr. Burrows confirmed that when he prepared his second report he had been \"*under the mistaken impression \u2026 that this was an Antofagasta document*\" but maintained: \"*If I had known at the time it was an analyst's document, I think I would have reached the same conclusions, because it has very detailed information after 45 years, on a number of factors that the analyst didn't just make up*.\"2168 He clarified that he was \"*not speculating that the analyst was involved in the purchase. I'm just saying from my experience with analysts' work, they talk to the company. The companies will usually help them a bit, and he was able to produce an analysis. It was remarkably close to what the actual plan was four years later*.\"2169\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2818 line 5 to p. 2821 line 10.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2821 line 16 to p. 2825 line 6.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2826 line 18 to p. 2827 line 2.\n\n1733.\n\nBased on the explanations provided by Dr. Burrows in his reports and in his oral testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal is not convinced by Dr. Burrows' arguments as to why he considered that no adjustment was warranted to account for the increased level of confidence regarding the resource estimates at Reko Diq. Besides the fact that it became clear at the Hearing that the spreadsheet on which Dr. Burrows had relied in making his comparison was not prepared by Antofagasta itself but rather by an analyst who may or may not have received information from Antofagasta beyond the publicly available information at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that the considerable increase of measured / indicated resources and inferred resources was entirely irrelevant to the valuation of the project. As pointed out by Prof. Davis, the estimates of contained copper and gold increased from 2006 to 2011 as follows:2170\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **2006** | **2011** |\n| **Inferred** |\n| Contained Cu (lbs.) | 11,517,333,333 | 22,381,333,333 |\n| Contained Au (troy oz.) | 10,636,107 | 15,553,119 |\n| **Indicated** |\n| Contained Cu (lbs.) | 15,1333,333,333 | 10,757,333,333 |\n| Contained Au (troy oz.) | 8,774,302 | 7,388,886 |\n| **Measured** |\n| Contained Cu (lbs.) | 0 | 20,525,333,333 |\n| Contained Au (troy oz.) | 0 | 15,715,966 |\n\nDavis II, Workpaper R-24.\n\n1734.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Dr. Burrows' argument that an increased level of confidence is relevant only if it also increases the amount of projected production. Again besides the uncertainty as to whether the spreadsheet on which Dr. Burrows based his comparison of projected production between 2006 and 2011 indeed reflected internal estimates made by Antofagasta at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it likely that a buyer determining the fair market value of the project in 2011 would not attach any value to an increased level of confidence into the fact that the resource is actually there and that the projected quantities of production are technically and economically feasible. Between 2006 and 2011, Claimant carried out significant amounts of exploration work, completed a Scoping Study, an Initial Mine Development Pre-Feasibility Study, the Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. As reflected in the resource estimates set out above, Claimant thereby managed to achieve a significantly increased level of confidence regarding the resource base at Reko Diq which is reflected particularly in the estimate of measured resources. As pointed out by Claimant, Dr. Burrows himself explained in an article outside this arbitration that the stage of development and the amount of measured, indicated and inferred resources are among the factors affecting the value of mineral properties.\n\n1735.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced by Dr. Burrows' testimony that he fully accounted for the increase in value created by the work carried out by Claimant by adding the amount of projected expenditures to his adjusted transaction value. Besides the fact that the Tribunal is not convinced by the basis for Dr. Burrows' decision to recognize only the amount projected in the 2006 analyst spreadsheet rather than the amount of USD 219 million that Claimant actually spent on its further exploration work, the Tribunal also does not find it plausible that the work carried out by Claimant increased the value of the project only by the amount of (projected) expenditures. Dr. Burrows maintained at the Hearing on Quantum that \"[y]*ou wouldn't expect to get more than the money you spent on it, unless you made some discovery that wasn't known before*\"2171 and that Claimant \"*did work that didn't change the expected value*\" but only \"[r]*educed the risk somewhat*\" which, however, did not add value because it concerned only asymmetric risk.2172 At the same time, however, Dr. Burrows confirmed that \"[t]*he property was further advanced between 2006 and 2011*\" and also agreed that the distinction between mineral resource stage and development stage had some meaningful significance in the mining industry.2173 In the Tribunal's view, it is not plausible that this transition would have an impact on value only if \"*some discovery*\" is made but not to account for an increased level of confidence that the discovered resources exist and can be economically extracted from the ground. In addition, the Tribunal is also not convinced that even on Dr. Burrows' argument, no such \"*discovery*\" was made. As pointed out by Prof. Davis and already noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the amount of inferred, indicated and measured resources nearly doubled between early 2006 and mid-2009. Dr. Burrows' explanation as to why he does not consider this development a value-increasing \"*discovery*\" does not convince the Tribunal.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2775 lines 1-3.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2778 lines 15-19.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2783 lines 5-12.\n\n1736.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal believes that Dr. Burrows did not adequately account for the increase in value created by the additional exploration work carried out by Claimant between 2006 and 2009 as well as the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies completed by Claimant in 2009 and 2010. Given that Dr. Burrows has not made any adjustment besides the addition of projected expenditures in this regard, the Tribunal considers that his value estimate cannot serve to help identifying or verifying the fair market value of the project as of the valuation date.\n\n1737.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore also does not consider it necessary to examine the several additional areas of disagreement between the Parties' experts in further detail. In particular, the Tribunal does not see the need to make a finding on the appropriateness of the adjustments that Dr. Burrows has made to account for increased prices and costs as well as for country risk. It suffices to note at this point that, as criticized by Prof. Davis, the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows appear to be rather general and detached from any project-specific considerations as they are largely based on mining indices and the sovereign yield spread of Pakistan. Specifically with regard to the latter, the Tribunal has already set out above why it is not convinced that the sovereign yield spread reflects the country-related risks faced by the project in the present circumstances. In the present context, the Tribunal specifically does not consider it established that the sovereign spread reflected the perception of country risk that Claimant's owners included in the purchase price they were willing to pay in 2006 or that the spread's increase reflected an increase in the country risk as perceived by a buyer of the project in 2011. More generally, the Tribunal is not convinced that Dr. Burrows' adjustments, which, beyond the projected start of construction and the project's location in Pakistan, did not take into account any project-specific factors, would result in a more adequate estimate of the project's fair market value than the very project-specific risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis in his modern DCF model.\n\n1738.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal also does not consider it necessary to explore in further detail whether the market-based approach used by Dr. Burrows would have been considered a relevant indication of value by a buyer. The Tribunal only notes that Dr. Burrows confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that, contrary to what was indicated in his first report, he had been \"*instructed to determine the value based on the 2006 transaction*\" and was \"*not instructed to look at other potential avenues for valuing*\" as \"*another Expert \u2026 was looking at DCF*.\"2174 He also testified:\n\n\"*Q.* \u2026 [A]*m I right that, in all those decades you have been consulting with minerals companies, you have never seen them make any major investment decision based on a comparable transaction analysis?*\n\n*A. I think that's pretty true.*\n\n*Q. And every major investment decision you have seen a mining company make has been based on Discounted Cash Flow analysis; right?*\n\n*A. Well, at least the ones I've been involved in that I've seen or that I've seen in my work. I think companies will use comparable numbers to screen acquisitions, but when they get an actual one, they usually use a DCF, if they can.*\n\n*Q. Well, no. I want to be precise about this, that you have never seen any major investment decision made on the basis of a comparable; right?*\n\n*A. Except as a confirmation.*\n\n*Q. And every single instance will be based on discounted Present Value; right?*\n\n*A. Usually, yes.*\n\n*Q. No. Every single instance that you've seen; right?*\n\n*A. Yes. Yes*.\"2175\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2789 lines 8-11 and p. 2796 lines 20-21.\n\nTranscript Hearing (Day 9), p. 2837 line 22 to p. 2839 line 1.\n\n1739.\n\nWhile Dr. Burrows testified that he had seen the use of comparable transaction analysis \"*as a confirmation*\" of a DCF analysis, his testimony was very clear as to the prevalence of income-based valuation methods in valuing mining projects. In the Tribunal's view, this confirms its conclusion that the valuation performed by Dr. Burrows, which did not account for any increase in value created by Claimant's work after 2006, cannot serve to call into question the result reached on the basis of Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation model. More specifically, the Tribunal considers that there is a reasonable explanation for the deviation between the values yielded by the two valuations and therefore does not see any basis for revisiting the conclusion it has reached on the value of Claimant's investment above.\n\n**c. Conclusion on the Verification of the Tribunal's Conclusion on the Value of Claimant's Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1740.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the results yielded by the other valuation or evaluation methods relied on by Respondent's experts or contemporaneously applied by TCCA do not warrant any adjustments to the conclusion that the Tribunal has reached on the basis of Prof. Davis' modern DCF valuation model above.\n\n1741.\n\nAs a final point, the Tribunal considers that this result is also in line with generally recognized principles of valuation as referred to in the second sentence of Article 7(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal found above that it is not required to resort to those principles, which are set out in that sentence as additional criteria for determining the market value of Claimant's investment, because the value can be \"*readily ascertained*\" on the basis of the Prof. Davis' valuation model. The Tribunal nevertheless decided to take due account of those principles of valuation. Based on all of the considerations set out above, the Tribunal is, in particular, convinced that the compensation awarded to Claimant is also reconcilable with the amount of capital invested by Claimant. As discussed in its assessment of the market-based valuation presented by Dr. Burrows, the Tribunal considers it plausible that by investing an amount of over USD 240 million into the exploration of Reko Diq and by creating a detailed plan on how to economically extract the minerals from the ground, as reflected in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Claimant has significantly increased the value of the project. The Tribunal has not accepted Dr. Burrows' suggestion that the value would increase only by the amount invested. It rather follows the economically sound argument that by increasing the geologic certainty of the resource and, more generally, by decreasing the risks affecting future cash flows that can be obtained from the project, Claimant raised the value of its investment by far more than the amount of capital invested. In the Tribunal's view, this increase of value is captured by Prof. Davis' income-based valuation methodology; it is not captured by Dr. Burrows' backward-looking, market-based approach and it is also not captured by the \u2013 equally backward-looking \u2013 assessment of the amount of capital invested.\n\n1742.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal maintains its conclusion that for the reasons set out in detail above, the value of Claimant's investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.\n\n**G. Pre-award and Post-award Interest**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1743.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address Claimant's request for an award of pre-award and post-award interest on the amount of compensation owed to it by Respondent.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1744.\n\nClaimant submits that the principle of full reparation requires that it be awarded pre-award and post-award compound interest at Respondent's borrowing cost. Claimant notes that Respondent accepts the necessity to award pre-award and post-award interest and the compensatory function of interest but argues that, while the compensatory function is indeed \"*the primary function of interest at international law*,\" tribunals have a \"*wide margin of discretion in awarding interest*\" and should also take into account two further functions of interest, *i.e*., to \"*prevent unjust enrichment of the respondent*\" and to \"*ensure efficiency in the arbitral process*.\"2176\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 508-509; Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 379-380, 386-387, *referring to* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 435 *and quoting from* *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v.

Argentina* and *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile* \"*adopt rates of 6% and 5% as reasonable*.\"2178 By contrast, Claimant considers the risk-free rate proposed by Respondent, which corresponds to an annualized compound rate of 0.3% and is thus considerably lower than the US inflation rate (corresponding to an annualized compound rate of 1.5%), \"*plainly unreasonable*\" as it would result in an award worth less on the award date, in real inflation-adjusted terms, than on the valuation date.2179 In its view, the rate proposed by Respondent is contrary to the principle of full reparation and ignores commercial reality as well as the risks that Claimant was forced to bear; in addition, it would ignore the two additional functions of interest, *i.e*., the prevention of unjust enrichment and efficiency.2180\n\nClaimant's Quantum Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 512, *referring to* *Victor Pey Casado and Fundation \"Presidente Allende\" v.

Claimant agrees that it would be \"*improper to compensate for the litigation risk*\" but maintains that the rate it has proposed does not incorporate such risk but only reflects the default risk which remains in the post-award period and for which Claimant should be compensated in both periods.2182\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 392-397 and note 573, *referring to* **Exhibit BW-58**, pp. 147-148 *and* Michael S.

Claimant further rejects the tribunal's reasoning that accounting for default risk would be aimed at repairing a hypothetical breach of the ICSID Convention. Claimant maintains that it aims at \"*fully compensating TCCA for the risk that it was actually forced to bear because of Pakistan's breaches of the Treaty*.\"2183\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 398-400, *referring to Vested Group Ltd. v.

Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1757.\n\nRespondent submits that under the applicable rules of international law, any interest awarded should be simple and accrue at a risk-free rate such as the one-month US Treasury bills. According to Respondent, any higher rate would reward Claimant for risks to which the assets being valued were not exposed after the valuation date or \"*simply contradict the applicable law*.\"2195\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 364; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 416.\n\n1758.\n\nRespondent contends that pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Treaty, \"[o]*nly commercial interest at a risk-free rate should accrue as from the valuation date*.\"2196 Respondent notes that the language used in Article 7(3), i.e., \"*at a commercial reasonable rate*,\" also appears in Article 1110(4) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and submits that these and similar clauses have led tribunals to effectively award interest at a risk-free rate. Specifically, Respondent refers to the tribunal in *ADM v. Mexico* which awarded \"*the simple interest rate for U.S. Treasury bills*,\" the tribunal in *SD Myers v. Canada* which fixed interest at the rate applicable to the investor's receivables in Canadian dollars, and the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina* which considered \"*the average rate of interest applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit*\" appropriate.2197 Respondent adds that the application of US Treasury bond rates was also endorsed by various other tribunals.2198\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 365.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 421-425, *quoting from* *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

After all, had the plaintiff received Y at time 0 [the time of the event], it would have invested the funds, receiving presumably its average rate of return. Hence, by time t, the plaintiff would have had Yert [i.e., Y plus compounded continuous returns at a rate equal to r during period t], so this is the amount that would make it whole. Another version of this argument would compensate the plaintiff at the rate it reasonably expected to earn on the destroyed asset.*\n\n*The fallacy here (in either version) has to do with risk. The plaintiff's opportunity cost of capital includes a return that compensates the plaintiff for the average risk it bears. But, in depriving the plaintiff of an asset worth Y at time 0, the defendant also relieved it of the risks associated with investment in that asset. The plaintiff is thus entitled to interest compensating it for the time value of money, but it is not also entitled to compensation for the risks it did not bear. Hence prejudgment interest should be awarded at the risk-free interest rate*.\"2199\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 366; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 430, *quoting from* Fisher and Romaine, *Janis Joplin's Yearbook and the Theory of Damages*, 5 Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance 145 (1990), p. 146. (**Exhibit BW-58**), *and referring to* Brailovsky/Wells I, \u00b6 174;\n\n1760.\n\nRespondent also refers to its experts who explain in their second report that \"[t]*he central point is clear:* 'The plaintiff should not be compensated (positively or negatively) for risks he or she did not bear.'\" *Similarly, Mark Kantor, in his book on valuation, agrees with this position:* 'The interest rate used for bringing historical amounts forward will clearly not contain the same risk factors as the discount rate used to present value future amounts. As a practical matter, the interest rate used for the historical amount is often a 'risk-free' rate (such as the rate for US Treasuries).' *Brattle's choices of rates are exactly the opposite of what economic theory dictates, and what the authors quoted above favor*.\"2200\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6 191.\n\n1761.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent considers that Claimant requests \"*an additional outrageous compensation of between USD 750 million and 7.5 billion as interest,*\" with its primary request for interest at Pakistan' borrowing rate amounting to over USD 2.3 billion or 25.5% of its total damages claim.2201 According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to provide any valid explanation as to why the Tribunal should award interest at a rate \"*that accrues monies to TCC's benefit so extraordinarily and disproportionately*\" instead of at the risk-free rate, which \"*is the criterion favored by scholars, legal materials and a large number of prior, persuasive decisions*.\"2202\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 367, *referring to* Davis II, Table 12; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 416.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 417.\n\n1762.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent considers that the use of a risk-free rate such as US Treasury bond rates is supported by the tribunals in *Vestey v. Venezuela*, *Unglaube v. Costa Rica* and \"*an extensive number of other international tribunals*.\"2203 It quotes from the *Unglaube* tribunal which held:\n\n\"*One well-recognized approach to determining the applicable interest rate was established by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran where it focused on developing a rate 'based approximately on the amount that the successful claimant would have been in the position to have earned if it had been paid in time and thus had the funds Treaty Art. 4(2). Additionally, the German Model BIT refers in the same section to the 'usual bank interest rate' available to invest in a form of commercial investment in common use in its own country. Such an approach was also adopted in Santa Elena.*\n\n*The Sylvania Technical Systems tribunal ultimately decided to use the rate from six-month United States certificates of deposit. Similarly, in other cases such as LG&E and CMS v. Argentina, the interest rate used was that applicable to short-term United States Treasury Bills. Both instruments have been chosen by tribunals because they reflect conservative rates for essentially risk-free investments. It is also worth noting that such rates have been used in cases, like British Gas v. Argentina and Siemens v. Argentina, which did not involve the U.S. government or U.S. companies.*\n\n*Although some tribunals apply an interest rate based on the requirements of the host State's domestic law, this is not the prevailing practice under international law. Additionally, commentators maintain that, '[t]he host-country-law approach has been criticized on the basis that where State\u201fs international responsibility is engaged, the award of interest should follow the rules of international law' rather than domestic law. Furthermore, in looking back to the investment alternatives approach from Sylvania Technical Systems, it is rational to conclude that an appropriate interest rate may be based on the 'deposit rate\u2026 commonly used in the country of the currency in which payment is to be made.' Interest rates from such instruments reflect the risk-free investments that investors were impeded from making with their property as a result of the expropriation*.\"2204\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 419, *referring to* *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/04, Award (15 April 2006), \u00b6 472.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 419, *quoting from* *Marion Unglaube v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/1, Award (16 May 2012), \u00b6 321.\n\n1763.\n\nIn Respondent's view, it is also contradictory that Claimant claims that its investment should be valued applying only a risk-free discount rate but then requests that additional risks should be added to the pre-award interest rate, \"*the only area of the valuation for which the prevailing literature actually considers that no risks exist*.\" Respondent quotes a legal commentary stating that \"[t]*he interest rate used for bringing historical amounts forward will clearly not contain the same risk factors as the discount rate used to present value future amounts. As a practical matter, the interest rate used for the historical amount is often a 'risk-free' rate (such as the rate for US Treasuries) or a statutory rate for pre-judgment interest.*\"2205\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 367-368, *quoting from* Mark Kantor, Valuation for Arbitration: Compensation Standards, p. 42 (**Exhibit BW-55**) *and referring to* *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

More specifically, Respondent argues that \"[a] *final award is not subject to any type of risk. The amount awarded is not subject to any changes, i.e. increases or reductions in principal amount, until effective payment. None of the risk elements of an investment are replicated in a tribunal's determination of compensation*.\"2206 In Respondent's view, Prof. Davis adopted the same opinion in *Bear Creek v. Peru* where he argued that \"[t]*he question whether compensation for risk is appropriate, and therefore whether a spread above the risk-free rate should be included in the pre-award interest, hinges on legal questions of when the liability is created and whether certain risks are best characterized as financial risks or litigation risks.*\"2207\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 459; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 427.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 460; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 431, *quoting from Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Quantum of Damages Analysis, Prepared by Graham A. Davis, Ph.D. and Florian A. Dorobantu, Ph.D., 6 October 2015, \u00b6 191.\n\n1765.\n\nRespondent argues that contrary to Prof. Davis' description of Claimant as a \"*forced creditor*,\" any amount of damages awarded \"*is not being loaned on the same risky terms as those under which bondholders may extend credit to Pakistan*\" but rather \"*awarded pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention*.\" Respondent claims that \"[b]*ecause there is no risk of not collecting a valid damages award, TCC is not entitled to a rate of interest that compensates it for both the time value of money and default risk*.\" Respondent also emphasizes that Claimant did not bear the risk associated with alternative investments and should therefore not be entitled to the returns commensurate with those risks as it would be speculative ro assume that such returns would actually have been earned.2208\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 428-429.\n\n1766.\n\nWith regard to Prof. Davis' calculation of pre-award interest at five different rates, *i.e*.: (i) 14% flat; (ii) US prime rate + 2%, compounded; (iii) Pakistan's short-term credit default swap rate, compounded; (iv) US inflation rate, compounded; and (v) the risk-free US Treasury Bill rate, not compounded that Pakistan proposed, Respondent refers to the explanation provided by its experts that \"*the strategy of Brattle and Claimant appears to be: choose rates in a way that their first choice, the credit default swaps for Pakistan, sits in the middle of the set. For that, they selected two outrageously high rates, one that is lower than their choice (although it is not even an interest rate), and list the rate we propose at the bottom of the table. The message is apparently intended to be that their rate is 'reasonable' or 'conservative', and ours is extreme.*\"2209\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 455-456, *quoting from* Brailovsky/Wells II, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\n1767.\n\nRespondent submits that the interest rate must be determined according to the currency of payment of the obligation, i.e. US dollars, and argues that by contrast, \"*Claimant's claim of an interest rate equal to Pakistan's cost of borrowing would seem to indicate a rate which is designed to apply to sums borrowed in local currency*.\" In Respondent's view, this also addresses Claimant's argument that the risk-free rate is below the rate of inflation because \"[t]*o the extent that TCC made its claim in US dollars, it is impossible to assign hypothetical risks of inflation or devaluation of the local currency of Pakistan, which has nothing to do with the currency in which the compensation was requested*.\"2210\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 457, 461-462; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 418.\n\n1768.\n\nSpecifically with regard to Claimant's argument that the risk-free rate would create the wrong incentives, Respondent quotes from the tribunal in *Vestey v. Venezuela*, which held that the \"*Tribunal does not find it appropriate for it to assume by anticipation that a sovereign state will breach a treaty obligation. Having said this, even if the assumption were made, it would in any event not justify an interest rate incorporating the risk of defaulting on the payment of the award. Indeed, accounting for this risk would mean seeking to repair a (hypothetical) breach of the ICSID Convention when this Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to breaches of the BIT*.\"2211 Respondent argues that \"*the Tribunal cannot prejudge or even assume that Pakistan will not fulfill its duty to pay an obligation*\" and rejects the suggestion that to award interest at a rate lower than Pakistan's borrowing rate would incentivize it to violate international investment treaties or to delay the resolution of investment disputes.2212\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 463, *quoting from* *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/04, Award (15 April 2006), \u00b6 445; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 433.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 432.\n\n1769.\n\nRespondent also refers to the holding of the *Vestey* tribunal:\n\n\"*The function of reparation is to compensate the victim for its actual losses. It is not to reward it for risks which it does not bear. As the Claimant itself argues, the award should reestablish the situation which would in all probability have existed but for the wrongful measures. As the Parties agree on the Valuation Date, the 'but for' scenario involves placing [the claimant party] in the position in which it would have been if it had received compensation on that date. In that case, [that claimant] would have been able to make use of the funds received as compensation. At no point in that scenario would [that claimant] have borne the risk of [the respondent State]'s sovereign default. The Claimant argues that '[a]n award of interest at a rate lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for states to 'refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding compensation for internationally wrongful acts'. However, reparation focuses on making the victim whole; it is not concerned with the possible enrichment of the Respondent. As the SPP tribunal stressed, 'the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant's loss rather than the defendant's gain*.'\"2213\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 434, *quoting from* *Vestey Group Ltd. v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1778.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis on interest, the Tribunal notes that while Claimant relies on the principle of full reparation as the applicable standard of compensation, Respondent refers to the expropriation provision of the Treaty and, in the context of interest, specifically to Article 7(3). In its analysis of the legal standards governing Claimant's claim for compensation, the Tribunal has determined that if the market value of Claimant's investment can be \"*readily ascertained*\" based on the evidence and valuation methods before it, there is no need to decide whether this result is based on the compensation provision in Article 7(2) of the Treaty or a compensation standard under customary international law. As set out in detail above, the Tribunal has determined the market value of Claimant's investment based on the modern DCF valuation method applied by Prof. Davis. Consequently, the Tribunal did not have to make a conclusive finding on the applicable standard of compensation.\n\n1779.\n\nAs for the standard to determine the applicable interest rate, Respondent relies on Article 7(3) of the Treaty, which provides with regard to interest:\n\n\"*The compensation \u2026 shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date the measures were taken to the date of payment* \u2026\"2224\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Article 7(3).\n\n1780.\n\nClaimant refers to the principle of full reparation under customary international law. As both Parties have referred to the Commentary to Article 38 of the ILC Articles in the context of their submissions on interest, this provision may also be quoted as reflective of the standard under customary international law:\n\n\"*1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.*\n\n*2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled*.\"2225\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B. INT'L L. COMM'N (2001), VOL. II, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2) [CA-1], Article 38.\n\n1781.\n\nWhile the Parties are in dispute as to the applicable standard of compensation, there is common ground with regard to interest to the extent that: (i) Claimant is entitled to payment of interest from the date of Respondent's Treaty breaches until the date of payment of the award, *i.e*., pre-award and post award interest; and (ii) interest has a compensatory function, *i.e*., it is aimed at complementing the amount of compensation to which Claimant is entitled for the losses it has incurred as a result of Respondent's breaches. Respondent explicitly confirms that \"*the appropriate interest rate must be determined only with a view to appropriately compensate the creditor*.\"2226 Claimant also confirms that \"[t]*he compensatory function is the primary function of interest at international law.*\"2227\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 435.\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 387.\n\n1782.\n\nClaimant further refers to a \"*wide margin of discretion in awarding interest*\" and argues that two additional functions of interest should inform the Tribunal's discretion, *i.e*., the aim \"*to prevent unjust enrichment of the respondent at the expense of the claimant*\" and \"*to promote efficiency.*\"2228 The Tribunal does not consider it established, however, that the interest rate is the proper means to address either of these considerations.\n\nJohn Y. Gotanda, \"Interest,\" in International Investment Law (Bungenberg et al. eds. 2015) [CA-437], p. 1143.\n\n1783.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the entire exercise of valuating Claimant's investment has been aimed at determining the amount of compensation that corresponds to the damage that Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches. This assessment did not look at a possible enrichment from which Pakistan may have benefitted as a result of these same actions but only at the damage incurred by Claimant which has to be compensated. In the Tribunal's view, it would be inconsistent if a different perspective were to be taken to determine the applicable interest rate. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Vestey v. Venezuela*, which held that \"*reparation focuses on making the victim whole; it is not concerned with the possible enrichment of the Respondent. As the SPP tribunal stressed,* 'the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant's loss rather than the defendant's gain.'\"2229\n\n*Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/04, Award of 15 April 2006 [RLA-402], \u00b6 440.\n\n1784.\n\nGiven the Parties' agreement on the compensatory function of interest under both of the standards of compensation on which they have relied, the Tribunal believes that in the present case, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on the applicable standard of compensation because it is possible to determine an interest rate that is both \"*commercially reasonable*\" as required by Article 7(3) of the Treaty and ensures full reparation of the damage that Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent's breaches as required under customary international law.\n\n1785.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that with regard to the appropriate interest rate, neither Party has argued that a distinction should be drawn between pre-award and post-award interest. Consequently, the Tribunal will determine a uniform interest rate which applies from the date of Respondent's Treaty breaches, *i.e*., 15 November 2011, until the date on which Claimant receives payment of the amount of compensation that Respondent is ordered to pay to it pursuant to this Award.\n\n1786.\n\nTable 12 of Prof. Davis' report, which was updated shortly before the Hearing on Quantum, shows the two rates proposed by Claimant (primarily [1]; in the alternative [2]), and the rate proposed by Respondent [3] as well the rate of US inflation [4] and a rate which, according to Claimant, is routinely awarded by Pakistani courts [5]:2230\n\nDavis Reply Report Table 12 (Updated).

As for line [4], Claimant does not contend that the US inflation rate is an interest rate but has rather presented this rate in support of its argument that the rate proposed by Respondent is significantly below the rate of inflation in the United States. As for line [5], labelled \"*Pakistan simple interest at 14%*,\" Claimant does not actually request that this rate be applied in the present case but has rather referred to it in response to Respondent's reliance on Pakistani law with regard to the question of compound interest. As will be discussed in more detail below, the Tribunal is of the view that the interest rate applicable to Claimant's compensation for losses incurred as a result of Respondent's breaches of the Treaty must be determined on the basis of international law and not domestic Pakistani law. For this reason, the Tribunal will not refer any further to the interest rate in line [5].\n\n1789.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a considerable part of both Parties' submissions on interest concerns the question whether Claimant bears, and should thus be compensated for, the risk of Pakistan's default as a result of the fact that Claimant has not received the amount of compensation on 15 November 2011 but will receive payment only at a future point in time after this Award. While Claimant argues that its position is that of a \"*forced*\" creditor and that it has borne and continues to bear Pakistan's default risk just like other creditors of the State,2232 Respondent claims that \"*there is no risk of not collecting a valid damages award*\" rendered pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.2233\n\n*See, e.g*., Claimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 383.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 428.\n\n1790.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary in the present case to express a conclusive opinion on this point. The Tribunal has already determined above that interest has compensatory function, *i.e*., it serves to complement the compensation to which Claimant is entitled for the losses it has incurred as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches. The relevant question is thus whether and in what amount Claimant would likely have achieved a return on the amount of compenssation if it had received such amount on 15 November 2011. As will be set out in more detail below, the Tribunal considers that this compensatory function, which applies under both compensation standards relied on by the Parties, is fulfilled by awarding interest at a rate that serves as a proxy for the borrowing costs of Claimant's owners. While an argument could be made that the interest rate should in any event not fall below Pakistan's borrowing rate, this question does not arise in the present case because the rate that the Tribunal determines to be applicable below exceeds Pakistan's borrowing rate. Consequently, Claimant's arguments that Respondent would lack an incentive to pay the award and that Claimant should be compensated for having to bear Pakistan's default risk until payment is made can be considered moot.\n\n1791.\n\nAs to the applicable compensatory considerations, it appears to be undisputed between the Parties and their experts that it would not be appropriate to award interest at a rate of return that Claimant might have been able to achieve if it had invested the amount, most likely in the mining business, because that investment would have been associated with risks that Claimant did not actually bear. Prof. Davis specifically stated in his second report that he \"*did not calculate interest at Claimant's opportunity cost of capital and did not suggest Claimant should be awarded their cost of capital \u2026 which the authors* [of a publication relied on by Respondent's experts] *argue would inappropriately compensate Claimant for a risk it did not bear*.\"2234 At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Wells emphasized in response to the question whether the cost of capital or average rate of return would be the relevant benchmark that \"[i]*f you invest it in something that you think is going to yield a higher Rate of Return, that's because there is risk attached to it. There is no risk attached to the money for the Award*.\"2235\n\nDavis II, \u00b6 356.\n\nTranscript Hearing on Quantum (Day 9), p. 2742 lines 10-14.\n\n1792.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement between the experts, the Tribunal will therefore not aim at determining an interest rate reflecting Claimant's cost of capital or the average rate of return that it might have achieved. However, the fact remains that Claimant is entitled to compensation for the expropriation and other Treaty breaches that have occurred on 15 November 2011. While it may be speculative to make assumptions as to the returns that Claimant or its owners might have achieved by investing this amount and the risk that would have been associated with such an alternative investment, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently likely and in line with basic economic considerations that Claimant or its owners would have put this money to use for the business they are involved in. Given the undisputed opportunities to achieve high returns in the mining business and the undisputed risks associated with these opportunities, the Tribunal is not convinced that the application of a risk-free rate, as an approximation of the returns that Claimant could have made from making a risk-free investment, would adequately capture the damage that Claimant has incurred. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that the amount of compensation was not available to Claimant and its owners as of November 2011 can rather be considered captured in their own borrowing costs, *i.e*., the cost for having to borrow the amount of money that should have been, but was not, made available to Claimant in November 2011. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the relevant borrowing costs are those of Antofagasta and Barrick, *i.e*., the companies which had undisputedly paid for the exploration work and (pre-)feasibility studies and which would have contributed the required amounts of equity into the project if it had proceeded to the construction and mining operations stage.\n\n1793.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimant, the \"*borrowing rate*\" approach was put forward by Judge Holtzmann in his Separate Opinion in *Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran*. While the majority of the tribunal had found that the interest rate should be \"*based approximately on the amount that the successful claimant would have been in a position to have earned if it had been paid in time and thus had the funds available to invest in a form of commercial investment in common use in its own country*\" and concluded that the six-month certificates of deposit in the United States represented such a form of investment,2236 Judge Holtzmann \"*believe*[d] *that using the average rate paid on six-month certificates of deposit in the United States is not unreasonable, but that it would be more appropriate to base the Tribunals interest rate on the prime rate during the relevant period. In his view, it is reasonable to assume that most businesses habitually borrow while fewer regularly invest in certificates of deposit. Moreover, although the prime rate is not applicable to all businesses, it is generally representative because the difference between it and other lending rates is relatively small. In contrast, the six-month deposit rate is less representative because of the wide range of possible uses that businesses make of their funds and the relatively large differences in the rates of return on such uses*.\"2237\n\n*Sylvania Technical Systems, Inc. v. Iran*, Award No. 180-64-1 of 27 June 1985, 8 IRAN-U.S. C.T.R., 298 *et seq.* [CA-449], p. 320.\n\n*Sylvania Technical Systems, Inc. v. Iran*, Award No. 180-64-1 of 27 June 1985, 8 IRAN-U.S. C.T.R., 298 *et seq.* [CA-449], p. 329.\n\n1794.\n\nAs pointed out in an authority addressing the calculation of compensation and damages in international investment law on which Claimant has also relied in the context of interest, the use of the borrowing rate of the claimant as a reference rate for pre-award interest is also reflected in international codifications of contract law such as the the Principle of European Contract Law and the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts. She explained that the prime rate to which these provisions referred \"*represents the interest rate that commercial banks charge their most creditworthy borrowers, such as large corporations*,\" noting that \"[o]*nly a few businesses qualify for the prime rate*.\" She noted that Judge Holtzmann and other decisions of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal usually referred to the US prime rate and identified further investment decisions in which tribunals had applied the US or New York prime rate, in two cases wth a premium of two and three percentage points, respectively, and in other cases with no additional premium.2238 She added:\n\n\"*The* 'prime' *or* 'base' *rate plays an important role in negotiations about company loan conditios in Anglo-American countries. As such, it seems to be an appropriate basis for the assessment of the damages incurred by delayed payment. However, it must be taken into account that not all enterprises can borrow money from the banks at the prime rate so that an increase by a few percentage points might be necessary. The question then arises, how many percentage points are appropriate. The practice of tribunals in not entirely consistent, but the variations remain rather limited. In addition, the prime rate as such fluctuates less than other commercial benchmarks, for example, the LIBOR. These advantages add to the conceptual logic of the application of the prime rate as a proxy for the borrowing rate of the investor*.\"2239\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6\u00b6 6.78-6.89.\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6 6.90.\n\n1795.\n\nThe same authority also stated that \"*one could also think of applying the actual borrowing rate of the investor*\" but noted that \"[i]*t appears, however, very difficult to identify the borrowing rate of the investor*\" and presented possible means of achieving an estimation of that acutal borrowing rate.2240\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6\u00b6 6.91-6.96.\n\n1796.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with the borrowing rate, or an estimation of such rate, for either Antofagasta or Barrick. The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to apply, as the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and several investment treaty tribunals have done, a reasonable approximation of such a borrowing rate. Claimant argues that in that case, the Tribunal should apply the US Prime Rate plus two percentage points, referring to the fact that \"*not all enterprises can borrow money from banks at the prime rate*\" and an aim to achieve \"*a rate that is broadly available to the market*.\" It further argues that the addition of that premium is \"*especially important* '[i]n the present market situation of ultra-low interest rates.'\"2241\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 409.\n\n1797.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, however, the decisive question is not whether the interest rate would be \"*broadly available to the market*\" but rather whether it reasonably reflects the borrowing costs of Claimant's owners which would have funded the project and, thus, the damage caused by the fact that the owed amount of compensation has not been paid on 15 November 2011. Given that Barrick and Antofagasta are undisputedly large and creditworthy companies \u2013 a fact which has played a role in various aspects of the Tribunal's assessment of the concerns raised by Respondent regarding the alleged unfeasibility of the project \u2013 the Tribunal is not convinced that the addition of two percentage points would be appropriate in the present circumstances.\n\n1798.\n\nThe Tribunal also cannot follow the argument that \"*the present market situation of ultra-low interest rates*\" would warrant a different result. As calculated by Prof. Davis, the US Prime Rate plus two percentage points corresponds to an annualized compound rate of 5.6%. This indicates that the US Prime Rate as such is not \"*ultra low*.\" In any event, the statement quoted by Claimant was made by tribunal in *Rusoro v. Venezuela* in the context of assessing a four percent premium to the LIBOR rate, which is not at issue here, and together with its finding that the interest rate should not fall below a minmum of 4% p.a.2242 In the Tribunal's view, this indicates that the base rate considered by the *Rusoro* tribunal was below zero at certain times and is thus not comparable to the base rate at issue in this case.\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award of 22 August 2016 [CA-361], \u00b6 838.\n\n1799.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal is also not convinced that interest at the US Prime Rate with no additional premium is sufficient to compensate Claimant for the damage it has incurred as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches. On balance, the Tribunal therefore concludes that interest should accrue at the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, corresponding to a reasonable approximation of the borrowing cost of Claimant's owners and thus the damage that Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches and the fact that compensation will be paid only after this Award.\n\n1800.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this rate is consistent with both standards of compensation advanced by the Parties, *i.e*., it corresponds to a \"*commercially reasonable*\" rate as required under Article 7(3) of the Treaty and it ensures full reparation as required under customary international law.\n\n1801.\n\nThe final question for the Tribunal to assess is therefore whether interest should be calculated on a compound or simple basis.\n\n1802.\n\nOne of the arguments put forward by Respondent is that under Pakistani law, compound interest is prohibited in the absence of a specific agreement to that effect. It argues that \"*any interpretation that the Australia-Pakistan BIT would lend itself to interpretations that would obliterate that legal prohibition would contradict the object and purpose of the BIT, and should thus be abandoned*.\"2243 The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument, however. It is undisputed between the Parties that the present dispute arises under international law and is to be decided pursuant to the rules of international law, in particular the provisions of the Treaty. The Tribunal also notes that in the context of its submissions on the applicable interest rate, Respondent itself relies on a quote from the reasoning of the tribunal in *Unglaube v. Costa Rica*, which stated, *inter alia*, that \"[a]*lthough some tribunals apply an interest rate based on the requirements of the host State's domestic law, this is not the prevailing practice under international law*. *Additionally, commentators maintain that,* '[t]he host-country-law approach has been criticized on the basis that where State's international responsibility is engaged, the award of interest should follow the rules of international law' *rather than domestic law*.\"2244 It might be worth noting that the commentator from whose book on damages in international law the *Unglaube* tribunal quoted is Dr. Ripinsky, who appeared as legal expert for Respondent in this arbitration. Dr. Ripinsky did not express an opinion on interest in either of his legal opinions.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6 370.\n\n*Marion Unglaube et al. v Costa Rica*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/08/1 and ARB/09/20, Award of 16 May 2012 [RLA-100], \u00b6 323.\n\n1803.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that Respondent itself has not proposed the application of an interest rate applicable under Pakistani law but has rather based its proposal of a risk-free rate based on US Treasury bills on considerations and authorities of international law. In the Tribunal's view, it would be inconsistent, however, to then resort to Pakistani law in order to determine whether that interest, which undisputedly had to be determined in accordance with the rules and principles of international law, shall be calculated on a compound or simple basis. The Tribunal will therefore look to international law to resolve this question as well.\n\n1804.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties to the extent that in earlier decisions, tribunals tended to reject requests for compound interest. Claimant acknowledges that \"*tribunals were historically reluctant to award compound interest*.\"2245 As pointed out by Respondent, the Commentary to Article 38 of the ILC Articles, which dates from 2001, noted that \"[t]*he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest*.\"2246 The Commentary specifically referred to decisions rendered by Iran-US Claims Tribunal in 1984 and 1986, which held that \"*special reasons*\" were required to depart from \"*international precedents which normally do not allow the awarding of compound interest*\" and which, according to Commentary demonstrated that \"[t]*he preponderance of authority thus continues to support the view expressed by Arbitrator Huber in the British Claims in the Spanish Zone of Morocco case*,\" which took place from 1923 to 1925 and in which he held that \"*the arbitral case law \u2026 is unanimous \u2026 in disallowing compound interest*.\"2247\n\nClaimant's Quantum Reply, \u00b6 418.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for InternationallyWrongful Acts, Y.B.

A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2) [CA-1], Article 38, \u00b6 8.\n\n1805.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute, however, as to whether there has been a change in more recent case law reflecting a trend towards granting compound interest as part of the compensation awarded to investors. As pointed out by Claimant, Dr. Ripinsky stated in his book on damages in international investment law dating from 2008:\n\n\"*The practice of investment tribunals has been mixed. However\u2014perhaps a positive response to the academic criticism of simple interest\u2014in the last 10 years tribunals have predominantly awarded compound interest. There have been more than 15 publicly known awards rendered by international tribunals in investor-State disputes where compound interest was granted, most of them issued after 2000. Although it would be wrong to suggest that tribunals have stopped awarding simple interest, the preference for compound interest has become apparent*.\"2248\n\nSergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (2008) [CA-431], p. 384.\n\n1806.\n\nFollowing a discussion of the case law rendered in and after 2000, in particular the tribunal's reasoning in *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* which awarded compound interest in 2000 and which he described as \"*a turning point in jurisprudence*,\" Dr. Ripinsky also made express reference to the ILC Articles quoted above and noted that while this codification of the international law on State responsibility \"*continues to treat simple interest as the norm, viewing compound interest as exceptional and to be awarded only where special circumstances warrant it in order to achieve full reparation*,\"2249 a different trend could be seen in international investment law:\n\n\"*As far as international investment law is concerned, there has been a reversal of the presumption of simple interest: a significant number of recent tribunal decisions provide a strong indication that compound interest has come to be treated as the default solution. This may be due to the nature of economic activity of the claimants in investor-State disputes and strong theoretical support for granting compound interest in such cases*.\"2250\n\nSergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (2008) [CA-431],pp. 384-387.\n\nSergey Ripinsky & Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (2008) [CA-431],p. 387.\n\n1807.\n\nThe trend described by Dr. Ripinsky in 2008 and specifically that \"[a]*real change of trend towards accepting compound interest became obvious in the year 2000,*\" starting with the *Santa Elena* decision, was confirmed by the authority relied on by Claimant, which discusses the calculation of compensation and damages in international investment law and is dated 2017.2251 Following an overview on relevant case law, including more recent case law rendered after 2008, this authority also concluded that \"[t]*he brief overview shows that compound interest as opposed to simple interest is predominantly accepted in recent international investment arbitration. It is regarded as better reflecting actual economic realities both for the purpose of remedying the loss actually incurred by the injured party and for the prevention of unjustified enrichment of the respondent state.*\"2252\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6 6,239.\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Methods of Valuation in International Practice, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2017) [CA-434], \u00b6\u00b6 6,240-6.248.\n\n1808.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has determined above that it does not consider it appropriate to mix considerations of unjust enrichment with the determination of damages based on compensatory principles, the Tribunal agrees with the authorities quoted above as well as with the tribunals whose decisions they discussed that compound interest more adequately reflects economic reality and thus the loss that Claimant has in fact incurred as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches.\n\n1809.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant is entitled to interest at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually, which accrues on the amount of compensation determined by the Tribunal above. Specifically, Respondent shall pay to Claimant interest at the rate specified above: (i), starting from the valuation date, *i.e*., 15 November 2011 until the date of this Award (pre-award interest); and (ii) starting from the date of this Award until the date on which Claimant receives payment of the full amount pursuant to this Award (post-award interest).\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1810.\n\nOn 28 September 2018, both Parties submitted their statements of costs, reflecting the costs, fees and expenses they incurred in this arbitration.\n\n1811.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision on the costs of the arbitration, *i.e.*, the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, shall form part of the award.\n\n1812.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has not yet rendered a decision on the costs incurred by the Parties in the first phase of the proceedings leading up to the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the second phase leading up to the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims. In both Decisions, it has reserved on the costs of the respective phase of the arbitration for this Award.\n\n**A. Claimant's Submission on Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1813.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal should order Respondent to compensate Claimant for all of the costs it has incurred in connection with this arbitration, including arbitral costs, legal fees and expenses, on an indemnity basis, in order to restore Claimant to the position it would have been in but for Respondent's Treaty breaches.2253\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.\n\n1814.\n\nClaimant argues that this should follow not only from the general principle that it has prevailed on all of its claims but also from the fact that, according to Claimant, Respondent \"*has gone to great length to frustrate TCCA's claims*\" and \"*to erect every conceivable obstacle to TCCA's efforts to obtain compensation*\" in order to delay an award and increase Claimant's costs.2254\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 2.\n\n1815.\n\nClaimant points to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and notes that tribunals have consistently held that this provision affords them wide discretion to assess costs as they see fit, as has also been acknowledged by Respondent. Claimant considers it agreed between the Parties that \"*the Tribunal should consider the relative success of the Parties in pursuing their claims and defenses, as well as the conduct of the Parties in advancing those claims and defenses*.\" In Claimant's view, both aspects require that it be awarded all of its costs.2255\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, *referring to* Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 448, 445.\n\n1816.\n\nReferring to the general principle in international arbitral practice that costs should follow the event, Claimant considers that its application must result in Respondent bearing Claimant's costs because Claimant prevailed on \"*virtually all legal and evidentiary issues considered by the Tribunal*,\" in particular: (i) jurisdiction and admissibility; (ii) liability; (iii) Respondent's counterclaim; (iv) Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims; (v) Respondent's Reconsideration Request; (vi) Respondent's first Disqualification Request; (vii) Respondent's second Disqualification Proposal; and (viii) Respondent's Application for a Ruling *in Limine* and for Spoliation Sanctions.2256\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n1817.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it should be awarded all of its costs and expenses even if the Tribunal were to award it a lesser amount than sought as damages in the present phase. Claimant refers to the tribunal in *Bear Creek v. Peru*, which awarded the claimant only 3% of the requested amount but 75% of its costs, because it did not consider it relevant which proportion of damages was ultimately awarded but what caused the party to incur the costs for which it sought reimbursement and noted that \"[t]*he vast majority of the arbitration costs were caused by the issues on which Respondent did not prevail*.\" In Claimant's view, the same applies in the present case.2257\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, *quoting from* *Bear Creek Mining Corp. v. Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Award of 30 November 2017 [CA-432], \u00b6 730.\n\n1818.\n\nClaimant further argues that awarding its full costs and expenses is consistent with, and in fact required under, the customary international law standard of full reparation. It refers to the tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico*, which held that \"*following the general principle expressed in* Chorzow Factory, *that* 'reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act', \u2026 *compensation should include a claimant's reasonable costs, both reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, in successfully and necessarily asserting its disputed legal rights in arbitration proceedings against an unsuccessful respondent*,\" as well as to the tribunal in *ADC v. Hungary*, which considered that \"\"[w]*ere the Claimants not to be reimbursed their costs in justifying what they alleged to be egregious conduct on the part of Hungary it could not be said that they were being made whole*.\"2258\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, *quoting from Gemplus v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/3, Award of 16 June 2010 [CA-104], \u00b6\u00b6 17-21 *and* *Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006 [CA-61], \u00b6 533.\n\n1819.\n\nAs an additional factor, Claimant considers it well-established that a tribunal \"*should \u2026 take into account the procedural conduct of the parties, and in particular whether such conduct delayed the proceedings or increased costs unnecessarily*\" and claims that Respondent's conduct has caused both, *i.e*., significant delays and unnecessary costs, through the manner in which it chose to argue its case.2259\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, *quoting from* *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Resconsideration and Award of 7 February 2017 (\"Burlington Award\") [CA-356], \u00b6 620.\n\n1820.\n\nClaimant further contends that a cost award serves not only to compensate the injured party but also to sanction unlawful, dilatory or other improper conduct of the wrongful party. It specifically refers to the tribunal in *Karkey v. Pakistan*, which held that \"*Pakistan did not cooperate in good faith in the arbitral proceedings and such behaviour must be taken into account by the Tribunal in the allocation of costs*\" and placed emphasis on the fact that Pakistan \"*made the Tribunal spend a large part of the Hearing on unfounded \u2026 arguments of corruption*\" and that \"*Pakistan requested the introduction of additional evidence only at the end of the*[] *proceedings causing unnecessary disruption and expenses, in an attempt to uncover evidence to substantiate alleged 'red flags' or suspicions of corruption*.\"2260\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, *quoting from* *Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1, Award of 22 August 2017 [CA-486], \u00b6\u00b6 1063, 1069, 1066.\n\n1821.\n\nClaimant argues that, likewise, Respondent's \"*improper conduct*\" in this case increased the duration and costs of this arbitration and also threatened the integrity of the proceedings, providing \"*further and independent reason*\" to award Claimant all of its costs and expenses. Specifically, Claimant refers to the following \"*examples*\": (i) Balochistan's reversal of its position in the Supreme Court proceedings regarding the CHEJVA; (ii) Respondent's \"*abusive extension demands*\" with regard to its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, which forced the Tribunal to postpone the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability by ten months; (iii) Respondent's corruption claims which it raised in a letter eight months after the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability and which it continued to expand after its Application to Dimiss the Claims, especially through new and expanded witness statements; (iv) Respondent's reliance on \"*false confessions and fabricated documentary evidence*\" in support of its allegations which were \"*deliberately designed to be difficult to disprove*\" and caused Claimant to incur more than USD 25 million in costs to investigate and defend against these allegations; (v) Respondent's demand for a separate hearing dedicated to hearing the Parties' forensic experts regarding the Aziz Diaries the originals of which Respondent refused to deliver to the Tribunal; (vi) Respondent's first Disqualification Request and its request for an independent and non-binding opinion from the Secretary-General of the PCA as well as Respondent's second Disqualification Proposal which was directed against all three members of the Tribunal and was rejected by the ICSID Chairman of the Administrative Council; (vii) Respondent's conduct in connection with the 2017 site visit which caused Claimant to incur more than USD 120,000 in direct expenses as well as \"*hundreds of thousands of dollars of additional legal fees and costs in defending against the procedural applications Pakistan filed arising out of that visit,*\" in particular regarding the review of Claimant's records at the offices of its Pakistani counsel; (viii) Respondent sought to introduce new witness evidence during the second round of written submissions in every phase of the arbitration; (ix) Respondent \"willfully\" failed to produce documents despite repeated orders from the Tribunal and redacted several documents despite the Tribunal's orders; and (x) in the quantum phase, Respondent submitted a valuation that its own expert acknowledged to be contrary to industry practice and launched \"*unfounded attacks*\" against the Feasibility study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study the defense against which caused more than USD 1.2 million in expert witness fees and expenses.2261\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 21-46.\n\n1822.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that in the circumstances of this arbitration, the costs it has incurred are \"*entirely reasonable*\" because \"*the manner in which Pakistan has chosen to defend itself was enormously expensive for TCCA*.\" In particular, Claimant argues that any disparity between the cost incurred by the Parties is \"the inescapable consequence of Pakistan's frivolous claims.\" It refers to several tribunals, which held that it is not unreasonable for claimants to incur greater costs than respondents as they bear the burden of proof on most issues. In addition, Claimant argues that there is a \"*massive disparity in the Parties' respective disclosures of documents and the fact that TCCA had not only to investigate a wide range of vague and unfounded allegations of corruption but defend against scattershot attacks on virtually every aspect of its exploration and feasibility work*\" and further points to \"*Pakistan's consistent practice of introducing new claims and evidence on reply or rejoinder, and to file frivolous procedural applications*.\"2262\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48,\n\n1823.\n\nIn any event, Claimant submits that tribunals have been reluctant to \"second-guess\" a party's decision to incur each component cost and refers to Judge Holtzmann quoted in *ADC v. Hungary*, who considered that \"*legal bills are usually first submitted to businessmen. The pragmatic fact that a businessman has agreed to pay a bill, not knowing whether or not the Tribunal would reimburse the expenses, is a strong indication that the amount billed was considered reasonable by a reasonable man spending his own money, or the money of the corporation he serves*.\"2263\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 49, *quoting from* *Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006 [CA-61], \u00b6 534.\n\n1824.\n\nOn that basis, Claimant requests that Respondent be ordered to pay, on an indemnity basis, all of Claimant's costs and expenses, including attorneys' and experts' fees, which it has summarized as follows:2264\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1.** | **ICSID Advances on Costs** *(see p. 3)* | US$ 2,600,000 |\n| **2.** | **Debevoise & Plimpton LLP** *(see pp. 4\u20147)* |  |\n|  | Stage 1 (Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures) | US$ 3,322,627.06 |\n|  | Stage 2 (Jurisdiction and Liability) | US$ 8.41S. 192.79 |\n|  | Stage 3 (Pakistan's Application to Dismiss the Claims) | US$ 21,738,366.50 |\n|  | Stage 4 (Quantum) | US$ 17,576,140.24 |\n| **3.** | **Pakistani Counsel** *(see p.

Respondent's Submission on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1825.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant should bear all costs and fees incurred by Respondent or, in the alternative, the Tribunal should allocate costs based on the proportion of success of Claimant's damages claim.2265\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, Section II.\n\n1826.\n\nRespondent submits that pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has the power and discretion to determine and allocate the costs of this arbitration and argues that ICSID tribunals award costs against the other party \"*where that party has acted in an unreasonable, unlawful, or frivolous manner.*\"2266 According to Respondent, Claimant's actions \"*have demonstrated bad faith tactics, frivolous objections, and unlawful actions, particularly as it relates to Pakistan's access to the project records and the site visit to the core shed*\" which Claimant attempted to avoid and restrict. Respondent claims that Claimant employed \"*guerilla tactics*\" before and during the site visit and even compromised the integrity of the project's physical records by paying a witness to remove samples from the core shed, demonstrating Claimant's bad faith. By contrast, Respondent argues that it acted \"*in an abundance of good faith*,\" facilitating the site visit and ensuring the safety of Claimant's personnel.2267\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, *referring to* *\u00d6mer Dede v. Romania*, \u00b6\u00b6 268\u2013270; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Separate opinion by Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro of 30 January 2007, \u00b6 6; *MCI Power Group L.C. & New Turbine Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award of 31 July 2007 [RLA-245], \u00b6 372; *AES Summit Generation Ltd and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award of 8 October 2009 [CA-136], \u00b6 322.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.\n\n1827.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimant filed \"*frivolous requests for interim relief*\" before this Tribunal as well as the parallel tribunal in the ICC proceedings between Claimant and the Province of Balochistan, with the first of them being dismissed by both Tribunals and the second one being abandoned even though the court proceedings before the Islamabad High Court continue. Respondent also refers to Claimant's submission of almost 70 new documents \"*on the eve of the hearing*\" even though they were mostly supportive of issues raised in its Quantum Reply and/or should have been disclosed pursuant to Respondent's document production requests. According to Respondent, \"*even more shocking*\" was that Claimant disclosed only a few days before the closing arguments that the calculation of its expert had been \"*off by USD 1 billion*,\" which required Respondent to restructure its cross-examination and its experts to conduct a rushed review of these calculations. In Respondent's view, \"[t]*his error cannot go unnoticed and should be given due consideration in any costs determination*.\"2268\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n1828.\n\nAs for Claimant's complaint about delays caused by Respondent in this arbitration, Respondent argues that an award of interest will compensate for the passage of time and emphasizes that \"*any delay caused was necessary for Pakistan to fully exercise and protect its due process rights and do as much as possible to ensure a fair proceeding and maintain the equality of arms between the parties. Pakistan has otherwise acted appropriately in these proceedings. None of the objections or defenses raised by Pakistan were frivolous or offered in bad faith, but to the contrary were serious, based on solid grounds, and put forth to fully guard and defend Pakistan's rights*.\"2269\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 13.\n\n1829.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent contends that its corruption allegations were based on newly discovered evidence \"*that could not be ignored*\" and brought to light Claimant's engagement in improper payments to obtain visa approvals and the violation of anti-corruption policies by the all-expense trips for the GOB. Respondent also emphasizes that its first Disqualification Request was filed to defend its right to an impartial and independent tribunal and that its second Disqualification Proposal was based on newly discovered facts. According to Respondent, \"*Pakistan should not be penalized for exercising its rights to ensure the integrity of the proceedings and the impartiality of the Tribunal*.\"2270\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n1830.\n\nRespondent therefore requests that the allocation of costs take into account \"*TCCA's tactics to derail and prejudice Pakistan's defense*\" and ultimately be based on the apportionment of success of the damages that Claimant has claimed in order to \"*balance against the current trend of claimants abusing the ICSID system to request exorbitant damages, which they are not able to prove, as a ruse to get the Tribunal to issue higher damage awards'\"* According to Respondent, Claimant has advanced an \"*unsubstantiated and outrageous damages claim against a developing State that has to struggle to find the resources to mount a meaningful defense.\"* For that reason, Respondent argues that costs should not be awarded exclusively on the basis of who prevailed in a given phase of the proceedings but should rather also consider the overall success of Claimant\u2019s damages claim in order to discourage claimants from seeking *\"exaggerated and deceptive damages claims,\"* while preserving the integrity and respectability of the ICSID system.2271\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n1831.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal award costs to Pakistan or, in the alternative, allocate costs based on the success of Claimant\u2019s damages claim, and submits that it has incurred costs in the total amount of USD 25,456,790, which it has summarized as follows:2272\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Description | Costs |\n| Phase 1: Appointment of Arbitral Tribunal, provisional measures and jurisdiction |\n| Legal fees of ABS & Co and international counsel26 | USD 1,083,525 |\n| Phase 2: Jurisdiction & Liability Phase (Counter-Memorial.

Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n1832.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal's authority to render a decision on the allocation of costs is based on Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n\"*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award*.\"\n\n1833.\n\nThere is further common ground that the Tribunal enjoys discretion to \"*assess the expenses incurred by the parties,*\" which extends to all costs incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration, *i.e*., including legal and expert fees and expenses as well as other expenses.\n\n1834.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus exercise its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and decide on the allocation of: (i) the costs of the arbitration, which includes the administrative fees charged by ICSID as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal; and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration.\n\n**1. The Costs of the Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1835.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will address the question of who shall bear the costs of the arbitration.\n\n1836.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties to the extent that in its decision on the allocation of costs, the Tribunal should take into account the outcome of the arbitration. While Claimant explicitly refers to the principle of \"*costs follow the event*\" and places emphasis on the legal and evidentiary issues on which it has prevailed in the course of this arbitration, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not only look at who prevailed in a given phase of the arbitration but also take into account the overall success of Claimant's damages claim, *i.e*., the proportion of success specifically in the quantum phase.\n\n1837.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the overarching significance that Respondents intends to attach to the result of this final phase of the proceedings. In support of its argument, Respondent invokes the necessity to discourage claimants from filing exaggerated damages claims and preserving the integrity of the ICSID system. The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent, however, that Claimant has filed an \"*unsubstantiated and outrageous damages claim*.\"2273 It further considers that the allocation of costs incurred by the Parties for presenting their claims and defenses in this arbitration should not be based on considerations referring to \"*other claimants*\" and thus considerations unrelated to this arbitration. In the Tribunal's view, it also does not impact either the integrity or the respectability of the ICSID system if costs are allocated by looking at the findings made in all phases of this arbitration.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n1838.\n\nThis arbitration has consisted of three separate phases involving separate written submissions, separate oral hearings and separate decisions by the Tribunal. In each of these phases, both Parties incurred significant amounts of costs for presenting their claims and defenses. Taking into account that only one of these phases concerned the amount of damages requested by Claimant, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to allocate the costs for all three phases, *i.e*., including the phase addressing jurisdiction and liability as well as the phase addressing Respondent's allegations of corruption, based on the proportion of success in the final quantum phase. The same applies to additional decisions rendered by the Tribunal on Claimant's 2012 Provisional Measures Request as well as on Respondent's Reconsideration Request.\n\n1839.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that both Parties have criticized the procedural conduct of the other Party and argue that such conduct should be taken into account as an independent reason to award it the costs it has incurred in this arbitration. In the Tribunal's view, the outcome of the proceedings should and will be the primary basis for allocating the costs of the arbitration. However, certain procedural conduct which resulted in a significant incurease of costs on both sides, without there being a justification for such costs from an objective point of view, may also be taken into account in determining the final allocation of costs.\n\n1840.\n\nAt the outset of this arbitration, Claimant filed its 2012 Provisional Measures Request, which involved written submissions and an oral hearing following which the Tribunal decided not to recommend any provisional measures. The Tribunal did order Respondent, however, to inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular basis, about its specific plans and activities with respect to deposit H-4 as well as of any change of its present intentions to implement the work plan for H-4, not to expand its mining activities to H-14 and H-15, and not to give any rights in this regard to any third party. No further decision was required on that matter.\n\n1841.\n\nClaimant has fully prevailed on the matters of jurisdiction, admissibility, liability and the counterclaims raised by Respondent. More specifically, the Tribunal affirmed the general jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention, in particular that Claimant has made a qualifying \"*investment*,\" it dismissed both of Respondent's objections on jurisdiction and admissibility, and it made an affirmative finding on all three breaches of the Treaty that Claimant has alleged. It further dismissed the counterclaim raised by Respondent, in part on jurisdiction and in part on the merits.\n\n1842.\n\nAfter the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Respondent raised allegations of corruption which led to a separate phase dealing with Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims on that basis. Following the Parties' written submissions, oral hearings involving a large number of witnesses as well as forensic experts from both sides, the Tribunal found that Respondent had failed to prove any of its factual allegations of corruption.\n\n1843.\n\nShortly after filing its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, Respondent filed a Reconsideration Request in which it requested that the Tribunal reconsider certain findings made on jurisdiction and liability. Following Claimant's Request for Summary Dismissal of the Reconsideration Request and further submissions from both Parties, the Tribunal rejected Respondent's Reconsideration Request.\n\n1844.\n\nFinally, on quantum, the Tribunal found it appropriate to follow the valuation approach presented by Claimant and its expert. It further found that none of the risks and issues raised by Respondent and its various experts impacted the feasibility of the project and with regard to a large majority of these issues, the Tribunal was also not convinced that they had an impact on the value of Claimant's investment. The Tribunal did make certain adjustments to the value of Claimant's investment as calculated by Prof. Davis, in particular with regard to the security risks caused by political violence and the risk that the mining lease might not be renewed or might not be renewed on the same terms after its initial 30-year term. In addition, the Tribunal held that a further deduction had to be made to fully account for the systematic risks affecting a project with a 56-year life of operations. The Tribunal also notes, however, that Respondent's experts did not present an alternative income-based valuation on which the Tribunal could have relied to verify its conclusions or even an update of the calculations made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study to the valuation date even though they relied on these calculations in support of their criticism of the valuation method proposed by Claimant. Moreover, while Respondent did present an alternative, market-based valuation, the Tribunal has determined above that this valuation could not be used as an indicator of the project's value as of the valuation date given that Respondent's expert had not assigned any value at all to the exploration work carried out by Claimant in the five years between the acquisition of Claimant by Barrick and Antofagasta and the valuation date.\n\n1845.\n\nOn balance, and while being aware that Claimant did not succeed on its 2012 Provisional Measures Request at the outset of this arbitration and did not fully prevail on its damages claim in the final phase the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration in full. In particular, the Tribunal recalls its finding on liability that none of the reasons invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration justified the Licensing Authority's decision to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal is convinced that the real motive for the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this motive. The Tribunal concluded that by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent has breached its obligations to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.\n\n1846.\n\nIn light of Respondent's conduct and the absence of any form of compensation, Claimant had to initiate this arbitration in order to obtain compensation for the loss of its investment caused by Respondent's breaches of its obligations under the Treaty. In the final phase of this arbitration, Claimant has further demonstrated that, contrary to Respondent's arguments, the project was technically and economically feasible and could have proceeded to construction and the operational stage if the mining lease had been granted. Claimant has further demonstrated that the project had substantial value.\n\n1847.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal considers it justified that Respondent shall bear in full the costs of the arbitration, which amount in USD to:\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mr. John Beechey | 6,072.06 |\n| Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs | 1,781,488.88 |\n| Rt. Hon. Lord Leonard Hoffmann | 357,473.08 |\n| Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov | 656,615.10 |\n\nTribunal Assistant's expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Susanne Schwalb | 22,038.67 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 244,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses2274 | 695,506.23 |\n| **Total** | **3,763,194.02** |\n\nThis amount includes charges relating to the dispatch of the Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n1848.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, ICSID requested the Parties to pay each of the respective advances on costs in equal shares. Respondent, however, has not paid its 50% share pursuant to the first three of the advance payment requests issued by ICSID but has only paid its share of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh advance payment requests. Upon request, Claimant has therefore paid its own share as well as Respondent's share of the first three advance payments on costs in the total amount of USD 2,900,000; Respondent has made payments in the total amount of USD 1,199,925.00.\n\n1849.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay to Claimant USD 2,533,277.08, which is the net amount after deducting from the full amount that Claimant has paid as advance on costs to ICSID, *i.e*., USD 2,900,000.00, the refund of USD 366,722.92 to be made by ICSID to Claimant.\n\n**2. The Costs Incurred by the Parties in Connection with this Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1850.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will assess the question of who shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration. The Tribunal notes that both Parties have incurred substantial amounts of costs in the arbitration. Neither Party has sought leave to file a response to the other Party's Submission on Costs and, in particular, no objections to the reasonableness of the other Party's costs have been raised. As reflected in the summaries of the procedural history included in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims (with Reasons) and this Award, both Parties have employed substantial efforts to present their claims and defenses in each phase of this arbitration, each of which concerned a large number of highly complex factual and/or legal issues. Both Parties relied on a large number of factual and expert witnesses as well as a comprehensive amount of factual exhibits and legal authorities. Against this background and in the absence of any objection from either Party, the Tribunal sees no reason to question the reasonableness of the costs incurred by the Parties and/or to make deductions with regard to the amount of recoverable costs.\n\n1851.\n\nBoth Parties have separately presented the costs they have incurred in each of four stages of the arbitration: (i) Request for Arbitration, appointment of the Tribunal, Claimant's 2012 Provisional Measures Request; (ii) written submissions and Hearing on Jurisdiction & Liability; (iii) Respondent's Application to Dismiss the Claims based on allegations of corruption; and (iv) quantum.\n\n1852.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall also bear the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this proceeding. While Claimant has not succeeded on its 2012 Provisional Measures Request at the first stage and certain deductions had to be made from the amount of compensation requested by Claimant at the final stage, the Tribunal considers that, on balance, these aspects are outweighed by the fact that: (i) Claimant has fully succeeded on jurisdiction and liability, including an affirmative finding on all three Treaty breaches alleged by Claimant, as well as in defending against Respondent's counterclaims; (ii) Claimant has successfully defended against each of Respondent's allegations of corruption, with the Tribunal having found no proven incident of Claimant exercising, or attempting to exercise, improper influence on Government officials aimed at obtaining rights or benefits relating to Claimant's investment in Pakistan; and (iii) Claimant has proven that the project was technically and economically feasible and had substantial value. Furthermore, neither of the two aspects changes the fact that Claimant had to initiate this arbitration in order to receive the amount of compensation to which it is entitled as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches.\n\n1853.\n\nAs an additional consideration, it must be noted that Respondent has raised various defenses in this arbitration which were found to be almost entirely meritless but nevertheless caused the proceedings to extend over a significant period of time and the Parties to incur large amounts of costs. In particular, in the quantum phase in which Claimant has succeeded to a considerable extent, albeit not in the full amount, Respondent chose to defend itself by presenting expert reports from an array of experts on the subjects of mineral resources, metallurgy, project execution, water supply, security, environmental and social impacts, permitting and approvals, as well as financing, but most of the criticisms raised by these experts turned out to be unconvincing and without any merit. As already expressed in its general remarks in Section VII.A.3 above, the Tribunal also recalls that none of these issues was raised by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject and there is no evidence in the record that any other agency or official of the GOB or the GOP raised these issues during the time period in which the joint venture partners were still collaborating or even when the GOB had decided to take over the project and deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application in violation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty. It was only during these arbitration proceedings that Respondent started to invoke additional grounds as allegedly critical issues that purportedly rendered the project unfeasible. In addition, Claimant was the only Party which presented the Tribunal with a valuation that could form the basis for the Tribunal's assessment of Claimant's damages, whereas the only valuation presented by Respondent and its experts did not serve to assist the Tribunal in the task at hand, *i.e*., determining the value of Claimant's investment.\n\n1854.\n\nWhile it is of course for each Party to decide on the strategy of how to defend against a claim brought forward against it, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that this Party also bear the consequences caused by that strategy. In this case, this applies in particular to the large amount of costs that Claimant had to incur in order to defend against the unproven allegations of corruption and the largely unfounded criticisms raised in the quantum phase. In the Tribunal's view, it is therefore justified that Respondent be ordered to bear the full costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this arbitration, *i.e*., including the costs incurred by Claimant in the quantum phase. In addition, Respondent shall bear its own costs that it has incurred in connection with the arbitration.\n\n1855.\n\nConsequently, Respondent shall reimburse to Claimant a total amount of USD 59,447,596.60, consisting of: (i) legal fees and costs for its international counsel in the amount of USD 51,055,326.59 and for its local counsel in the amount of USD 943,361.06; (ii) fact witness expenses in the amount of USD 1,668,484.49; (iii) expert witness expenses in the amount of USD 4,774,505.01; and (iv) other expenses in the amount of USD 1,005,919.45.\n\n**3. Post-Award Interest on Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1856.\n\nFinally, Claimant requests that it be awarded post-award interest on any amount of costs awarded to it until full payment of those amounts is made.\n\n1857.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to award interest on the amount of costs that Respondent is ordered to reimburse at the same post-award interest rate as on the principal amount of compensation, *i.e*., at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually. Such interest shall start to accrue from the date of this Award.\n\n**IX. DECISION BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n1858.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides as follows:\n\n**I. To the extent that the Tribunal has previously admitted evidence submitted by****the Parties in the present phase of the proceeding** ***de bene esse*****, such evidence is admitted into the record.**\n\n**II. Respondent shall pay to Claimant USD 4,087 million as principal amount of compensation for the breaches, as determined in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 10 November 2017, of Respondent's obligations under Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the** ***Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investments*** **relating to Claimant's investment in Pakistan.**\n\n**III. Respondent shall further pay to Claimant pre-award interest on the principal amount of compensation under II., as of 15 November 2011 until the date of this Award, at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually.**\n\n**IV. Respondent shall further pay to Claimant post-award interest on the principal amount of compensation under II., as from the date of this Award until the date of payment, at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually.**\n\n**V. Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration,** ***i.e*****., the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses of the Tribunal's Assistant, as well as the charges for the use of the facilities of ICSID, in the total amount of****USD 3,763,194.02, in full. Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse to Claimant an amount of USD 2,533,277.08.**\n\n**VI. Respondent shall further bear an amount of USD 59,447,596.60 of the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this arbitration proceeding and thus reimburse to Claimant an amount of USD 59,447,596.60.**\n\n**VII. Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of costs to be reimbursed under V. and VI. as from the date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually.**\n\n**VIII. Respondent shall pay the amounts due under II. through VII. in US dollars, outside of Pakistan, without any reduction, claim or offset for taxes, other fiscal obligations or other reasons.**\n\n**IX. All further requests and applications raised by the Parties in these proceedings are dismissed.**"}]}
