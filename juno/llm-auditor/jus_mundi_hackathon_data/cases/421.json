INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the Claimants brought an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**Application**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application relates to the appearance of a number of persons on one of the Claimants' properties (\"**Smalldeel**\", which is a property located within the Claimants' Makandi Estate). The Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunals \"order the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent people from coming onto the Makandi Estate, and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Makandi Estate, to remove them, unless those people are authorised by the Claimants.\" (see Application, para. 1.1).\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals have considered the Application and have decided unanimously as follows.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the Tribunal Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Respondent to file any observations it may have on the Application by 8 March 2013.\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the Respondent filed its observations on the Application, requesting that the Tribunals dismiss the Application (\"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the Tribunal Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Claimants to file any response it may have to the Respondent's Observations by 11 March 2013.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent's Observations, reiterating their request that the relief set out in the Application be granted (\"**Claimants' Response**\").\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants submit that on 26 February 2013, a group of approximately ten persons (referred to by the Claimants as \"**the Muzite Party**\") entered the Claimants' Smalldeel property without the Claimants' authorisation. The Claimants assert that the group included, *inter alia*:\n\n(a) Superintendent Chitondwe, who is a member of the Respondent's police force and according to the Claimants purported to be acting in his official capacity as a member of the Zimbabwean police; and\n\n(b) Mr. Muzite, who is known to the Claimants, in particular from a 2010 incident during which Mr. Muzite is alleged to have threatened and assaulted the Claimants' staff and to have stolen a large amount of crops from the Makandi Estate (with one of his supporters carrying a high calibre firearm at the time).\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Application, the Muzite Party informed the Claimants' farm staff that they arrived \"to identify Mr Muzite's 100ha of land on Smalldeel\" (see Application, para. 2.4). The Claimants dispute that the Respondent has in fact allocated land on Smalldeel to Mr. Muzite by way of an Offer Letter Process or otherwise.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that on 1 March 2013, several members of the Muzite Party returned to Smalldeel, threatened the keeper of the farm's store, took possession of the store and placed a sign over the store: \"Muzite Farm\". The Claimants further allege that on the following day, a larger group of approximately 15 persons returned to Smalldeel, and threatened and chased the harvesting staff from the fields.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that on 6 March 2013, the Muzite Party commenced harvesting macadamia nuts on Smalldeel and have since physically removed some of the harvested nuts from Smalldeel.\n\n12.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the actions outlined above indicate that:\n\n(a) the Muzite Party plans to permanently occupy Smalldeel and profit from the macadamia and wheat crops (see Application, para. 2.8);\n\n(b) a risk exists that the Muzite Party will damage existing infrastructure on Smalldeel (see Application, para. 2.8); and\n\n(c) the Muzite Party will likely continue to physically intimidate and threaten the Claimants' staff, particularly in light of the 2010 events referred to at paragraph 8 above (see Application, para. 2.9).\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants state that they have unsuccessfully sought assistance from the local police, who \"appear to be intimidated by the involvement of Superintendent Chitondwe\" (see Application, para. 2.10). The Claimants attach to their Application a communication dated 4 March 2013 addressed to counsel for the Respondent, advising the Respondent of their position that the Superintendent's conduct is attributable to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\n14.\n\nRelying on Article 40 and 41 of the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the Claimants submit that they seek to have the following rights preserved through the present Application (see Application, paras. 4.8 and 4.9):\n\n(a) \"rights under the BITs and customary international law not to have their property expropriated on grounds of discrimination, in serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law\"; and\n\n(b) the \"right to participate in these proceedings without threats of intimidation from members of the Respondent's police force, or other persons.\"\n\n15.\n\nIn their Application, the Claimants seek specifically that the Tribunals order the Respondent (see Application, para. 7.1):\n\n(a) to instruct its police force that only those persons who have been granted permission by the Claimants to enter the Makandi Estate may do so (**Authorised Persons**);\n\n(b) to instruct its police force to remove all persons from the Makandi Estate who are not Authorised Persons; and\n\n(c) not to take any further action to aggravate the dispute between it and the Claimants.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn its Observations on the Application, the Respondent submits that Mr. Muzite was legally allocated subdivision 1 (a 100-ha plot) of Smalldeel farm on 10 February 2009 and that the apparent cause of the current disturbances relates to the exact boundaries of this plot (see Respondent's Observations, p. 1).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' characterisation of the events and avers that there is no collective \"Muzite Party\", stating rather that the \"facts on the ground are that Mr Muzite considered it reasonable to harvest what was on the portion of land allocated to him in 2009\" (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there was also an incident involving Mr. Muzite in 2010 and that the \"problem\" about which the Claimants complain is not new and therefore not urgent (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n19.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Respondent confirms the following (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2-3):\n\n\"Respondent has emphasised to the police that they should ensure that the status quo at the time of the filing of Claimants' case in 2010 prevails. Respondent confirms that police are under instructions to ensure that Mr Muzite does not interfere with the Claimants' operations.\n\nRespondent invites the Arbitral Tribunal to advise Claimants that they have the option to approach the provincial police in Mutare, in the event that the district police are not acting on their reports. The provincial police have undertaken to act in the event of any such a report.\n\nClaimants' application does not indicate any attempt to engage the provincial police in the issue at hand. In the event that the provincial police were also to fail to act, the Claimants can approach the Police General Headquarters in Harare, which is aware of the ICSID proceedings.\"\n\n20.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in support of the Respondent's Observations, Superintendent Chitondwe also confirmed receipt of the following directions from the Government of Zimbabwe (see Respondent's Observations, Affidavit of Superintendent Chitondwe, para. 29):\n\n\"The Attorney General's Office advised us that the status quo as at the time proceedings were instituted in ICSID should be maintained. We have advised Mr Muzite to stay off the land in question until the ICSID matter is finalized.\"\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in any event, the criteria for ordering provisional measures are not met.\n\n**C. The Claimants' Response**\n------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants note in their Response that \"the Respondent appears to have accepted the substance of the Claimants' application of 6 March 2013\", based on the fact that \"the Police appear to have been instructed to act against the Muzite Party, which they have done\" (see Claimants' Response, para. 1.2). Nevertheless, the Claimants state that they continue to feel intimidated by the fact that threats were made against their staff and because the police were allegedly a party to those threats. As a result, the Claimants maintain their Application and request that they be granted the relief set out at paragraph 15 above.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants record the following events since the filing of their Application, supported by the witness statement of Nicholas Shaxson, a senior manager of the Makandi Estate (see Claimants' Response, paras. 2.2 to 2.8):\n\n\"2.2 One matter that was not mentioned in the background facts to the application of 6 March 2013 is that one of the Makandi Estate's tractor drivers, together with a security officer, confronted the Muzite Party on Smalldeel. As a consequence both were questioned by the Police, and the tractor driver was taken into Police custody. The Police released the tractor driver without charge after this application was made. The security officer was also questioned for allegedly defaming President Mugabe. The defamation matter has not been dropped (Shaxson, para 5, tab 1).\n\n2.3 On 6 March 2013, two local Policemen were placed on the Smalldeel Estate. However, they merely observed matters, and did not intervene in the subsequent removal of crops from Smalldeel (Shaxson, para 6, tab 1).\n\n2.4 On the morning of Thursday, 7 March 2013, members of the Muzite Party removed five pickup loads of macadamia nuts from Smalldeel, which is equivalent to approximately two tonnes. These macadamia nuts were transported to another farm, Rosalie, which is now run by a member of the ZANU-PF political party. This theft was reported to the local Police. In response, the local Police informed the Claimants that they were awaiting instructions from District Police Headquarters as to how they should deal with this matter (Shaxson, para 7, tab 1).\n\n2.5 Later on in the morning of Thursday, 7 March 2013, members of the Muzite Party began to steal the staff's maize stocks. Approximately one tonne of maize was taken from the staff. This caused a great deal of concern because it was thought very unlikely that the Makandi staff would tolerate the theft of their own food. Later on that day the Police attended Smalldeel and ordered the Muzite party to return the maize and to stop harvesting the macadamia nuts. However, the Muzite Party continued to harvest macadamia nuts on Thursday night (Shaxson, para 8, tab 1).\n\n2.6 On Friday 8 March 2013, Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that the Attorney-General's office had become involved in this matter, and had made comments to the effect that \"they were not risking 128 million dollars for the sake on one individuals\" (Shaxson, para 9, tab 1).\n\n2.7 By Saturday morning, 9 March 2013, the Muzite Party's harvesting gang left Smalldeel. However, Mr Muzite and members of the Muzite Party remained in the store near the Smalldeel fields. On Saturday morning Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that they were on their way to evict Mr Muzite. The local Police asked Mr Shaxson to intercept a truck that the Muzite party had loaded with three tonnes of macadamia nuts that were harvested from Smalldeel on Friday. These are the same nuts that the local Police had previously watched Mr Muzite take from Smalldeel. Mr Shaxson did not intercept the truck, but the Police did (Shaxson, para 10, tab 1).\n\n2.8 In the evening of Saturday 9 March 2013, Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that the Muzite Party had been given until Sunday morning to leave the store. During Saturday night the Muzite party departed Smalldeel (Shaxson, para 11, tab 1).\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants insist that the police will only act if applications for provisional measures are made to the Arbitral Tribunals, and that it is not good enough for the Respondent to suggest that they simply \"keep climbing the Police ladder to Provincial level until someone will respond to them\" (see Claimants' Response, paras. 4.1 and 5.7). As a result, the Claimants maintain their Application.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals wish to record the fact that the Application has been considered on a without prejudice basis insofar as the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are concerned. Additionally, while neither Party has addressed the question of *prima facie* jurisdiction in its submissions, the Tribunals are satisfied, based on the reasoning set out below, that the absence of any such submissions is not fatal to their disposing of the Application in the present Procedural Order.\n\n26.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals note the Respondent's statement that it has instructed its police to maintain the status quo as of the date on which the Claimants initiated ICSID proceedings and, in particular, to ensure that Mr. Muzite does not interfere with the Claimants' operations at Smalldeel. The Tribunals also note the Respondent's statement that the provincial police have undertaken to act on any reports they receive in relation to this matter.\n\n27.\n\nIn their Response, the Claimants confirm that the police have progressively taken steps since the date of filing of the Application (i.e., 6 March 2013) to ensure the removal of Mr. Muzite and his party and that certain food stocks and harvested crops, if not all, have been restored to Smalldeel farm with the assistance of the police.\n\n28.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals note that the Claimants continue to \"feel intimidated\" by the threats made against their staff and that this intimidation is \"heightened by the fact that the Police will not act\". However, in light of the Respondent's undertakings to ensure that the status quo is maintained and that the police will act on any reports received in relation to Smalldeel farm, as well as the Claimants' confirmation that since the date of filing their Application the police have in fact ensured the departure of Mr. Muzite and the return of certain food stocks and harvested crops, the Tribunals see no basis at this time to order the relief requested and therefore the Application is dismissed.\n\n29.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals expressly do not take a view on the merits of the Application. The Tribunals' decision is also predicated on the current factual matrix presented by the Parties in their submissions in relation to the Application and is without prejudice to any further application that either Party may seek to bring should that factual matrix change.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants have notified an additional event which took place on 6 March 2013, involving a confrontation between a security officer and tractor driver on the Makandi Estate, on the one hand, and Mr. Muzite and/or his party, on the other hand, following which the tractor driver and the security officer were questioned by the police. According to the Claimants, the security officer was questioned in particular for allegedly defaming President Mugabe and this matter has not been dropped, although no charges appear to have been brought and he has not been detained by the police. Whilst the Tribunals are sensitive to the tension that appears to exist between the Parties to these proceedings as manifested in this Application and the substantive submissions filed by both Parties in these proceedings, it is unclear what, if any, direct relation this latter event has to the specific matters before the Tribunals. As the matter presently appears to stand, the Tribunals are not persuaded that their intervention is warranted.\n\n31.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals, however, strongly encourage both Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid further aggravation of the dispute between them in order to ensure the orderly progress of these proceedings.\n\n**V. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS' DECISIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Members of the Arbitral Tribunals have deliberated and decided unanimously to dismiss the Application.\n\n33.\n\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\n\nDated as of 16 March 2013"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the Claimants brought an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**Application**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application relates to an alleged plan by the Respondent's Central Intelligence Organisation (\"**CIO**\") to kill one of the Claimants, Mr. Heinrich von Pezold. The Claimants seek to have their \"right to participate in these proceedings without threats to their lives by the Respondent\" preserved through provisional measures.\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals have considered the Application and have decided unanimously as follows.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, in light of the urgency of the request presented in the Application, the President of the Arbitral Tribunals issued the following interim directions (\"**Interim Directions**\") (see Interim Directions, para. 10):\n\n\"(a) The Respondent immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent (the \"Protection Measures\"); and\n\n(b) The Respondent allow the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, to participate, in so far as it may be possible, in the planning and the implementation of the Protection Measures.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Interim Directions have remained in force until the issuance of this Procedural Order No 5.\n\n6.\n\nThe President of the Arbitral Tribunals also directed a briefing schedule in the Interim Directions, reserving leave for either Party to apply at any time to amend the Directions.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, the Respondent, while submitting that the Arbitral Tribunals did not have jurisdiction to entertain the Application, presented its observations on the Application, supported by a letter from the Chief Legal Officer of the CIO and a Statement by the Assistant Commissioner of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, assuring the Tribunals in effect that the members of these institutions take their roles to ensure the safety of all persons in Zimbabwe seriously and requesting that the Application be dismissed in its entirety or that the Claimants be directed to \"submit proof of their outlandish rumour\" (\"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, the Claimants, while asserting that the Arbitral Tribunals do have jurisdiction in relation to the Application, also presented their comments in response to the Respondent's Observations, supported by several documents, including a letter from the German Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Ambassador Hans Gnodtke, to the Minister of Land and Rural Resettlement raising, *inter alia*, the issue of threats against the life of Mr. von Pezold. The Claimants submitted that they had established there was a very serious threat to Mr. von Pezold and that the assurances given in the Respondent's Observations did not negate the need for an order on the terms expressed in the Interim Directions (\"**Claimants' Reply**\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 17 March 2013, the Respondent sought an extension of time to submit its rebuttal observations until 19 March 2013, which the President of the Tribunals granted.\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Arbitral Tribunals, clarifying their submissions in respect of the Tribunals' jurisdiction to order provisional measures (the \"**Claimants' 18 March Letter**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, the Respondent presented its further observations, along with a second letter from the Chief Legal Officer of the CIO and copies of two \"Notes Verbales\" sent by the German Embassy to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs relating to the actions of Mr. Muzite and others (see Procedural Order No. 4 dated 16 March 2013). The Respondent urged the Tribunals not to give any credence to what it considers to be spurious allegations against the Respondent and its State Entities (the \"**Respondent's Rebuttal**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 20 March 2013, the Claimants sought leave from the Tribunals to file further submissions in support of their Application and in response to the Respondent's Rebuttal. The President of the Tribunals granted the Claimants' request, extending also an invitation to the Respondent to file any further reply the Respondent wishes to make within 48 hours. The President confirmed that the Interim Directions would continue to remain in place.\n\n13.\n\nIn their Letter of 20 March 2013, the Claimants provided further details surrounding the diplomatic channels engaged by the German Embassy in Zimbabwe relating to this Application and the application for provisional measures disposed of in Procedural Order No. 4. The Claimants also provided further press reports in support of their allegations relating to police conduct and reiterated their request for relief (the \"**Claimants' 20 March Letter**\").\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent filed its final reply on 22 March 2013, describing the Claimants' evidence in support of their Application as, *inter alia*, \"anachronistic\", and reiterating its request that the Tribunals find the Application to be \"merely sensational, improbable and unfounded\", that the Application be dismissed and that the Claimants be condemned for abusive proceeding (the \"**Respondent's 22 March Letter**\").\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nHaving considered all of the Parties' submissions, the Arbitral Tribunals will now review in some detail their principal arguments.\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants provide the following background in support of their Application (see Application, paras. 2.2 to 2.5):\n\n\"On 6 March 2013, Heinrich von Pezold was informed by a reliable source within the Government of Zimbabwe that the Respondent's Central Intelligence organisation (\"CIO\") has been instructed to kill him. The CIO is the Respondent's \"premier\" Security Service and is an organ of State.\n\nThe position of the source within the Government of Zimbabwe and the disclosure of the specific details of the plan to kill Heinrich have led the Claimants and their advisors to conclude that this information must be taken very seriously. In reaching this conclusion, the Claimants have also taken into consideration the fact that the claimants in the case of *Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd & Ors v. Republic of Zimbabwe* at the SADC Tribunal in Namibia were violently assaulted in Zimbabwe during the course of those proceedings. The fact that those assaults occurred is recorded in numerous press articles. Photos of the injuries inflicted on the Campbell claimants are contained in the Respondent's own evidence filed with its Rejoinder, namely Ben Freeth's book.\n\nThe Claimants are not prone to hysteria. In any event, in order to obtain further reassurance as to their conclusions, the Claimants have passed the information regarding the CIO's instruction to kill Heinrich von Pezold to the German Embassy in Harare. The German Embassy has also concluded that the source and the threat must be taken very seriously.\n\nThe source has informed Heinrich von Pezold that the reason why the CIO has been instructed to kill him is because of the international claims that he has made in regard to the expropriations of his properties. The source has stated that certain people within the Zimbabwean Government want to avoid the negative publicity that his claims are bringing in what is an election year. In these circumstances, the Claimants consider that the instruction to kill Heinrich is a direct challenge to these ICSID proceedings.\" [citations omitted]\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants state that the purpose of provisional measures, as set out in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, is to \"preserve the respective rights of either party\", and that, through the present Application, they seek to have preserved their right to participate in these proceedings without threats to their lives by the Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants initially took the position in their Reply that the Arbitral Tribunals may assume that they have jurisdiction for the purpose of making orders for provisional measures (see Reply, para. 2.3). However, the Claimants subsequently clarified in their letter of 18 March 2013, that this means the Tribunals must satisfy themselves that there is, *prima facie*, a basis upon which the Tribunals' jurisdiction might be established in regard to the merits of the dispute (see Claimants' 18 March Letter, para. 12).\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they have pleaded the bases of the jurisdiction in the Request for Arbitration and in the Memorial. Furthermore, the Claimants aver that the fact that the Respondent challenges the Tribunals' jurisdiction does not prevent the Tribunals from making an order for provisional measures, including in respect of procedural rights, relying on Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and ICSID case authority (see Claimants' 18 March Letter, paras. 1.3-1.4).\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the urgency and necessity criteria for the grant of provisional measures are met as follows (see Application, paras. 5.2 to 5.4):\n\n\"Urgency exists in the circumstances of this application as it is the Claimants' understanding that the instruction to kill Heinrich von Pezold has already been given. In any event, all allegations regarding a threat to life must \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 be treated as giving rise to urgency.\n\nIn regard to the issue of necessity, it will be recalled that necessity exists if irreparable harm or damage will occur in the event that the provisional measures are not ordered. Furthermore, it will also be recalled that provisional measures will usually be ordered in circumstances where the health or life of people are in jeopardy as compensation will not in those circumstances fully remedy the damage suffered.\n\nCompensation will not fully remedy the death of Heinrich von Pezold. Therefore necessity is established.\" [citations omitted]\n\n21.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Claimants seek an order from the Tribunals that the Respondent (see Application, para. 7.1):\n\n(a) Immediately instruct the Central Intelligence Organisation, the Police and all other Security Services in Zimbabwe, together with their officers, employees and agents that they are not to harm Heinrich von Pezold or any of the other Claimants, their families and staff;\n\n(b) Immediately instruct the Police to provide the Claimants with full protection and security; and\n\n(c) Does not take any further action to aggravate the dispute between it and the Claimants.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants' Application.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that the Arbitral Tribunals do not have jurisdiction to determine demands of the nature set forth in the Application, reasoning as follows (see Respondent's Observations, pp. 1-2):\n\n\"\u2026such jurisdiction is defined by the terms of the ICSID Convention as well as by the terms of the BITs potentially relevant to Claimants' alleged investments. Claimants' presents demands do not concern an investment, but rather the security of a person living on Respondent's territory.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention states that: \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\". This is not the case as the rumours brought forward by Claimants are general in nature, concern a person directly and not its supposed investment.\n\nArticle 4.3 of the Swiss[/Zimbabwe] BIT states that \"each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investors of the other Contracting party treatment not less favourable to him that [sic] which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.\"\n\nArticle 4 of the German[/Zimbabwe] BIT does not specifically address investors per se but only their investments.\n\nConsequently, Respondent would ask the members of the Arbitral Tribunal to decline to address Claimants' demands and otherwise order Claimants to raise their demands before proper legal forum. Moreover, Respondent respectfully submits that should the Arbitral Tribunal decide to review the claims, it would risk violating the necessary impartiality of the Arbitral Tribunal in this case, as it would demonstrate that it has already implicitly reached a decision as to jurisdiction over alleged investments.\n\nRespondent considers that the best proof that nothing threatens any of Claimants' lives is their future presence at arbitral hearings in Singapore, unless Claimants were to be organising a plan to be absent from hearings in Singapore.\"\n\n23.\n\nAs regards the facts underlying the Application, the Respondent states that the Claimants had not substantiated their allegations nor disclosed the alleged source of the information that a threat existed. The Respondent further states that Mr. von Pezold did not suffer any harm or threat at all even during the height of the land reform programme, expressing surprise that four years after initiating proceedings he would now perceive himself to be under threat.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent notes that news about the ICSID proceedings has been published and no harm has befallen Mr. von Pezold. The Respondent avers that the fact that 2013 is an election year is \"neither here nor there\", noting that 2012 was also considered to be an election year yet no threats against Mr. von Pezold were perceived.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the Claimants' Application as \"purely speculative and unnecessary\", submitting that it is the constitutional mandate of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and Zimbabwe's Security Services to protect everyone living in Zimbabwe, therefore it is unnecessary for the Tribunals to order the police and the Security Services to do what they do and have always done.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent also states that had the German Embassy received any report of a threat, it should have communicated with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, concluding that in the absence of such action the German Embassy must not have taken the so-called threat seriously.\n\n**C. The Claimants' Reply**\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants submit that whether or not they are alive by the time of the hearing in Singapore will not determine their existing safety (see Claimants' Reply, para. 3.1). They aver that previous threats have in fact been made against Mr. von Pezold and his staff, stating that during the height of the land reform programme they were in fact humiliated, threatened with death and assaulted, had firearms put to their heads, and were abducted.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants also contend with respect to the present alleged threat that it is not realistic for the Claimants to disclose their source to the Respondent, as this would put the source's life in danger, but note that the German Government has taken it seriously enough to raise with the Zimbabwean Government (see Claimants' Reply, paras. 4.1-4.2).\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants submitted with their Reply a letter from the German Ambassador to the Zimbabwean Minister of Lands and Rural Resettlement, which they called a \"Note Verbale\" and which adverts to the threat to Mr. von Pezold.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that they are not reassured by the Respondent's statements regarding the duty of the Zimbabwean police and its security services, providing the details of a recent Zimbabwean High Court judgment which addresses certain events that took place in 2001, heavily critical of the police and other materials critical of the CIO (see Claimants' Reply, paras. 7.1-7.3).\n\n**D. The Respondent's Rebuttal**\n--------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn its Rebuttal, the Respondent contended that the Claimants' allegations of a death threat against Mr. von Pezold remain unproven and have not given rise to any Note Verbale, contrary to what the Claimants had stated in their Reply. First, the Respondent reasons that had the Respondent or its police force or any State Entity had the intention to kill Mr. von Pezold, he would have already been killed during the height of the land reform programme (see Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 2).\n\n32.\n\nSecond, the Respondent provided copies of the two Notes Verbales from the German Embassy to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 5 December 2012 and 4 March 2013, respectively, relating solely to the events which are the subject of Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the letter attached to the Claimants' Reply from the German Ambassador to the Minister of Lands and Rural Resettlement as a \"simple multi-topic letter \u2013 not a note verbale\", observing that the alleged threat to Mr. von Pezold's life is mentioned in that letter almost as an aside. The Respondent goes on to state the following (see Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 3 and 4):\n\n\"The German Ambassador's focus in that letter is on the Muzite-Smalldeel need for protecting the 'freshly harvested macadamia nuts'. Unlike the language quoted above from the two notes-verbales, the 7 March 2013 letter makes no appeal for the Ministry's intervention. The Germany Ambassador does not even seek the Minister's intervention for Heinrich's protection in connection with what it characterises as the 'very concrete death threat'.\n\nSurely, were the German Embassy to have any credible evidence of a death threat, it would not have had recourse to a simple, multi-topic letter discussing various matters and making no appeal to Zimbabwean authorities.\"\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent concludes therefore that the German Embassy has not attributed any weight to the alleged death threat.\n\n35.\n\nThird, the Respondent states that the only support provided by the Claimants for their Application relates to conditions prevailing in Zimbabwe in 2002, which are, in the Respondent's view, in no way analogous to conditions in Zimbabwe today.\n\n**E. The Parties' Further Observations**\n----------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn their letter of 20 March 2013, the Claimants submit that the Respondent seeks to elevate form over substance, as regards the letter from the German Ambassador to the Minister of Lands and Rural Resettlement. The Claimants underscore that the death threat was referred to in the letter and it was on this basis that the Ambassador was recalled to Germany, as explained in the letter, to \"report 'on the ongoing deterioration of the security situation in Zimbabwe'.\" (see Claimants' 20 March Letter, para. 2).\n\n37.\n\nAs regards the conduct of the Zimbabwean police and Security Service, the Claimants provided additional press reports which support, in their view, that Zimbabwe's Security Services and police consider themselves to be above the law, thereby rendering any undertakings or promises with regard to the safety of the Claimants unsatisfactory (see Claimants' 20 March Letter, para. 3.1 to 3.6).\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, the state of things in Zimbabwe today is not vastly different from what it was in 2002, and therefore they continue to request an order for provisional measures on the terms expressed in the Interim Directions.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent, in its final submission dated 22 March 2013, reiterates its position that the Claimants' accusations are unfounded and urges the Tribunals to note that the Application is \"merely sensational, improbable and unfounded\" and to dismiss it in its entirety.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Authority to Grant Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunals recall that the Claimants' Application was made pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:\n\n**\"Article 47**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n41.\n\nThe procedure with respect to provisional measures is outlined in Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n**\"**\n\n**Rule 39**\n\n(1)\n\nAt any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n42.\n\nIt follows from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules that the Tribunals have the power to recommend provisional measures at any time after the institution of the arbitration and must give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunals note that, notwithstanding the fact that an objection to jurisdiction is pending, an ICSID tribunal can render a decision on a request for provisional measures. This is borne out by the decisions of numerous ICSID tribunals and is made clear in several legal writings.\n\n44.\n\nIn particular, Christoph Schreuer comments as follows on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and the pending issue of jurisdiction (see C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A commentary* (2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press: 2009), at pp. 771-772):\n\n\"Giving priority to a request for provisional measures also means that it has to take precedence over any other issues pending before the tribunal. Where a party has raised jurisdictional objections, the tribunal may have to decide on provisional measures before having ruled on its own jurisdiction. As a consequence, a party may be exposed to provisional measures even though it contests the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. On the other hand, the urgency of the matter often makes it impossible to defer provisional measures until the tribunal's jurisdiction has been fully argued and decided.\n\nThis question has arisen frequently before other arbitral tribunals and before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The case law of the ICJ has adopted the approach that a *prima facie* showing of jurisdiction is sufficient to establish its power to indicate provisional measures. As held in the Judgment in the *Case concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay)* :\n\n[I]n dealing with a request for provisional measures the Court need not finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case but will not indicate such measures unless there is, prima facie, a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court might be established.\n\nThe ICSID Convention has a special feature which is helpful in this regard. Art. 36(3) of the Convention provides that the Secretary-General shall register a request for arbitration unless he finds that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. Therefore, unlike in other procedures, such as in State-to-State cases brought before the ICJ, there is a preliminary examination of jurisdiction before the case even reaches the tribunal. Although the tribunal is, of course, in no way bound by this preliminary examination of jurisdiction, it provides a useful basis for its power to recommend provisional measures. The Secretary-General's registration of a request, in accordance with Art. 36(3) of the Convention, does not preclude the tribunal from examining the question of jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures. It is equally clear that a party may continue to challenge the jurisdiction after provisional measures have been recommended until the tribunal has formally decided on its competence (see Art. 41, paras. 11-15). It is ultimately with the tribunal whether it will accept the Secretary-General's registration as a sufficient basis or whether it wants to form a *prima facie* opinion on jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures.\n\nIn *Holiday Inns v. Morocco*, the question of jurisdiction was still disputed when the Tribunal gave its decision on provisional measures. The Tribunal said:\n\nThe Tribunal, \u2026considers that it has jurisdiction to recommend provisional measures according to the terms of Article 47\u2026, the Parties still having the right to express, in the rest of the procedure, any exception relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on any other aspects of the dispute.\n\n\u2026\" [citations omitted]\n\n45.\n\nMoreover, as the ICSID Tribunal in *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 stated (see Decision on Provisional Measures, para. 55):\n\n\"Whilst the Tribunal need not definitely satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in respect of the merits of the case at issue for purposes of ruling upon the requested provisional measures, it will not order such measures unless there is, *prima facie*, a basis upon which the Tribunal's jurisdiction might be established.\"\n\n46.\n\nIn their two Requests for Arbitration, the Claimants invoke several bases for jurisdiction. The Request for Arbitration related to ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15 (the \"**von Pezold RfA** \") was brought by nine members of the von Pezold family, eight of whom are allegedly nationals of both, Germany and Switzerland, and one Claimant, Bernhard Friedrich Arnd R\u00fcdiger von Pezold, is a national of Germany only.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the von Pezold RfA, the von Pezold Claimants rely on Zimbabwe's advance consent to ICSID jurisdiction contained in (i) the 1996 Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Zimbabwe on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection (the \"**Switzerland/Zimbabwe BIT**\") which entered into force on 14 April 2000 and remains in force today, and on Zimbabwe's advance consent to ICSID jurisdiction contained in (ii) the 1995 Agreement between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"**Germany/Zimbabwe BIT**\"), which entered into force on 9 February 2001, and which also remains currently in force (see von Pezold RfA, para. 91). Specifically, the von Pezold RfA states that Claimant [Bernhard Friedrich Arnd R\u00fcdiger von Pezold] relies on the Germany/Zimbabwe BIT, while all other von Pezold Claimants rely on Zimbabwe's consent to ICSID jurisdiction in both the Germany/Zimbabwe BIT and the Switzerland/Zimbabwe BIT. (Id.)\n\n48.\n\nArticle 11 of the Germany/Zimbabwe BIT states in relevant part:\n\n\"(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and a national [\u2026] of the other Contracting party concerning an investment of such national in the territory of the former Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If the dispute is not settled within six months of the date when it is raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to arbitration. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit the dispute to arbitration. Unless the parties in dispute agree otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 18 March, 1965. [\u2026]\"\n\n49.\n\nArticle 10 of the Switzerland/Zimbabwe BIT reads in relevant part:\n\n\"(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party [\u2026] consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months and if the investor concerned gives written consent, the dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. [\u2026]\"\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the von Pezold RfA, the written consent to ICSID arbitration for each of the nine Claimants is contained in a letter of 9 November 2009 addressed to the Minister of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion (see von Pezold RfA, para. 105), except for Claimant Adam Friedrich Carl Leopold Franz Severin von Pezold, who allegedly consented to ICSID arbitration by letter dated 2 March 2010, which was also addressed to the Minister of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion (see von Pezold RfA, para. 106).\n\n51.\n\nThe von Pezold RfA further states that each von Pezold Claimants \"restates and ratifies his/her consent to submit this legal dispute to arbitration administered by ICSID.\" (see von Pezold RfA, para. 106).\n\n52.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration related to ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25 (the \"**Border Timbers RfA**\"), the Claimants rely on Zimbabwe's advance consent to ICSID jurisdiction as set forth in the ICSID arbitration provision of Article 10(2) the Switzerland/Zimbabwe BIT (see above). The written consent to ICSID arbitration for each of the three Claimants is contained in the Border Timbers RfA itself (see Border Timbers RfA, para. 95).\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunals note, moreover, that there is no manifest reason for excluding their jurisdiction on a *prima facie* basis.\n\n54.\n\nSince the other requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (investment, parties and legal dispute) are not in issue, the Arbitral Tribunals are therefore satisfied that *prima facie* jurisdiction has been established and the Tribunals are thus empowered to decide the present Application.\n\n**B. Criteria for the Grant of Provisional Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Parties do not appear to dispute the substantive criteria required for the grant of provisional measures, to wit, that provisional measures should only be granted where they are necessary to preserve a party's rights and urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm. The Parties do dispute however whether these criteria are satisfied in the present case, including whether a right exists within the context of these investment proceedings capable of protection by provisional measures recommended under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n56.\n\nIt is well established that Article 47 of the Convention is based on Article 41(1) of the ICJ Statute1. It is also well established that an ICSID tribunal may, in certain circumstances, have recourse to the jurisprudence of the ICJ for guidance.\n\nArticle 41(1) of the ICJ Statute reads as follows : \"The Court shall have the power to indicate, if it considers that circumstances so require, any provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunals note that, in the *Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark)*, Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures, Order dated 29 July 19912, the ICJ unanimously determined that a measure is urgent when \"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is given\".\n\n1991 I.C.J. Rep. 12 at page 17\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunals also note that in *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case (Greece v. Turkey)*, Request for the Indication of Interim Measures of Protection, Order dated 11 September 19763, President Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga in a separate opinion opined that a provisional measure is necessary when the actions of a party \"are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked\".\n\n1976 I.C.J. Rep. 3 at page 11\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunals will accordingly be guided by those decisions which they find apposite in the circumstances of the present cases.\n\n60.\n\nIn their Application, the Claimants assert that the right to be preserved is the Claimants' \"right to participate in these proceedings without threats to their lives by the Respondent\" (see Application, para. 4.1).\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunals find that the Claimants have adduced sufficient *prima facie* evidence that instructions to kill Mr. Heinrich von Pezold have been issued to the Respondent's Central Intelligence Organization.\n\n62.\n\nAccordingly, the measures which the Claimants seek, in the view of the Tribunals, are urgent and necessary since any action of any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent which could endanger the life and safety of the Claimants, in particular of Mr Heinrich von Pezold, is capable of causing irreparable prejudice to their right to participate in the present proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunals are also of the view that any prejudice caused to the Respondent by issuing an order for provisional measures in this respect is far lesser than the risk to the life and safety of Mr Heinrich von Pezold if the Tribunals declined to issue an order.\n\n64.\n\nTherefore, after having considered the extensive submissions of both Parties and the circumstances which obtain in Zimbabwe at the moment, the Tribunals have decided to confirm, by this Order, the Interim Directions issued on 8 March 2013, and, in addition, to order the Respondent to report to the Tribunals periodically on the protection measures adopted in compliance with the present Order.\n\n**V. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS' DECISIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Members of the Arbitral Tribunals, having deliberated, unanimously direct that:\n\n(a) The Respondent immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent (the \"**Protection Measures**\");\n\n(b) The Respondent allow the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, to participate, in so far as it may be possible, in the planning and the implementation of the Protection Measures;\n\n(c) The Respondent report in writing to the Tribunals on the Protection Measures adopted in compliance with the present Order on 15 April 2013; and\n\n(d) The Respondent also report in writing to the Tribunals on the Protection Measures adopted on 15 May 2013.\n\n66.\n\nThis Order is without prejudice to all substantive issues in dispute between the Parties and should not be considered as prejudging any issue of fact or law concerning jurisdiction or the merits of these cases.\n\n67.\n\nThere shall be no order as to costs."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2013-07-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, the Claimants brought an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"Application\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application relates to the arrival of a group of people referred to as the \"Thornton Party\" onto Thornton Farm, a part of the Border Estate allegedly expropriated in 2005, and the Respondent's alleged refusal of the Claimants' requests to remove them. According to the Claimants, some of the members of the Thornton Party appear to have been displaced from a neighboring community as a result of a diamond mining operation in which the Respondent is involved. The Claimants further state that the Thornton Party has shown an intention to permanently occupy Thornton Farm, has caused extensive damage to property and has attacked the workers' village on Thornton Farm.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants seek an order directing the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent all persons from coming onto the Forrester Estate, the Border Estate and the Makandi Estate (the \"Estates\"), and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Estates, to remove them, unless they are authorized by the Claimants.\n\n4.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals have considered the Application and have decided unanimously as follows:\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, the Tribunals' Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Respondent to file any observations it may have on the Application by 9 July 2013.\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, the Respondent filed its observations on the Application, requesting that the Tribunals dismiss the Application (the \"Respondent's Observations\").\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants submit that if the requested order is not made there is a serious risk of catastrophic forest fires on the Border Estate during the forthcoming dry season in Zimbabwe, which \"will destroy one of the very investments that are the subject of these proceedings (the forest plantations on Thornton Farm)\" (see Application, para. 1.4). The Claimants also submit that if the order is not granted, they will be unable to participate in these proceedings without being intimidated and the dispute will be aggravated.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Thornton Party moved onto the Thornton Farm in December 2012 and, since that time, has cleared 75 ha of pine plantation through manual means and by lighting fires. According to the Claimants, members of the Party have built homesteads and planted crops on this cleared land, and continue to clear pine plantation by lighting fires. The Claimants place significance on the lighting of fires by the Thornton Party, noting that the risk of forest fires is particularly high going into the dry season. The risk of a catastrophic forest fire is stated to be heightened because the Thornton Party has blocked access roads, rendering a timely response by fire crews difficult if not impossible. The Claimants explain that between 2002 and 2010, 13,778 ha of plantation on the Border Estate were damaged by fires, including fires lit by settlers (see Application, paras. 3.3 and 3.5).\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, one of the Claimants, Border Timbers Limited, successfully obtained a provisional order from the local court for the eviction of the Thornton Party. This order provides as follows (see Exh. C-000860, paras. 1-4):\n\n\"The Respondents jointly, and all those acting through them are interdicted forthwith from carrying out any farming or any other activities and operations and erecting illegal structure in applicant's property namely Thornton Farm situated in Chimanimani District for which applicant has a right of occupation referred to in Applicant's Affidavit hereto.\n\nThe Respondents and all those through then [sic] are interdicted from going to applicant's property on Thornton Farm, without the applicant's express authority and consent thereby interfering with the applicant's operations in anyway in the property.\n\nThe Respondents and all those through then [sic] are ordered to give applicant and its employees undisturbed right of use to its property namely Thornton Farm, Chimanimani.\n\nThe Respondents to remove all illegal structures on Applicant's property forthwith.\"\n\nThe order was made final on 30 January 2013 and appears to remain in place to date (see Application, para. 3.10).\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 and 23 January 2013, pursuant to the provisional order, a court official and the police evicted some members of the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm. However, the Claimants state that other members of the Thornton Party evaded eviction and therefore further evictions were carried out on 9 May 2013 (see Application, para. 3.11). The Claimants further state that the situation in recent weeks has escalated, allegedly due to the political activities of Mr. Robert Sacco and his son, Mr. Joshua Sacco, whereby they have encouraged more people to join the Thornton Party and support Joshua Sacco's bid to win the ZANU-PF primaries in the electorate of Chimanimani East, in which Thornton Farm is located. The Claimants estimate that the ranks of the Thornton Party have now swelled to at least 100 people (see Application, para. 3.15).\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, on the evening of 2 July 2013, members of the Thornton Party attacked the workers' village on Thornton Farm, returning the following morning wielding machetes and knobkerries. The Claimants state that later that day, 3 July 2013, the police attended Thornton Farm with Joshua Sacco and asked the Thornton Party to \"co-exist\" with the Border Estate's employees. The Claimants submit that whatever the reason for the swelling in size of the Thornton Party, the Respondent has changed its attitude and now refuses to remove the Thornton Party (see Application, paras. 3.17-3.18).\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants note that they have corresponded with the Respondent's counsel on the matter and requested that the Respondent remove the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm. According to the Claimants, the Respondent stated in the course of the parties' exchanges that it cannot act without an order from the local courts and, moreover, that the order obtained on 14 January 2013 is invalid because it was obtained *ex parte*. The Claimants note that *ex parte* orders may validly be obtained in cases of urgency and that, in any event, the order was confirmed and made final. The Claimants submit that the real issue is the Respondent's refusal to act against the Thornton Party for which the Claimants speculate are political reasons relating to tensions within ZANU-PF (see Application, para. 4.1).\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants submit that although they are not required to exhaust local remedies before seeking relief from the Tribunals, there is in any event nothing further that the Claimants can do locally to evict the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm (see Application, para. 4.2). They further submit that all of the prerequisites for an order granting provisional measures are satisfied as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunals have *prima facie* jurisdiction over the merits of the disputes, as pleaded in their Requests for Arbitration and in their Memorial, and as confirmed by the Tribunal in PO No. 5 (see Application, paras. 5.1-5.2);\n\n(b) The Claimants seek the preservation of three existing rights, being (i) their entitlement to the return of Thornton Farm, including the plantations thereon; (ii) their right to participate in these proceedings without being intimidated directly or indirectly by the Respondent or other persons; and (iii) their right that the dispute between the parties is not aggravated by the Respondent (see Application, paras. 6.3-6.6);\n\n(c) The Claimants submit that the presence of the Thornton Party is highly prejudicial - and therefore meets the criterion of urgency - given the nature of the investment in question (i.e., the plantations), as their presence presents a serious risk of catastrophic forest fire that could destroy the plantations and Thornton Farm's value. The Claimants submit that their right not to be intimated and their right to the non-aggravation of the dispute is also prejudiced by the presence of the Thornton Party, noting the attack on the workers' village (see Application, paras. 8.1-8.4); and\n\n(d) The Claimants submit that irreparable harm or damage will occur \u2013 thereby satisfying the criterion of necessity \u2013 if provisional measures are not ordered because the matters engaged by the rights the preservation of which is sought in this Application cannot be fully remedied by compensation (see Application, paras. 9.1-9.4).\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants justify the scope of the order being requested, that is an order which would apply in respect of any unauthorized person entering onto any one of the three Estates, as opposed to an order applicable solely to the Thornton Party and Thornton Farm, as follows (see Application, paras. 10.2-10.6):\n\n\"The general assumption in Zimbabwe is that between now and 14 August 2013 there will be a national election. The last national election (in 2008) was marked by political violence. Human Rights Watch has warned that the forthcoming elections will also be violent. The Claimants are very concerned that if large numbers of Settlers are allowed onto the Estates it greatly increases the chances of political violence occurring on the Estates, whether between Settlers or between Settlers and the Claimants' 6.500 employees.\n\nThe chance of such violence is increased because it is reasonable to assume that the Settlers have political views that are opposed to those of the Claimants' employees (note the attack on the workers' village on 2 July 2013 \u2013 see para. 3.17 above). This divergence in political opinion arises out of a number of matters, including the fact that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, initiated the expropriation [sic: of] the Claimants' land in 2005, which the Settlers wish to occupy, but which could destroy the livelihood of the Claimants' employees.\n\nFurther, the chance of violence is increased by the fact that the congregation of large numbers of people in one place acts as magnet for political activists seeking to promote political violence.\n\nThere is also an air of despondency among some rural people partly arising out of the fact that food security is on the rise as a result of the expropriation of the large scale farming sector.\n\nFinally, there have been a number of Invasions on the Estates that have been brought to the attention of the tribunals to date. As a result of the correspondence that the Respondent had submitted to the Tribunals in regard to an earlier application for provisional measures (that concerned the Muzite Party) the Claimants had understood that the Respondent intended to instruct its Police force to stop Settlers invading the Estates. However, the Respondent appears to be no longer willing to do so, or at least to be inconsistent as to whether or not it will act in such circumstances. If the Tribunals accept the grounds of this application in regard to Thornton Farm, then those grounds are equally applicable to all properties within the three Estates. In such circumstances it would be far more efficient to have one order in regard to all of the Estates as opposed to the Claimants having to make an application each time there is an Invasion of a particular property.\" [citations omitted]\n\n**B. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Border Estate is not the only forestry estate in Zimbabwe facing threats of unlawful entry or settlement. The normal route, according to the Respondent, is for owners of plantations to have recourse to civil court proceedings in order to evict any unauthorised persons on their properties. The Respondent submits that this is what the Claimants have done in the past and should do now (see Respondent's Observations, p. 1.).\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Thornton Party is a group of persons totally independent from the Respondent's control and not associated with the Land Reform Programme, and it is therefore incorrect to allege that the Respondent is violating any of the Claimants' rights. The Respondent avers, however, that it will act if this or any other group of people engage in any criminal activity (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent explains the process engaged by the Claimants through the local courts as follows (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2):\n\n\"Under domestic law, execution of the Provisional Order granted to Claimants on 14th January 2013, C-000860, meant that the court official designated to execute such orders, being the messenger of court, became *functus officio* together with the police who were empowered to arrest the Thornton Party after the successful execution of the order.\n\nIn terms of domestic procedure, any defiance of the court order after its successful execution can only be cured by an order of contempt made by the same court that granted the defied order. Such contempt order does not involve the police, as it is a civil matter where the applicant must approach the civil court on application and the concerned party is given an opportunity to respond.\n\nIn such proceedings the domestic court will issue further orders designed to stop/mitigate the contempt. In the event that such an order involves the police or any arm of the State to assist in diminishing the contempt, then the Respondent will be obliged to act.\"\n\n18.\n\nAs an alternative, the Respondent states that the Claimants could institute fresh eviction proceedings and seek an order that would require the Respondent to assist the court official charged with execution of court orders (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent observes that as primary elections have already come and gone, they are no longer an issue among the Thornton Party. Additionally, the Respondent avers that it cannot be stated with any certainty that there will be any violence in the forthcoming elections. As regards to the threat of fires, the Respondent dismisses the Claimants' reliance on destruction caused to timber plantations over the period from 2002 to 2010 in support of an alleged issue arising in 2012, submitting that this is not a new issue (see Respondent's Observations, p. 3).\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that even if the Arbitral Tribunals were minded to grant provisional measures with regard to Thornton Farm, there would be no justification for extending the relief to the other Estates, as provisional measures are extraordinary and should be limited to exceptional situations and circumstances that require such measures to be issued (see Respondent's Observations, p. 3).\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals recall that Procedural Order No. 4, dated 16 March 2013 (\"PO No. 4\"), and Procedural Order No. 5, dated 3 April 2013 (\"PO No. 5\"), both dealt with applications for provisional measures brought by the Claimants pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The legal framework for the grant of provisional measures under the ICSID Convention is set out in those provisional orders and shall not, therefore, be repeated here. It is useful, however, to recall briefly the applications which were the subject of PO No. 4 and PO No. 5, including their disposition.\n\n22.\n\nIn PO No. 4, the Arbitral Tribunals considered the Claimants' application for an order instructing the police to prevent persons from entering onto Smalldeel farm, a property located on the Makandi Estate and, as the case may be, to remove any unauthorised persons already on the property (i.e., the \"Muzite Party\"). The Tribunals dismissed the application without prejudice to any further application that either Party might wish to bring on the basis that the Respondent had voluntarily provided undertakings to ensure that the *status quo* was maintained and directed the police to remove the offending persons, and that the provincial police had undertaken to act on any reports they received in relation to the matter (see PO No. 4, paras. 26-28). The Tribunals nevertheless strongly encouraged the Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid the aggravation of the dispute.\n\n23.\n\nIn PO No. 5, the Arbitral Tribunals considered a second application by the Claimants for an order, *inter alia*, that the Respondent instruct its Central Intelligence Organisation, police and all other Security Services in Zimbabwe not to harm Heinrich von Pezold or any of the other Claimants, their families and staff. The Tribunals granted the requested relief in part, ordering the Respondent to \"immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent\" (the \"Protection Measures\") and to report on the Protection Measures adopted at regular intervals. The Respondent's reporting obligations were also addressed during the 21 May 2013 telephone conference held between the President of the Tribunals and the parties, and later summarized in a letter from the Tribunals' Secretary to the Parties, dated 23 May 2013, as follows:\n\n\"While the proceedings are suspended, the Respondent's reporting obligations pursuant to Procedural order No. 5 remain in place: the Respondent is to continue to provide an update to the Members of the Tribunals on the 15th of each month until the commencement of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits.\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunals were satisfied on the evidence presented in support of the application the subject of PO No. 5 that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures were met and therefore the Tribunals issued an order that they considered to be proportionate to the concerns raised in the Claimants' application.\n\n25.\n\nIn the present Application, however, the Tribunals are not satisfied on the evidence that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures, and in particular those of urgency and necessity, are met. The Claimants essentially seek an order directing the Respondent to instruct its police force (i) to prevent any and all unauthorized persons from coming onto any one of the three Estates and, (ii) with respect to any unauthorized persons presently on any one of the Estates (since 8 July 2010), to remove such persons. Such an order is extremely broad in scope and, in the Tribunals' view, disproportionate to the matters raised in the Application.\n\n26.\n\nThe matters raised in the Application primarily relate to the recent unauthorised entry onto Thornton Farm, property located within the Border Estate, of the Thornton Party and activities in which the members of the Thornton Party have engaged which allegedly jeopardize the value of Thornton Farm and intimidate the Claimants' and/or their employees on Thornton Farm. The Claimants acknowledge that the factual background to their Application \"largely concerns the Thornton Farm\", yet submit that an order covering the whole of all three of the Estates would nonetheless be appropriate for the reasons articulated at paragraph 14 above. These reasons appear to be inspired primarily by fears of political violence that may occur in connection with upcoming national elections in Zimbabwe and on the Estates in particular, and concern that the Respondent may no longer be willing to instruct its police force to ensure the *status quo* during the pendency of these proceedings, as it had committed to do in response to the application the subject of PO No. 4. The Claimants reason that the most efficient course in the circumstances would therefore be to secure a single order applicable to all of the Estates rather than make an application each and every time there is an invasion of a particular property.\n\n27.\n\nWhilst the Tribunals are sensitive to the concerns raised by the Claimants in respect of unauthorised persons entering onto the Estates and, in particular, concerns relating to the aggravation of the disputes, efficiency is not a sufficiently compelling reason for granting the breadth of relief requested by the Claimants, nor is a general concern regarding the \"chance\" for increased or future political violence. It is nigh impossible to assess whether the circumstances require the Tribunals to recommend that provisional measures be taken to preserve the Claimants rights, as is the Tribunals' mandate under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, in the absence of a specific factual matrix against which criteria of necessity and urgency, for example, may be considered. The Tribunals are not persuaded on the basis of the Application with which they are presently seized that the broad relief requested by the Claimants is required.\n\n28.\n\nEven were the Tribunals to consider a narrower scope of relief pertaining exclusively to the unauthorized presence of the Thornton Party on Thornton Farm, the Tribunals are still not persuaded that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures are satisfied. In considering the necessity of provisional relief, the Tribunals note, in particular, that the Claimants successfully obtained an order from a local court in January 2013, which remains in force, ordering the eviction of the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm, the removal of any structures built on the property, and the exclusion of the Thornton Party from re-entering the property without the Claimants' authorization. The Claimants themselves state that evictions have been successfully carried out pursuant to the order twice since its issuance (see Application, paras. 3.11 and 3.12).\n\n29.\n\nAlthough it appears that there may have developed some reluctance more recently by local law enforcement to assist in carrying out the order, there is, as described above, a process in place for the Claimants to challenge any non-compliance with the order through contempt proceedings. Notwithstanding the Claimants' submission that they are not required to exhaust local remedies before seeking provisional relief, there is no evidence before the Tribunals that seeking the assistance of the local court through contempt proceedings is likely to be futile. On the contrary, the local court appears to have responded swiftly in response to the Claimants' previous request for assistance.\n\n30.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to the urgency criterion, the Tribunals note that the primary elections which were alleged to have been the reason for a swelling in the ranks of the Thornton Party following issuance of the eviction order have, according to the Respondent, \"come and gone\" (see Respondent's Observation, p. 3). The stated impetus for an escalation of events at Thornton Farm in disregard of the eviction order therefore appears to have passed.\n\n31.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunals dismiss the Claimants' application without prejudice to any future application that they may wish to bring should circumstances in relation to Thornton Farm or any other property located on the Estates change.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunals also record their concern over the matters raised in the Application. The Respondent's failure to address the Claimants' assertion that the police attended at Thornton Farm following the events of 2 July 2013 and asked the Thornton Party to \"co-exist\" with the Border Estate's employees (see Application, para. 3.17) is troubling in view of the eviction order, issued by the local court, in force at the time. The Respondent acknowledged in its Observations that, under Zimbabwean law, the \"messenger of court, became *functus officio* together with the police who were empowered to arrest the Thornton Party after the successful execution of the order.\" (see Respondent's Observation, p. 2; emphasis added). It is therefore somewhat disingenuous for the Respondent to state that \"it is up to the Claimants to obtain court orders for the eviction of the group using the normal court process\", given that such an order was in place when the police allegedly attended at Thornton Farm on 3 July 2013.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunals reiterate their strong encouragement of the Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid further aggravation of the disputes between them. In this connection, the Tribunals consider that the undertakings provided by the Respondent in response to the application disposed of in PO No. 4 are continuing insofar as they reflect the Respondent's general obligation to ensure that its organs, such as the police, maintain the *status quo* as at the time of the filing of the Claimants' cases in 2010 and carry out their official duties in good faith (see Respondent's letter of 8 March 2013, p. 2).\n\n**IV. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS' DECISIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Members of the Arbitral Tribunals have deliberated and decided unanimously to dismiss the Application.\n\n35.\n\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\n\nDated as of 22 July 2013"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-03-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.** Procedure\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Republic of Zimbabwe (the **\"Applicant\")** filed applications for annulment and requests for stay on enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the \"von Pezold Award\" and the \"Border Timbers Award,\" respectively, and together the \"Awards\") pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the **\"Committees\")** in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting the order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the **\"Application\").** Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties\u2019 filing of further observations on the matter.\n\n4.\n\nBy a letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committees, informing the Parties of the Committees\u2019 decision to deny the Applicant\u2019s request for an interim order and inviting Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the \"Respondents\" or \"VPB\") to submit their response to the Application by 2 March 2016.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed their response to the Applicant\u2019s Application (the \"Response\").\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 4 March 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties advising them that the Committees would rule on the Application on the basis of the record before them.\n\n**II.** Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicant\u2019s Application**\n----------------------------------\n\n1. **The Factual Basis of the Application**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Application arises from the publication of the von Pezold Award on the website of *ITA Law,* an investment arbitration information service, and the subsequent media coverage, including a series of articles on the von Pezold Award published by the *Investment Arbitration Reporter* **(\"IA Reporter\")** on 11 February 2016.1 The Applicant contends that it was the Respondents who were responsible for \"leaking\" the von Pezold Award to the media.2 The Applicant also claims that the Respondents had previously made the von Pezold Award publicly known by attaching it, on 20 August 2015, to an affidavit filed by Mr Peter Lewis Bailey, the judicial manager of Border Timbers Limited, in public High Court of Zimbabwe proceedings (the **\"Bailey Affidavit\").3**\n\nApplication, pp. 2-3, paras. 4, 9-12.\n\nApplication, pp. 4 *et seq.,* paras. 13 *et seq.*\n\nApplication, pp. 4-5, paras. 15-17; p. 7, para. 27.\n\n8.\n\nThe Applicant contends that counsel for the Respondents \"continued to heat the fire\" by further commenting on the von Pezold Award in an article published by the *Global Arbitration Review* on 16 February 2016. The Applicant notes that the article was inaccurate insofar as it reported that the arbitral tribunals in the original proceedings had held a five-day hearing, while in fact there were six days of hearings.\n\n9.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, contrary to what is suggested by the Respondents, the publication of the von Pezold Award on *ITA Law* cannot be attributable to the Applicant as only those Zimbabwe representatives who are on the ICSID mailing list and the Minister of Lands had access to the Awards; all other government officials were only provided with a summary.4 The Applicant also suggests that it cannot be a coincidence that *ITA Law* published precisely the same material that had been exhibited by the Respondents in the Zimbabwean High Court proceedings.5 According to the Applicant, the Respondents \"could have simply certified to the High Court of Zimbabwe in VPB\u2019s court papers that they had won in the ICSID award, summarizing or quoting a particular relevant passage,... instead of having their manager disclose the whole award.\"6\n\nApplication, p. 4, paras. 13-14.\n\nApplication, p. 8, para. 30.\n\nApplication, p. 5, para. 17.\n\n10.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that \"non-disclosure was the agreed rule and practice\" in the original proceedings, and that such practice \"also constitute[d] an agreement that should not be lifted without both parties\u2019 consent.\"7 According to the Applicant, this was reflected in the Parties\u2019 agreement not to consent to the publication of the arbitral awards, as recorded in procedural order No. 1 issued by the arbitral tribunal in the original proceedings.8\n\nApplication, pp. 5-6, paras. 19-23.\n\nApplication, pp. 5-6, paras. 19-23.\n\n11.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Respondents, by commenting on the Awards in the public domain, have exacerbated the dispute. The Respondents have also thereby diverted the Applicant\u2019s attention from its pleadings on the stay, and converted the legal debate into a political public debate.9 Indeed, a disruption of the Applicant\u2019s work on its pleadings appears to be the \"strategic goal\" of the Respondents.10 Even assuming the Respondents had not \"leaked\" the von Pezold Award, the Applicant submits that they have \"legitimized\" it by way of their legal counsel taking the initiative of commenting on the von Pezold Award in the media and subsequently issuing a press release, while the annulment proceedings are still underway.11 According to the Applicant, the Respondents\u2019 conduct is likely to continue if not stopped by the Committees.12\n\nApplication, p. 7, para. 25.\n\nApplication, p. 9, para. 39.\n\nApplication, pp. 7-8, paras. 26 and 34.\n\nApplication, p. 9, para. 38.\n\n**2.The Legal Basis of the Application**\n----------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn support of its Application, the Applicant relies on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.13 Quoting the decision on provisional measures in *Occidental Petroleum et al* v. *Ecuador,* the Applicant argues that, \"in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm.\"14\n\nApplication, p. 2, para. 2.\n\nApplication, p. 16, para. 59 (quoting *Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 61.)\n\n13.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Applicant argues that it seeks to preserve its right that the dispute between the Parties not be aggravated by the Respondents; that the dispute between the Parties not be transformed from a legal to a public, political forum; and that the Applicant\u2019s representatives not be harassed or their attention not be diverted from preparation of their pleadings in these annulment proceedings.15\n\nApplication, p. 16, para. 60.\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the requirements of urgency and necessity are also met. According to the Applicant, the matter is \"urgent\" as it is \"likely\" that the Respondents will take further action prejudicial to the rights of Zimbabwe before a final decision is issued in these annulment proceedings.\"16 Moreover, as the Applicant\u2019s right not to be intimidated during the course of these proceedings \"can never be fully remedied by compensation,\" there is also a risk of irreparable harm if the Applicant\u2019s request is not granted.17\n\nApplication, p. 18, para. 71.\n\nApplication, pp. 18-19, paras. 72-75.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant also stresses the importance of \"keeping the debates and documents among the parties and ICSID,\" citing various provisions of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules and ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, which address *inter alia* the confidentiality obligation of the members of ICSID tribunals and *ad hoc* committees, secrecy of deliberations, and the publication of ICSID awards.18 The Applicant also cites to a series of decisions in other ICSID cases, including *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* in which the arbitral tribunal recommended provisional measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of the proceedings, and in order to avoid aggravation of the dispute.19 However, while the Applicant refers to, and \"reiterates,\" its requests to the Committees in its annulment application of 21 October 2015, its formal request for relief in the Application does not contain requests relating specifically to confidentiality.20\n\nApplication, pp. 10-14, paras. 41-53.\n\nApplication, pp. 12-13, para. 49. *See* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, 29 Sept. 2006.\n\nApplication, pp. 19-20, para. 79.\n\n16.\n\nIn conclusion, the Applicant requests that the *ad hoc* Committees \"order and declare\" that the Respondents and their counsel:\n\na. \"have not respected the *status quo;*\n\nb. cease and desist arguing issues subject to these Annulment Proceedings in the press;\n\nc. not further aggravate the dispute or the Applicant;\n\nd. not frustrate the eventual annulment decision; and\n\ne. maintain the *status quo.\"21*\n\nApplication, p. 1 and p. 20.\n\n**B. The Respondents\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1.Response to the Applicant\u2019s Factual Allegations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondents suggest that the only dispute between the Parties as to facts is whether the publication of the von Pezold Award on 10 February 2016 was made possible by the disclosure of this award by the Applicant or the Respondents. However, according to the Respondents, this issue is irrelevant because ICSID awards are not confidential.22\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 4.\n\n18.\n\nIn any event, the Respondents deny that they \"leaked\" the von Pezold Award.23 The Respondents accept that the von Pezold Award was exhibited to the Bailey Affidavit on 20 August 2015, but claim that this was consistent with the \"best evidence rule\" that applies in Zimbabwe. Moreover, there was no wider publication of the von Pezold Award at the time, and the Applicant did not complain about this particular disclosure until six months later, on 23 February 2016.24\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 4.\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 5.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondents explain that their lead counsel, Mr Matthew Coleman, was contacted by two different journalists in September and October 2015, but refused to disclose the Awards.25 In February 2016, he was again approached by a journalist who informed him that the von Pezold Award had been published on *ITA Law,* and that a series of articles on the Award were to be published on the *IA Reporter.* Mr. Coleman informed the Applicant\u2019s lead counsel, Mr Philip Kimbrough, of these developments, adding that \"it was someone in the Zimbabwean Government that provided the von Pezold Award to third parties.\"26 According to the Respondents, this was consistent with the fact that material from the original arbitration proceedings had been previously published by settlers opposing the Respondents in local court proceedings, which suggested that someone in the Zimbabwean Government was providing materials to third parties.27 In the circumstances, once the von Pezold Award had been published, there was no bar for the Respondents to comment on it as it was already in the public domain.\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 6.\n\nResponse, p. 3, para. 9.\n\nResponse, p. 3, para. 9.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the quotes their counsel supplied were measured and fully accurate, and the one rhetorically charged phrase attributed to them (the reference to an \"outright land-grab\" in the article appearing in *The Times of London)* was not a quote actually made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel.28 Similarly, while there were minor inaccuracies in the articles published in the *Global Arbitration Review* and *Law360,* these were \"not the fault of the VPBs.\"29\n\nResponse, p. 5, para. 14.\n\nResponse, p. 6, para. 17.\n\n**2.Response to the Applicant\u2019s Legal Argument**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondents note that *ad hoc* committees do not have power under Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention to order provisional measures, as Article 47 is not one of the provisions of the ICSID Convention that apply to annulment proceedings. However, they nevertheless accept that annulment committees have the power to issue provisional measures pursuant to Article 44 of ICSID Convention (which is referred to in Article 52(4) of the Convention) and, alternatively, based on their inherent power to ensure the integrity of the proceedings.30 According to the Respondents, the supporting rule in both circumstances is Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.31\n\nResponse, p.7, para. 19. Under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, \"[a]ny arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\nRule 39 deals with provisional measures.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondents state that they accept that, in order for the Committees to order interim relief, the Applicant must:\n\na. \"identify the substantive and procedural right that requires protection;\n\nb. establish that the measures proposed are urgent; and\n\nc. show that there is necessity, i.e., if the provisional measures are not ordered, there will be irreparable damage to the rights that Zimbabwe seeks to protect.\"32\n\nResponse, p. 7, para. 20.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondents also argue that, in order to be in a position to recommend provisional measures, the Committees must have jurisdiction over the Applicant\u2019s annulment applications; however, the Respondents accept that this is the case here.33\n\nResponse, p. 7, para. 21.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the interim relief sought by the Applicant is neither urgent nor necessary. There is no urgency because the Applicant did not seek interim relief as soon as it filed the annulment applications, even if the von Pezold Award (exhibited to the Bailey Affidavit) had been submitted already on 20 August 2015.34\n\nResponse, pp. 18-19, para. 49.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondents agree that \"[i]t is well-established that there is a right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute,\" however this right, which is \"a single right,\" is limited in scope.35 It is established in ICSID jurisprudence that this right \"only applies in respect of actions that would render the resolution of the dispute by the tribunal more difficult.\"36 Provisional measures may therefore only be ordered \"in regard to those aspects of a party\u2019s behavior that aggravate the dispute to such an extent that it would make resolution of the dispute by the tribunal more difficult: in other words, mere aggravation of the dispute between the parties... or a mere change in the *status quo* is not enough.\"37 According to the Respondents, no such circumstances exist in this case. The Respondents also confirm that they \"have no intention of aggravating the dispute between the parties to such an extent that it would make resolution of the dispute more difficult.\"38\n\nResponse, pp. 20-21, paras. 52, 55.\n\nResponse, p. 21, para. 58.\n\nResponse, p. 21, para. 58.\n\nResponse, p. 28, para. 76.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondents accept that the Parties have the right for the dispute to be resolved before the Committees and not in some other manner. However, they deny that the comments made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel in the press bear any connection to the issues before the Committees. Nor have they transformed, or risk transforming, the dispute before the Committees from a legal to a public, political forum.39\n\nResponse, p. 28, paras. 78-79.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondents also accept that, in order to ensure the integrity of the proceedings, the Parties have the right not to be harassed by each other.40 However, they deny that the mere publication of articles in the press on an award that has been published online can constitute harassment.41 Moreover, while speaking to the press, the Respondents \"merely exercised their right to free speech in a reasonable, calm and respectful manner.\"42 The Respondents also claim that, if the publication of the articles diverted the Applicant\u2019s attention from preparing its pleadings on the stay, this was not as a result of the Respondents\u2019 actions or even the media coverage of the von Pezold Award, but rather a consequence of the Applicant\u2019s decision to make its Application when, in the Respondents\u2019 view, it had no basis for doing so.43\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 80.\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 81.\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 81.\n\nResponse, p. 30, para. 84.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondents also deny that the provisional measures sought by the Applicant are necessary. According to the Respondents, \"[t]o the extent that Zimbabwe has the rights which it has pleaded (which the VPBs deny), the VPBs accept that the breach of those rights could not be remedied by the payment of damages.\"44\n\nResponse, p. 31, para. 86.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, although the Applicant does not specifically request in its prayer of relief that the annulment proceedings be kept confidential, the Respondents have assumed so for purposes of their submission, given the many references to confidentiality in the Application. In this connection, the Respondents clarify that \"it is not the VBPs\u2019 intention to disclose during the course of the Annulment Proceedings the pleadings or other documents filed by the parties during the course of the Arbitrations or the Annulment Proceedings.\"45 The Respondents also deny that there has been any agreement between the Parties as to confidentiality, and that the various provisions of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules and Administrative and Financial Regulations cited by the Applicant do not establish a general obligation of confidentiality binding on parties to ICSID arbitration or ICSID annulment proceedings, nor is there support for any such obligation in ICSID jurisprudence.46 According to the Respondents, \"[t]ailored confidentiality requirements have only been imposed to maintain the integrity of the proceedings and/or to prevent the aggravation of the dispute in extreme circumstances.\"47\n\nResponse, p. 8, para. 24.\n\nResponse, pp. 9-18, paras. 25-48.\n\nResponse, p. 17, para. 45.\n\n**III. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committees\u2019 Analysis**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s Application raises an issue that has also arisen before other *ad hoc* committees, but which has not yet been decided, as to whether an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is competent to recommend provisional measures in the first place.48 The issue arises because Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which deals with ICSID tribunals\u2019 power to recommend provisional measures, is not among the provisions listed in Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention which \"shall apply *mutatis mutandis\"* to proceedings before ICSID annulment committees. The omission of Article 47 from the list of the relevant provisions in Article 52(4) suggests that the power of ICSID annulment committees to recommend provisional measures has been intentionally excluded, possibly because under Article 52(5) of the Convention they may stay enforcement of an award pending their decision on annulment, which is effectively a special form of interim relief.49\n\n*See generally* Mallory Silberman, \"Annulment: What Are the Rules on the Rules,\" 10 June 2013, Kluwer Arbitration Blog, http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com.\n\n*See* Christoph Schreuer with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair: \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" 2nd edition, p. 1055.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, the matter is complicated by Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides that \"[t]he provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\" One of such rules applicable *mutatis mutandis* is Rule 39, which deals with provisional measures in great detail. The Respondents further suggest that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention is also relevant in this context as it establishes that \"[a]ny arbitration proceedings [and presumably therefore also any annulment proceedings] shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section.\" The Section in question (Section 3 of the ICSID Convention) contains Article 47, which as noted above deals with provisional measures.\n\n32.\n\nThe Committees note in this connection that the Parties agree that the Committees would have, at the very least, an inherent power to recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the present proceedings. However, in view of the conclusions reached below, the Committees do not consider it necessary to rule on this issue.\n\n33.\n\nWhen reaching their decision, the Committees have carefully considered the Applicant\u2019s Application, the supporting evidence and the legal argument submitted by the Applicant in support of its Application. The Committees are not persuaded that any provisional measures are required in the circumstances, and in any event the Applicant has not demonstrated that such circumstances exist.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, the Applicant has not demonstrated that the Respondents or their legal counsel are responsible for the alleged \"leak\" of the von Pezold Award to the public domain. The disclosure of the von Pezold Award in the proceedings before the Zimbabwe High Court cannot justifiably be considered an illegitimate \"leak\" as such disclosure was made for purposes of pursuing or protecting a legal right. In any event, ICSID awards are not confidential as such. Even if the ICSID Secretariat may publish an ICSID award only with the consent of the parties, it may publish excerpts of the legal reasoning of the tribunal without their express consent; see Rule 48(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Moreover, unless the parties have specifically agreed otherwise, either party may make the award publicly available, and indeed, this appears to be the way in which ICSID awards often become public in practice.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, the Committees are not persuaded that the statements made by the Respondents\u2019 legal counsel in the media were of such a nature as to aggravate the present dispute, or otherwise threaten the integrity of the present annulment proceedings. Indeed, parties to ICSID annulment proceedings must be considered to be entitled to comment on the ICSID award in question to the media, so long as this is done in a manner that does not amount to an attempt to litigate the pending annulment proceedings in the public domain, or in a manner that may otherwise aggravate the dispute. There is no evidence that this has occurred in the present case. Nor is there any evidence that the publication of the von Pezold Award or the statements made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel to the press would tend to frustrate the *ad hoc* Committees\u2019 eventual decision in these annulment proceedings. The Applicant\u2019s Application therefore stands to be dismissed.\n\n36.\n\nNonetheless, mindful of the importance and sensitivity of the matter before it, the Committees consider it appropriate to remind the Parties of their general obligation not to take any action during the pendency of these annulment proceedings that may aggravate the dispute. In this connection, the Committees note the Respondents\u2019 assurance that \"it is not the VPBs\u2019 intention to disclose during the course of the Annulment Proceedings the pleadings or other documents filed by the parties during the course of the Arbitrations or the Annulment Proceedings.\"50 The Committees take note of the Respondents\u2019 undertaking and expect that both Parties share and respect the spirit of this undertaking in the course of these annulment proceedings.\n\nResponse, p. 8, para. 24.\n\n**IV.** Decision\n----------------\n\n37.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide as follows:\n\na. The Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures is dismissed; and\n\nb. The Parties are reminded of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-10-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.** Procedure\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Republic of Zimbabwe (the **\"Applicant\")** filed applications for annulment (the **\"Annulment Applications\")** and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the \"von Pezold Award\" and the **\"Border Timbers Award,\"** respectively, and together the **\"Awards\")** pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the **\"Committees\")** in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. I on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings. In particular, Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting an order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties\u2019 filing of further observations on the matter.\n\n4.\n\nBy a letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committees, informing the Parties of the Committees\u2019 decision to deny the Applicant\u2019s request for an interim order and inviting Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the **\"Respondents\"** or \"VPBs\") to submit their response to the application by 2 March 2016.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed their response to the Applicant\u2019s application.\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Committees issued a Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures. The Committees dismissed the application, while reminding the Parties of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"Memorial on Stay\"), together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to ZALEX-072.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed a Counter-Memorial on Stay (the \"Counter-Memorial on Stay\"), together with Exhibits VPB-10 to VPB-26 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-18 to VPBLEX-57.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed a Reply to VPB\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Stay of Enforcement (the \"Reply on Stay\"). On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted a revised version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including witness statements by Dr J.P. Mangudya, Attorney General Prince Machaya and Mr Zvinechimwe Churu (ZA-121, ZA-137 and ZA-144, respectively) and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed a Rejoinder on Stay (the \"Rejoinder on Stay\"), together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043, including a witness statement by Mr Heinrich Bemd Alexander Josef von Pezold (VPB-32), and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the \"Application\").\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with an invitation from the Committees, on 23 September 2016, the Respondents filed a Response to Zimbabwe\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures (References to the Merits) (the \"Response\").\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 26 September 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties advising them that the Committees would rule on the Application on the basis of the record before them.\n\n**II.** Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA. The Applicant\u2019s Application\n------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Application arises out of references made in the Respondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Stay and Rejoinder on Stay to the merits of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications, in the context of whether or not the applications should be considered dilatory or otherwise *prima facie* without any merit. The Applicant requests that the Committees \"order and declare that the consideration of the merits of the Annulment Applications is excluded from Part I of these Annulment proceedings and thus fully reserved for Part II of these Proceedings,\" in accordance with Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. I.1\n\nApplication, para. 1.\n\n15.\n\nIn support of its Application, the Applicant relies on Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.2 The Applicant also refers to the Parties\u2019 earlier submissions in which they addressed the issue that gives rise to the Applicant\u2019s Application and requested that the Committees resolve the matter.3\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\nApplication, para. 3 (referring to the Reply on Stay, para. 321, and to the Rejoinder on Stay, para. 49).\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Application is urgent as there is an \"urgent need to protect the serenity of the proceedings,\" the Respondents having confirmed in their Rejoinder on Stay their \"intent... to debate the merits of the Annulment Applications\" in Part I of these proceedings, contrary to Procedural Order No. I.4 The Applicant argues that, unless the Committees grant the requested relief, the remaining steps in this Part I of the proceedings \"promise to be unnecessarily chaotic and disorderly and to prejudice Applicant\u2019s right to due process.\"5\n\nApplication, paras. 5 and 6.\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\n17.\n\nThe Applicant adds that the Application is timely, as Procedural Order No. 1 \"suspended the calendar during the month of August.\"6\n\nApplication, para. 10.\n\n18.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Applicant argues that it seeks to protect its \"full right to present the merits concerning the Annulment Applications... in the manner stipulated in [Procedural Order No. I].\"7 In the alternative, \"were the Committees to instruct the Parties to discuss any part of the merits in Part I of these proceedings,\" the Applicant\u2019s rights to be preserved also include \"to know the scope of any such discussion of the merits in Part I.\"8 This is necessary in order for the Applicant to be able to prepare its written and oral submissions for the remaining steps of Part I of these annulment proceedings.9\n\nApplication, paras. 11 and 12.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicant argues that its Application also meets the requirement of necessity, \"as irreparable harm would result\" if the scope of the remaining steps in Part I are not clarified.10 According to the Applicant, \"[i]n view of VPB\u2019s decision to argue the merits\" in Part I, if the requested provisional measures are not granted, the Applicant\u2019s right to due process would be harmed as it would not be in a position to respond before a final decision is given.11 This harm would be irreparable as the \"Applicant\u2019s right to know the scope of Skeleton Arguments and Oral Arguments on Stay in due time during the course of these proceedings, can never be fully remedied by compensation.\"12\n\nApplication, para. 15.\n\nApplication, para. 16.\n\nApplication, paras. 17 and 18.\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicant also addresses in detail the Respondents\u2019 submissions that give rise to the Application. It contends that the Respondents should have raised their argument that the Annulment Applications are manifestly unfounded under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), which requires such arguments to be raised within 30 days of the constitution of the Committees. As they did not do so, the Respondents are \"now foreclosed from doing so.\"13 In any event, the Respondents\u2019 own lengthy submissions demonstrate that the Annulment Applications are not manifestly unfounded or dilatory.14 In the circumstances, the Respondents\u2019 decision to argue the merits of the case in this Part I of the proceedings \"severely prejudges the merits to an extent that deprives Applicant of its due process right to serenely present its case on the merits in Part II of these proceedings as stipulated by [Procedural Order No. I].\"15\n\nApplication, para. 21.\n\nApplication, paras. 24 and25.\n\nApplication, para. 22.\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the issues raised by its Annulment Applications are \"heavy and substantive\" and therefore not suitable for \"summary disposition on a *prima facie* basis.\"16 Citing the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Libananco* v. *Turkey,* the Applicant submits that the Respondents\u2019 \"dilatory test\" is not sound; it applies only if a stay application has been brought without any basis under the Convention.17 According to the Applicant, \"given the universal nature of VPB\u2019s arguments on the merits any *prima facie* decision on a less than complete presentation of Applicant\u2019s full case..., gravely impinges upon its right to present the merits and would unduly and severely prejudge the case and its rights, as the issues involved are too heavy a topic to be addressed in a summary fashion.\"18 Citing *Amoco Iran International Finance Corporation* *v.* *Iran* and *AAP* *v*. *Sri Lanka,* the Applicant argues that it is not possible to rely on a *prima facie* test \"when a legal matter should be proven in a conclusive manner.\"19\n\nApplication, paras. 29-43.\n\nApplication, para. 32 (citing *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012), VBLEX-61.

Consequently:\n\na. The parties are not to brief, submit factual exhibits / legal authorities or argue the merits in Part I but will be free to brief, submit factual exhibits / legal authorities and argue these issues in Part II and\n\nb. The Committees will not consider and / or deliberate on any arguments and / or factual evidence or legal authorities regarding the merits during Part I.\n\n(d) VPB\u2019s invitation in Paragraph 28 of its Rejoinder, 'Before reviewing the following sub-sections, the Committees may wish to re-read paras 33-69 of the VPBs\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Stay. That is where the VPBs\u2019 arguments that the annulment applications do not meet the Non-Dilatory Requirement are set out in full' again constitutes discussion of the merits of Applicant\u2019s annulment applications from pages 16 to 21 of its Rejoinder on Stay and consequently:\n\na. out of sequence,\n\nb. deemed not written and\n\nc. shall not be discussed in Part I.\n\n(e) VPB\u2019s defense in its Rejoinder on Stay of its discussion of the merits in Part I under the guise of 'dilatory' will not be considered in Part I as it is based on the merits of heavy issues that are to be addressed only in Part II, particularly not in a cursory manner in Part I.\n\n(f) The 30 November 2016 Organizational conference call, the Parties Skeleton Arguments and the December 2016 Oral Argument shall not address the merits.\"22\n\nApplication, para. 55 (footnotes omitted).\n\n24.\n\nThe Applicant further requests \"clarification and confirmation of the scope\" of Procedural Order No. 1 as to \"(i) the number, sequence and calendar of pleadings specified in Art. 15 of [Procedural Order No. 1], [and] (ii) the right to accompany pleadings with documentary evidence and legal authorities.\"23\n\nApplication, para. 56 (footnotes omitted).\n\n25.\n\n\"Subsidiarily and in the alternative, were the Committees to refuse to grant Applicant\u2019s requests set out... above,\" the Applicant requests:\n\n(a) \"that the question of Stay be joined to the Merits and decided after the close of the agreed procedural steps relating to the merits listed in Procedural order N\u00b0 1, or\n\n(b) in the extremely unlikely event that the Committees were to wish to consider certain issues regarding the merits in connection with Part 1 of these annulment proceedings, that the Committees:\n\na. clearly indicate what circumscribed issues the Committees wish the Parties to address in the Skeleton Arguments and at the Oral Hearing, so as to:\n\nb. allow 30 days from PO N\u00b0 2 for Applicant to make written submission regarding any issues on the merits that the Committees consider relevant for determination in Part I and\n\nc. allow 15 days to VPB to further rebut Applicant\u2019s position on any issues on the merits that the Committees consider relevant for determination in Part l.\"24\n\nApplication, para. 57.\n\n**B. The Respondents\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondents state that they agree with the Applicant that the Committees have the power to order provisional measures under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which is applicable pursuant to Article 52(4) of the Convention, and under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.25\n\nResponse, para. 6.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondents further accept that, in order for the Committees to order interim relief, the Applicant must:\n\n(a) \"identify the substantive and procedural right that requires protection;\n\n(b) establish that the measures proposed are urgent; and\n\n(c) show that there is necessity, i.e., that if the provisional measures are not ordered there will be irreparable damage to the rights that Zimbabwe seeks to protect.\"26\n\nResponse, para. 7.\n\n28.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondents, the Committees must have *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications. For the purpose of the present Application, the Respondents accept that this is the case here, while reserving their right to argue at a later stage of the proceedings that the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications \"are not within the confines of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"27\n\nResponse, para. 8.\n\n29.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Respondents also agree that the Parties\u2019 procedural rights arising under Procedural Order No. 1, specifically the rights arising under Section 15 which provides that the proceedings shall consist of two phases, \"are rights that may be protected by an order for provisional measures.\"28 However, the Respondents deny that they have breached Procedural Order No. 1 and therefore request that the Application be denied.29\n\nResponse, para. 10.\n\nResponse, paras. 9-12.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondents recall that the Applicant in its Memorial on Stay and Reply on Stay argued that the Annulment Applications are not dilatory in nature and that this is relevant in deciding whether or not the stays should be lifted. The Respondents conclude from this that the Parties in fact agree that the requests for stay should not be granted if the Committees find that the Annulment Applications are dilatory. According to the Respondents, under Section 15 of Procedural Order No. 1 neither Party was prevented from arguing and applying the legal test which determines whether or not an annulment application is dilatory (the **\"Dilatory Test\"),** as \"such a test does not prejudge the merits.\"30 The Respondents add that, \"[t]o the extent that the VPBs refer to the merits of [the Annulment Applications],\" they do so \"only for the purpose of and in accordance with the Dilatory Test; they do not seek a final determination of the merits as the Dilatory Test neither requires nor permits such a determination.\"31 The Respondents argue that they have therefore not breached the Applicant\u2019s procedural rights, as they \"have merely responded to the legal argument raised by Zimbabwe as to the application of the Dilatory Test.\"32\n\nResponse, para. 13.\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Applicant appears to have misunderstood the Dilatory Test. The Respondents are not seeking a disposal of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), as a successful application of Rule 41(5) would bring the proceedings to an end, whereas \"a finding by the Committees that the Annulment Applications are dilatory does not.\"33\n\nResponse, para. 17.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the urgency requirement, the Respondents agree that the Application is urgent as it seeks protection of a procedural right. However, the Respondents argue that the Applicant has waived its right to seek protection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. The Respondents note that they had first addressed the Dilatory Test in their Counter-Memorial on Stay, which was filed on 11 June 2016. However, the Applicant waited over three months before filing the Application and thus \"has waived its right to object to the manner in which the VPBs have referred to the merits in their pleadings.\"34 In this connection, the Respondents refer to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, which provides that \"[a] party which knows or should have known\" that any applicable procedural rule has not been complied with, but \"which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed... to have waived its right to object.\"35\n\nResponse, paras. 18-20.\n\nResponse, para. 18.\n\n33.\n\nAs to the requirement of necessity, the Respondents accept that \"to the extent that Zimbabwe has the right which it has pleaded (which is denied),... the breach of that right could not be remedied by the payment of damages.\"36\n\nResponse, para. 21.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, in response to the further relief requested by the Applicant, the Respondents argue that:\n\n(a) The Applicant\u2019s request for \"clarification and confirmation of the scope\" of Procedural Order No. 1 is not a procedural or substantive right and therefore \"not amenable to an order on provisional measures;\"37\n\n(b) The Applicant\u2019s alternative request to join Part I to Part II is also not a procedural or substantive right of the Applicant. The Parties must comply with the procedural calendar set by the Committees, \"unless there are reasonable grounds for not being able to do so.\" According to the Respondents, no such grounds have been argued by the Applicant;38 and\n\n(c) Finally, should the Committees decide that the Respondents have not breached Procedural Order No. 1 by addressing the Dilatory Test, there is no need for further submissions on the merits of the Annulment Applications or guidance from the Committees as the matters would have been dealt with appropriately in the pleadings to date.

For the reasons set out below, the Committees do not consider it necessary to take a view on this issue at this time.\n\n38.\n\nThe Committees have carefully considered the Parties\u2019 submissions and the supporting evidence and legal authorities and, for the reasons set out below, have reached the conclusion that there is no basis to recommend provisional measures, even assuming the Committees had the power to recommend such measures.\n\n39.\n\nThe Applicant in its Application argues that the Respondents in their Counter-Memorial on Stay and Rejoinder on Stay have improperly attempted to argue the merits of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications, in breach of the Committees\u2019 decision in Procedural Order No. 1 to bifurcate the present annulment proceedings and to deal with the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay in Part I of the proceedings.43 The Applicant in particular objects to the way in which, or the extent to which, the Respondents have argued the issue as to whether or not the Annulment Applications should be considered \"dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive.\"\n\nThe Applicant refers, specifically, to Counter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 28-69 and Reply on Stay, paras. 28-44.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondents argue, in response, that they have merely replied to the Applicant\u2019s own argument in its Counter-Memorial on Stay and Reply on Stay, to the effect that its Annulment Applications are not dilatory, trivial or frivolous, and do not constitute an abuse of process.44\n\nResponse, para. 13 (referring to the Applicant\u2019s Memorial on Stay, paras. 2-12 and Reply on Stay, paras. 279,295, 298-299,301 and 359).\n\n41.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant raised in its Memorial on Stay the issue of whether its Annulment Applications meet what it referred to as \"threshold criteria\" of not being dilatory, trivial or frivolous, or an abuse of process.45 The Applicant argued that these criteria were met in this case. The Respondents then responded to these arguments in the Counter-Memorial on Stay, agreeing that these were the \"threshold criteria\" for the continuation of a stay.46 The Respondents then went on to argue that the Annulment Applications indeed were, in their view, \"dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive.\"47 The Applicant presented further argument on the issue in its Reply on Stay,48 and the Respondents replied in the Rejoinder on Stay.49\n\nMemorial on Stay, paras. 2-12.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, para. 28.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 33-69.\n\nReply on Stay, in particular paras. 292-301.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 6-44.\n\n42.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondents argued in their Rejoinder on Stay that the Applicant \"appear[ed] to acknowledge that an application will be dilatory if it is 'manifestly abusive,' 'baseless\u2019 (i.e. no *prima facie* case) or 'an abuse of process.'\"50 The Respondents indicated that, \"to the extent that the additional two criteria ('trivial' and 'frivolous') are not covered by the Non-Dilatory Requirement,\" they \"take no position on whether or not the jurisprudence on stays of enforcement supports them or as to whether or not they have been met in the present circumstances.\"51 Consequently, in the Respondents\u2019 view, the sole \"threshold criterion\" issue that remains before the Committees \"is whether or not the Non-Dilatory Requirement has been met.\"52\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 6 (footnotes omitted).\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 7.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 8.\n\n43.\n\nThe Committees note that both Parties have taken in their submissions the view that, in order for the Committees to be able to grant the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay, the Annulment Applications must meet certain \"threshold criteria.\" While the Parties do not agree on whether these criteria have been met, they appear to agree that the application of these criteria will require the Committees to make a preliminary or *prima facie* determination as to whether or not the Annulment Applications meet these \"threshold criteria.\" Thus, the Applicant in its Memorial on Stay argues:\n\n\"Applicant has established in its Annulment Applications that there is *prima facie* a reasonable case for seeking annulment, as the grounds and facts on which Applicant relies in the Annulment Application, if proved, lead to annulment. Although Applicant does not request and the *ad hoc* Committees are not in a position during this preliminary phase of proceedings to decide on the merits of the Applicants Annulment Applications, on their face, *prima facie,* were the facts and law Applicant presented to be proven, one can reasonably envisage the possibility that the Awards be overturned.\"53\n\nMemorial on Stay, para. 3. See also paras. 5, 12.\n\n44.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondents state in their Counter-Memorial on Stay:\n\n\"In its Memorial on Stay, Zimbabwe argues that the Annulment Application are not dilatory in nature, trivial, frivolous or an abuse of process. It groups these matters under the notion of 'threshold criteria' for the continuation of a stay on enforcement, as indeed they are.\n\n\u2026\n\n[W]here an annulment application is dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive, a stay of enforcement will not be ordered; but meeting these low hurdles is not a factor in favour of ordering such a stay.\"54\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 28, 30 (footnotes omitted).\n\n45.\n\nTherefore, the issue on which the Parties disagree is not whether an annulment application must meet certain \"threshold criteria\" for a request for continuation of a stay to be granted, but whether the Respondents, when responding to the Applicant\u2019s argument on this issue, have strayed beyond addressing the \"threshold criteria\" and have argued the merits of the Annulment Applications. That this is the subject matter of the dispute between the Parties is evident from the Applicant\u2019s Reply on Stay, where the Applicant contends that \"[the Respondents'] arguments [in the Counter-Memorial on Stay] focus on issues totally outside the 'threshold' tests regarding the stay\" and are \"directly pertinent to the merits of its case to be addressed in these proceedings during Phase II.\"55 According to the Applicant, \"VPB simply could not resist its urge to counter Applicant\u2019s reasoning in its Annulment Applications until the time it agreed to do so, as reflected in Procedural Order No. 1...\"56\n\nReply on Stay, para. 296.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 296.\n\n46.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties therefore concerns the legal criteria to be applied by the Committees in determining whether or not to grant the Applicant\u2019s requests that the stay of enforcement of the Awards be continued. While the Committees cannot make any determination on this issue at this stage of the proceedings, they note that, even assuming the Committees were to conclude that, for the Applicant to be able to prevail on its requests for the continuation of the stay, its Annulment Applications must meet certain substantive threshold criteria (and the Committees take no view at this stage on the content or indeed the existence of any such threshold criteria), the Committees\u2019 decision on any such threshold criteria would merely be relevant in determining whether the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay may or may not be granted; as a determination on this preliminary issue it would not, and indeed could not, prejudge the Committees\u2019 decision on the merits of the Annulment Applications, which will be briefed by the Parties and resolved by the Committees in Part II of these annulment proceedings. In these circumstances, there cannot be any risk that the Committees\u2019 decision could cause irreparable harm on the Applicant\u2019s right to present its case on the merits, which is the right that the Applicant seeks to protect by its Application.\n\n47.\n\nConsequently, the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of Merits in Part 1 stands to be dismissed.\n\n**IV.** Decision\n----------------\n\n48.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide that the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I is dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2017-04-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Applicant filed applications for annulment (the **\"Annulment Applications\")** and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Border Timbers Limited and others* v. *Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) and *Bernhard von Pezold and others* v. *Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) (the **\"Border Timbers Award,\"** and together with the **\"von Pezold Award,\"** the **\"Awards\")** pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Applications and at the same time notified the parties that enforcement of the Awards was provisionally stayed, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\")** was constituted in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(3). The members of the Committee are Dr Veijo Heiskanen, President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Finland, Ms Jean Kalicki, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Hungary, and Professor Azzedine Kettani, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council. All members were appointed by the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council. On the same date, Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the **\"Respondents\"** or **\"VPBs\")** and Zimbabwe (the **\"Applicant\")** (together, the **\"Parties\")** were duly informed of the commencement of the annulment proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nThe Committee conducted a joint first session with the Parties and the Secretary of the Committee by telephone conference on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceeding. In particular, Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n5.\n\nMoreover, Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides that the Annulment Applications would be conjoined and heard together. More specifically, Section 1.7 of Procedural Order No.l foresees that:\n\n\"The Committees shall issue separate decisions in relation to each Award but may nevertheless discuss these proceedings in decisions or procedural orders as a single set of proceedings, except where circumstances necessitate separate treatment.\"\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting an order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the **\"First Application\").** Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties\u2019 filing of further observations on the matter. By letter of 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee\u2019s decision to deny the Applicant\u2019s request for an interim order. On 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed a response to the First Application, requesting that the application be denied. The proceedings relating to the First Application are set out in detail in the Committee\u2019s Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, which was transmitted to the Parties on 17 March 2016. In their Decision, the Committee dismissed the First Application, stating that \"[t]he Committees are not persuaded that any provisional measures are required in the circumstances, and in any event the Applicant has not demonstrated that such circumstances exist.\"1 The Committee also reminded the Parties of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings.\n\nDecision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 17 March 2016, para. 33.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Memorial on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to ZALEX-072.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Counter-Memorial on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits VPB-010 to VPB-026 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-018 to VPBLEX-057.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed its Reply on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Reply on Stay\").** On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted a revised version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including witness statements by Dr J.P. Mangudya, Attorney General Prince Machaya and Mr Zvinechimwe Chum (Exhibits ZA-121, ZA-137 and ZA-144, respectively), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Rejoinder on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043, including a witness statement by Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-032), and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the **\"Second Application\").** On 23 September 2016, the Respondents filed a response to the Second Application, requesting that the application be denied. The proceedings in respect of the Second Application are described in detail in the Committee\u2019s Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I, which was transmitted to the Parties on 13 October 2016. In its Decision, the Committee dismissed the Second Application, stating that any decision\n\n\"[...] on this preliminary issue [...] would not, and indeed could not, prejudge the Committees\u2019 decision on the merits of the Annulment Applications, which will be briefed by the Parties and resolved by the Committees in Part II of these annulment proceedings.

On 18 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant\u2019s request for leave to file Exhibit ZA-152 and instructed the Respondents to file any observations they might have on that document within five business days of its production. Later that day, the Respondents filed their Skeleton Arguments on Stay (the **\"Respondents\u2019 Skeleton Arguments on Stay\")** and the Applicant filed its Skeleton Arguments on Stay (the **\"Applicant\u2019s Skeleton Arguments on Stay\")** and also Exhibit ZA-152.\n\n13.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, the Respondents filed their observations on Exhibit ZA-152 in the form of Exhibits VPB-044 to VPB-047 and a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048).\n\n14.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 30 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant leave to file an additional witness statement in response to the Respondents\u2019 observations of 25 November 2016.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 December 2016, the Applicant filed an additional witness statement of Dr J.P. Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-153). Together with the witness statement, the Applicant requested a procedural ruling from the Committee in advance of the scheduled hearing regarding alleged hearsay evidence contained in the additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048). On 4 December 2016, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant\u2019s request.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant\u2019s 2 December 2016 request for a procedural ruling from the Committee with respect to the alleged hearsay evidence. The Respondents requested that Exhibit VPB-048 be kept on the record in its entirety or, should the Committee decide to exclude it, then Exhibit ZA-152 be struck from the record as well.\n\n17.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference. During the call, in addition to discussing logistical arrangements for the upcoming hearing, the Parties agreed that there was no need for the Committee to strike portions of Exhibit VPB-048 from the record.\n\n18.\n\nA joint hearing on the stay of enforcement of the Awards was held in Paris, France, on 14 and 15 December 2016 (the **\"Hearing\").** In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following individuals were present at the Hearing:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *For the Applicant:* |\n| Mr Philip Kimbrough | Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s |\n| Mr Tristan Moreau | Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s |\n| Mr Prince Machaya | Attorney General, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Ms Fortune Chimbaru | Acting Director Civil Division, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Ms Elizabeth Sumowah | Legal Advisor, Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Ms Varaidzo Zifudzi | Principal Director, Legal Services, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Mr Chrispen Mavodza | Director, Legal Affairs Department Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Mr Zvinechimwe Ruvinga Churu | Principal Director - Budgets and Acting Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| *For the Respondents:* |\n| Mr Matthew Coleman | Steptoe & Johnson |\n| Ms Helen Aldridge | Steptoe & Johnson |\n| Mr Thomas Inn\u00e9s Mr Charles Verrill Mr Heinrich von Pezold | Steptoe & Johnson |\n\n*Court Reporter:*\n\nMr Trevor McGowan The Court Reporter Ltd.\n\n19.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the following persons were examined:\n\n*On behalf of the Applicant:*\n\nMr Prince Machaya Attorney General, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Willard L.

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 19 January 2017, the Respondents sent directly to the Applicant a request that it produce certain documents, and attached to their request Legal Authority VPBLEX-069. On 2 February 2017, the Respondents sent a further communication directly to the Applicant requesting additional updated information (this letter was subsequently introduced into the record as Exhibit VPB-050).\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, the Applicant produced Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 in response to the Respondents\u2019 document production request of 19 January 2017. The Applicant stated that Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 should \"properly inform the Parties without breaching the Applicant\u2019s confidentiality obligations.\"\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee stating that they did not consider the documents produced by the Applicant to satisfy their request for document production and asked the Committee to determine whether their request had been met. The Respondents also requested leave from the Committee to make observations and file new evidence in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155. On 14 February 2017, the Committee granted the Respondents\u2019 request to make observations and file new evidence.\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 February 2017, the Respondents filed an additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-049) in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee\u2019s decision to deny the Respondents\u2019 request for document production, taking note of the Applicant\u2019s refusal to produce the documents on grounds of confidentiality. The Committee noted that its decision was without prejudice to the determination, which it would make in due course, as to whether the Applicant had established the facts that the requested documents allegedly support.\n\n25.\n\nThe Applicant filed its Post-Hearing Brief on 9 March 2017 (the **\"Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief\"),** and the Respondents filed their Post-Hearing Brief on 10 March 2017 (the **\"Respondents\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief\").**\n\n26.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee requesting that certain allegations made in the Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief be disregarded. The Applicant commented on this request by letter dated 6 April 2017. By letter of 10 April 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties that the Committee had decided not to formally disregard the Applicant\u2019s allegations, and that it would assess the Applicant\u2019s allegations in terms of their relevance to the Applicant\u2019s request for stay and the evidentiary record of these annulment proceedings.\n\n**II.

Day 1, Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement, 105:3-107:8.\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicant submits that a demonstration that the Annulment Applications pass the *prima facie* threshold of not being dilatory shifts the burden of proof to the Respondents who would then have to establish that there are nonetheless reasons why the stay should be lifted.18\n\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\n36.\n\nThe Applicant also disagrees with the Respondents on a number of other points which, according to the Respondents, show that the Annulment Applications are dilatory and/or abusive. The Applicant argues that its claim for annulment based on non-disclosure cannot be abusive when Mr Fortier, the presiding arbitrator in the underlying arbitration, did not disclose his role as chair of the World Bank Sanctions Board until 548 days after his appointment;19 that there was no waiver because the relevant disclosure came too late in the proceedings;20 that any failure to object does not constitute a bar in annulment proceedings;21 and that the Applicant was indeed denied its right to be heard in relation to its illegality exception because it only had the opportunity to furnish a rushed pleading on this issue.22\n\nApplicant\u2019s Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 122-123.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 304.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 125-127\n\nApplicant\u2019s Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 138-145.\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicant further submits that the Respondents\u2019 claims that the Annulment Applications are dilatory unduly strays into a consideration of the merits that should not be entertained by the Committee in these stay proceedings.23 According to the Applicant, it is not possible for the Committee to decide that certain grounds listed in the Annulment Applications are dilatory without resolving matters that should only be considered as part of Part II of the proceedings on the merits.24\n\nTr.

Zimbabwe has strained financial (foreign exchange) resources and the Awards debt, USD 210 million, is substantial;48\n\nb. The award debt constitutes over 5% of Zimbabwe\u2019s overall budget, over 25% of its education budget and over 60% of its healthcare budget;49 and\n\nc. Having to pay or freeze the amounts due under the Awards would adversely impact on its ability to finalize its debt restructuring with the EU, the IMF and the World Bank.50\n\nApplicant\u2019s Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 153; Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief; para. 56.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 333; Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 53-55, 80.\n\nReply on Stay, paras. 240-241, 358.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the impact of the Awards is particularly significant for Zimbabwe, a country with a small economy that has been subjected to sanctions over the last fifteen years. It is therefore not a consequence that would arise in each and every annulment proceeding.51\n\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 62-63.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicant contends that if the stay were lifted, it would be required to make restitution of the properties and, if the properties ended up being held in the hands of a complex VPB structure or third party that would likely be difficult to localize, Zimbabwe would be unable to recover them if the Awards were annulled.52\n\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 81; *see also* Memorial on Stay, paras. 26-37.\n\n**(2) The Respondents\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Applicant\u2019s alleged hardship is in fact an \"enforcement hardship\" and premised on the assumption that the VPBs will have to take enforcement action.

THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe relevant provision of the ICSID Convention governing an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s decision on stay of enforcement is Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. According to this provision, \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.\"\n\n76.\n\nThe procedure for dealing with requests for continuation of stay is set out in Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Rule 54 provides:\n\n\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall be automatically terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or\n\n(3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n77.\n\nThe Parties agree that ICSID *ad hoc* committees have discretion in determining whether or not to continue a stay of enforcement of an ICSID award; this is reflected in the term \"may\" in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention: \"The Committee **may,** if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision\" (emphasis added). In other words, an ICSID *ad hoc* committee may or may not stay enforcement of an award, depending on the circumstances.\n\n78.\n\nThe Committee notes, at the outset, that the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention is open-ended in the sense that it does not specify the \"circumstances\" to be taken into account in determining whether or not a stay is required. However, it is apparent from the context that such circumstances must be relevant to the case, and that they must \"require\" a stay. In other words, not just any circumstances, even if relevant to the case, may justify a stay; the circumstances must be sufficiently compelling so as to \"require\" a stay. This is how ICSID *ad hoc* committees have understood the terms of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"Based on the plain language of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules on annulment, it is clear to the Committee that a continued stay of enforcement of the award is not, in any event, automatic. Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, a continued stay is dependent on the specific circumstances of the case. Indeed, to order the continuation of the provisional stay, the Committee must be convinced that within the context of the case at hand such continuation is required.... The Committee also notes that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the stay shall only be continued if the Committee considers that \u2018the circumstances so **require.\u2019** The Convention does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \u2018recommend,\u2019 \u2018deserve,\u2019 \u2018justify\u2019 or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \u2018require.\u2019\"90\n\nVPBLEX-039, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Paraguay\u2019s Request for the Continued Stay of the Enforcement of the Award dated 22 March 2013, paras. 82, 87 (emphasis in original). *See also* VPBLEX-042, *OI European Group B.

According to the Applicant, the relevant question therefore is not whether there are circumstances that require continuation of the stay, but rather whether there are circumstances that require the lifting of the stay.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee is unable to agree with the Applicant\u2019s position, which is incompatible with the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, as set out above. It is for the party requesting continuation of the stay to establish that there are circumstances that require such continuation; it is not for the counterparty to show that there are \"exceptional circumstances\" that require the lifting of the stay.91 The fact that under Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, if an application for annulment contains a request for stay of enforcement of the award, enforcement is provisionally stayed pending the decision of an *ad hoc* committee on whether or not the stay should be continued, does not create a presumption in favor of continuation. Nor does the fact that according to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"either party\" *(i.e.,* either the applicant or the respondent) may request an *ad hoc* committee to rule on whether or not a provisional stay should be continued, create any presumption in favor of continuation of the stay; it merely means that it is for the requesting party - whether the applicant or the respondent - to establish that the stay should be continued, or that it should be terminated, as the case may be.\n\n*See, e.g.,* VPBLEX-037, *Ioannis Kardassapoulos and Ron Fuchs* v. *Georgia,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB0/07/15, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 12 November 2010 *(\"Kardassapoutos\"),* para. 26 (\"Stay of enforcement during the annulment proceeding is by no way automatic, quite to the contrary, a stay is contingent upon the existence of relevant circumstances which must be proven by the Applicant.\")\n\n81.\n\nMoreover, while there are decisions of ICSID *ad hoc* committees that contain language that appears to support the Applicant\u2019s argument of a presumptive stay, on a careful reading those decisions have also turned on the issue of whether the requesting party has established that there are circumstances that require continuation of the stay. Thus, in *Azurix* (the case primarily relied upon by the Applicant), the *ad hoc* committee \"confirm[ed] its determination that, for the reasons submitted by Argentina, the circumstances require a stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the annulment application.\"92 The Committee notes that the Applicant\u2019s counsel accepted at the Hearing that it is indeed for the Applicant to establish the relevant circumstances, and that the Applicant has also submitted argument to this effect in its written and oral submissions.93\n\n*Azurix.* para. 21.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement, 73:1-24 (\"[MR. KIMBROUGH:] So it\u2019s clear there\u2019s nothing automatic. And I think I have used the words later that it\u2019s not automatic for us; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s automatic for them. But the phrase technically is worded in such a way that you may, if the circumstances require, stay. So that means that clearly we have to establish circumstances that require. We believe we\u2019ve done that...So the reasons there are the direct elements that we bring forward as the reasons that this Committee should continue the stay. So we accept that if these reasons were made up or not serious, that you would not grant the stay.\")\n\n82.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the continuation of the stay is required for a number of reasons, including *inter alia* because the Annulment Application presents a *prima facie* case for annulment; because the right to institute annulment proceedings \"constitutes a fundamental right under the ICSID Convention;\" because the seizing of its assets by the Respondents would cause \"irreparable injury\" to the Applicant, even if they were eventually returned; and because termination of the stay would lead to \"catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences for Zimbabwe\u2019s ability to conduct its affairs during the course of the proceedings,\" due to its \"strained foreign exchange resources,\" and would also deprive it of its ability to pay the costs related to these proceedings.94\n\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 42-43.\n\n83.\n\nHaving carefully considered the record before it, the Committee is not satisfied that the Applicant has proven that the circumstances require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. While the Applicant argues that the lifting of the stay would cause irreparable injury to it, it has not explained how this concern is specific to the lifting of the stay, as opposed to compliance with the Award in the event the Award is not annulled. Indeed, the Applicant has confirmed its intention to pay the Award if the Annulment Application is rejected, which implies that the payment of the Award would not have consequences that would have \"catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences for [Zimbabwe\u2019s] ability to conduct its affairs.\"95\n\nVPBLEX-020, *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE)* v. *Guinea.* ICSID Case No, ARB/84/4, Interim Order No. 1 on Guinea\u2019s Application for Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 12 August 1988 (\"*MINE\"),* para. 27.\n\n84.\n\nNor is there any evidence before the Committee that the lifting of the stay, in itself, would cause irreparable damage to the Applicant. More specifically, there is no evidence that would show that \"the termination of the stay would necessarily result in the deductions from the specific budgetary items involving the \u2018people\u2019s needs\u2019 that the Applicant cites as the basis for its claimed irreparable harm, as opposed to deductions, if any, from other budgetary items.\"96 While the Committee accepts that, on a general level, Zimbabwe\u2019s strained public finances are a matter of public knowledge, this in itself is not a sufficient reason to support, let alone establish, a request for continuation of a stay. As noted by the *ad hoc* committee in *MINE,* and confirmed by other *ad hoc* committees,\n\n\"[p]overty as such is not a circumstance justifying a stay any more than it would justify non-payment of an award. The criterion is, rather, whether termination of the stay would have what Guinea calls \u2018catastrophic\u2019 immediate and irreversible consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs.\"97\n\n*OI European Group B.* I\u2019., para. 119.\n\n*AUNE,* para. 27. *See also Kardassapoulos,* para. 44; VPBLEX-024, *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Whether or Not to Continue Stay and Order dated 14 July 2004, para. 21.\n\n85.\n\nAt the hearing, the Applicant\u2019s counsel specified that the irreparable consequences that the Applicant was referring to are primarily \"those that frustrate the fundamental right to pursue annulment,\" *i.e.,* the effect that parallel enforcement proceedings would have on \"the serenity of the judicial process we are in now, the annulment proceedings, by these extraneous factors.\"98 While the Applicant provided some examples of how ongoing enforcement proceedings could affect its participation in the present annulment proceedings, the Applicant has failed to explain how this would amount to irreparable damage; nor has it provided any evidence to demonstrate that it would be unable to finance the present annulment proceedings or its participation therein.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant\u2019s Opening Argument, 27:22-28:11. The Applicant also confirmed, in response to a question from the Committee, that there would be \"economic harm.\" Tr. Day 1, Mr Kimbrough, 77:8-78:12.\n\n86.\n\nNor is there any concrete evidence before the Committee that the lifting of the stay would jeopardize Zimbabwe\u2019s debt restructuring process, and in any event, in the Committee\u2019s view this would not be a sufficient reason to maintain the stay of enforcement of the Award. It also seems unlikely that the debt restructuring process, which appears to be at a relatively early stage of re-engagement with the IFIs, could be completed during the pendency of these annulment proceedings, so as to have any effect on Zimbabwe\u2019s ability to pay the Award.\n\n87.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Applicant having failed to establish that the circumstances of the case require the stay of enforcement of the Award, there is no need for the Committee to consider whether a security should be ordered as a condition for continuation of the stay. Nor is there any need in the circumstances to consider the Respondents\u2019 argument that the Annulment Application is dilatory and that, therefore, the Applicant\u2019s request for continuation of the stay should be dismissed on this basis alone.\n\n88.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion that the circumstances of the case do not require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Committee will turn to the question of the implications of its decision. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the Award provides for the restitution of the properties specified in paragraph 1012.1 of the Award and in the Table referred to therein (the **\"Claimed Properties\")** within 90 days of the dispatch of the Award (the **\"Restitution Window\")** and, in addition, for payment of compensation in the amount specified in paragraph 1012.2 of the Award or, in the alternative, if restitution is not made in full within the Restitution Window of 90 days, for compensation in the higher amount specified in paragraph 1012.3 of the Award.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the 90-day period has already expired and that therefore upon termination of the stay, restitution is no longer available. According to the Respondents, the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is the date of registration of the Annulment Application, *i.e.* 2 November 2015, which is more than 90 days after the dispatch of the Award, 28 July 2015.99 The Respondents rely in support of their position on the *Kardassopoulos* decision, which in the Respondents\u2019 submission confirmed that the relevant date in this connection is the date of registration.100 The Applicant argues, by contrast, that the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is not the date of registration, but the date on which the complete Annulment Application was received by the ICSID Secretariat; and as this date was 23 October 2015,101 it was before 26 October 2015, *i.e.* the date on which the 90-day period expired.102\n\nTr. Day 1, Respondents\u2019 Opening Statement, 131:11, 132:16.\n\nTr. Day 1Respondents\u2019 Opening Statement, 220:23, 221:18.\n\nThe Applicant submitted its Annulment Application on 21 October 2015, followed by the transmission of the supporting documents on 22 and 23 October 2015. ICSID acknowledged receipt of the complete copy of the Annulment Application on 23 October 2015.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement, 18:20, 19:16.\n\n90.\n\nThus the question arises whether the termination of the provisional stay of enforcement results in the resumption of the Applicant\u2019s obligation to restitute the Claimed Properties, together with the obligation to pay the related (lower) amount of compensation, or whether the Restitution Window has already closed and, accordingly, whether the obligation to compensate in the higher amount specified in paragraph 1012.3 of the Award would become applicable.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee notes, at the outset, that it is unable to agree with the Respondents\u2019 argument that the *Kardassopoulos* decision provides authority to determine that the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is the date of registration of an annulment application. The passage of the decision on which the Respondents rely, and which appears to imply that, in that case, the provisional stay took effect on the date of registration of the annulment application, is contained in the part of the decision dealing with the procedural history of the annulment proceedings, and it is apparent from the context that it does not contain any findings of the *ad hoc* committee.103\n\n*See Kardassapoulos,* para. 3.\n\n92.\n\nIn examining this issue, the Committee notes that, while Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 50 define the requirements for registration of an annulment application, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules specifically address the issue as to when the provisional stay of enforcement takes effect. As noted above, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention merely provides that, \"[i]f the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\" Similarly, ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) merely provides that the Secretary-General shall inform both parties of the provisional stay of enforcement together with the notice of registration of the annulment application, but again does not address the issue of the date of effect. The Explanatory Notes that were published with the ICSID Regulations and Rules of 1968 confirm that, in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Secretary-General [...] has no discretion as to the granting or the refusal of the stay of enforcement of an award.\"104 The Explanatory Notes further clarify that if the Secretary-General \"refuses to register an application for lack of timeliness [...] then no stay of enforcement can be based on that application.\"105\n\nSee Note C to Arbitration Rule 54 of the annotated notes to the ICSID Regulations and Rules, 1968, Doc. ICSID/4/Rev. 1.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n93.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee considers that, if the Secretary-General refuses to register an annulment application because it does not meet the relevant requirements of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the award is not provisionally stayed, even if the annulment application contains a request for a provisional stay of enforcement. In other words, a provisional stay of enforcement is always subject to the registration of the annulment application which contains it. However, it does not necessarily follow that, if an annulment application meets the relevant requirements and is registered, a provisional stay of enforcement must be considered to have taken effect from the date of registration; this would imply that the lapse of time between the date of filing and the date of registration of an annulment application would fall exclusively on the applicant\u2019s account, even if the applicant has no control over the registration process.\n\n94.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Committee concludes that a provisional stay of enforcement must be considered to take effect from the date of filing with the ICSID Secretariat of an annulment application, subject to its subsequent registration by the ICSID Secretariat. If the ICSID Secretariat finds that an annulment application complies with the relevant requirements under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and registers it, any request for a provisional stay of enforcement of an award contained with it must be considered to have taken effect from the date of receipt by the ICSID Secretariat of the annulment application or, if the initial filing was not complete, from the date of receipt by the ICSID Secretariat of the complete annulment application. In the present case, this date is 23 October 2015, which is the date when the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the remaining documents supporting the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Application, which the Secretariat had received two days earlier, on 21 October 2015.\n\n95.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that the Restitution Window cannot be considered as having closed, and that the provisional stay of enforcement took effect within the 90-day period envisioned in the Award.\n\n96.\n\nHaving concluded that the lifting of the stay will also apply to the Applicant\u2019s obligation to restore the Claimed Properties in accordance with paragraph 1012.1 of the Award, the Committee must determine the date on which the Restitution Window will close. The Committee has carefully considered the issue, including in view of its findings regarding the non-recoupment risk as set out below, and finds that the entire 90-day Restitution Window must be considered as being reinstated as a result of the lifting of the stay of enforcement and that, accordingly, the 90-day period within which the Applicant is to comply with its restitution obligation should start running from the date of dispatch of this Decision to the Parties. The Committee notes that a contrary conclusion would effectively penalize the Applicant for the exercise of its right to seek annulment of the Award, which would not be in accordance with the letter and spirit of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.106 In reaching this conclusion, the Committee is mindful of the unusual circumstances of this case, which involves not only an obligation to reinstate the Claimed Properties, but also an alternative obligation relating to the amount of compensation awarded.\n\nIt would be unreasonable to count the time spent by an applicant preparing its annulment application against the applicant when that time was well within the window provided under Article 52(2), as this would effectively result in imposing an obligation on an applicant to enforce an award while preparing a challenge of the award and a request for provisional stay.\n\n97.\n\nAs to the risk of non-recoupment of the collected amounts in the event the Award is annulled, while the Parties do not agree that there is such a risk, the Respondents suggest that any risk of non-recoupment can be eliminated by way of an appropriate escrow arrangement. Accordingly, the Respondents have indicated in their written submissions and again confirmed at the Hearing that they would be willing to place any funds paid under the Award in an escrow account pending the outcome of these annulment proceedings. The Respondents note that \"[p]revious *ad hoc* committees have regarded such arrangements as sufficient to \u2018effectively eliminate[]\u2019 any risk of possible nonrecoupment.\"107\n\nRespondents\u2019 Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 61 (citing VPBLEX-031, *Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 5 March 2009, para. 83).\n\n98.\n\nThe Committee agrees that, in the circumstances of this case, an escrow arrangement would appropriately balance the Parties\u2019 legitimate interests pending the completion of these annulment proceedings.

Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Republic of Zimbabwe (the **\"Applicant\"**) filed applications for annulment (the **\"Annulment Applications\"**) and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others* v. *Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others* v. *Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the **\"von Pezold Award\"** and the **\"Border Timbers Award,\"** respectively, and together the **\"Awards\"**) pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the **\"Committees\"**) in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings. Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II') shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n3.\n\nFollowing the Parties\u2019 submissions in Part I of the proceedings, the hearing on stay held on 14 and 15 December 2016 and the filing by the Parties of their post-hearing memorials, on 24 April 2017, the Committees issued their Decisions on Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Decisions on Stay\"**). In their Decisions on Stay the Committees decided that:\n\n\"(1) The Applicant\u2019s request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Award rendered on 28 July 2015 is rejected;\n\n(2) The provisional stay is lifted as of the date of this Decision;\n\n(3) The Applicant has 90 days as of the date of dispatch of this Decision to comply with paragraph 1020.1 of the Award;\n\n(4) Any funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award, and any documents establishing title to the Claimed Properties, be placed in escrow until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings;\n\n(5) The Parties are directed to engage in discussions with a view to agreeing on an appropriate escrow arrangement; and\n\n(6) The decision on the allocation of costs is reserved until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings.\"1\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and others v.

Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25), the Committees similarly decided, in paragraph 99 of the Decision on Stay:  \n (1) The Applicant\u2019s request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Award rendered on 28 July 2015 is rejected;  \n (2) The provisional stay is lifted as of the date of this Decision;  \n (3) The Applicant has 90 days as of the date of dispatch of this Decision to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Award;  \n (4) Any funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award, and any documents establishing title to the Claimed Properties, be placed in escrow until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings;  \n (5) The Parties are directed to engage in discussions with a view to agreeing on an appropriate escrow arrangement; and  \n (6) The decision on the allocation of costs is reserved until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 May 2017, the Committees issued Procedural Order No. 2, providing the Parties with procedural directions regarding the escrow arrangement and requesting the Parties to revert by 15 June 2017 \"advising the Committees of the agreement reached and, to the extent there are any issues on which the Parties have been unable to agree, of their respective positions on any such issues.\"\n\n5.\n\nFollowing a joint request from the Parties on 14 June 2017, the Committees granted an extension until 23 June 2017 for the Parties to report on their agreement and/or positions on the escrow arrangement. On 23 June 2017, after a further joint request from the Parties, the deadline was again extended until 29 June 2017.\n\n6.\n\nOn 29 June 2017, the Respondents filed a report on the progress and outstanding issues concerning the escrow arrangement together with exhibits VPB-51 through VPB-58. On the same date, the Applicant sent its own report together with a draft v11 of the escrow agreement. On 30 June 2017, the Respondents sent a letter following up on the previous day\u2019s correspondence together with exhibits VPB-59 through VPB-62, which the Applicant responded to in its correspondence dated 3 July 2017.\n\n7.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions, on 7 July 2017, the Committees provided the Parties with directions as to who the escrow agent under the escrow agreement should be, as well as directions for the release of funds and/or documents held in escrow, and invited the Parties to revert again by 14 July 2017.\n\n8.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, the Respondents wrote to update the Committees on the status of the discussion between the Parties and requested an extension until 19 July 2017 for the Parties to revert to the Committees. The Committees granted the extension on the same day.\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 July 2017, both Parties informed the Committees separately that they had not been able to reach an agreement regarding the escrow arrangement, each Party attaching a draft escrow arrangement. The Applicant submitted additional exhibits ZA-228 through ZA-234 in support of its position. The Applicant also requested that the Committees extend the deadlines (the **\"Restitution Window\"**) to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award. Upon invitation from the Committees, the Respondents submitted additional comments on the Applicant\u2019s letter on 20 and 21 July 2017. The Applicant responded to the Respondents\u2019 additional comments on 21 July 2017.\n\n10.\n\nOn 23 July 2017, the Committees wrote to the Parties noting \"that they do not have jurisdiction to grant the Applicant\u2019s request as this would require the Committees to vary the Awards. While the Committees do have jurisdiction to stay the enforcement of the Awards, this matter was already decided in the Committees\u2019 Decisions on Stay of Enforcement dated 24 April 2017.\" The Committees extended the deadline fixed by the Committees in ICSID\u2019s letter of 7 July 2017 for the Parties to engage in further discussions with a view to reaching an agreement on the terms of the escrow arrangement, until 7 July 2017. The Committees noted that if the Parties were unable to reach an agreement by that date, they would make a final decision on the escrow arrangement.\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 July 2017, the Applicant filed an Urgent Application for Provisional Measures including Temporary Stay of Execution pursuant to pursuant to Articles 50(2) and 52(5), of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules 39 and 54 (the **\"Application\"**). The Applicant enclosed with its Application a confirmation of its election of restitution in accordance with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award, in the form of a \"General Notice\" signed by Hon. P.A. Chinamasa, the Acting Minister of Lands and Rural Settlement, which was to be published and take effect 120 days after the issuance of the Committees of their decision on annulment (the **\"General Notice\"**). In its Application, the Applicant requested the Committees to confirm that:\n\n\"i) Zimbabwe elected to restitute the Properties before 23 July 2017;\n\nii) the Escrow Agreement per Directions of the Committees of 7 July 2017 is to be opened with the Batonnier of the Paris Bar serving as Escrow Agent;\n\niii) no Agreement has been signed to date as issues raised by the Paris Bar remain unanswered;\n\niv) the Batonnier has not informed the Parties of the bank account references into which to deposit Escrow Funds;\n\nv) Zimbabwe is legally and practically prevented from implementing Restitution with the Batonnier Escrow Agent for those reasons (i.e., no Agreement has been signed to date - no account number).\"2\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\n12.\n\nThe Applicant further requested the Committees \"to grant a stay of Execution of the Awards from 23 July 2017 through the date five Paris Business Days following opening of Batonnier Escrow Account and to order VPB to maintain confidentiality of Zimbabwe\u2019s elect[ion] to restitute the Properties until the release of these Title documents from Escrow upon Final Decision on the Merits of the Annulment Applications.\"3\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n13.\n\nThe Applicant argued that the measures requested were reasonable and proportionate and required under the circumstances, in particular because the Respondents had not acted sufficiently promptly to finalize the discussions on the escrow agreement before the 90-day deadline provided for in the Awards.4\n\nApplication, paras. 15 and 16.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 July 2017, the Committees invited the Respondents to provide their comments on the Application by 28 July 2017.\n\n15.\n\nOn 28 July 2017, the Applicant submitted comments on the Respondents\u2019 draft vl5 of the escrow agreement, together with a new draft vl6.\n\n16.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondents submitted their response to the Application (the \"Response\") together with exhibit VPB-63. The Respondents opposed the Application and requested that the Committees dismiss the Application on the following grounds:\n\n\"9.1.1 Zimbabwe has not sought to establish that it has met the tests it has set itself - there is simply no legal analysis whatsoever to support the Application;\n\n9.1.2 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe seeks to reopen the 23 July Decision (which the Committees cannot do);\n\n9.1.3 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe has not met the test for the grant of provisional measures; and\n\n9.1.4 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe has not established sufficiently compelling (or any) circumstances to justify a stay.\"5\n\nResponse, paras. 9.1.1 \u2014 9.1.4.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondents further contended that the \"General Notice does not purport to restitute the Zimbabwean Properties as required by the terms of the Awards.\"6\n\nResponse, para. 1.2.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondents separately commented on the Applicant\u2019s comments of the same date on the escrow arrangement and reserved their right \"to advise the Committees by 7 August 2017 on their positions as to those issues on which the parties cannot agree, as per the Committees\u2019 direction of 23 July 2017.\"\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 August 2017, the Respondents submitted their update on the status of the Parties\u2019 discussions and the outstanding issues concerning the escrow arrangement together with draft v15 of the escrow agreement and exhibits VPB-64 through VPB-66. On the same day, the Applicant submitted its update on the status of the discussions on the escrow arrangement. The Applicant also commented on the Respondents\u2019 further argument on the Application.\n\n20.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the Respondents informed the Committees of certain changes that in their view had to be introduced to drafts v15 and v16 of the escrow agreement, in order for the drafts to comply with French legal requirements.\n\n**II. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committees\u2019 Analysis**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn their Decisions on the Applicant\u2019s Applications for Provisional Measures dated 17 March and 13 October 2016, the Committees observed that the Applicant\u2019s applications \"raised an issue that has also arisen before other *ad hoc* committees, but which has not yet been decided, as to whether an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is competent to recommend provisional measures in the first place.\"7 The Committees further noted that, while the Parties agreed that the Committees \"would have, at the very least, an inherent power to recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the present proceedings,\" in view of the conclusions reached in their Decisions, the Committees did not consider it necessary to rule on the issue.\n\nDecision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, para. 30: Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 13 October 2016, para. 36.\n\n22.\n\nThe Committees have considered the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Application and, for the reasons set out below, have concluded that it is not necessary to rule on this issue in this Decision either.\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicant has termed its submission as an application for provisional measures, but what it seeks is, in substance, a temporary stay of enforcement of the Awards, together with a confirmation by the Committees of a number of statements set out in paragraph 12 of the Application. The Committees note at the outset that the legal requirements for the two types of relief - provisional measures and temporary stay - are not the same. While Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that an *ad hoc* committee *may* stay enforcement of an ICSID award provisionally, pending its decision on the annulment application, \"if it considers that the circumstances so require,\" ICSID tribunals typically require, and the Parties in their previous submissions in these cases have argued, that an application for provisional measures must meet the requirements of urgency, necessity and risk of irreparable harm.8\n\n*See* Response, para. 6.1; Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, paras. 12 to 14 and 22 (summarizing the Parties\u2019 arguments on the requirements for provisional measures); Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 13 October 2016, paras. 16 to 19 and 27 (summarizing the Parties\u2019 arguments on the requirements for provisional measures).\n\n24.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant has not argued in its Application what the applicable requirements, in its view, are and has not sought to demonstrate that the Application meets those requirements. However, the Applicant does argue that \"[t]he circumstances require\" the measures it requests, particularly because, in the Applicant\u2019s submission, the Respondents have not acted sufficiently promptly to finalize the discussions on the escrow arrangement.9 However, the Applicant does not appear to suggest that the alleged delay alone is a sufficient basis to grant its application, and in any event, there is no evidence before the Committees to show that either Party has sought to delay the discussions on the escrow arrangement.\n\nApplication, para. 16.\n\n25.\n\nIn the circumstances, as the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that its Application meets either the requirements for provisional measures or the requirements for a temporary stay of enforcement of the Awards, in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 39 and 54, the Committees dismiss the Applicant\u2019s Application.\n\n26.\n\nTo the extent that the Applicant seeks to reinstate its request of 21 July 2017 for an extension of time of the 90-day period to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award (see paragraphs 10, 11, 14 and 18 of the Application), the Committees note that the Applicant\u2019s request for such an extension was denied by the Committees\u2019 ruling of 23 July 2017, on the basis that granting such a request would amount to varying the Awards, which is beyond the Committees\u2019 jurisdiction. The Applicant argues in its Application that the Committees, in their Decisions on Stay, \"did modify the Awards a first time as it added time to the Restitution Window fixed in the Awards,\" and that \"the Committees have the same jurisdiction to do so again.\"10 However, when determining in the Decisions on Stay that the 90-day Restitution Window within which the Applicant was to comply with its restitution obligation should start running from the date of dispatch of the Decisions on Stay, the Committees did not \"add time\" to, or extend, the Restitution Window, as fixed in the Awards; the Committees merely reinstated it, in order not to \"penalize the Applicant for the exercise of its right to seek annulment of the Award[s]...\"11 Now that the Restitution Window, as reinstated by the Committees, has closed, the Committees have no power to extend it.\n\nApplication, para. 18.\n\nDecisions on Stay, para. 96.\n\n27.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant remains free to deposit the relevant property documents in escrow, even if the Restitution Window has closed, in furtherance of an amicable settlement of the dispute between the Parties.\n\n**B. Escrow Arrangement**\n-------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Committees note that, as set out in the Parties\u2019 correspondence of 7 August 2017, despite further directions provided by the Committees on 7 July 2017 and several extensions of time, the Parties have been unable to agree on the escrow arrangement, and that there are still numerous points, which do not appear to be minor, on which the Parties continue to disagree.\n\n29.\n\nIn the circumstances, and considering that, even if the Committees were now to provide further directions to the Parties on the outstanding points, there is no guarantee that no further issues will arise in the course of the further discussions that prevent the Parties from reaching an agreement, the Committees direct each of the Parties to individually establish escrow accounts of their own devise. The Parties are directed to submit their proposed escrow account arrangements for the Committees\u2019 prior review and approval by 15 September 2017. This arrangement will allow the Applicant to deposit the funds payable under the Awards (and the relevant property documents should it so wish), and the Respondents to deposit any funds they may be able to collect on the Awards, in escrow. The escrow accounts must be established with an internationally reputable bank.\n\n**III. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n30.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide as follows:\n\n(a) The Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures including Temporary Stay of Execution is dismissed;\n\n(b) The Parties are directed to individually establish escrow accounts of their own devise, with an internationally reputable bank, in accordance with paragraph 99(4) of the Decisions on Stay; and\n\n(c) The Parties are directed to submit their proposed escrow account arrangements for the Committees\u2019 prior review and approval **by 15 September 2017.**"}]}
