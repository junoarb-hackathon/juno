Accordingly, the Consolidation Tribunal was constituted on that date.\n* 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13 May 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal requested the Parties to make an advance payment to cover the costs of the consolidation proceeding.\n* 6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 20 May 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 (\u201cPO 1\u201d) and draft Terms of Appointment to the Parties for their comments.\n* 7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 31 May 2024, Respondent provided the Parties\u2019 joint comments on the draft PO 1 and the draft Terms of Appointment. On 4 June 2024, Claimant confirmed its agreement with the documents submitted by Respondent.\n* 8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3 June 2024, the first procedural meeting (originally scheduled for 5 June 2024) was postponed to give more time for payment of the advance.\n* 9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 25 June 2024, ICSID confirmed receipt of Respondent\u2019s share of the advance.\n* 10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 2 July 2024, the Parties respectively confirmed their availability for a first procedural meeting on 16 July 2024. In the same communication, Claimant indicated its intention to identify additional items for the agenda of the meeting, including \u201cjurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126, timing concerns and good faith application of the procedural rules\u201d.\n* 11. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 10 July 2024, Claimant requested the suspension of the consolidation proceeding on the basis that the Consolidation Tribunal was established after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5) (\u201cPreliminary Objection on 60-day Period\u201d).\n* 12. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15 July 2024, Respondent provided its response to Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request Procedural Order No. 2\n\n* 13. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also on 15 July 2024, Claimant requested the Consolidation Tribunal to adjourn the first procedural meeting scheduled for 16 July 2024 on the basis that the tribunal in FM 1 had granted its request for admission of ancillary claims. Claimant further requested the opportunity to make full submissions on whether the out-of-time constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal can be resolved when only Respondent is willing to waive the time limit, and whether the time limit can be waived. Respondent opposed Claimant\u2019s request to adjourn the first procedural meeting on the same date.\n* 14. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 16 July 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal informed the Parties that the first procedural meeting would take place as scheduled, during which the Parties could address the recent correspondence. During the procedural meeting, the Consolidation Tribunal decided to address Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period in an initial written phase and directed the Parties to file their respective written submissions within the timelines agreed upon during the procedural meeting.\n* 15. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 5 August 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal issued PO 1, inter alia, reiterating and confirming the aforesaid directions in respect of Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period in accordance with the procedural timetable set out in Annex A of PO 1. In particular, the Consolidation Tribunal fixed the deadline of 7 August 2024 for Claimant\u2019s submission on its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period and of 22 August 2024 for Respondent\u2019s response.\n* 16. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 8 August 2024, Claimant filed its Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction dated 7 August 2024 (\u201cClaimant\u2019s 60-day Submission\u201d). Since Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission was filed after the deadline specified in Annex A of PO 1, Claimant also submitted a letter dated 8 August 2024, requesting an extension of one day due to technical difficulties in uploading the documents to ICSID\u2019s filesharing platform, Box.\n* 17. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 12 August 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal granted Claimant\u2019s request for a limited extension and proposed to extend the corresponding deadlines for Respondent\u2019s submission and the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s decision by one day each, subject to Respondent\u2019s comments.\n* 18. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13 August 2024, Respondent informed the Consolidation Tribunal that it did not require an extension and would file its response to Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission within the original deadline prescribed under Annex A of PO 1.\n* 19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 22 August 2024, Respondent filed its response to Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission (\u201cRespondent\u2019s 60-day Submission\u201d).\n* 20. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Procedural Order No. 2, the Consolidation Tribunal decides upon Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\n### II. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR RELIEF\n\n* 21. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant requests that the Consolidation Tribunal \u201cdismiss the Respondent\u2019s Request for Consolidation\u201d. Claimant reserves the right to claim its costs against Respondent.1\n* 22. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent requests that the Consolidation Tribunal: (i) determine that it is duly constituted and has jurisdiction to decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all claims in ICSID Arbitration Nos. ARB/21/14 and ARB/23/28, and to hear and determine them; and (ii) award Respondent the legal costs and expenses related to this arbitration, considering the clear lack of merit of this preliminary objection to jurisdiction.2\n\n### III. NAFTA ARTICLE 1126(5)\n\n23. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is based on NAFTA Article 1126(5). This provides as follows:\n\nWithin 60 days of receipt of the request, the Secretary-General shall establish a Tribunal comprising three arbitrators. The Secretary-General shall appoint the presiding arbitrator from the roster referred to in Article 1124(4). In the event that no such presiding arbitrator is available to serve, the Secretary-General shall appoint, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, a presiding arbitrator who is not a national of any of the Parties. The Secretary-General shall appoint the two other members from the roster referred to in Article 1124(4), and to the extent not available from that roster, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, and to the extent not available from that Panel, in the discretion of the SecretaryGeneral. One member shall be a national of the disputing Party and one member shall be a national of a Party of the disputing investors.\n\n### IV. CONSOLIDATION TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS\n\n* 24. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Section, the Consolidation Tribunal sets out the issues raised by Claimant with respect to its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and Respondent\u2019s response thereto, and decides upon those matters. To the extent that the Consolidation Tribunal does not set out in detail every argument made by the Parties, those arguments have been closely reviewed by the Consolidation Tribunal and can be considered subsumed herein.\n* 25. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is brought on the basis of an alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal.3 The Consolidation Tribunal considers that it is empowered by NAFTA Article 1126(1) and Article 21(1) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976 (\u201cUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\u201d) to decide on Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and neither Party has contended otherwise. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules apply to this consolidation proceeding pursuant to NAFTA\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\nArticle 1126(1). Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that \u201c[t]he arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction\u201d.\n\n### A. Preclusion of Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period\n\n26. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal will first consider whether Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60 Day Period is precluded, whether by estoppel, or by the principle of good faith.\n\n### (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant\u2019s Position\n\n* 27. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that it is not estopped from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period as the requirements for estoppel are not met. Claimant identifies three conditions for estoppel to have arisen: first, there must be a clear and unequivocal representation previously made by it to another party, either expressly or impliedly; second, the other party was, in the circumstances, entitled to rely and in fact did rely on this representation; and third, as a result the other party has been prejudiced or the party making it has secured some benefit or advantage for itself.4\n* 28. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the first requirement, Claimant asserts that it has consistently raised its concerns regarding compliance with the 60-day time limit in its correspondence with the ICSID Secretariat dated 22 February 2024 and 1 May 2024, and before the Consolidation Tribunal through correspondence dated 2, 10 and 15 July 2024, and during the first procedural meeting. Therefore, Claimant states that it has not misrepresented its position or misled Respondent regarding the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.5\n* 29. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Claimant further states that the draft Terms of Appointment and any alleged waiver to the jurisdictional objection contained therein is not binding on the Parties and cannot constitute a waiver of the mandatory 60-day requirement under NAFTA Article 1126(5). In any event, Claimant reiterates that it has consistently raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period both before and after providing its comments on the draft Terms of Appointment, and again at the first procedural meeting.6\n* 30. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the second requirement mentioned in \u00b6 27 above, Claimant states that it never made a clear and unequivocal representation that it consented to the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. To the contrary, raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period as a serious issue requiring rectification by Respondent. Claimant states that it would, therefore, be unreasonable and disingenuous for Respondent to claim to have relied on its \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d belief in this regard.7\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\n31. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the third requirement mentioned in \u00b6 27 above, according to Claimant, Respondent has not indicated that it suffered any damage due to its reliance on Claimant\u2019s alleged conduct. Claimant states that any damage suffered by Respondent arises from its own refusal to refile the Consolidation Request, and not from Claimant\u2019s actions.8\n\n### (2) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s Position\n\n* 32. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent disputes that Claimant raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period on time and states that Claimant filed this objection for the first time only hours before the first procedural meeting with the Consolidation Tribunal. Respondent denies that Claimant raised the issue of the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in its correspondence dated 30 April 2024. In its view, it merely urged the ICSID Secretary-General to establish the Consolidation Tribunal as soon as possible. Respondent also denies that Claimant raised the issue in its correspondence dated 1 May 2024 which, according to Respondent, only noted that the deadline had passed and expressed Claimant\u2019s view that compliance with NAFTA Article 1126(5) was mandatory.9\n* 33. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent states that, to the contrary, Claimant did not object to paragraph 3.3 of the draft Terms of Appointment circulated for comments by the Consolidation Tribunal, which recorded the Parties\u2019 agreement that the Consolidation Tribunal had been validly constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1126. According to Respondent, therefore, Claimant should not be permitted to go against its own statements and actions to frustrate the mandate of the Consolidation Tribunal.10\n\n### (3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n\n* 34. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal does not disagree, in principle, with Claimant\u2019s proposed test to determine whether a procedural estoppel has arisen (see \u00b6 27 above). Respondent has not specifically commented on the criteria.\n* 35. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the following reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it is not estopped from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period. Taking into account the record of communications by Claimant, the representations made to ICSID and to the Consolidation Tribunal were not an unequivocal acceptance of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal after the 60-day period in NAFTA Article 1126(5).\n* 36. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, Claimant did raise the question of the timeliness of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal in certain communications. On 1 May 2024, it stated its view to the ICSID Secretariat and Respondent that the period was mandatory, and invited Respondent\u2019s proposal to resolve this \u201ccritical issue\u201d. On 2 July 2024, it indicated to the Consolidation Tribunal and Respondent its intention to add matters to the agenda for the first procedural meeting such as the \u201cjurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal pursuant to\n\n  8\n\n  9\n\n  10\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request Procedural Order No. 2\n\nNAFTA Article 1126, timing concerns and good faith application of the procedural rules\u201d (see \u00b6 10 above).\n\n* 37. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Claimant did not explicitly object to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal on the basis of untimeliness until 10 July 2024 (see \u00b6 11 above). Moreover, on 31 May 2024 Claimant did not object to the language circulated in the draft Terms of Appointment for the Parties\u2019 consideration which stated in paragraph 3.3 that \u201c[t]he parties confirm that they have no objection on the basis that the period to establish the Consolidation Tribunal exceeded 60 days from the request for consolidation.\u201d\n* 38. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Claimant\u2019s explicit objection to the timing of the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s constitution was not communicated until 10 July 2024, Claimant did timely raise concerns related to the expiry of the 60-day period and signalled that it considered some further action to be required to resolve the issue, for example in its correspondence of 1 May 2024. In these circumstances, the Consolidation Tribunal does not consider Claimant\u2019s prior statements to have conveyed a clear and unequivocal acceptance of the delay in the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal. Claimant is therefore not estopped from raising its objection when it did so, prior to the first procedural meeting.\n* 39. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also relevant to whether Claimant\u2019s objection is precluded, Respondent invokes the principle of good faith, which in its view prevents a party from going against its own prior statements or actions when another party has relied on them.11 The Consolidation Tribunal does not accept that Claimant has acted contrary to the principle of good faith, since the different communications noted in \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 above do not demonstrate a lack of good faith. Nor is lack of good faith evident from the fact that Claimant participated in the process of appointing the Consolidation Tribunal, and in doing so requested extensions of time. The Consolidation Tribunal does not consider Respondent to have established that Claimant deliberately sought to frustrate the prompt constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal, and subsequently to object to the timeliness of its constitution or to have otherwise acted contrary to the principle of good faith.\n* 40. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal determines that Claimant is not precluded from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and will proceed to decide upon it.\n\n### B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant\u2019s Position\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mandatory nature of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5)\n\n41. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant submits that compliance with the timeline of 60 days prescribed under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is a mandatory condition for a consolidation tribunal to be validly constituted. In this regard, Claimant relies on, first, the language of NAFTA Article\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request Procedural Order No. 2\n\n1126(5) and specifically, the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d therein, and second, the alleged practice of States party to NAFTA (\u201cNAFTA Parties\u201d). Further, Claimant states that neither the Parties nor the Consolidation Tribunal can waive the non-compliance with the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5).12\n\n* 42. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the first submission, Claimant argues that as per Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (\u201cVienna Convention\u201d), NAFTA Article 1126(5) must be interpreted in accordance with the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of its terms (see \u00b6 233 above).13\n* 43. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant states that the ordinary, dictionary meaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates a \u201crequirement\u201d or \u201ccommand\u201d or what is \u201cmandatory\u201d. Further, Claimant contrasts the use of \u201cshall\u201d with that of \u201cmay\u201d in Chapter 11 of NAFTA generally and Article 1126 specifically. According to Claimant, the choice between these two words in these provisions indicates whether a directive is mandatory or not. Claimant states, therefore, that Article 1126(5) imposes a mandatory requirement or condition that must be adhered to before a consolidation tribunal can be validly constituted.14\n* 44. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the second submission referred to in \u00b6 41 above, Claimant states that consistent and long-standing practice of the NAFTA Parties, including Respondent, confirms the mandatory nature of the 60-day time limit within Article 1126(5). In particular, Claimant relies on Respondent\u2019s position in B-Mex, et al. v. Mexico15 where, according to Claimant, Respondent took the view that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in NAFTA imposes a mandatory legal obligation and, therefore, the procedural requirements in NAFTA Articles 1119 and 1121 relating to the submission of a notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration were mandatory.16\n* 45. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the aspect of waiver, Claimant argues that a mandatory (\u201cshall\u201d) procedural requirement is established by agreement of the NAFTA Parties and cannot be modified, except through amendment, or jointly issued interpretation, agreed upon by all three NAFTA Parties.17 Claimant further states that where the NAFTA Parties intended to permit the disputing Parties to modify a default procedural rule, they indicated so expressly, by including phrases, such as \u201cunless the disputing parties agree otherwise.\u201d Claimant submits, therefore, that without the NAFTA Parties\u2019 consent, neither the disputing Parties\n\n  12\n\n  13\n\n  14\n\n    \n\n  15\n\n    \n\n  16\n\n    \n\n  17\n\n    \n\n  Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 16-17, 21.\n\n  Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\n  Claimant\u2019s 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-16, citing Exhibit CL-0003, \u201cShall,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (12th ed.), dated 2024; Exhibit CL-0004, \u201cShall,\u201d Oxford English Dictionary, last visited 6 August 2024; and Exhibit CL-0005, \u201cShall,\u201d Merriam-Webster, last visited 6 August 2024.\n\n  Exhibit CL-0006, B-Mex, LLC Deana Anthone, Neil Ayervais, Douglas Black and others v.

Claimant relies on correspondence among the Parties and the ICSID Secretariat leading up to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal wherein both Parties acknowledged the lapse of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5). Claimant highlights that it had raised the issue in its correspondence dated 1 May 2024 and had invited Respondent to provide proposals to resolve it. Claimant argues, therefore, that the Parties have not and could not have waived the 60-day requirement under NAFTA Article 1126(5).13\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal effect of failure to constitute the Consolidation Tribunal within 60 days\n\n* 47. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant submits that the consequence of non-compliance with the timeline of 60 days under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is that the Consolidation Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Claimant states that non-compliance with mandatory procedural requirements, such as prearbitration negotiation and litigation requirements, has been held by other investment tribunals to negate the jurisdiction of the tribunal and is not merely a matter of admissibility.14\n* 48. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant further states that in cases where tribunals have treated specific requirements as mere \u201cformalities\u201d, they have done so where one of the parties has thereafter taken steps to remedy the failure.15 Claimant asserts, however, that the present case is different as NAFTA Article 1126(5) imposes a strict condition and time limit for compliance, without any ability for the parties or the ICSID Secretary-General to extend that time limit. Claimant also asserts that since NAFTA Article 1126 sets out a complete code for the adjudication of requests for consolidation, the very first step prescribed therein cannot\n\n  18\n\n  19\n\n  20\n\n    \n\n  21\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\nsimply be ignored. Further, Claimant states that there exists no ability here for the Parties to extend a deadline contained in an investment treaty.16\n\n49. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Claimant, therefore, the establishment of a consolidation tribunal within the 60-day time limit is a condition precedent to valid jurisdiction, and distinguishable from formalities or omissions which may be remedied.17\n\n(iii)Prejudice to Claimant if the alleged defect in jurisdiction is not cured\n\n* 50. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that non-compliance with the 60-day time limit for constituting the Consolidation Tribunal would make any subsequent award issued by the Constitution Tribunal vulnerable to challenge, which will cause grave prejudice to Claimant. Claimant alleges that Respondent has not acted in good faith during the FM1 and FM2 proceedings as well as this consolidation proceeding, and its conduct demonstrates \u201cthe very real likelihood\u201d that Respondent will challenge any subsequent final award on jurisdictional grounds if this suits its purpose.18\n* 51. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant asserts that Respondent is attempting to use this consolidation proceeding to forum-shop, delay the FM1 proceedings and avoid complying with the provisional order issued in the FM1 proceedings. Claimant states that Respondent\u2019s purported objective for filing the Consolidation Request, i.e., having all claims heard by a single tribunal, can be met through withdrawal of the FM2 proceedings now that the FM1 tribunal has admitted Claimant\u2019s ancillary claims. Claimant states that despite this, Respondent has refused to cooperate in withdrawing the FM2 proceedings and is avoiding submitting all claims to the tribunal in the FM1 proceedings, contrary to its stated objective for filing the Consolidation Request.19\n* 52. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant states that if Respondent\u2019s actions are bona fide, it must refile its Consolidation Request to avoid any challenges to the resulting award. According to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s insistence on ignoring the mandatory 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is hindering the fair and efficient resolution of the disputes between the Parties.20\n\n### (2) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s Position\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mandatory nature of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5) and legal effect of failure to constitute the Consolidation Tribunal within 60 days\n\n53. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is only a procedural requirement imposed upon the ICSID Secretary-General, and not a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d or \u201cstrict requirement\u201d, non-compliance with which would affect the\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request Procedural Order No. 2\n\nConsolidation Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.21 Respondent disputes Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the first sentence of NAFTA Article 1126(5) in this regard.22\n\n* 54. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent states that Claimant\u2019s interpretation erroneously focuses on only one element of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, i.e., the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the word \u201cshall\u201d, while ignoring the context of the provision and the \u201cobject and purpose\u201d of NAFTA. Respondent does not dispute that the word \u201cshall\u201d ordinarily implies a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement. However, according to Respondent, the relevant context, object and purpose for interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5), which include the NAFTA, ICSID Convention and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, do not support Claimant\u2019s interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5).23\n* 55. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Respondent argues, first, that the 60-day timeline is imposed on the Secretary-General of ICSID, which is a neutral, administrative and procedural position meant to facilitate submission of investment disputes to arbitration. Respondent states that the 60-day timeline enables the ICSID Secretary-General to follow due process by allowing parties sufficient time to comment on the proposed arbitrators. Respondent states that, consequently, the procedure is not entirely in the control of the ICSID Secretary-General and depends on the actions of the Parties. According to Respondent, this is relevant context which supports the interpretation that the 60-day time limit is only a procedural requirement which does not affect the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal.24\n* 56. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Respondent argues that the 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is not a condition precedent to the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration. Respondent distinguishes the 60-day requirement under Article 1126(5), which is applicable to the ICSID SecretaryGeneral and does not condition the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration, from mandatory conditions under other provisions of NAFTA which are to be fulfilled by a disputing investor before filing a claim. According to Respondent, the investment arbitration decisions cited by Claimant confirm this distinction. According to Respondent, failure to comply with the 60-day timeline is a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d which was cured in the present case, by establishing the Constitution Tribunal once the independence and impartiality of the three arbitrators had been confirmed.25\n* 57. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Respondent argues that interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5) must be done in\n\nlight of the object and purpose of NAFTA and Section B of Chapter 11 of NAFTA, which include the creation of \u201ceffective procedures . . . for the settlement of disputes\u201d, \u201cequal treatment among investors\u201d and \u201cdue process of law before an impartial tribunal\u201d. Respondent further notes that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (which pre-date NAFTA), which are applicable to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal, emphasize the\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n  \n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\nrequirement of impartiality and independence of arbitrators.26 Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5) is contrary to the aforesaid object and purpose for the following reasons:\n\n* (i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant\u2019s interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5), which would deny jurisdiction to a consolidation tribunal composed after 60 days, would also prevent the ICSID Secretary-General from ensuring compliance with the fundamental requirements of due process, impartiality and independence. Respondent submits that the 60-day timeline is essential to allow the ICSID Secretary-General to obtain parties\u2019 comments on the proposed tribunal and, therefore, to ensure due process and facilitate the constitution of an impartial and independent tribunal. Respondent argues that even in the present case, the delay of 26 days in establishing the Consolidation Tribunal was necessary to allow the Parties adequate time to complete their review process. Respondent accordingly states that Claimant\u2019s interpretation would render useless the objectives of due process and impartiality and independence of the consolidation tribunal and must be rejected.27\n* (ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Claimant\u2019s interpretation would defeat NAFTA\u2019s stated objective of effective and efficient dispute resolution. Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Consolidation Tribunal does not have jurisdiction and Respondent must file a new consolidation request due to lapse of the 60-day timeline, impedes the efficient resolution of disputes and only adds to the time and cost of the process.28Respondent notes that Claimant\u2019s proposed solution would require Respondent to refile its request and the Secretary-General to re-compose the same tribunal of previously appointed arbitrators leading to unnecessary procedural redundancy and delay.29\n* (iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of NAFTA Article 1126 has been held to be the \u201cavoidance of procedural harassment\u201d of parties. Further, the procedural rights of both sides must be balanced in consolidation proceedings. Claimant\u2019s interpretation would give parties the ability to unilaterally prevent the proper constitution of a consolidation tribunal by delaying this process, thereby rendering Article 1126 useless.30\n* (ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prejudice to Claimant if the alleged defect in jurisdiction is not cured\n\n58. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent denies that Claimant will suffer prejudice if its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is rejected. Respondent states that, practically, awards in investor-State cases have only been annulled for improper constitution of the tribunal when the defect involves\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\na serious deviation from a fundamental rule of procedure, and non-compliance with the 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) would be irrelevant in this regard.31\n\n59. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent further states that given Respondent\u2019s position in these proceedings, there would be no legal basis or reason for Respondent to go against its own actions and challenge an award on grounds of non-compliance with the 60-day time limit. Respondent has not challenged the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal and has taken the position that any technical failure to comply with the time limit was promptly remedied when the ICSID Secretary-General established the Consolidation Tribunal as soon as the impartiality and independence of the arbitrators was confirmed.32 Respondent asserts that Claimant has also not suffered any prejudice from the delay of 26 days in the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal.33\n\n### (3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n\n* 60. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no dispute that the Consolidation Tribunal was constituted 26 days after the expiry of the 60-day period specified in NAFTA Article 1126(5).34\n* 61. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal interprets NAFTA Article 1126(5) in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, i.e., in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n* 62. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the word \u201cshall\u201d in NAFTA Article 1126(5) indicates a mandatory requirement. However, mandatory does not mean that the requirement is properly characterized as a condition precedent to consent to the consolidation proceedings. As Respondent points out, the mandatory requirement falls upon the Secretary-General of ICSID and not upon the disputing Parties (\u201cthe SecretaryGeneral shall establish\u201d, see \u00b6 23 above). Being an obligation upon a third party and outside the direct control of the Parties, the plain language does not support an interpretation that the 60-day period for establishing the Consolidation Tribunal is a condition of consent of the disputing Parties for consolidation proceedings. In this regard, the Consolidation Tribunal disagrees with Claimant that the 60-day period set out in NAFTA Article 1126(5) is analogous to certain pre-conditions for requesting arbitration, such as a mandatory requirement to exhaust domestic remedies or a mandatory period for negotiations.35 Nor is it constructed as a condition precedent to the consolidation proceedings continuing.\n* 63. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the purpose of NAFTA Article 1126(5) is to serve efficiency, in the sense of procedural economy. The 60-day period specified for the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal allows the consolidation proceedings to move forward with due dispatch, while preserving due process by allowing\n\n  37\n\n  38\n\n  39\n\n  40\n\n  41\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request Procedural Order No. 2\n\ntime for the Parties to provide their views on the prospective members of a consolidation tribunal. Indeed, the reason for the delay in constituting the Consolidation Tribunal was because both Parties availed themselves of the opportunity to have input on the candidates.\n\n* 64. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Consolidation Tribunal does not consider this interpretation to be inconsistent with other uses of the word \u201cshall\u201d in different provisions of NAFTA, which relate to different requirements specified under the treaty, with distinct contexts and purposes.\n* 65. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were Claimant\u2019s interpretation to be accepted, the procedure would require Respondent to refile its Consolidation Request, and subsequently for ICSID to re-constitute a consolidation tribunal. In the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s view, this would frustrate the efficiency objectives of NAFTA Article 1126.\n* 66. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Consolidation Tribunal considers that the particular factual circumstances of this case confirm the view that non-compliance with the 60-day period does not constitute a bar to the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal. Specifically, the ICSID Secretary-General initiated the process for the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal promptly after the submission of Respondent\u2019s request of 12 February 2024. Ten days later, on 22 February 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General submitted a first list of potential arbitrators and requested the Parties to provide their comments by 29 February 2024. Claimant then requested the ICSID Secretary-General to extend the deadline to provide comments by 14 days, which was granted. Claimant requested a second, four-day extension of the deadline for the submission of comments, which was, again, granted. Finally, Claimant successfully requested a third, three-day extension of the deadline. On 21 March 2024 (that is, 38 days after Respondent\u2019s consolidation request), Claimant submitted its comments objecting to one of the three proposed arbitrators and Respondent requested an opportunity to react to Claimant\u2019s objection. This opportunity was granted and, on 1 April 2024, Respondent filed its comments on Claimant\u2019s objection to a proposed arbitrator.\n* 67. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 11 April 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General submitted a revised list of arbitrators, which, this time, was met with Respondent\u2019s objection to the new proposed arbitrator. This objection was filed on 17 April 2024. Thereafter, on 25 April 2024, the ICSID SecretaryGeneral submitted a third list of arbitrators to which none of the Parties objected. The Consolidation Tribunal was thus constituted on 8 May 2024.\n* 68. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this background, it bears recalling that NAFTA Article 1126(5) significantly restricts the pool of arbitrators from which the ICSID Secretary-General may choose. One of them must be a national of the \u201cdisputing Party\u201d (Respondent) and another must be a national of the disputing investor (Claimant). The Consolidation Tribunal is thus mindful of the complexity and importance of the delicate task entrusted to the ICSID SecretaryGeneral to identify potential candidates and ensure their availability and suitability to serve on a tribunal before they can be proposed to the parties for consideration.\n* 69. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the several requests from the Parties, the ICSID Secretary-General was able to submit two lists of arbitrators within 60 days from the Consolidation Request. Even after the expiry of the 60-day period, the Secretariat was confronted with a further objection to\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v. United Mexican States\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 &\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28) \u2013 Consolidation Request\n\nProcedural Order No. 2\n\na proposed arbitrator, thus requiring it to submit a third list of arbitrators for consideration. The ICSID Secretary-General thus acted actively and diligently during the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal. The delay beyond the 60-day period is rather a function of the specific circumstances of this case, which, as explained above, included requests of both Parties during the constitution process either to extend deadlines for submission of comments, object to proposed arbitrators, or to be afforded an opportunity to react to the other Party\u2019s objections. This lends further support to the conclusion that the delay beyond the 60-day period may not amount to a bar to jurisdiction, especially where the Parties\u2019 requests throughout the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s constitution heavily contributed to this delay.\n\n* 70. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the above reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal considers that the 60-day period is not a requirement that has a bearing on its jurisdiction. As such, non-compliance with the 60-day period does not deprive, especially in the circumstances of this case, the Consolidation Tribunal of jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1126(5).\n* 71. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the purpose of the 60-day period is to balance efficiency with due process, the Consolidation Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s submission that the successful constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal has cured the procedural defect of untimeliness, taking into account that: (i) due process was respected; and (ii) neither Party has been prejudiced by the 26-day delay in the Consolidation Tribunal\u2019s constitution.\n* 72. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of prejudice, Claimant\u2019s primary argument is that an award rendered by the Consolidation Tribunal (in a scenario in which Respondent\u2019s Consolidation Request is granted) would be vulnerable to challenge in post-award proceedings.36 In support of the likelihood of this scenario, Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s conduct lacks good faith, constitutes forum-shopping and constitutes a pattern of obstructionist behaviour.37 The Consolidation Tribunal considers this risk to be speculative and the allegations with respect to Respondent\u2019s conduct to be unproven, at least at this stage of the proceedings. The Consolidation Tribunal is not satisfied that Claimant will suffer serious prejudice as a result of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5). On the other hand, the refiling of Respondent\u2019s Consolidation Request causes prejudice to both Parties in the form of considerable delay and additional expense.\n* 73. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the above reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal considers Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period to be without merit and rejects it. The Consolidation Tribunal confirms that its establishment after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5) does not impact its jurisdiction to decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all claims in ICSID Arbitration Nos. ARB/21/14 and ARB/23/28, and, subject to its decision on the Consolidation Request, to hear and determine them as appropriate.\n\n  42\n\n  43\n\nFirst Majestic Silver Corp. v.
