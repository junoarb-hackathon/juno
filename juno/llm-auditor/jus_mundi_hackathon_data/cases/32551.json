INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are three companies incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Libra LLC (\"**Libra**\"), Neptun Azerbaijan-British LLC (\"**Neptun**\"), Virgo Developments Ltd. (\"**Virgo**\") \u2013 and the Estate of Mr. Efruz Muduroglu (the \"**Estate**\"), who is a deceased national of the United Kingdom (the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Azerbaijan (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Azerbaijan**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn September 6, 2023, the Claimants submitted the Request for Arbitration, together with Exhibits 1 to 63 (the \"**RfA**\"), to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\"). The RfA was based on the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Azerbaijan Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed on January 4, 1996, and entered into force on December 2, 1996 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn October 16, 2023, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the RfA.\n\n6.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed on the method of appointment of the arbitrators and constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the Claimants appointed Mr. D. Brian King, a national of the United States, as arbitrator. Mr. King accepted the appointment on December 22, 2023. Together with his acceptance, Mr. King provided the Parties with a declaration of his independence and impartiality.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 25, 2024, the Respondent appointed Ms. Carolyn B. Lamm, a national of the United States, as arbitrator. Ms. Lamm accepted the appointment on February 16, 2024. Together with her acceptance, Ms. Lamm provided the Parties with a declaration of her independence and impartiality that she has updated twice at the Claimants' request.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, the Claimants submitted a Request for Provisional Measures accompanied by Exhibits 67-102 and the Witness Statement of Mr. Eran Muduroglu (\"**Mr. Muduroglu**\") dated February 14, 2024 (the \"**Claimants' Request**\").\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(2)(c), the Claimants requested that the ICSID Secretary-General fix time limits for the Respondent to present its observations on the Claimants' Request so that the Claimants' Request and observations could be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution. Accordingly, on February 15, 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General ordered the following time limits for the Parties' written observations: (i) the Respondent would file its observations on the Claimants' Request by February 28, 2024; (ii) the Claimants' response within seven days of receipt of the Respondent's observations; and (iii) the Respondent's reply within seven days of receipt of the Claimants' response.\n\n11.\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants' Request, accompanied by Exhibits R-1 to R-5 and Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-13 (the \"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the Claimants filed its reply to the Respondent's Observations, accompanied by Exhibits 103-119 and the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Claimants' Response**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the Respondent filed its reply to the Claimants' Response, accompanied by Exhibits R-6 to R-13 and Legal Authorities RLA-14 to RLA-28 (the \"**Respondent's Reply**\").\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated April 3, 2024, the Claimants filed a Supplemental Submission in support of the Claimants' Request, accompanied by Exhibits 120-155 and the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Supplemental Submission**\"), and requested the ICSID Secretary-General to fix a two-week deadline for the Respondent's response. This Supplemental Submission was not contemplated in the calendar referred to under paragraph 10 of this Decision, but the Respondent did not object to the filing of the Supplemental Submission.\n\n15.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the Respondent filed a Reply to the Claimants' Supplemental Submission, accompanied by Exhibit R-14 and Legal Authorities RLA-29 to RLA-40 (the \"**Reply to Supplemental Submission**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn May 15, 2024, in accordance with the method of appointment of the President agreed upon by the Parties, Professor Eduardo Zuleta, a national of the Republic of Colombia, was appointed as President of the Tribunal by his co-arbitrators. Professor Zuleta accepted the appointment on June 5, 2024. Together with his acceptance, Professor Zuleta provided the Parties with a declaration of his independence and impartiality.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 6, 2024, a Tribunal composed of Professor Eduardo Zuleta (President, appointed by his co-arbitrators by agreement of the Parties), Mr. D. Brian King (Arbitrator, appointed by the Claimants), and Ms. Carolyn B. Lamm (Arbitrator, appointed by the Respondent), was constituted. Ms. Leah W. Njoroge, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated June 19, 2024, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate by June 24, 2024, their respective availabilities to attend the first session on either July 15 or 16, 2024, beginning at 9am Washington, D.C. time.\n\n19.\n\nOn June 24, 2024, the Claimants confirmed their availability for the first session on either date and also inquired whether the Tribunal intended to address the Claimants' Request before or during the first session. On the same date, the Respondent also confirmed availability for the first session on either date offered by the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nOn June 25, 2024, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would take place by video conference on July 16, 2024 starting at 9am Washington, D.C. time. The Tribunal directed the Parties to confirm by June 26, 2024, whether they wished to address the Claimants' Request at the first session. If the Parties agreed to do so, the Tribunal would then issue its decision after the first session. If there was no agreement to address the issue at the first session, the Tribunal would issue its decision within the time limit provided in ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(2)(d), based on the Parties' written submissions.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they were prepared to forego addressing the Claimants' Request at the first session unless the Tribunal had questions or would find oral argument on the Claimants' Request helpful.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter also dated June 26, 2024, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was content for the Tribunal to issue its decision based on the Parties' written submissions, and did not consider it necessary to address the Claimants' Request during the first session. The Claimants responded to this message requesting that the Tribunal either (1) strike and refuse to consider the substantive sections of the Respondent's letter; or (2) allow the Claimants a two-page response to be filed by June 27, 2024. In response to the Claimants' request, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit a two-page response to the Respondent's letter by the end of the day on June 27, 2024.\n\n23.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, the Claimants filed a response to the Respondent's letter dated June 26, 2024, as invited by the Tribunal.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal recommend provisional measures:\n\na. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to immediately lift the restrictions on Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the country;\n\nb. **Ordering** Azerbaijan forthwith to furnish a formal written undertaking signed by the appropriate authority in Azerbaijan that Mr. Muduroglu is granted permission to leave Azerbaijan by any means and at any time of his choosing;\n\nc. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to desist from any measures that aggravate this dispute, alter the *status quo*, or otherwise threaten or harass Claimants, Mr. Muduroglu, his family, or any other individuals involved in or connected with Claimants or the arbitration, including ordering Azerbaijan to desist from the bogus tax audits of Neptun and Libra and to lift the associated freezing orders on their accounts; and\n\nd. **Ordering** any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.1\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 54.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has (i) repeatedly prevented Mr. Muduroglu from leaving Azerbaijan under manufactured and groundless pretenses, and (ii) frozen the bank accounts of two of the Claimants (Libra and Neptun) in connection with sham tax audits.2 According to the Claimants, this is part of the \"Respondent's deliberate and coordinated 'dirty war' strategy aimed at interfering with Claimants' pursuit of this arbitration.\"3\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants allege the following facts to support their request for provisional measures:\n\n(i) Mr. Muduroglu is the authorized representative of the Estate, and the manager of day-to-day operations of Libra, Neptun, and the Landmark Properties; as such, he is indispensable to the Claimants' presentation of their case.4\n\n(ii) On January 27, 2024, Mr. Muduroglu attempted to fly from Baku to Istanbul, with Istanbul being a stopover on his way to London, where he intended to meet with the Claimants' experts and hand-deliver documents relevant to the Claimants' claims in this arbitration.5 However, Mr. Muduroglu was informed by a State Border Official at the airport that he was prohibited from leaving the country by order of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs (the \"**First Travel Ban**\").6 This restriction is said to have been unlawful. Mr. Muduroglu did not receive prior notification or an opportunity to be heard before it was imposed.7 Additionally, despite requesting an explanation through multiple channels, Mr. Muduroglu received no response or justification for this travel ban.8\n\n(iii) On March 11, 2024, upon request by the State Tax Service, the Baku Commercial Court (the \"**Baku Court**\") imposed another travel ban on Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Second Travel Ban**\"). The State Tax Service based its request on the claim that Malham LLC (\"**Malham**\"), a company managed by Mr. Muduroglu, owed US$\u202f4,500 in unpaid profit taxes from 2022, even though Malham had not earned any profits that year. Despite granting Malham five days to pay the alleged debt, the State Tax Service immediately filed a request for a travel ban on Mr. Muduroglu. The Baku Court scheduled the hearing for the next business day, mere hours before the hearing to lift the First Travel Ban would take place.9 According to the Claimants, \"[t]hese court proceedings were plainly a sham, as demonstrated by the lack of evidence presented to the Court, the Baku Court's issuance of a decision within eleven minutes of the commencement of the hearing (although neither party appeared for the hearing), the Court's failure to provide any reasoning for its decision, and the Court upholding the Second Travel Ban despite the deadline for payment of the disputed tax assessment not having expired.\"10\n\n(iv) On March 11, 2024, Mr. Muduroglu paid the assessment under protest, relying on the statement in the Baku Court's judgement of the same date that the ban would be lifted upon settlement of Malham's alleged tax debt.11 On March 13, 2024, Mr. Muduroglu attempted to leave the country again, but the State Border Control prevented him from departing Azerbaijan without justification (the \"**Third Travel Ban**\").12\n\n(v) Also on or about March 13, 2024, the State Tax Service began a comprehensive audit of Libra.13 Libra's accounts had been initially frozen in February 2024 at the request of Aqrarkredit CJSC (\"**Aqrarkredit**\"),14 and will remain frozen during the pendency of the State Tax Service's audit.15\n\n(vi) On March 15, 2024, as a result of a \"desk audit\", the State Tax Service issued another notice declaring that Neptun owed approximately US$ 736,000 in unpaid VAT. This resulted in another travel ban being imposed on Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Fourth Travel Ban**\"), as well as the freezing of Neptun's VAT deposit account in the amount of 105% of the debt calculated by the tax authority.16 The Claimants claim that the \"desk audit\" of Neptun is \"facially impermissible and improper under Azeri law,\"17 and that the court proceedings resulting in the Fourth Travel Ban were also rigged.18\n\n(vii) Due to the freezing of their accounts, Neptun and Libra \"must obtain pre-authorization from the Azeri courts before paying any business expenses other than ordinary payroll or tax expenses,\" which means that Azerbaijan can \"know exactly what expenses Neptun and Libra are paying in furtherance of the arbitration (such as the fees of expert witnesses), and also [] block the payment of such expenses altogether.\"19\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 16-28.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 24.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 12.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 35.\n\nSupplemental Submission \u00b6 32.\n\nSupplemental Submission \u00b6 42.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the manner, timing, and speed with which Azerbaijan has implemented the measures described above demonstrate that they are intended to intimidate and harass the Claimants, and impair their ability to prepare and present their case.20\n\n*See*, Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 14, 31, 43, 44.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal has broad discretion under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to \"'recommend' provisional measures it considers appropriate to ensure the preservation of either party's rights in the circumstances of the case,\"21 and that their request satisfies the legal standard for the recommendation of provisional measures.22\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 37.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00a7V.\n\n29.\n\nFirst, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction.23 Citing to *Occidental v. Ecuador* and *Millicom v. Senegal*, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should limit its examination to a preliminary analysis of its jurisdiction at this stage.24 The Claimants proceed to argue that they are protected \"investors\" with qualifying \"investments\" within the meaning of Articles 1 and 8(2) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.25 Specifically, the Claimants assert that (i) they are \"nationals\" and \"companies\" of the United Kingdom, which (ii) directly or indirectly hold \"movable and immovable property\", as well as \"participation in companies\" that own or owned the properties at issue; (iii) the dispute arose in the early 2000s, after the BIT's entry into force in December 1996; and (iv) the Respondent gave its consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 8 of the BIT, whereas the Claimants gave their consent in their Notice of Dispute and the RfA.26\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00a7V.A.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 59-50.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 52.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b652-55.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, the Claimants claim that the requested provisional measures are necessary.27 According to the Claimants, the relevant test is not whether the harm threatened is irreparable by an award of damages, but rather whether it is serious or significant.28 The Claimants contend that\n\n[t]he harm that is likely to occur here if Azerbaijan's unlawful mistreatment of Mr. Muduroglu persists is grave and implicates Claimants' most fundamental rights. Azerbaijan's unlawful restriction of Mr. Muduroglu's freedom of movement already has impeded Claimants' ability to present their case by rendering it impossible for Mr. Muduroglu to travel to London for important meetings with Claimants' experts and to provide physical documents necessary for the development of Claimants' claims. The provisional measures Claimants seek are necessary to ensure the integrity of the proceeding, to protect Claimants' ability to develop and present their case in an unintimidated manner, and to ensure Claimants' ability to communicate securely and confidentially with their counsel*.29*\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00a7V.B.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 59.\n\n31.\n\nThird, the Claimants argue that their request for provisional measures is urgent in the sense that it cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.30 The Claimants assert that \"Azerbaijan is presently impeding [their] ability to prepare and present their case,\" and that they will continue to suffer harm as long as the Respondent's unlawful conduct remains unremedied.31\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 61.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 62.\n\n32.\n\nRegarding the necessity and urgency requirements, the Claimants further contend that \"[r]eviewing voluminous, complex documents is a remote setting is neither feasible nor an adequate substitute for in person meetings (\u2026) [n]or is digital communication a secure substitute for in-person meetings.\"32 The Claimants argue that Azerbaijan has a history of intercepting private telephone and online communications without judicial oversight, and that the Respondent's own statements imply that Mr. Muduroglu has already been subjected to surveillance.33\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the requested measures meet the proportionality standard, as they would not impose any obligations on Azerbaijan beyond those already required under international and domestic law, the ICSID Convention, and the BIT, while without these measures, there is a significant risk that the Claimants will be unable to fully prepare or present their case.34\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' request for provisional measures. The Respondent denies any threats of a \"dirty war\" against the Claimants and asserts that the measures concerning travel restrictions and tax audits have been made by the competent authorities in accordance with domestic laws and procedures.35 Accordingly, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) deny the Claimants' requests for provisional measures; and\n\n(b) order the Claimants to pay to the Respondent the full costs arising out of the Request and all subsequent submissions on provisional measures.36\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00a7 IV.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 75.\n\n35.\n\nIn response to the factual allegations made by the Claimants, the Respondent asserts the following:\n\n(i) The First Travel Ban was made on the basis of a Protocol on Administrative Offences (No. 1904159) (the \"**Protocol**\") issued by the State Migration Service on January 26, 2024, where it was determined that Mr. Muduroglu breached article 575.1.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences of Azerbaijan (the \"**CAO**\").37 On March 11, 2024, the Baku Court decided that Mr. Muduroglu had not committed an administrative offense under article 575.1.3 of the CAO, and lifted the travel restriction imposed on him.38 The First Travel Ban has thus been lifted, such that it cannot be used as grounds for the request.39\n\n(ii) The Second Travel Ban has also been lifted; therefore, the Claimants' request for provisional measures related to it is now moot.40 In any event, the imposition of this travel restriction was in accordance with domestic laws and procedures.41\n\n(iii) The Third Travel Ban did not exist. Contrary to the Claimants' suggestion, a travel restriction does not lift automatically upon payment, as the State Tax Service must confirm the payment and take necessary actions to lift it. According to the Claimants' own account, payment was received on the same day Mr. Muduroglu was scheduled to travel, and there is no evidence that he followed up on lifting this travel restriction.42\n\n(iv) The Fourth Travel Ban was lawfully imposed on Mr. Muduroglu as Managing Director of Neptun.43 The Court, after a hearing at which both sides were represented, considered it was justified as Mr. Muduroglu, a foreign citizen, might leave the country before attending to the tax debt.44 In any event, it is a \"temporary measure that will be lifted when Neptun fulfills its tax debt obligations, or if Neptun succeeds in challenging the tax assessment following established procedures under the laws of Azerbaijan.\"45\n\n(v) The freezing of Libra's bank accounts is linked to domestic court proceedings between Aqrarkredit and Libra, and has nothing to do with the Government of Azerbaijan or the ongoing tax audit of Libra by the State Tax Service.46 Moreover, the freezing order of Neptun's accounts was in accordance with Azeri laws and procedures.47\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 58.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\n*See*, Reply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15-25.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 32-41.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 44.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to establish a basis for the provisional measures sought.48\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00a7III.\n\n37.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden to prove that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction. Specifically, according to the Respondent,\n\nthe Claimants have failed to establish that, before the dispute arose, and at all relevant times as prescribed under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, Libra LLC, Neptun Azerbaijan-British LLC and Virgo Developments Ltd. were majority owned by UK nationals or companies, and that the UK Estate or other person in this regard qualifies as an \"investor\" under the Treaty. They have also failed to show how and when exactly ownership interests in the alleged \"investments\" were acquired by the Claimants, namely in Landmark I, Landmark II, Landmark III, Baku II and the Venetian Palace, and that they actually \"made\" these alleged investments. Finally, the Claimants have not proved that the alleged investments meet the characteristics of an investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.49\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 48.\n\n38.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the provisional measures requested are urgent and necessary, i.e., that \"they are required to preserve [the Claimants'] rights from irreparable harm [i.e., harm that cannot be compensated by monetary damages] and there is a need to obtain the measures requested before the issuance of an award.\"50\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 20. See generally, Respondent's Observations, \u00a7 III.B.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the rights at issue are those of Mr. Muduroglu and not of the Claimants; and the Claimants \"have failed to explain how the travel restriction against Mr. Muduroglu indirectly affects their rights in the arbitration proceedings, and particularly their ability to present their case.\"51 Specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants \"have failed to explain why in-person meetings in London are necessary to prepare for the arbitration proceedings, why electronic communications and virtual meetings are inadequate, and why it is important to transfer 'voluminous documents' out of the country in person and delivered only by Mr. Muduroglu himself.\"52 Moreover, the Claimants have not provided \"any evidence of intimidation, duress, harassment, or any sort of ill-treatment by Azerbaijan, nor any threat to Mr. Muduroglu's personal safety and health, nor any risk to the Claimants' ability to communicate securely and confidentially with their counsel because no such risks or threats exist.\"53\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\nReply on Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 64; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 29.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent therefore concludes that \"the only conceivable effect of the travel restriction on the Claimants' ability to present their case may be a potential slight increase of costs, assuming that it is more expensive for the Claimants' counsel (and expert, if necessary) team to travel to Azerbaijan for preparatory meetings than for Mr. Muduroglu to travel to London, if indeed in person meetings are required at all.\"54\n\nRespondent's Observation, \u00b6 35.\n\n41.\n\nRegarding the freezing of Libra's and Neptun's bank accounts, the Respondent contends that \"[the] Claimants have provided no evidence regarding the extent of their overall resources and ability to fund this arbitration through assets held both inside and outside Azerbaijan. Nor have they attempted to show how precisely the freezing orders affect their ability to fund the present proceedings (which are clearly ongoing and not inhibited) (\u2026). Therefore, their requests in relation to those measures must be declined as unsubstantiated.\"55\n\nReply on Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 47.\n\n42.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that the Claimants' specific request for relief is disproportionate and vague.56 The Respondent argues that granting provisional measures for a potential and hypothetical harm arising from uncertain actions would improperly interfere with the exercise of the State's sovereign powers in pursuit of the public interest.57\n\nReply on Supplemental Submission, \u00b6 66.\n\n*See*, Reply on Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 67-73.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes the facts relevant to its decision below. These facts have been only preliminarily determined on the basis of the Parties' pleadings related to the request for provisional measures and are determined solely for purposes of the decision on provisional measures. Both Parties may, therefore, provide evidence on any alleged facts at the appropriate stage of the proceedings for purposes of jurisdiction and merits. The Tribunal further notes that the omission of express reference to an alleged fact below does not mean that the Tribunal has not considered it.\n\n44.\n\nOn January 27, 2024, Mr. Muduroglu, the authorized representative of the Estate, the Director of Virgo and the General Director of Neptun and Libra, attempted to fly from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Istanbul, Turkey.58 The State Border Control official stopped Mr. Muduroglu, informing him without explanation that Azerbaijan had prohibited him from leaving the country.59 The Claimants complain that Mr. Muduroglu and his counsel addressed several authorities of Azerbaijan requesting an explanation for the travel ban but received no response.60\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 4 and 6.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 7\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 8.\n\n45.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, the State Migration Service had issued the Protocol, determining that Mr. Muduroglu had breached article 575.1.3 of the CAO.61 According to the Respondent, it was on the basis of the Protocol that the State Migration Service temporarily restricted Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the territory of Azerbaijan on the ground of commission of an administrative offence by a foreign citizen.62\n\nExhibit R-2, Protocol on Administrative Offences No. 1904159, dated 26 January 2024 (unofficial translation); Exhibit RLA-13, Migration Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (unofficial translation), Article 17.1, 17.1.7; Exhibit R-3, Resolution of the State Migration Service No. 09/QD, \"Decision on the preparation of the case on administrative offence for consideration\", dated 26 February 2024 (unofficial translation).\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 58.\n\n46.\n\nFollowing a hearing that took place on March 11, 2024, at the State Migration Service, in which Mr. Muduroglu did not appear but was represented by counsel, the State Migration Service finally decided that Mr. Muduroglu had not committed an administrative offence under article 575.1.3 of the CAO, resulting in the lifting of the travel restriction it had imposed on him.63\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 19; Exhibit R-6, Decision on the termination of proceedings on the administrative offence case MN No 0000251 dated 11 March 2024, (unofficial translation to English); Exhibit R-7, State Migration Service Website, \"Check the Existence of a Travel Ban for Eran Muduroglu\", at: https://eservice.migration.gov.az/public/checkrestriction (last checked 15 March 2024); Exhibit R-10, State Migration Service Acknowledgement dated 11 March 2024, and handwritten note in Resolution of the State Migration Service No. 09/QD, \"Decision on the preparation of the case on administrative offence for consideration\", dated 26 February 2024 (unofficial translation).\n\n47.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 7, 2024, the State Tax Service issued a notice declaring that Malham (not a Claimant in this proceeding), a company managed by Mr. Muduroglu, owed approximately US$ 4,500 in unpaid profit taxes from 2022.64 On the same date, the Main Department of Liability Management of the State Tax Service issued a notice temporarily restricting Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the country.65 The State Tax Service then filed an application with the Baku Commercial Court requesting that it restrict Mr. Muduroglu from leaving Azerbaijan.66 The Baku Court scheduled a hearing for March 11, 2024, and on the same date, it upheld the travel ban on Mr. Muduroglu imposed by State Tax Service.67\n\nExhibit 120, Resolution No. 2419120115179800 on the Calculation of Taxes, Social Insurance and Unemployment Insurance Fees of Malham LLC dated March 6, 2024, received March 7, 2024; Muduroglu WS3, \u00b6 6.\n\nExhibit 122, Notice for Temporary Restriction of the Right to Leave the Country from the Main Department of Liability Management of the State Tax Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan under the Ministry of Taxes dated March 7, 2024\n\nExhibit 123, Statement by the Baku City Main Directorate of Local Revenues of the State Tax Service under the Ministry of Economy to the Baku Commercial Court dated March 7, 2024.\n\nExhibit 124, Determination (Court Ruling) of the Baku Commercial Court dated March 7, 2024; Muduroglu WS3, \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 14.\n\n48.\n\nAlso on March 13, 2024, Mr. Muduroglu paid the taxes on Malham's behalf under protest,68 and on the same day he went to the airport to again try to leave the country. The State Border Control prevented Mr. Muduroglu from departing Azerbaijan, claiming that he was banned from departing.69 According to the Respondent, given the short timing between the payment of the taxes and Mr. Muduroglu's attempt to travel out of Azerbaijan, it was not possible to update the information so that the lifting of the ban appeared in the system of the State Border Control.70\n\nExhibit 127, Payment Confirmation dated March 11, 2024.\n\nMuduroglu WS3, \u00b6 20.\n\nReply to Supplemental Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n\n49.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the State Tax Service sent a formal notification to Neptun asserting that the company owed a debt to the state budget of approximately US$ 530,000,71 which was subsequently adjusted to approximately US$ 736,000.72 On the same date, the State Tax Service issued a decision freezing Neptun's VAT deposit account in the amount of 105% of the debt calculated by the tax authority.73\n\nExhibit 140, Notification on Non-Payment of Tax Debt for Neptun dated March 15, 2024.\n\nExhibit 143, Decision on Calculated Taxes, Social Insurance, and Unemployment Insurance Fees of Neptun dated March 15, 2024.\n\nExhibit 134, Letter regarding the necessary documents (information) required for a desk tax audit from the Main Directorate of National Revenues of the State Tax Service to Neptun dated March 6, 2024; Exhibit C-135, Letter regarding the necessary documents (information) required for a desk tax audit from the Main Directorate of National Revenues of the State Tax Service to Neptun dated March 6, 2024; Exhibit C-140, Notification on Non-Payment of Tax Debt for Neptun dated March 15, 2024.\n\n50.\n\nAlso on March 15, 2024, the State Tax Service submitted a statement to the Baku Court requesting that the Court restrict Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the country based upon this tax debt.74\n\nExhibit 144, Statement for Temporary Restriction of the Right to Leave the Country from the State Tax Service to Baku Commercial Court dated March 15, 2024.\n\n51.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, the Baku Court scheduled a hearing on the travel ban for March 27, 2024.75 The hearing took place on March 27, 2024, and, on the same date, the Baku Court issued its ruling upholding the travel ban.76 Mr. Muduroglu is prevented from leaving Azerbaijan until Neptun pays the tax allegedly owed or successfully challenges the tax assessment.\n\nExhibit 146, Determination (Court Ruling) of the Baku Commercial Court dated March 18, 2024.\n\nExhibit 150, Resolution of the Baku Commercial Court dated March 27, 2024, p. 5.\n\n52.\n\nOn or about March 13, 2024, the State Tax Service began a comprehensive audit of Libra, another Claimant in this arbitration. During the pendency of this latest audit, the State Tax Service has frozen Libra's accounts.77\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by observing that its power to recommend provisional measures is well-established under the rules applicable to this arbitration.\n\n54.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n55.\n\nFurther elaborating on the Tribunal's authority, Rule 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n(1) A party may at any time request that the Tribunal recommend provisional measures to preserve that party's rights, including measures to:\n\n(a) prevent action that is likely to cause current or imminent harm to that party or prejudice to the arbitral process;\n\n(b) maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute; or\n\n(c) preserve evidence that may be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\n\n(\u2026)\n\n(3) In deciding whether to recommend provisional measures, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:\n\n(a) whether the measures are urgent and necessary; and\n\n(b) the effect that the measures may have on each party.\n\n(4) The Tribunal may recommend provisional measures on its own initiative. The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures different from those requested by a party.\n\n56.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree that in deciding whether to adopt interim measures requested by a party, the Tribunal must consider whether (a) it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear the case;78 (b) the requested measures are necessary;79 (c) the situation is urgent;80 and (d) the requested measures are proportional, i.e., the \"balance of convenience\" falls on the side of the requesting party.81\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 47; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 47; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 47; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 47; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 14.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that these requirements must be met concurrently. Therefore, generally, failing one of them, an application for provisional measures must also fail. The Claimants have the burden to prove that their Request meets all these requirements.\n\n**A.** ***P****rima facie*** **Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Rules provide for this requirement and investment tribunals have not been uniform in including the same as a condition for the granting of provisional measures. In any event, the tribunals that have considered this matter have indicated that, for purposes of provisional measures, the Tribunal does not need to definitely establish that it has jurisdiction in respect of the merits of the case.82 The Tribunal therefore \"cannot and must not examine in depth the claims and arguments submitted on the merits of the case; it must confine itself to an initial analysis, i.e. 'at first sight.'\"83 As correctly put by the tribunal in *Paushok v. Mongolia*:\n\n\"Essentially, the Tribunal needs to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous or obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal. To do otherwise would require the Tribunal to proceed to a determination of the facts and, in practice, to a hearing on the merits of the case, a lengthy and complicated process which would defeat the very purpose of interim measures.\"84\n\nExhibit 84, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, August 17, 2007, \u00b6 55.\n\nExhibit 88, *Millicom v. Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/20, Decision on the Application for Provisional Measures, December 9, 2009, \u00b6 42.\n\nExhibit 95, *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSCVostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia*, Order on Interim Measures, September 2, 2008, \u00b6 55.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent's objections to the *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal would require the Tribunal to go into the facts of the case and to a detailed analysis of the evidence supporting such facts. This exceeds a *prima facie* analysis and corresponds to a full and detailed decision on jurisdiction that is reserved for a different stage of the proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nFor purposes of its decision on provisional measures, and without prejudice to the analysis on jurisdiction at the proper stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants' claims, as presented in the RfA, are not, on their face, frivolous or obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal. The Claimants have provided evidence that the executor of the Estate has authority to pursue the claim on its behalf, and they have provided *prima facie* evidence of an investment, and a UK national's ownership of the majority of the Claimant entities and thus their nationality. Given the Respondent's allegations to the contrary, the Tribunal's determination is preliminary, and the issues of investment, investor and nationality all remain to be examined on the basis of a full evidentiary record in the jurisdictional and merits proceedings.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, considers that, *prima facie*, it has jurisdiction to decide on the provisional measures.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered all the arguments and allegations presented by both Parties in connection with the other requirements listed in paragraph 56 above. The Tribunal observes, on the one hand, that the facts related to necessity and urgency overlap, and on the other, that neither the necessity nor the urgency requirement has been sufficiently established by the Claimants as of the present time and, consequently, that the request for provisional measures is premature. Therefore, the Tribunal will limit its analysis to the necessity and urgency of the requested provisional measures and will not undertake an analysis of the proportionality requirement.\n\n**B. Necessity and Urgency of the Measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nProvisional measures are generally ordered to prevent the aggravation of a dispute, maintain the status quo or prevent or stop acts that affect the integrity of the arbitration. According to the Claimants, the rationale and urgent need for provisional measures is clear because absent the requested measures, there is a serious threat that the dispute will be materially aggravated and the integrity of the proceedings undermined: \"[the] Claimants' ability to present their case will be severely impaired if Mr. Muduroglu, the Executor of the Estate and General Director of Neptun and Libra, is forced to live in fear for his physical and legal safety, and is being detained in Azerbaijan, unable to leave the country to attend meetings in relation to the Arbitration or to communicate with counsel securely and confidentially.\"85\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 42.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the requested provisional measures are necessary and urgent. According to the Claimants, they are already suffering harm and will continue to suffer harm as long as Azerbaijan's conduct remains unremedied.86 In particular, the Claimants are being affected in their ability to prepare and present their case, and this is not a harm that can be remedied at a later stage or that can wait until the issuance of a final award to address.87 Azerbaijan is thus jeopardizing the integrity of the arbitral process and inhibiting the Tribunal's ability to conduct a fair and impartial proceeding by preventing the Claimants from presenting their case unimpeded.88\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 62.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 62.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 62.\n\n65.\n\nThe travel restrictions adopted by the Respondent have, according to the Claimants, prevented Mr. Muduroglu from traveling outside of Azerbaijan to meet with counsel and experts, and to personally deliver physical documents necessary for the development of the Claimants' claims.89 Mr. Muduroglu, a British citizen, remains detained in Azerbaijan with no access to legitimate legal recourse, and with no ability to communicate safely and confidentially with international counsel for the Claimants.90 This is disputed by the Respondent, which adds that the decision of the Baku Court already provides a remedy as it notes that the travel restriction is \"temporary\" until the tax obligations are fully met.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 59.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 44.\n\n66.\n\nAs to the freezing of Libra's and Neptun's accounts, the Claimants submit that it inhibits not just their ability to do business generally, but also directly interferes with their ability to conduct this arbitration.91 As explained in Mr. Muduroglu's third witness statement, Neptun and Libra must obtain pre-authorization from the Azeri courts before paying any business expenses other than ordinary payroll or tax expenses.92 Again, the Respondent disputes the alleged effects on the Claimants.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\nSupplemental Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a provisional measure is necessary if there are no other reasonably available means to preserve the procedural rights of the given party, and urgent when there is a risk of serious or irreparable harm to the rights of a party in the arbitration or to the arbitration itself that may occur before the Tribunal renders a final decision.\n\n68.\n\nAs applicable here, the standard of necessity requires the Claimants to prove that, due to the Respondent's conduct, unless the Tribunal grants the provisional measures, they would be seriously impeded in preparing and presenting their case before this Tribunal. The standard of urgency, meanwhile, requires a showing that this risk is sufficiently imminent so as to justify an early intervention of the arbitral tribunal in the proceedings, prior to issuing a final decision on the case. By contrast, if the alleged risk is merely potential or insufficiently concrete when the provisional measures are requested, such an early intervention would not be justified. Further, and in all events, the Tribunal must balance the interference alleged by the Claimants against the Respondent's sovereign right to regulate conduct within its territory.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal is indeed concerned by the sequence of actions by the Respondent's officials that have resulted in repeated and sequential travel bans, and with the way the proceedings resulting in the travel bans have been conducted. However, absent a stronger evidentiary showing by the Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the requested measures are presently necessary in order to ensure the procedural integrity of the arbitration, avoid aggravation of the dispute or preserve the status quo. The Claimants have failed to prove that the alleged measures have a direct effect on the arbitration.\n\n70.\n\nFirst, Mr. Muduroglu submitted before this Tribunal three witness statements in support of the request for provisional measures and there is no allegation, much less evidence, that he has had any difficulties in communicating with counsel for the preparation of the witness statements or that such preparation was interfered with by acts of the Respondent.\n\n71.\n\nSecond, the Claimants do not explain why Mr. Muduroglu must deliver the documents related to the arbitration personally and in physical form, and there is no evidence that he is prevented from delivering those documents safely via an electronic platform or in any other technically secured manner. There is likewise no convincing evidence that Mr. Muduroglu is under surveillance and thus prevented from delivering or discussing the documents with encryption or in another confidential manner.\n\n72.\n\nThird, in connection with the freezing of Libra's and Neptun's accounts, on the one hand, there is no evidence that the freezing affects all funds held by such companies, and on the other, the Claimants have not proven that the funds held by Libra and Neptun are the only sources of funding available to the Claimants to continue prosecuting this arbitration. Further, there appears to be at least some potential legal recourse available to the companies in Azerbaijan. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not on the present record proven that the freezing of the accounts prevents them from presenting their case before this Tribunal.\n\n73.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds no sufficient grounds on the evidentiary record, as it now stands, to grant the provisional measures requested by the Claimants. However, in light of the concerns expressed in paragraph 69 above, the Tribunal invites the Parties to keep it updated on the issue of the travel bans and asset freezes and may revisit the issue at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n**VI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nFor the reasons provided above, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) rejects the Claimants' request for provisional measures; and\n\n(ii) defers any decision on the costs associated with this request to a later stage of the proceedings.\n\nJuly 8, 2024"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for a Temporary Restraining Order", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2024-12-26T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for a Temporary Restraining Order\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

(\"**Virgo**\") \u2013 and the Estate of Mr. Efruz Muduroglu (the \"**Estate**\"), who is a deceased national of the United Kingdom (the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Azerbaijan (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Azerbaijan**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\".\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1**\n------------------------------\n\nThis section summarizes the main procedural events relevant to the present decision regarding the Claimants' request for a Temporary Restraining Order, submitted along with the Claimants' Renewed Application for Provisional Measures dated December 19, 2024.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, the Tribunal issued a Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures dated February 14, 2024, as supplemented by the Claimants on April 3, 2024.\n\n5.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, the proceeding was suspended following the Claimants' Proposal for the Disqualification of Ms. Carolyn Lamm, who had been appointed as arbitrator by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Ms. Lamm, the Tribunal was reconstituted on November 12, 2024, with Prof. Claus von Wobeser appointed to fill the vacancy, and the proceeding resumed on that same date.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, the Tribunal and the Parties held the First Session.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, the Claimants submitted a Renewed Application for Provisional Measures (the \"**Renewed Application**\"), requesting, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal \"recommend an immediate temporary restraining order (\"**TRO**\") suspending the auction of Landmark III [a building in Baku] pending its determination of [the] Claimants' Renewed [Application].\u2026\"2 (the \"**TRO Request**\"). The Landmark III auction is scheduled to commence on December 22, 2024, and to finish on December 29, 2024.3\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Application for Provisional Measures dated December 19, 2024 (the \"**Renewed Application**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 92(b).\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 5; The Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated December 20, 2024 (the \"**Response to the TRO Request**\"), \u00b6 7.\n\n9.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit (i) a brief response on the TRO Request by close of business on December 20, 2024; and (ii) a response to the Renewed Application by December 26, 2024.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, the Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal in response to the TRO Request (the \"**Response to the TRO Request**\"). Additionally, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal extend the deadline to respond to the Renewed Application to January 9, 2024.4\n\nResponse to the TRO Request, \u00b6 35(b).\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn its Renewed Application, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal recommend the following provisional measures:\n\na. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to immediately lift the restrictions on Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the country;\n\nb. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to temporarily suspend the auction of Landmark III while the Tribunal decides Claimants' Renewed Request for Provisional Measures;\n\nc. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to temporarily suspend the auction of Landmark III, the asset freezes on Libra and Neptun, and all related domestic proceedings until the Tribunal issues its Final Award in this arbitration;\n\nd. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to suspend any other domestic proceedings involving the foreclosure or sale of the investments at issue in this dispute until the Tribunal issues its Final Award in this arbitration;\n\ne. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to refrain from taking any other action to aggravate this dispute or disturb the status quo antes as of [the] Claimants' Request for Arbitration; and\n\nf. **Ordering** any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.5\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 92.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn its Response to the TRO Request, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal\n\n(a) Deny the Claimants' TRO Request; and\n\n(b) Extend the deadline to respond to the Claimants' [Renewed] Application to 9 January 2024*.*6\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nResponse to the TRO Request, \u00b6 35.\n\n12.\n\nThis decision addresses solely the Claimants' request in paragraph 92(2) of their Renewed Application, seeking that the Tribunal recommend a provisional measure \"[o]rdering Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to temporarily suspend the auction of Landmark III while the Tribunal decides [the] Claimants' Renewed [Application],\"7 i.e., the TRO Request.\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 92(b) [emphasis eliminated].\n\n13.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for an extension up until January 9, 2025 to respond to the Renewed Application. The Tribunal will decide on the Renewed Application after considering the positions of both Parties in full.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants request the temporary suspension of the auction of Landmark III, which was ordered by the Azerbaijani courts in a proceeding initiated by Aqrarkredit, a creditor of a loan granted to Libra.8 The auction is set to begin on December 22, 2024, and conclude on December 29, 2024.9\n\n*See*, Renewed Application, \u00b6\u00b6 22-37.\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 5.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants argue that due to the immediate threat to their investment and the likelihood of harm occurring before the Tribunal can fully address their Renewed Application, a TRO should be issued to suspend the auction of Landmark III pending the Tribunal's decision on their Renewed Application.10\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 89.\n\n16.\n\nThe relevant facts before this Tribunal as of the date of this decision on the TRO are the following:\n\na. In March 2023, Aqrarkredit brought an action in the Azerbaijan courts seeking foreclosure on Landmark III.11\n\nb. On March 12, 2024, the first-instance Baku Commercial Court ordered the foreclosure of Landmark III and set the property's price at AZN 120 million.12\n\nc. On June 10, 2024, the Court of Appeal upheld the Baku Commercial Court's decision.13\n\nd. On October 16, 2024, the Court of Cassation ordered that Landmark III be auctioned at a price of AZN 120 million.14\n\ne. The Claimants do not specify the exact date when the Azerbaijani courts set the auction of Landmark III to begin on December 22, 2024. The Respondent affirms that the auction announcement was published online on December 2, 2024.15\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 22; Response to the TRO Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 32; Response to the TRO Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 33; Response to the TRO Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nRenewed Application, \u00b6 34; Response to the TRO Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nResponse to the TRO Request, \u00b6 7.\n\n17.\n\nAfter considering the positions of the Parties and the evidence presented, the Tribunal finds no compelling justification for the Claimants' delay in submitting the TRO Request. The foreclosure was ordered on March 12, 2024. The Claimants were aware of the decision of the Court of Cassation decision since October 202416 and knew or should have known the auction date at least since December 2, 2024. However, the Claimants waited until December 19, 2024 \u2013 only one business day before the auction was scheduled to begin \u2013 to file the TRO Request.\n\nAccording to the English translation of the Court of Cassation's decision dated October 16, 2024, \"[t]he decision is final and enters into force from the moment of its adoption.\" (Exhibit C-202, p. 31)\n\n18.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this delay provides sufficient grounds to deny the TRO Request. A party cannot assert urgency for a provisional measure when it has postponed the submission of its application without good cause shown.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this decision solely concerns the Claimants' request to suspend the auction of Landmark\u202fIII scheduled for December 22 to 29, 2024, and does not anticipate or prejudge the Tribunal's ruling on the Renewed Application.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal must reiterate its concern about the course of events involving Mr. Muduroglu and Landmark III as recited in the Claimants' papers. It will closely monitor the upcoming developments as part of its assessment of the Renewed Application.\n\n**V.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, the Claimants submitted a Request for Provisional Measures accompanied by Exhibits C-67 through C-102 and the Witness Statement of Mr. Eran Muduroglu (\"**Mr. Muduroglu**\") dated February 14, 2024 (the \"**Claimants' Initial Request**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants' Initial Request, accompanied by Exhibits R-1 to R-5 and Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-13 (the \"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the Claimants filed their reply to the Respondent's Observations, accompanied by Exhibits C-103 through C-119 and the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Claimants' Response**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the Respondent filed its reply to the Claimants' Response, accompanied by Exhibits R-6 to R-13 and Legal Authorities RLA-14 to RLA-28 (the \"**Respondent's Reply**\").\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated April 3, 2024, the Claimants filed a Supplemental Submission in support of the Claimants' Initial Request, accompanied by Exhibits C-120 through C-155 and the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu (the \"**Supplemental Submission**\"), and requested the ICSID Secretary-General to fix a two-week deadline for the Respondent's response.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the Respondent filed a Reply to the Claimants' Supplemental Submission, accompanied by Exhibit R-14 and Legal Authorities RLA-29 to RLA-40 (the \"**Reply to Supplemental Submission**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures denying the Claimants' Request (the \"**First Decision on Provisional Measures**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, the Claimants filed a renewed request for provisional measures, together with the Fourth Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu, Exhibits C-187 through C-210, and Legal Authorities CL-48 through CL-70 (\"**Claimants' Renewed Request**\"). The Claimants requested, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal \"recommend an immediate temporary restraining order (\"**TRO**\") suspending the auction of Landmark III [a building in Baku] pending its determination of [the] Claimants' Renewed.\u2026[Request]\" (the \"**TRO Request**\"). The Landmark III auction was scheduled to commence on December 22, 2024, and to finish on December 29, 2024.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit a short response to the TRO Request, which the Respondent did on December 20, 2024.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 26, 2024, the Tribunal denied the TRO Request (the \"**TRO Decision**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn January 9, 2025, the Respondent filed its observations to the Claimants' Renewed Request, together with Exhibits R-22 through R-33 and Legal Authorities RLA-65 through RLA-74 (\"**Respondent's Observations on Renewed Request**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits, together with three witness statements, including the Fifth Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu, a quantum expert report, Exhibits C-211 through C-618, and Legal Authorities CLA-71 through CLA-241.\n\n13.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the Claimants filed a reply to the Respondent's Observations on the Renewed Request, together with the Sixth Witness Statement of Mr. Muduroglu, and Exhibits C-619 through C-624 (\"**Claimants' Reply on Renewed Request**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the Respondent filed a rejoinder, together with Exhibits R-34 through R-39 and Legal Authorities RLA-74 through RLA-79 (\"**Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request**\").\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal recommend provisional measures:\n\na. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to immediately lift the restrictions on Mr. Muduroglu's right to leave the country;\n\nb. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to suspend any other domestic proceedings involving the foreclosure or sale of the investments at issue in this dispute until the Tribunal issues its Final Award in this arbitration;\n\nc. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to refrain from taking any other action to aggravate this dispute or disturb the *status quo ante* as of Claimants' Request for Arbitration;\n\nd. **Ordering** Azerbaijan to reimburse Claimants forthwith for any and all costs they have incurred pursuing provisional measures; and\n\ne. **Ordering** any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.1\n\nClaimants' Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6 22. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants adjusted their request for relief in their Reply on the Renewed Request. Specifically, they removed the request for the Tribunal to issue provisional measures ordering Azerbaijan to take all actions necessary to \"temporarily suspend the auction of Landmark III while the Tribunal decides Claimants' Renewed Request for Provisional Measures\" and to \"temporarily suspend the auction of Landmark III, the asset freezes on Libra and Neptun, and all related domestic proceedings until the Tribunal issues its Final Award in this arbitration\" [*see* Claimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 92(a) and (b)], and added a request for costs.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants assert that since the First Decision on Provisional Measures, Azerbaijan has escalated its misconduct against the Claimants and Mr. Muduroglu.2 Specifically, the Respondent (i) continues to prevent Mr. Muduroglu from leaving Azerbaijan on entirely spurious grounds,3 and (ii) has unlawfully used Aqrarkredit to auction Landmark III at a suppressed price to ensure that Libra maintains its debt after the auction, as a tool of leverage to pressure the Claimants into giving up this arbitration and to hold Mr. Muduroglu personally accountable for the remaining debt.4\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 2.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 42.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 6.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants cite the following facts in support of their request for provisional measures:\n\n(i) Mr. Muduroglu has remained unlawfully detained in Azerbaijan since his initial travel ban in January 2024. Although this ban was lifted in an administrative hearing on March 11, 2024, Azerbaijan has placed additional travel bans on Mr. Muduroglu.5\n\n(ii) In February and March 2024, Azerbaijan initiated three tax investigations against Neptun, Libra and Malham. Based on these investigations, Azerbaijan placed additional travel bans on Mr. Muduroglu.6\n\n(iii) In February 2024, the State Tax Service began a desk audit of Neptun. This audit is, in Claimants' view, illegal as the time bar for said audit had expired. On March 15, 2024, the State Tax Service purportedly discovered an outstanding VAT deficiency for Neptun, imposing a US$ 530,000 debt on the company. Consequently, Neptun's accounts were frozen, and a travel ban was imposed on Mr. Muduroglu's.7\n\n(iv) On October 30, 2024, the Baku Court of Appeal ruled on the allegedly outstanding tax and on the travel ban. In its decision, the Court held that \"no deviations were revealed by the [State Tax Service]\" and concluded that Neptun's claim was highly likely to be successful. As a result, the Court ordered the \"prohibit[ion of] all actions related to the execution\" of the contested decision, which would have resulted in the lifting of the Neptun travel ban and the freeze of Neptun's assets. However, only the freeze was lifted, as the travel ban remains in place. In its ruling, the Court ordered, within a month, the provision of an independent expert opinion to confirm that Neptun did not owe any of the alleged taxes. However, almost three months after the ruling, the work on the expert opinion has not yet started.8\n\n(v) On December 28, 2024, the Court of Cassation issued a decision in the Neptun tax and travel ban proceeding, which upheld the travel ban on Mr. Muduroglu without examining the merits of the tax assessment.9\n\n(vi) The State Tax Service had notified Libra in March 2024 that the duration of the tax audit would be 30 working days. However, the State Tax Service has forced Mr. Muduroglu to sign extensions to and suspensions of the tax audit, informing him and his employees that refusal to sign would lead to serious consequences. Thus, the tax audit remains ongoing, and the State Tax Service recently demanded another extension of the audit on January 17, 2025, which continues extending the deadline.10\n\n(vii) As of December 28, 2024, the Malham travel ban is still in place although the tax debt was paid under protest in March 2024. In a decision dated November 27, 2024, which only became available to the Claimants on December 28, 2024, the Court of Cassation upheld the Malham travel ban arguing that a presumption of debt existence remained, ignoring the fact that Mr. Muduroglu had already paid this debt.11 Additionally, Mr. Muduroglu had previously received a notice that the Malham tax was still outstanding as of September 2024. Also, in the Neptun hearing, the judge confirmed that the Malham travel ban remained in place. Lastly, an administrative hearing concerning the tax was scheduled for February 17, 2025.12\n\n(viii) By January 23, 2025, the State Tax Service website no longer listed an active travel ban against Mr. Muduroglu. However, when Mr. Muduroglu attempted to leave Azerbaijan, he was stopped by State Border Control, informing him of a \"secret internal travel ban\" against him, imposed by the State Tax Service.13\n\n(ix) Under the direction of the Azerbaijani government, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 570, the International Bank of Azerbaijan (\"**IBA**\"), which financed the construction of Landmark III, transferred Libra's outstanding debt to Aqrarkredit in 2017. Over the years, Libra attempted to negotiate with Aqrarkredit to restructure its debt, but the latter refused.14 After some years, Azerbaijan's First Lady \"gifted\" Aqrarkredit her 50% stake in Landmark III, which had been acquired in 2006, after the First Lady had demanded a substantial portion of the Claimants' properties in Baku in order to permit the construction of Landmark III to proceed.15\n\n(x) In March 2023, Aqrarkredit, the state-owned credit institution and an *alter ego* of the Azerbaijani government, initiated two actions before Azerbaijani courts seeking (1)\u202fa declaration that it is entitled to equal control over Libra and (2) foreclosure on Landmark III.16 In February 2024, Aqrarkredit obtained a freezing order on Libra's accounts which has not allowed the company to make payments without Aqrarkredit's consent. Subsequently, on March 12, 2024, the Baku Commercial Court ordered the foreclosure of Landmark III and ordered the property to be auctioned at a price of AZN 120 million, a value far below the actual value, which had to be adequately determined for the auction to take place.17\n\n(xi) The decision concerning the auction of Landmark III was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, and the Azerbaijani courts initially set a date for the auction to begin on December 22, 2024.18 By early January 2025, an attempted auction of Landmark III came and went with no bidders. After two auctions have concluded without a buyer, Landmark III will be offered at a 40% discount on the initial price of AZN 120 million, which will not satisfy Libra's outstanding debt.19\n\n(xii) Libra has sought relief through an application through the Constitutional Court. However, the Claimants claim that there is no remaining domestic recourse available that could feasibly stay the auction.20\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Claimant's Reply in Support of their Renewed Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimant's Reply in Support of their Renewed Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 8.\n\nClaimant's Reply in Support of their Renewed Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\nClaimant's Reply in Support of their Renewed Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Renewed Request, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26-27, 29.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 22, 28.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 38-39.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 31-34, 37.\n\nClaimants' Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 37.\n\n18.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the travel bans imposed, and the auction of Landmark III demonstrate that Azerbaijan has implemented measures to aggravate the dispute. Indeed, the travel bans have caused serious harm to the Claimants' rights and ability to pursue this arbitration. Additionally, the ongoing auction proceedings of Landmark III undermine the *status quo* at the time the Request for Arbitration was filed and aggravate the dispute to a substantial degree.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their request to lift the travel bans is necessary and urgent.\n\n20.\n\n*First*, the Claimants argue that their request for provisional measures is necessary as the travel ban seriously affects the preparation presentation of the Claimants' claim in this arbitration. The Claimants contend that the fact that Mr. Muduroglu remains consistently detained in Azerbaijan has caused great difficulty to retrieve various documents located outside of Azerbaijan, including in Italy. Further, Azerbaijan's actions have occupied significant legal resources and time.21\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n21.\n\n*Second*, the Claimants assert that their request is urgent as there is a material risk of serious and imminent prejudice.22 The Claimants argue that Mr. Muduroglu's continuous detention has a serious chilling effect on his testimony, and he has become genuinely afraid to testify against senior government members and Azerbaijan's First Family.23 The Claimants rely on *Libananco v. Republic of Turkey* to assert that it is urgent for the Tribunal to act, since the Respondent has created an untenable situation by abusing its sovereign powers to gain an unfair procedural advantage.24\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 49.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the court proceedings concerning the auction of Landmark III violate Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which operates to exclude other remedies which may be parallel to the remedies sought in the arbitration.25 The Claimants assert that in this case both the identity of the subject matter and the identity of the parties overlap, supporting their position.26\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 58.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants aver that the order of the Court of Cassation to auction Landmark III so as to satisfy Libra's purported debt to Aqrarkredit weighs directly on determinations the Tribunal has been asked to make of whether that debt is legitimate, whether the sale from IBA to Aqrarkredit breached the BIT, and whether the First Lady's actions breached the BIT. Thus, there is overlapping identity of the subject matter.27\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 61.\n\n24.\n\nAqrarkredit is a state-owned, government backed, non-banking credit institution that is directed and controlled by Azerbaijan and is thus an *alter ego* of the State. In this regard, Azerbaijan uses Aqrarkredit for its own purposes, it is owned 100% by the Ministry of Economy and has received direct instructions from Azerbaijan. Further, the Claimants contend that there is an obvious level of coordination between the Azeri government and Aqrarkredit. The Claimants rely on Articles 5, 8 and 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility to support their position.28\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, 68-69.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the outcome of the parallel proceedings would deprive them of the ownership of one of the investments at issue, resulting in irremediable harm,29 which supports a request for provisional measures to the Tribunal.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 54.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the auction proceedings of Landmark III threaten to alter the *status quo*, as the sale of Landmark III would destroy Libra's viability as an enterprise.30 The Claimants relied on different cases, including *Perenco v. Ecuador*, to assert that measures that would jeopardize an enterprise's viability are serious enough to recommend provisional measures to preserve the *status quo*.31\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 81.\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 80.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the auction has been irregular for several reasons including that the auction company is under investigation for tax fraud. Further, auctions cannot be carried out by companies that have not worked continuously for 5 years, and in the present case this auction company was dormant for a few years.32\n\nSixth Witness Statement of Eran Muduroglu, \u00b6 13.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants assert that their request for provisional measures is urgent, as an action prejudicial to their rights is likely to be taken before the Tribunal's decision, namely Landmark III's auction.33\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that all provisional measures requested are proportional as they present no prejudice to Azerbaijan or Aqrarkredit. On the other hand, the Claimants contend that the travel bans, and the auction of Landmark III, seriously harm their rights.34\n\nClaimant's Renewed Request, \u00b6 86; Claimant's Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6 21.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants' Renewed Request.35 The Respondent asserts that the travel restrictions, tax audits, and the proceedings related to the auction of Landmark III have been made by the competent authorities in accordance with domestic law and procedures.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 92.\n\n31.\n\nIn response to the factual allegations made by the Claimants, the Respondent asserts the following:\n\n(i) The Neptun travel ban is valid and in force under Azeri law.36 Under the Azerbaijani Civil Procedure Code, proceedings on the imposition of travel bans are separate and different from the tax-related proceeding.37 The decision of the Court of Appeal dated October 30, 2024 did not result in the lifting of Mr. Muduroglu's travel ban.38 The Claimants acknowledged this fact as they appealed the Neptun travel ban in a different court proceeding.39\n\n(ii) The travel ban was challenged on April 15, 2024, before the Baku Appellate Court40 which rejected the appeal. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court which left the travel restriction in force.41 The Neptun travel ban can be seen on both the New Website and Old Website of the government and will only be lifted once the outstanding tax debt is paid or until domestic courts rule in Neptun's favor.42\n\n(iii) As for the expert appointed by the Baku Court of Appeal to render a forensic report, the Court is required to provide the expert with the materials to conduct the examination. The expert review process has not commenced because the case materials were sent to the Supreme Court, which will consider the State Tax Service's recourse filed against the October 30, 2024 ruling.43 The case file will be sent to the Baku Court of Appeal after the Supreme Court completes its review of the recourse and only then the expert review process will commence.44\n\n(iv) In relation to Libra's audit, there has been no travel ban imposed in relation to Libra.45 As for the extended time alleged by the Claimants, in accordance with the Tax Code, the duration of on-site tax audits may be extended up to 90 business days. Further, the audit has lawfully been further extended by virtue of decisions issued by the State Tax Service, which were also signed by Mr. Muduroglu,46 and the latter has voluntarily submitted and signed applications that resulted in suspensions of Libra's tax audit.47\n\n(v) The Malham travel ban has been lifted because Mr. Muduroglu paid the Malham tax debt.48 Both the Baku Appellate Court and the Supreme Court did not find that the travel ban was still in force.49 Furthermore, in the Neptun hearing the judge never commented on the alleged Malham travel restriction, and the administrative hearing scheduled for February 17, 2025 concerns the tax debt in question for the Court to consider matters related to the tax calculation.50\n\n(vi) The Landmark III auction process has been conducted in accordance with Azeri laws and is the result of a series of court proceedings initiated in 2023 by Aqrarkredit, a financial institution and separate legal entity from Azerbaijan.51 The dispute has been heard before first instance courts, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, allowing the Claimants to fully present their arguments, including through an application before the Constitutional Court.52 All of them have ordered that Landmark III be auctioned at an initial price of AZN 120 million.53\n\n(vii) On March 12, 2024, the Baku Commercial Court ordered the foreclosure of Landmark III, and further ordered that the property be auctioned. On June 10, 2024, the Court of Appeal upheld the Commercial Court's decision. Further, on October 16, 2024, the Supreme Court ordered Landmark III to be auctioned.54\n\n(viii) The auction price of Landmark III was properly determined based on available evidence. Mr. Muduroglu failed to facilitate the process necessary for experts to determine the liquid value of the property.55 In 2023-2024, experts attempted to access the property, but Libra failed to cooperate.56\n\n(ix) After two unsuccessful auctions with no participants, Landmark III was offered at a 40% discount price on the initial price, in accordance with Azeri laws.57 The auction has been available to all participants at an open auction, and the Claimants themselves could have bid on the building if the auction price was indeed too low.58\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 10; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 17.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16-17, 20, 23.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 2.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 12; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 19.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 22; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 45.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 45; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 32, 37.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 5; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 28.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 55.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.\n\nRespondent's Letter, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 57.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 29.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent argues that that the requested provisional measures fail to satisfy the legal standard as they are not urgent or necessary.59 The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to present new convincing grounds and evidence justifying why it is necessary and urgent to lift the Neptun travel restriction.60 In this regard, the situation remains that Mr. Muduroglu has had no difficulties in assisting in the preparation of the Claimants' case, as shown by the fact that the Claimants have submitted multiple witness statements by Mr. Muduroglu, together with multiple exhibits.61 Furthermore, the documents which are allegedly outside Azerbaijan were not previously mentioned, and as such, the Respondent contends that this argument is newly created.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request , \u00b6 64.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 65.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have voluntarily chosen to keep the travel restriction in force by not paying the outstanding debt and have also refrained from participating in the auction process.62 Thus, the restriction does not reflect any attempt to undermine the Claimants' preparation of the case, but Mr. Muduroglu's economic decision not to satisfy tax obligations.63\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 32.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 71.\n\n34.\n\nIn relation to the court-ordered auction of Landmark III, the Respondent argues that the alleged urgency is undermined by the fact that the Claimants knew about the upcoming auction since March 2024, nine months before submitting the Renewed Request, and in any event since October 2024.64\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 78.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, in relation to the parallel proceedings, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not aim to prevent the State from exercising its sovereign rights to exercise its judicial powers but rather aims to prevent an investor from bringing a cause of action in multiple fora.65 For provisional measures to be warranted, the cause of action, dispute and parties must be the same, which is not the case here.66\n\nRespondent's Letter, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 81.\n\n36.\n\nFirst, the dispute and cause of action of the domestic proceedings and the arbitration are not the same. The domestic proceedings are a dispute brought by Aqrarkredit against Libra, concerning the enforcement of a debt while the arbitration proceedings concern Azerbaijan's compliance with the BIT.67\n\nRespondent's Letter, \u00b6 17.\n\n37.\n\nSecond, Aqrarkredit's acts are by no means attributable to the State as there is no delegation of governmental authority to Aqrarkredit; there is no evidence of instructions, direction or control on behalf of the State.68\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 82.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there is no significant threat to the *status quo ante* as the domestic court proceedings with Aqrarkredit that led to the auction process were ongoing and known to the Claimants when they submitted their Request for Arbitration before this Tribunal.69\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 80.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that there is no record of any tax fraud investigation against the auction company.70 Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting the allegation that the auction company was dormant for a few years. In any event, Libra had the opportunity to appeal the decision of the enforcement officer on the conduct of the auction by the particular auction company but never filed a complaint.71\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 31.\n\n40.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent asserts that where an award of damages is an adequate remedy, provisional measures should not be ordered. In this case, any damage caused to the Claimants is monetary in nature and could be compensated through a damages award, rendering the recommendation of provisional measures unnecessary.72\n\nRespondent's Letter, \u00b6 30-31; Respondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 6.\n\n41.\n\nLastly, the Respondent claims that these issues are not fit for determination in the context of a request for preliminary measures as they relate to the merits of the dispute.73\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 34.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal has been asked three times by the Claimants to consider interim relief: in the Initial Request, in the TRO Request and in the Renewed Request.\n\n43.\n\nIn their Renewed Request, the Claimants seek an order from the Tribunal to: (i) lift the travel bans imposed on Mr. Muduroglu, and (ii) suspend the auction of Landmark III, as well as all domestic proceedings involving the foreclosure or sale of the investments at issue in this dispute.74\n\n*See* Claimants' Renewed Application, \u00b6 92; Claimants' Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6 22.\n\n44.\n\nWhile the first item, the request to lift the travel bans was included in the Claimants' Initial Request, the second item was not. However, the Tribunal considered the relevant facts related to the auction in its TRO Decision. The Tribunal will first address the request concerning the travel bans and will then turn to the Landmark III auction.\n\n**A. Travel Bans on Mr. Muduroglu**\n-----------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Request is based on the allegation that Mr. Muduroglu has been effectively detained in Azerbaijan by successive travel bans since January 27, 2024, shortly after this arbitration began, imposed on spurious grounds and with no effective legal recourse available.75\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 42.\n\n46.\n\nBy the time of the Tribunal's First Decision on Provisional Measures, the first and second travel bans had seemingly already been lifted.76 However, Mr. Muduroglu remained subject to a third travel ban imposed due to an alleged unpaid tax debt of Neptun.77\n\nTribunal's First Decision Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 46 and 48.\n\nTribunal's First Decision Provisional Measures, \u00b6 51.\n\n47.\n\nIn their Renewed Application, the Claimants presented the following new developments regarding the travel bans.\n\n48.\n\nFirst, according to Claimants and contrary to the Respondent's assertions, the second travel ban related to the Malham tax debt, which Mr. Muduroglu paid under protest, remains in effect.78 This contradicts the Respondent's claim that paying the debt leads to the lifting of the travel ban.79\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants' Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n49.\n\nSecond, the tax audit of Libra, which the tax authorities stated would be completed within 30 working days, has been ongoing for nearly a year. This prolonged audit has provided Azerbaijan with a basis for potentially imposing a new travel restriction on Mr. Muduroglu.80\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n50.\n\nThird, on October 30, 2024, the Baku Court of Appeal ruled on the allegedly outstanding Neptun tax debt, finding that Neptun's position was \"highly likely\" to succeed.81 As a result, the Court ordered the suspension of all measures related to the contested tax assessment\u2014an order that should have led to the lifting of the travel ban but did not.82\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 12, referencing Exhibit C-187.\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these points.\n\n52.\n\nRegarding the Malham travel ban, the Tribunal finds that the evidence presented by the Claimants does not contradict the Respondent's repeated assertion that the restriction was lifted after the Malham tax debt was paid under protest in March 2024.\n\n53.\n\nIn their Renewed Request, the Claimants raised four factual matters: (i) Mr. Muduroglu was notified that the debt was still outstanding as of September 2024;83 (ii) in a hearing before the Baku Court of Appeal regarding the Neptun tax assessment, a judge confirmed that the Malham travel ban remained in effect;84 (iii) Malham's administrative appeal of the tax was rejected;85 and (iv) an administrative hearing concerning the tax was scheduled for February 17, 2025.86\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 16, referencing Exhibit C-190.\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 16, referencing the Fourth Witness Statement of Eran Muduroglu at \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 16, referencing Exhibit C-191.\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 16, referencing the Fourth Witness Statement of Eran Muduroglu at \u00b6 11.\n\n54.\n\nIn response, the Respondent clarified why the debt appeared outstanding in the system, denied that the judge confirmed the continuation of the Malham travel ban, explained the administrative appeal's rejection, and stated that the February hearing concerned the tax assessment and could potentially result in a credit for Malham.87\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 32-39.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal finds these explanations plausible and notes that the Claimants did not address them in their Reply on the Renewed Request.\n\n56.\n\nInstead, the Claimants introduced a new factual matter: a decision from the Azerbaijani Court of Cassation dated November 27, 2024, allegedly upholding the Malham travel ban.88 In its Rejoinder on the Renewed Request, the Respondent clarified that the ruling merely affirmed the restriction was lawful at the time it was imposed, not that it remains in effect.89 The Respondent thus maintains that the Malham travel restriction has been lifted, and the Tribunal will hold the Respondent to that assertion.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 13.\n\n57.\n\nTurning to the Libra tax audit, the Claimants assert that it has exceeded the 30-day limit and may result in a new travel ban. However, the Tribunal lacks sufficient evidence to conclude that the suspensions and extensions, which Mr. Muduroglu consented to, albeit under alleged undue pressure for which there is no conclusive evidence, were contrary to domestic law. Accordingly, based on the current record, it has not been established that the duration of the audit violates domestic law, and, as of today, no travel ban has resulted from this audit. The Tribunal, however, will continue monitoring the developments of this audit and requests the Parties to keep the Tribunal updated, particularly if a clear risk arises of a new travel ban being imposed on Mr. Muduroglu.\n\n58.\n\nAs to the travel restriction arising from the Neptun tax matter, the Claimants argued in their Renewed Request that the Baku Court of Appeal's determination favoring Neptun should have resulted in the travel ban against Mr. Muduroglu being lifted.90 In response, the Respondent explained that \"the Baku Court of Appeal issued temporary protective measures pending the resolution of the dispute and did not finally resolve the Neptun tax dispute,\" and that the travel restriction is subject to separate court proceedings; consequently, \"[t]he travel restriction has been lawfully not suspended based on the Court of Appeal's ruling.\"91\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\n59.\n\nIn their Rejoinder, the Claimants criticized the Azeri system for requiring travel bans related to alleged tax debts to be handled in separate, parallel proceedings that seem unrelated to the validity of the debt. However, they did not dispute the Respondent's assertion that the travel restriction remains lawful under domestic law despite the Court of Appeal's decision, nor did they argue that the separation of these proceedings is illegal or abusive rather than a standard Azeri legal practice.92\n\n*See* Claimants' Reply on Renewed Request, \u00b6 8.\n\n60.\n\nTherefore, it appears undisputed that the travel restriction will be lifted either upon the substantive, favorable resolution of the tax issue for Neptun (which, based on the Baku Court of Appeal October 2024 ruling, is likely to be the case) or when Neptun pays the debt under protest. Furthermore, it seems that Neptun has judicial remedies available to challenge the tax assessment on the merits.\n\n61.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the Tribunal cannot determine that the travel ban resulting from the Neptun tax proceedings is unlawful. However, it remains concerned that the tax proceedings have still not been resolved, and as a result, Mr. Muduroglu has been unable to leave Azerbaijan for over a year.\n\n62.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal's First Decision on Provisional Measures found that the circumstances at the time did not allow it to conclude that the travel bans directly impacted the arbitration,93 it is now concerned that the lack of prompt resolution of these tax proceedings, and the prolonged detention of Mr. Muduroglu as a result, will begin to impinge materially on the Claimants' ability to prosecute this case, particularly in terms of Mr. Muduroglu's access to counsel and the potential chilling effect of his inability to leave Azerbaijan.\n\nFirst Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 69-71.\n\n63.\n\nBased on the facts presented by the Respondent, the Tribunal understands that, in its decision dated October 30, 2024, the Baku Court of Appeal ordered an expert review process on the Neptun tax assessment, which has not yet started because the case file was sent to the Supreme Court for resolution of an appeal filed by the State Tax Service on November 16, 2024.94 The Respondent further explains that on January 21, 2025, the Supreme Court invited the parties to provide objections to the appeal by February 21, 2025, and that once the Supreme Court completes its review, the case file will be returned to the Baku Court of Appeal, allowing the expert review process to commence.95 Given the Court's earlier ruling, the Tribunal would expect that the travel ban would be lifted once the expert review process concludes. The Respondent has provided no reason to think or evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 19.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, \u00b6 20.\n\n64.\n\nAlthough the Respondent notes that it cannot provide a timeline due to the absence of a statutory deadline for such processes,96 the Tribunal expects the matter to be resolved efficiently, so that Mr. Muduroglu's ability to leave the country is clarified without unnecessary delay. Even though it is true that Mr. Muduroglu may avoid the travel ban by paying under protest, it is also true that he has the right to challenge the ban and obtain a prompt resolution of his case by the courts. If the travel ban were not lifted despite a final decision by the Baku Court of Appeals following the expert review, or despite Neptune paying under protest, the Tribunal would view that as a very serious matter indeed.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Renewed Request, fn. 34.\n\n65.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal (i) will not grant the requested measure at this time, but (ii) will direct the Parties to provide an update on the developments in these tax matters by April 15, 2025, after which it may, if deemed appropriate, recommend provisional measures.\n\n**B. The Landmark III Court Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants assert that \"[t]he ongoing court proceedings concerning the auction of Landmark III represent an urgent threat to the principle of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\"97 They argue that the two noncumulative factors tribunals typically consider when deciding whether to stay domestic proceedings under the principle of exclusivity\u2014overlap in (i) subject matter and (ii) parties between the domestic and international proceedings\u2014are satisfied in this case.98 The Respondent maintains that the dispute and cause of action in the domestic proceedings and this arbitration are different and the parties in the domestic proceedings are not the same.99\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00a7 IV.B.\n\nClaimants' Renewed Request, \u00b6 58.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 81.\n\n67.\n\nAs previously noted, the Tribunal reviewed the relevant facts regarding the auction of Landmark III in its TRO Decision and concluded that the Claimants' delay in submitting the TRO Request provided sufficient grounds to deny it.100 Specifically, the Tribunal observed that \"[a] party cannot assert urgency for a provisional measure when it has postponed the submission of its application without good cause shown.\"101\n\nTRO Decision, \u00b6 18.\n\nTRO Decision, \u00b6 18.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the same reasoning applies to the Renewed Request. As the Respondent asserts, \"the auction process forms part of domestic court procedures that had already started when the dispute was presented before the Tribunal.\"102 Therefore, there is no reason why the Claimants could not have requested provisional measures earlier if they believed the matter required urgent intervention from the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Renewed Request, \u00b6 80.\n\n69.\n\nAdditionally, two further reasons support the conclusion that the requested measures should not be granted. First, determining whether the requirements for parallel proceedings are met could involve prejudging issues currently before the Tribunal, including whether Aqrarkredit actions are attributable to Azerbaijan. Second, an award of damages would likely be an adequate remedy if the Tribunal finds a treaty violation concerning the foreclosure proceedings of Landmark III.\n\n70.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the requested measures concerning the Landmark III court proceedings satisfy the criteria of urgency and necessity and, therefore, will not grant the requested relief.\n\n**IV. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\na. Dismisses the Claimants' Renewed Request;\n\nb. Directs the Parties to provide an update on the developments regarding the Libra tax audit, the Neptun tax proceeding, or any other relevant matters related to the travel bans imposed on Mr. Muduroglu by April 15, 2025; and\n\nc. Defers any decision on the costs associated with the Claimants' requests for provisional measures to a later stage of the proceedings.\n\nMarch 7, 2025"}]}
