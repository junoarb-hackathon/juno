Indeed, one of the basic reasons of my unease with this excessively long award, is its style of turning around the main issues and drowning them into an ocean of minutia and elaborated details, rather than confronting them frontally and treating them thoroughly. This is why I shall not, in this opinion, enumerate and analyze all the \"objects\" of my objections, but - while reserving my position on the other preliminary objections of Argentina - shall limit my remarks and analysis mainly to the two fundamental points mentioned above, which overshadow all the others; not, however, before addressing my second level of disagreement.\n\n4.\n\nThe second ground of my disagreement with the majority award, is situated at a further remove, at the level of legal method and reasoning, as well as the understanding of some basic principles, rules and concepts of international law, such as jurisdiction and admissibility, and the principles and methods of interpretation ; that which I shall illustrate by using the example of the handling by the majority award of the fourth preliminary objection, based on the requirement of prior consultations and resort to national courts for 18 months before going to arbitration. (See Section II below).\n\n5.\n\nHowever, before turning to these objections, I have to articulate some basic premises and concepts from which my analysis proceeds.\n\n6.\n\ni) This is technically an international *ad hoc* arbitral Tribunal. It is \"*ad hoc*\" because specially established to hear one specific case, suit or action. It is \"international\" because it is rooted in two layers of international treaties : the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Italy and Argentina. As such it functions under, and is governed by international law, and has to be clearly distinguished from \"international\" commercial arbitration tribunals, such as those established within the framework of the International Chamber of Commerce, which function under national law and ultimate national judicial control. It is necessary to keep this distinction in mind, as solutions may vary at these two distinct levels; and what is sometimes permissible in municipal law, is not necessarily acceptable in international law.\n\n7.\n\nii) In international law, all tribunals - not only arbitral, but even judicial - are tribunals of attributed, hence limited jurisdiction (*juridictions d\u2019attribution).* There is no tribunal or system of tribunals of plenary or general jurisdiction (*juridiction de droit commun)* that covers all cases and subjects, barring exceptions falling under - i.e. attributed to - the jurisdiction of a specialized tribunal. This is because, in the absence of a centralized power on the international level that exercises the judicial function through a judicial system empowered from above (or rather incarnating the judicial power as part of the centralized power), all international adjudicatory bodies are empowered from below, being based on the consent and agreement of the subjects (i.e. the litigants, *les justiciables)* themselves (with the very limited exception of tribunals created by international organizations in the exercise of their powers under their constitutive treaties, which are also ultimately based on the consent of the subjects that concluded or adhered to these constitutive treaties).\n\n8.\n\niii) This is the reason why, the fundamental principle and basic rule in international adjudication, is that of the consensual basis of jurisdiction. It also explains the prominent place of questions of jurisdiction both in the jurisprudence and in the writings on international adjudication. It explains as well the widely shared perception that the first task of an international tribunal is to ascertain its jurisdiction; and the great care international tribunals take in establishing from the outset, the existence and limits of the consent of the parties before them, on which their jurisdiction is founded.\n\n9.\n\niv) Jurisdiction as a concept in international law, partakes of its generic meaning in the general theory of law; but is further specified and particularized in function of the fundamental principle of the consensual basis of international adjudication.\n\n10.\n\nThe term \"jurisdiction\" (from the latin \"*jurisdictio\",* literally to \"pronounce\" or \"enunciate the law\", *dire le droit),* when used in the judicial or adjudicative context, denotes \"the legal power of an organ to decide cases (in general) or a case (in particular) by application of law\". In other words, it is the empowerment to exercise the judicial function. Thus, jurisdiction refers first and foremost to a *legal power* to exercise a certain type of activity, the judicial function1.\n\nSee different definitions of the term (putting emphasis on power), in *Black\u2019s Law Dictionary* (6th ed., 1990) : *Jurisdiction* : A term of comprehensive import embracing every kind of judicial action...It is *the power* of the court to decide a matter in controversy and presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court with control over the subject matter and the parties... Jurisdiction defines *the powers* of courts to inquire into facts, apply the law, make decisions, and declare judgment... The legal right by which judges exercise their authority...*Power* and *authority* of a court to hear and determine a judicial proceeding; and *a power* to render particular judgment in question...\" (emphasis added).\n\n11.\n\nIn English, however, the term \"jurisdiction\" is also used to designate the \"ambit\" or \"sphere\" within or over which this power is exercised, though in other languages, such as French and Spanish, another term is used to designate the \"ambit\", which is \"competence\". Some writers and arbitral decisions seem to be oblivious of the primary and more fundamental meaning of jurisdiction as power, limiting the term to the ambit of this power. Jurisdiction as ambit is defined as a four-dimensional sphere, by its extent and limits in time (*ratione temporis)* and space *(ratione loci)*, and over subjects (*ratione personae)* and objects or subjects-matters (*ratione materiae)*.\n\n12.\n\nv) In international law, because of its consensual basis, jurisdiction as an ambit is analyzed and scrutinized at two different levels, where adjudication is not intended for one case only, but takes place within an institutional setting, either of a standing organ (such as the ICJ) or a framework within which *ad hoc* tribunals are established (such as the PCA and the ICSID) :\n\na) - \"general jurisdiction\" which defines the objective range and outer limits of the ambit for all cases, according to the constitutive instrument of the organ (e.g. the ICJ Statute), or the framework convention (e.g. the ICSID Convention;.\n\nb) - \"special jurisdiction\" which defines the subjective range and limits of the ambit of jurisdiction of the organ in a particular case, according to the specific jurisdictional title bearing the consent of the parties, on the basis of which the case is brought before the organ.\n\n13.\n\nThe consent of the parties cannot go beyond the objective limits of the general jurisdiction of the organ, but can restrict its jurisdiction further within these objective limits, by the parties subjecting their consent to additional limits, conditions or reservations. These can relate to any of the four dimensions of the ambit. But they can also relate to the powers of the organ as such (the primary meaning of jurisdiction), as long as this does not touch the hard core requirements of the judicial function, for example by excluding from its powers the indication of provisional measures.\n\n14.\n\nIn case of ICSID arbitration, the jurisdictional title for general jurisdiction is the Convention itself. For \"special jurisdiction\", the title is usually two-tiered : the BIT between the two States and the consent in writing of the two parties to the dispute.\n\n15.\n\nThus, for an ICSID *ad hoc* tribunal, a triple-layered consent is usually required. For such a Tribunal to take jurisdiction over a case, it has to ascertain :\n\na - that the case falls within the jurisdiction of the ICSID as defined by the ICSID Convention and related instruments (Rules of Procedure, etc.);\n\nb - that it falls within the bounds defined by the BIT between the State party to the ICSID arbitration and the national State of the investor (which usually - but not necessarily - also carries the consent of the two states to arbitrate);\n\nc - and that the case is covered by the specific written consent of the parties to the dispute (which can be for the State party, the BIT or another unilateral act bearing its consent. But it can also be a compromissory clause in a contract between the parties; and for the investor it can be the request of arbitration itself).\n\nThe Tribunal has to ascertain the existence and scope of the consent of the parties within the limits prescribed by them in each of the above-mentioned instruments.\n\n16.\n\nvii) The requirement to ascertain the existence and scope of consent, while strict and exacting in international law, does not mean the restrictive interpretation of the jurisdictional title (the old theory of interpretation in favour of sovereignty, as far as the State party is concerned). But it does not mean either its extensive interpretation beyond \"the horizon of foreseeability\"; i.e. extending jurisdiction to what the party or parties could not have foreseen at the time the treaty was concluded or consent was given. Interpretation is limited here to the establishment of the reality and extent of the consent of the party or parties, at the time it was given.\n\n17.\n\nviii) As with jurisdiction, the concept of admissibility in international law partakes of its generic meaning in the general theory of law, but is further particularized in function of the specificities of international adjudication, including its consensual basis.\n\n18.\n\nGenerically, the admissibility conditions relate to the claim, and whether it is ripe and capable of being examined judicially, as well as to the claimant, and whether he or she is legally empowered to bring the claim to court.\n\n19.\n\nIt is true that these conditions were adjusted to the specificities of international law, and some additional ones were developed, by way of custom. But none of these conditions has anything to do with the determination of the scope of consent whether to the general or the special jurisdiction of tribunals, contrary to what the majority award asserts (para. 496); these questions being jurisdictional by essence.\n\nII - The Fourth Preliminary Objection\n-------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThis objection is based on the non-fulfilment by the Claimants of the requirements of prior consultations (or negotiations) and, in case they fail to settle the dispute, resort to local courts for 18 months before going to arbitration. These two conditions are stipulated in paragraphs 1 to 3 of article 8 of the BIT dealing with the settlement of disputes, which constitutes the second layer of the jurisdictional title in the present case (para. 15 above), and the preliminary objection based on them is presented by the Respondent as a plea to jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nThe majority award rejects this legal characterization on the basis of an incomprehensible distinction between \"conditioning its [a State party\u2019s] consent to ICSID jurisdiction to the fulfilment of a pre-condition\" - which, I presume, would constitute a jurisdictional limitation according to the majority award - and \"conditioning the effective implementation of such consent, i.e. the possibility to resort to ICSID arbitration, to the fulfilment of such a pre-condition\" (para. 494), which can lead \"only - if at all - to a lack of admissibility of the claim\" (para. 496).\n\n22.\n\nAbstruseness and the absence of any suggested criterion to effect this distinction apart, I can see no legal or logical objective reason to distinguish between the different conditions, reservations or limitations that parties attach to their consent in the jurisdictional title, be it one or a multi-layered one, as in the present case, and be these reservations or conditions related to the general or the special jurisdiction of the tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nIt is true that, under general international law, the two requirements in question are considered as conditions of admissibility. But when such conditions are included in the jurisdictional title, they condition, like any other reservation inserted in the jurisdictional title, the consent of the party or parties making them, to submit to the jurisdiction of the judicial or arbitral organ, and limit by that much the exercise by the organ of its jurisdiction. In other words, in this case these conditions become conventionally jurisdictional, in addition to being admissibility conditions by their legal nature.\n\n24.\n\nBut the fatal blow to the majority opinion\u2019s distinction comes from much closer quarters. For the non-adepts at legal analysis, it suffices to read the second sentence of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention (\"A contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\"), to discover that such a stipulated requirement conditions the *consent to arbitrate* and not merely \"the effective implementation of such consent\", whatever that means. As such, it is a limit to jurisdiction, and the plea based on it is a plea to jurisdiction and not to admissibility.\n\n25.\n\nBe that as it may, and regardless of the classification of the objection as a plea to jurisdiction or to admissibility, the result of the non-fulfilment of the requirements should have been the same, the dismissal of the case. But what is even more striking in the treatment by the majority award of these two conditions (under admissibility), is the short shrift it gives them and the cavalier way it disposes of them.\n\n26.\n\nThus, the requirement of prior consultations, in spite of the peremptory \"shall\" of article 8/1 of the BIT2, and the clear text of this paragraph, the majority award practically strikes it out of the treaty, together with the paragraph that stipulates it, on the ground, *inter alia*, that:\n\n\"In the view of the Tribunal, the consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT is not to be considered of a mandatory nature but as the expression of the good will of the Parties to try firstly to settle any dispute in an amicable way\" (para. 564).\n\nAnd this is because the provision contains the proviso \"to the extent possible\". But this proviso is inherent to all \"obligations of means\" or of \"best efforts\" (*obligations de moyen),* which would be, according to the majority award\u2019s reasoning, devoid of any legal effect and can be simply ignored, rendering the provisions stipulating them totally useless (with no *effet utile)*!\n\nArticle 8 : 1. Any dispute relating to investments that may arise between an investor from one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, with respect to matters regulated by this Agreement, **shall** be, insofar as possible, resolved through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute\" (emphasis added).\n\n27.\n\nMore aggravating still, is the manner in which the majority award treated the second of these requirements, that of resorting to Argentinean tribunals for 18 months before initiating arbitration. Here, the majority award admits that this requirement should have been, but was not complied with by the Claimants. But it immediately adds, at para. 579 : \"At the same time, the wording of Article 8 BIT itself does not suffice to draw specific conclusions with regard to the consequence of non compliance with the order established by Article 8\", and, at para. 580, that \"Claimants\u2019 disregard of the...requirement is in itself not yet sufficient to preclude Claimants from resorting to arbitration\".\n\n28.\n\nThese last two sentences are very odd indeed. For no instrument, laying down jurisdictional limits or admissibility conditions, specifies the legal consequences of non observance of these limits or non fulfilment of these conditions. These consequences are embedded in the very legal classification of these as jurisdictional limits or admissibility conditions. According to the general rules of law and rules of general international law, non compliance begets the inevitable legal sanction of dismissing the case, as falling outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or as inadmissible. Only if the parties want to waive or vary this sanction do they address the effect of non compliance in the instrument. Otherwise, in case of silence, it is the rules of general international law that apply.\n\n29.\n\nInstead, and in spite of its admission that the requirement is obligatory and that it was not fulfiled, the majority award decides to proceed to a \"weighing of the interests of the Parties\" (para. 582), it concludes that \"it would be unfair to deprive the investor of its right to resort to arbitration based on the mere disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement\" (para. 583); adding : \"[T]his conclusion derives more from a weighing of the specific interests at stake than from the application of the general principle of futility\" (para. 584); before rejecting the preliminary objection.\n\n30.\n\nHere again, the majority award takes the liberty of striking out a clear conventional requirement, on the basis of its purely subjective judgment; that which calls for three remarks.\n\n31.\n\nFirst, the \"balancing of interests\", that the majority award arrogates to itself the right to go behind the text (or across the mirror) in order to operate, has already been done, at the appropriate legislative level, by the parties themselves, introducing the requirement in the Treaty, but limiting it to 18 months. And it was reflected or registered in the clear text. It is not open to the Tribunal, which is now called upon to apply it, to put it into question in the name of a rebalancing of interests more to its liking, at the expense of the one agreed by the parties.\n\n32.\n\nSecondly, both the language (\"it would be unfair\") and the stance of the argument, are those of a tribunal judging *ex aequo et bono*, which is prohibited by the rules of general international law and the ICSID Convention, except by agreement of the parties (Article 42/3); absent which, the judgment is *ultra vires.*\n\n33.\n\nThirdly, the presumed unfairness derives, according to the majority award, from the fact that \"the deprivation of the investor\u2019s right to resort to arbitration would, in effect, deprive him of an important and efficient dispute settlement means\" (para. 583). Elsewhere in the award, it is even contended that the dismissal of the case would deprive the securities holders of *any* effective means of dispute settlement. **But I beg to differ**. For, apart from the Argentinean courts that the Claimants had not even tried, they could have gone to the chosen fora in the security entitlement instruments, which are neutral fora of major financial centers; or to Italian courts, against the banks that sold them the security entitlements in the bonds, and whose ambiguous role, when later grouped as Task Force Argentina, is strongly contested by the Respondent as having diverted the bondholders from those normal fora for this type of disputes, towards the extraordinary forum of ICSID arbitration, in order to circumvent their own responsibility.\n\nIII - The Ninth Preliminary Objection\n-------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThis objection is based on the contention that the security entitlements in the Argentinean bonds held by the Claimants, do not constitute a covered or protected \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Italy and Argentina; and that, in consequence, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the case.\n\n35.\n\nThis is, to my knowledge, the first ICSID case that involves a sovereign debt bond (or a security entitlement therein), totally unrelated to a specific project or economic operation or enterprise in the borrowing State. It raises a major issue as to the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals over a vast new field, with incalculable economic and political ramifications.\n\n36.\n\nThe assessment of this preliminary objection requires defining what is a protected or covered \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and whether the financial security entitlements in question fall within this definition.\n\n37.\n\nIn what follows, I shall proceed to address these questions by successive approximations, indicating, where appropriate, the points of my divergence from the majority award.\n\nA - Investment under the ICSID Convention in General\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nStarting with the ICSID Convention, the task is to identify the purport of the term \"investment\" in paragraph 1 of article 25, which defines the scope of jurisdiction of the Centre as extending \"to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment...\". It is to be noted, however, that beyond this mention, the Convention does not provide expressly a definition of what is meant by \"investment\" for its purposes.\n\n39.\n\nThis led to one opinion according to which, since the ICSID Convention does not define \"investment\", this task is totally abdicated or left to the BIT (or another jurisdictional title, on the basis of which the case is brought before an ICSID arbitral tribunal). In consequence, according to this opinion, there is no need for a \"double-barreled\" test the claim has to pass, under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT, in order to qualify as an investment. It suffices to qualify only under the BIT (or another jurisdictional title reflecting the consent of the Parties).\n\n40.\n\nThis opinion does not withstand scrutiny. That the ICSID Convention does not provide an express definition of investment does not automatically imply that the definition is totally left to the BITs. This is because words have an intrinsic meaning, hence a limited and limiting one, however large and vague it may be (although there is always a penumbra around the limits which provides the margin of interpretation). Without limits, words would be meaningless, because undistinguishable from one another. The intrinsic meaning of a word, which is its \"ordinary\" meaning, is further specified by the way it is used and the context in which it is used; and if it figures in a treaty, by the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n41.\n\nA clear distinction has to be made between the use of the term \"investment\" in the financial context and in the ICSID context. In financial markets, \"investment\" covers the acquisition of any kind of assets such as deposit accounts, debt and equity securities, credit default swaps and derivatives.\n\n42.\n\nThis over-wide financial concept of investment is fundamentally different from the concept of investment envisaged when drafting the ICSID Convention and followed in its context since. And in the words of the Annulment Committee in *Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo :*\n\n\"It is obvious that the special and privileged arrangements established by the Washington Convention can be applied only to the type of investment which the Contracting States to the Convention envisaged\"3.\n\nDecision on the Application for Annulment of the Award of 9 February 2004 (1 Nov. 2006). ICSID case No ARB/99/7, para. 25.\n\n43.\n\nThe *Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention reveal the limiting or restricting intent behind the introduction and further qualification of the term \"investment\" in the provision that became article 25. Thus, in response to concerns about the over-broad jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in the Working Paper which simply referred to \"disputes\", the Preliminary Draft introduced the term \"investment\" as a qualifier before \"disputes\", in defining the ambit of jurisdiction (\"any existing or future *investment* dispute of a legal nature\")4.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, vol. I, pp. 110-112.\n\n44.\n\nThis was further narrowed in the First Draft : \"all legal disputes...arising out of or in connection with any investment\"5. This formula was in turn strongly attacked as too wide, particularly the clause \"in connection with\", which was struck out by a vote of 26 to 8, while adding the further qualifier \"directly\" into the Second (revised) Draft that became the actual formula : \"any dispute arising *directly* out of an investment\"6.\n\nIbid. p. 116.\n\nIbid. p. 118.\n\n45.\n\nThe purpose for using the term \"investment\" in article 25/1 was thus to set objective outer-limits to the types of disputes that can be treated within the ICSID7; and that is enough to refute the opinion referred to in paragraph 38 above. It is true that these outer-limits bound a vast ambit, to the point of not being clearly visible to some. But they exist all the same.\n\nThe exclusion of certain types of transactions, starting with ordinary commercial transactions, i.e. the purchase of goods and services in the normal course of business, was clearly on the mind of the drafters of the Convention, particularly its main architect, A. Broches (ibid. Vol II, p. 83). It was frequently reiterated by ICSID Tribunals, e.g. *SGS v. Pakistan*, (Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, para. 133) : \"...investment...embod[ies] certain core meaning which distinguishes it from \u2018an ordinary commercial transaction\u2019 such as a simple, stand alone, sale of goods or services\"; *Phoenix Action v. Czech* Republic (Award 15 April 2009, para. 96) : \"There is nothing like a total discretion, even if the definition [of investment] developed by ICSID case law is quite broad and encompassing. There are indeed some basic criteria and parties are not free to decide in BITS that anything - like a sale of goods or a dowry for example - is an investment\".\n\n46.\n\nDifferently put, the term \"investment\" in article 25/1 of the ICSID Convention, whilst flexible enough, is not infinitely elastic8. It leaves much latitude and a wide margin of interpretation and further specification to States in their BITs; but not to the point of rendering it totally vacuous, without any legal effect. In other words, the term has a hard-core that cannot be waived even by agreement of States parties to a BIT9.\n\nSee Michael Waibel, \"Opening Pandora\u2019s Box : Sovereign Bonds in International Arbitration\" 101 *AJIL* (2007, No. 4), p. 711 at p. 722.\n\nSee *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, supra* note 7. The Tribunal adds : \"...BITs which are bilateral arrangements between two States parties, cannot contradict the definition of the ICSID Convention. In other words, they can confirm the ICSID notion or restrict it, but they cannot expand it in order to have access to ICSID. A definition included in a BIT being based on a text agreed between two States cannot set aside the definition of the ICSID Convention, which is a multilateral agreement\".\n\n47.\n\nTo identify this hard-core, one has to look further into the general context of the ICSID Convention and the circumstances surrounding its elaboration as well as to its object and purpose.\n\n48.\n\nIt is most significant that the ICSID Convention was elaborated and the Centre established on the initiative and within the framework of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; an institution which concentrated its activities since the early sixties almost exclusively to the second facet of its mandate according to its title, i.e. the \"development\" of the less developed countries.\n\n49.\n\nThe Preamble of the Convention clearly reveals its \"developmental\" object and purpose, as a means of encouraging \"international cooperation for development, and the role of private international investment therein\"; and this by making available \"facilities for international conciliation or arbitration\", besides the national courts of host States, to settle potential disputes arising from such investments between private foreign investors and those States.\n\n50.\n\nThe investment that the Convention seeks to encourage by providing it with an international procedural guarantee is that which contributes to the economic development of the host country, i.e. to the expansion of its productive capacity, a contribution that presupposes a commitment to this task not only of economic resources, but also in terms of duration in time and the taking of risk, with the expectation of reaping profits and/or revenue in return.\n\n51.\n\nThe different attempts by ICSID tribunals to capture the essence of this hard-core concept of investment in article 25 and formulate it in terms of criteria or conditions - particularly the classical *Salini* criteria10; but also in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic*11; as well as in the recent *Romak S.A. v. Uzbekistan* case12 - all turn around the same idea, with minor variations.\n\nSalini Construttori v. Morocco, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, ICSID case No. ARB/09/4, para. 55-56).\n\nSupra, note 7, at para. 82.\n\nPCA case No. AA 280, Award of 26 Nov. 2009, para. 180, 207, quoted in the majority award, para. 370.\n\n52.\n\nThe fact that the *Salini* criteria or the other similar formulations are not expressly laid down in the ICSID Convention does not mean that they do not articulate, perhaps imperfectly, an obligatory requirement of article 25, or that this requirement has no constraining effect if States parties to the ICSID Convention chose to ignore it in their BITs, as the muddled analysis of this issue in the majority award seems at one point to suggest (para. 364, also 351). But the award hedges the issue by contending that in any case, the investment in question satisfies the requirement, at least as formulated in the *Romak v. Uzbekistan* case (para.371); a contention subject to verification below.\n\n53.\n\nWhat type of investment corresponds to this requirement ? It is worth recalling that the main object and purpose of the Convention was to encourage the flow of private foreign investment into developing countries, by making available an additional international procedural facility or guarantee that counter-balances the host State\u2019s regulatory authority over investment and economic activities in its territory; in other words, by providing a neutral international forum in case of dispute, as an alternative to submitting to the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the host State.\n\n54.\n\nSuch facility is basically needed by private foreign direct investment, for it is this type of investment that once it is carried out in the host country, for example by building factories or establishing enterprises, falls under the imperium of the host State in terms of legislation and adjudication.\n\n55.\n\nDirect foreign investment is then the \"ideal type\" of investment (in the Weberian sense of the term) for ICSID purposes. But does it exhaust the ambit of ICSID jurisdiction *ratione materiae* ? And if not, how far can an alleged investment depart from the ideal type and still be covered by the Convention, i.e. and still be considered as falling within the objective outer- limits set by article 25 ?\n\n56.\n\nThis question arises particularly in relation to \"portfolio investments\" and other financial negotiable products traded in the financial markets, which cover a wide spectrum ranging from standardized instruments such as shares, bonds and loans to structured and derivative products, such as hedges (of currencies, oil, etc.) and credit default swaps.\n\n57.\n\nSuch widely dispersed off-the shelf financial products, with their high velocity of circulation and their remoteness, the same as their holders, from the State in whose territory the investment is supposed to take place (being traded within seconds at the touch of a button in capital markets, with no involvement or knowledge of the borrowing country, nor passage through the territory or the legal system of that State), seem at first blush to be worlds apart from the direct foreign investment model, which is usually long negotiated and extensively embedded in the legal environment of the host State.\n\n58.\n\nThis raises acutely the question of the conformity of these financial products with the requirements of article 25 and evokes a kind of informal presumption that, because of their intrinsic characteristics described above, they are excluded *per se*, i.e. automatically, from the protected or covered investments under the Convention.\n\n59.\n\nAll the same, the empirical evidence reveals that whilst the vast majority of transactions considered by ICSID tribunals to constitute covered or protected investments under the Convention consisted of direct foreign investment, some of these tribunals have also considered negotiable financial products, in certain circumstances, as covered investments. Some BITs also include financial products, or some of them, in their illustrative list of investment.\n\n60.\n\nThis practice goes against the presumption that financial products are disqualified *per se* and automatically as protected investment under the Convention; that which led a learned commentator to observe that \"[p]ortfolio investment(s)...are not excluded as a rule\"13.\n\nG.

But it also means that they can be excluded in certain cases. In other words, it means that the exclusion or inclusion cannot be operated automatically, on the basis of the mere classification of the instruments *per se*, but has to be done on a case by case basis, depending on other factors and criteria that lie beyond the mere categorization of the instrument in question; factors and criteria that I examine below in relation to the alleged investment in the present case.\n\nB - Applying the BIT and the Convention to the Alleged Investment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nArticle 1 (\"Definitions\") of the BIT between Italy and Argentina provides in its first paragraph (in the unofficial English translation of Argentina) :\n\n\"For the purposes of this Agreement :\n\n1. The term \u2018investment\u2019 shall mean, in conformity with the legal system of the receiving Country and independently from the legal form adopted or from any other connected legal system, any contribution or asset invested or reinvested by physical or juridical persons of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nWithin this general context, the following are specifically, but not exclusively, considered to be investments :\n\n.....\n\nc. debt obligations, public or private securities or any other right to benefits or services with an economic value, as well as capitalized income;\"\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 English translation of lit. c. is somewhat different :\n\n\"c. bonds, private or public financial instruments or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues;\"\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s English translation is as follows :\n\n\"c. obligations, private or public titles or any other right to performances of services having economic value, including capitalized revenues;\"\n\n65.\n\nHaving examined the wording of this provision and the nature of the alleged investment *in casu*, the majority award concludes that : \"Claimants purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitute a contribution which qualifies as \u2018investment\u2019 *per se* under Article 1(1) of the BIT\" (para. 371).\n\n66.\n\nBefore reaching this conclusion, the majority award dispenses with the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, by examining three alternative theories or views (which it paradoxically counts as two) (para.368). The first is to apply the double-barreled test; but if the alleged investment or contribution satisfies the BIT test, but not the *Salini* test, the former test should prevail, i.e. discarding the requirements of Article 25, according to *Salini* (paras. 363-368). The second view is simply to discard the double-barreled test and require only a BIT test, discarding formally and totally any requirements by the ICSID Convention in this regard! (para. 369). The third view, pays lip service to Article 25 of the Convention by maintaining that, if need be, the term \"investment\" *per se* in Article 1/1 of the BIT can be analyzed in the same manner as in Article 25 of the Convention, as interpreted in the *Romak v.Uzbekistan* case (para. 371). From which statement the majority award presumably expects the reader to infer and assume that the alleged investment satisfies the criteria of *Romak*, without any further proof or demonstration on the part or the award, which jumps directly to the conclusion that \"Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitute a contribution which qualifies as investment *per se* under Article 1(1) of the BIT\" (para. 371).\n\n67.\n\nBe that as it may, this conclusion or finding of the majority award calls for verification on several levels, namely, (by ascending order of importance) :\n\ni - Do the securities in question really correspond to Article 1/1/c of the BIT ?\n\nii - Could they be considered as protected investments in Argentina in view of their legal remoteness, the same as their present holders, from Argentina, and the bonds it initially issued ?\n\niii - Assuming that both preceding questions are answered in the affirmative, do these securities fulfil the substantive conditions of the Convention and the BIT relating to the contribution, particularly the territorial link ?\n\n68.\n\n(i) Concerning the first question : whether the alleged investment is covered by Article 1/1/c of the BIT or not, there is no need to revisit here the controversy over the correct English translation of \"obligaciones\", and whether it is \"bonds\" (Claimants), or \"debt obligations\" (Respondent), or merely \"obligations\" (Tribunal). On this question I agree with the majority analysis that Article 1/1/c covers financial instruments, and that its language is large enough to encompass the security entitlements in the Argentinean bonds.\n\n69.\n\n(ii) The problem raised by the second question is much more complicated than transpires from the simplistic argument by which the majority award brushes it asides, simply affirming that the bonds and the security entitlements \"are part of one and the same economic operation\" (para. 359).\n\n70.\n\nThe award fails clearly to distinguish between purchases on the primary market, involving the issuer (Argentina) and the first buyers of the issue (the underwriters), and the secondary market, where previously issued securities are traded, without any involvement of the sovereign debtor. An ICSID Tribunal cannot look only at the economics of a transaction, without taking into consideration its legal framework and structure, in order to determine whether it qualifies as a protected \"investment\" or not.\n\n71.\n\nEven from a purely economic point of view (not to mention the legal perspective), the passage from the primary to the secondary market is neither automatic nor certain. The underwriters of the bonds bear the risk of not attracting enough demand, which is one reason why they receive an underwriting spread. Moreover, they may want to keep bonds as part of their portfolio. Similarly, and also from an exclusively economic point of view, the position of Argentina in these two markets is totally different. In the primary market, Argentina received the proceeds of the initial issuance of the bonds from the underwriters. By contrast, the flow of funds triggered by transactions in the secondary market is exclusively between the buyer and seller of the security entitlements, its volume depending on the conditions prevailing in that market, and bearing no visible relation to the lump-sum received by Argentina from the underwriters at issuance14.\n\nSee, Waibel, \"Opening Pandora\u2019s Box\", *supra* note 8. p.727.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus bound to look at the circumstances of the individual purchases of security entitlements, and their traceability to - i.e. the strength or tenuousness of their legal *nexus* with - Argentina, before it can decide whether the dispute over each of them \"aris[es] directly out of an investment\"; in other words whether they satisfy the requirements of a covered or protected \"investment\" under the Convention and the BIT, on which hinges its jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\nC - The Territorial Link\n------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the answer to the first two questions calling for verification is in the affirmative (an assumption that I refute regarding the second question, as just explained above), there remains the third, and more problematic question, namely : do these security entitlements satisfy the other, substantive, conditions of the Convention and the BIT, particularly that of a territorial nexus or link with Argentina ?\n\n74.\n\nA territorial link or nexus is inherent in the concept of \"investment\" in article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The whole idea behind the Convention was to encourage the flow of private foreign investment to developing countries by offering an international guarantee in the form of an alternative neutral adjudication of disputes arising out of such investment in the territory of the host States, typically subject to its laws and courts.\n\n75.\n\nIn addition, the Argentina-Italy BIT unambiguously requires a territorial link between the alleged investment and the host country. The Preamble of the Argentina-Italy BIT expresses the State parties\u2019 intentions to \"create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either State *in the territory of the other*\" - a standard formulation found in many BITs. The definition of investment in Article 1 refers to \"any contribution or asset invested or reinvested by physical or juridical persons of one Contracting Party *in the territory of the other*\", and Article 1/4 carefully delimits the BIT\u2019s territorial ambit.\n\n76.\n\nThe BIT\u2019s substantive provisions are also conditioned on a territorial link, including :\n\nArticle 2 (protection and promotion of investments) calls on each contracting party to \"encourage the making of investments *in its territory* by investors of the other Contracting Party\";\n\nArticle 2/2 (full protection and security) obliges each party to refrain from \"adopting unjustified or discriminatory measures that impair the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation and liquidation of investments made *in its territory* by investors of the other Contracting Party\";\n\nArticle 3 (national and most favoured treatment) likewise contains the qualifier \"within its own territory\";\n\nArticle 4 (compensation for damage or loss) refers to \"the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made\".\n\n77.\n\nThis requisite territorial link is clearly absent in the present case. The alleged investment, the security entitlements, are not located in Argentina by applying either the legal or the material criteria for determining such location\n\n78.\n\n1) *The legal criteria* : the financial securities instruments that constitute the alleged investment, i.e. the security entitlements in Argentinean bonds, have been sold in international financial markets, outside Argentina, with choice of law and forum selection clauses subjecting them to laws and fora foreign to Argentina. In fact, they were intentionally situated outside Argentina and out of reach of its laws and tribunals. There is no way then to say (and no legal basis for saying) that they are legally located in Argentina.\n\n79.\n\nThe majority award contests this clear conclusion on two grounds :\n\na) The first is that the above conclusion \"would mean that forum selection clauses determine the place where contractual performance is supposed to take place\", whilst they are merely \"of a procedural nature aiming to determine the place of settlement of a dispute relating to contractual performance\", but \"have nothing to do with the place where a party is supposed to perform its obligations\" (para. 379).\n\n80.\n\nThe majority award appears thus to suggest that the determinative factor is the place of performance. If this criterion is applied, there can be no doubt that the place of performance under the securities instruments at issue is invariably outside Argentina, given the use of fiscal agents, paying agents, depositories and places of payment all situated outside Argentina. Factors other than the place of performance also point to the location of the securities in question outside Argentina.\n\n81.\n\nAmong these other factors, I consider a clause selecting courts external to the host State, as a prominent one in determining where the security instruments, and the underlying right to repayment of the debt, are located15.\n\nBayview v. Mexico, Preliminary Objections, Award of 19 June 2007, paras 101-102.\n\n82.\n\nTo answer the question whether the securities in question are located in Argentinean territory, this Tribunal needs to determine the *situs* of the debt - i.e. the alleged investment - using a systematic approach consistent with well founded and established precedents and drawing on private international law rules. The foreign governing law and foreign forum, while not determinative by themselves, are important factors in determining *situs*. Other factors include the currency of payment, the place of payment and the residence of the intermediaries. On any of these criteria, the transactions at issue here were deliberately structured so as to have their *situs* outside Argentina16.\n\nSee, Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 171; Michael Waibel, *Sovereign Defaults before International Courts and Tribunals* (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 239.\n\n83.\n\nb) - The other argument by which the majority award tries to counter the obvious conclusion that the alleged investment is legally located outside Argentina, is that forum selection clauses (ignoring the other numerous connecting factors and criteria mentioned above) are contractual stipulations and as such they are irrelevant for locating the \"investment\" for the purposes of a \"treaty claim\", which is based on other rights and obligations derived from the BIT (para. 379).\n\n84.\n\nBut this facile escape route (*\u00e9chappatoire*) is to no avail in the instant case. A treaty claim is necessarily based on a right that has been allegedly violated; here, the debt that was not repaid. If this right is created by contract, it is the contract that governs its legal existence and the modalities of this existence, including the location of this right (and its reciprocal obligation). And the right in the present case has been purposefully located outside Argentina.\n\n85.\n\nThe treaty claim cannot by-pass or circumvent this right, or change its modalities of existence, including its *situs* according to its legal title - the contract and the applicable law under which it exists - as this right, in its fixed legal configuration, serves as the legal basis underlying the treaty claim.\n\n86.\n\nA treaty claim cannot allege a violation of a right, while ignoring the specific legal configuration of this right. The treaty may define the kinds of violation, but the underlying right subject to these violations, is defined only by its legal title, and the applicable law that governs its existence.\n\n87.\n\nIn conclusion, the alleged investment, i.e. the financial securities and their underlying debt, by all legally recognized connecting factors and criteria, have their *situs* outside Argentina; a treaty claim based on the nonpayment of this debt, or other violations of the right it represents, cannot change the legal configuration of this right, including its *situs* outside Argentina. In consequence, the alleged investment does not constitute an \"investment in the territory of Argentina\", and thus falls outside the ambit of jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione materiae.*\n\n88.\n\n2) *The material criteria for determining the situs of the \"investment\"* : As was just explained, the majority award discards the contractual clauses and arrangements stipulated in the securities instruments as relevant factors for the location of the *situs* of the investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, whilst proposing other material or economic criteria. It is noteworthy in this respect that the section under which this question is addressed in the majority award is entitled \"Made in Argentina\" (i.e. investment \"made in Argentina\") and not \"Made in *the territory* of Argentina\", following the language of article 1/1 of the BIT, an omission symptomatic of the result-oriented style of the whole award.\n\n89.\n\nThe majority award starts by an affirmation that \"the determination of the place of the investment... depends on the nature of such investment\" (para. 374); to reach the conclusion that an \"investment of purely financial nature\" need not be \"linked to a specific economic enterprise or operation taking place in the territory of the host State\" (para. 375), basing itself on arguments it draws from a) Article 1/1/c of the BIT, and b) the nature of the investment. These arguments are examined in what follows.\n\n90.\n\na) Arguments drawn from article 1/1/c of the BIT : The majority award states that :\n\ni - Article 1/1/c \"designates financial instruments as an express kind of investment covered by the BIT\", i.e. as a covered investment *per se,* or as such; in consequence,\n\nii - \"it would be contrary to the BIT\u2019s wording and aim to attach a further condition to the protection of financial investment instruments\" (para. 375)\n\n91.\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to explain what the qualification \"*per se*\" (frequently used by the award) exactly means in this context. As was already explained (paras. 56-61 above), financial instruments, because of the intrinsic characteristics that appear to be incompatible with the type of investment envisaged in article 25 of the ICSID Convention, suffered from a kind of informal presumption that they are disqualified *per se* (or as such) from constituting a covered investment under the ICSID Convention (para. 58 above). But once a BIT includes these financial instruments in its enumeration of investments covered by the treaty, this presumption is obviously rebutted. However, if these financial instruments are not excluded *per se* (or automatically) that does not mean that they are included *per se*, in the sense of being automatically considered as legally self-sufficient to constitute a protected investment. We have here to recall the distinction (dating back to Roman law) between the *instrumentum* and the *negotium*, the instrument that registers and vehicles a legal act or transaction and the legal transaction itself17. Article 1/1/c recognizes the financial securities *per se* as valid *instrumenta* for investment. But the investment itself, as a legal act or transaction that is attested and vehicled by these instruments, has to satisfy the substantive requirements for investment, in article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as in the BIT, if any.\n\nThis distinction between the *instrumentum* and the *negotium* was clearly on the mind of the drafters of Article 1/1 of the BIT. Thus, in their enumeration, where they considered that confusion between the two may arise, they expressly made the distinction e.g., under (a) \"...including, *to the extent they may be used as investments*, security interests on the property of third Party; under (d) \"credits *directly related to an investment*...\" (emphasis added).\n\n92.\n\nLeaving aside the requirements of article 25 of the Convention discussed above (para. 47-52), does the BIT impose any other substantive conditions ? And is linking the investment \"to a specific economic enterprise or operation taking place in the territory of the host State\" one of them?\n\n93.\n\nHere, the majority award interjects its second argument drawn from article 1/1/c, namely that, given the designation, in this provision, of financial instruments as covered investments, \"it would be contrary to the BIT\u2019s wording and aim to attach a further condition to the protection of financial investment instruments\" (para. 375).\n\n94.\n\nThis argument disregards a major fact. Of course, one cannot introduce a \"further condition\" into the Treaty. However, two such conditions are already writ large therein. It is true that they do not figure in Article 1/1/c itself. But all one has to do is to raise his sight a few lines above this provision to the chapeau of Article 1/1, which applies to all the types and vehicles of investment enumerated under it, including (c), and which defines investment *inter alia* as that made by nationals \"of one Contracting Party *in the territory of the other [Party]*, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter\" (emphasis added).\n\n95.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the emphasized words could not be clearer. And how can the fact that the investment has been made or realized in the territory of the host country be proved or demonstrated, except by tracing it to a specific project, enterprise or activity in that territory that corresponds to the economic meaning of investment in article 25 of the ICSID Convention (i.e. that it contributes to the expansion of the country\u2019s productive capacity)?\n\n96.\n\nb) Arguments drawn from the nature of the investment : Against this clear \"territorial imperative\" of the Convention and the BIT, the majority award develops a second line of argument or defense, consisting of four mutually supporting affirmations, namely :\n\ni - \"The determination of the place of investment depends.... on the nature of such investment\"; and for \"an investment of a purely financial nature, the relevant criteria cannot be the same as those applying to an investment consisting of business operations and/or involving manpower and property\";\n\nii - For \"investments of a purely financial nature the relevant criteria should be where and/or for the benefit of whom the funds are ultimately used, and not the place where the funds were paid out or transferred\";\n\niii - \"This is also the view taken by other arbitral tribunals\";\n\niv - \"Thus, the relevant question is where the invested funds ultimately made available to the Host State [*sic*], and did they support the latter\u2019s economic development\" (para. 374).\n\n97.\n\nNone of these affirmations withstands scrutiny.\n\ni - There is absolutely no basis in the ICSID Convention for drawing such a distinction between \"investments of a purely financial nature\" and other types of investment in this or other respects. Investment under ICSID is a unified category corresponding to the economic meaning of investment. The question that is raised about financial instruments under ICSID concern their high velocity of circulation which distends their link, as well as that of their last holders, with the ultimate economic enterprise or activity that materializes the investment in the economic, i.e. ICSID, sense of the term, within the territory of the host State. The question is not about the necessity of locating this enterprise or activity in the territory of the host State.\n\n98.\n\nIndeed, the most persuasive legal justification for admitting financial instruments as protected investments, in spite of their stark contrast to the ideal type of investment under ICSID, the direct foreign investment (see para 55 above), is that these investments finance, be it at several removes, specific economic projects, enterprises or activities which, had they been undertaken directly by these foreign financial investors, would have constituted foreign direct investment; which of course can only take place within the territory of the host State.\n\n99.\n\nii - The governing texts, particularly article 1/1 of the BIT, are clear as to the relevant criterion for locating the *situs* of the investment. It is \"where\" the investment is made or realized, and not \"for the benefit of whom\".\n\n100.\n\nIt is ironic that the majority award cites the *SGS v. Republic of the Philippines* decision in support of its position; an award enunciating that : \"In accordance with normal principles of treaty interpretation, investments made outside the territory of the Respondent State, however beneficial to it, would not be covered by the BIT\"18; a dictum repudiating in no uncertain terms the criterion of \"for the benefit of whom\" proffered by the majority award.\n\nSGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Republic of the Philippines, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 January 2004, para. 99; see also Canadian Cattleman for Fair Trade v. United States, NAFTA, Award on Jurisdiction, 28 January 2008, para. 127.\n\n101.\n\niii - Indeed, the cases cited by the majority award do not lend it as much support as it contends and are all quite distinguishable from the present case. The majority opinion cites three awards19. Only one of them involves financial instruments, namely *Fedax v. Venezuela.* And it is the only one of the three (as well, to my knowledge, of all other ICSID arbitral decisions) that carries a dictum suggesting the over-loose, ultimate beneficiary test which is followed by the majority award in the present case (but *Fedax* is distinguishable from the present case on facts as explained below).\n\nIn note 147 to paragraph 374. The three awards are : *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 11 July 1997, para. 41; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 6 August 2003, paras. 136-140; *SGS v. Republic of the Philippines,* para. 111.\n\n102.\n\nThe *Fedax* decision was widely criticized both by other tribunals and in the literature, including by Professor Dolzer, one of the leading legal experts of the Claimants in the present case, who commented in an article that \"the *Fedax* decision is not without ambiguity in its construction of \u2018investment\u2019\"; and in relation to the \"territorial dimension of foreign investments\", that :\n\n\"...the *Fedax* decision (paragraph 41)...assumed that the absence of a physical transfer of funds will not stand in the way of the existence of an \u2018investment\u2019. Without explaining the rationale for this view in any detail, the *Fedax* tribunal considered apparently that it is sufficient that the funds made available by the investor are utilized by the host country as the beneficiary of the transaction so as to finance its various governmental needs\"20.\n\nRudolf Dolzer, \"The Notion of Investment in Recent Practice\", *in* Charmovitz et al. (eds) *Law in the Service of Human Dignity : Essays in Honour of Florentino Feliciano* (CUP, 2005), p. 261 at pp. 269, 272.\n\n103.\n\nSimilarly, the *SGS v. The Republic of the Philippines*21 decision - that the majority award cites in support of its position! - apart from its flat repudiation of the *Fedax* test in the dictum reproduced above (para. 100), spared no effort to distance itself from that case, not only by distinguishing it, but also by pointing to certain factors that severely limit its general relevance (if any). Thus, after noting that \"[t]he Tribunal in the *Fedax* case gave a very broad definition of territoriality\", it observes in a footnote to that sentence that :\n\n\"The territorial requirement in the BIT [Venezuela-Netherlands] was...less categorical. It referred to the protection in its territory of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party...and this only in a clause dealing with entry, not in a general clause defining the scope of the Treaty as a whole\".\n\nCited in note 18 above.\n\n104.\n\nJust after the general remark about the \"very broad definition of territoriality\",the Tribunal proceeds to distinguish *Fedax* :\n\n\"...but the focus of the decision was whether the endorsee of a promissory note issued with respect to an investment had itself made an investment, and whether the dispute over non-payment of the note arise \u2018directly\u2019 out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\"22.\n\nIbid. at para. 110 and footnote 41 in that decision. The Tribunal hints that it would have gone further in the critical analysis (or rather criticism) of Fedax, were it not that \"Counsel for the Respondent declined to argue that Fedax was in this respect wrongly decided, but at any rate the circumstances of the Fedax case were very different from the present\" (Ibid.).\n\n105.\n\nFedax is an isolated case. It is an outlier. But I need not expand further on whether it was correctly decided or not, as it is clearly distinguishable in this respect (of territorial link) from the present case on facts; primarily by two significant facts. The promissory notes at issue in Fedax were governed by the host State\u2019s law. They were not free-standing or unhinged from any specific project or economic activity in the host country, as they were initially given in exchange for the provision of specific services in Venezuela. The issue in that case was whether an endorsement of six promissory notes outside Venezuela severed their link with the underlying transaction, and not about the necessity of the existence of such underlying transaction23.\n\nSee Waibel, *Sovereign Defaults*, supra note 16, p. 225.\n\n106.\n\nThe other two cases cited by the majority award, *SGS v. Pakistan* and *SGS v. the Republic of the Philippines*, have nothing to support the majority award\u2019s position, either in their reasoning and dicta or in their facts. Indeed, one can say the opposite as far as *SGS v. the Republic of the Philippines,* given its critical and distant position *vis \u00e0 vis Fedax*, as exposed above. In both *SGS* cases the issue was whether services provided by SGS and attendant expenses largely undertaken outside the territory of the host State, could be considered as an investment \"in the territory\" of the host State. And in both cases the Tribunals found that a reasonable part of the service and the expenses, though perhaps not the major part, took place in the territory of the host State; and that the service was not constituted of two operations : one outside and the other inside the territory of the host State, but one overall service straddling the frontier of that State, and as such well anchored in its territory.\n\n107.\n\nIn none of these cases, including *Fedax*, or others in which the question of territoriality was raised, was the need to trace the alleged investment to an underlying specific project or activity within the territory of the host State, questioned. The issue in all these cases was whether what takes place outside the territory of the host State, such as the payment of funds or the endorsement of the promissory notes, distends this link to the point of legally severing it.\n\n108.\n\nThe situation in the present case is totally different. The security entitlements in question are free-standing, and totally unhinged. They do not form part of an economic project, operation or activity in Argentina. Nor are they issued in support of a public project or a commercial undertaking there. In other words, they have no specific economic anchorage in Argentina, allowing them to be seen and considered as an investment \"in the territory of Argentina\".\n\n109.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion of this rapid survey of cases invoked by the majority award in support of its position, is that, unlike these cases, there is a missing link in the present case that prevents the alleged investment from being recognized as covered or protected investment under the BIT and article 25 of the Convention, namely the traceability of the alleged investment (or its link, be it tenuous) to an underlying specific economic project or operation taking place in the territory of Argentina.\n\n110.\n\niv - In order to surmount this tough obstacle, the majority award resorts to an astounding exercise of logical gymnastics, operating a double logical somersault that ends up standing the sequence of legal reasoning on its head, by way of two unverifiable (and for one totally untenable) assumptions,\n\n111.\n\na) As concerns the first of these assumptions, the majority award asserts that : \"*There is no doubt that the funds* generated through the bonds issuance process were *ultimately made available to Argentina* [and here comes the first logical jump dissimulated by the first assumption] and *served to finance Argentina\u2019s economic development*\" (para. 378, emphasis added). Thus, according to the majority award, any loan or funds made available to a government (and regardless of the way it uses them, which is \"irrelevant\") must be deemed, by virtue of an unrebuttable presumption, to be contributing to the development of the country of that government, and thus corresponding to the economic concept of investment of article 25 of the ICSID Convention (i.e. contributing to the expansion of the productive capacities of the country).\n\n112.\n\nBut this presumption is rebuttable on two grounds. First, not every loan can constitute an investment in the sense of the Convention. A simple loan in itself is merely an \"ordinary commercial transaction\". For it to become an investment, it has to fulfil the conditions discussed above. This is why, for example, in the enumeration of the various types of protected investment in article 1/1 of the BIT, under (d), \"credits\", which are a species of loans, are qualified by the clause \"which are directly linked to an investment\".\n\n113.\n\nThe other ground on which this first presumption is rebuttable is the mere fact that not all funds made available to governments are necessarily used as \"investment\" in projects or activities contributing to the expansion of the productive capacities of the country. Such funds can be used to finance wars, even wars of aggression, or oppressive measures against restive populations, or even be diverted through corruption to private ends. This is why, for such loans to constitute investments under the ICSID Convention, they have to be concretely traced, even at several removes, to a particular productive project or activity in the territory of the host country; and not merely by postulating a stop-gap abstract assumption that does not hold its ground.\n\n114.\n\nb) The second assumption is even more remarkable than the first, and totally dependent on it. In fact, it is undetachable from it; thus one has to formulate them together, in something like the following : Because the funds were made available to Argentina and used by it (whatever the use which is \"irrelevant\" and which is not traceable or proven, but assumed), these funds \"as such, must be considered to have contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development [first assumption] *and thus* [and here comes the second assumption dissimulating the second logical jump] to have been made in Argentina\" (para. 378, emphasis added). Put in straight forward language, without the ellipsis, the proposition would be : As the funds made available to Argentina *must be considered* (i.e. assumed) to have contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development, they also, and as a necessary consequence, *must be considered* (or assumed) to have been made in Argentina.\n\n115.\n\nThus, by assuming a contribution to the economic development of Argentina, one necessarily assumes also its location in Argentina, without having to demonstrate or prove either. The falsity of such reasoning is too evident to need further elaboration.\n\n116.\n\nMoreover, the presumed logical necessity of drawing or deducing the second presumption from the first is also false. It suffices to recall in this regard the dictum of *SGS v. the Republic of the Philippines* that \"investment made outside the territory of the Respondent State, however beneficial to it, would not be covered by the BIT\", and the example it gives of \"the construction of an embassy in a third State or the provision of security services to such an embassy\" which \"would not involve investments in the territory of the State whose embassy it was, and would not be protected by the BIT\"24.\n\nCase cited in note 16 above, at para. 99.\n\n117.\n\nHere again, the logical legal sequence is stood on its head. Rather than demonstrating the contribution by tracing the alleged investment to (or proving its link with) a productive project or activity in the territory of the host State, the majority award deduces a *situs* from a presumed contribution hanging in the air.\n\n118.\n\n*In conclusion* *,* the present case is, to my knowledge, the first one to come before an ICSID tribunal in which the alleged investment is totally free-standing and unhinged, without any anchorage, however remote, into an underlying economic project, enterprise or activity in the territory of the host State. None of the logical short-cuts put forward by the majority award to palliate this absence, holds water.\n\n119.\n\nAs both the ICSID Convention and the BIT require that the investment be made in the territory of the host State for the investment to be covered by the treaty and fall within the jurisdictional ambit of ICSID, and as this territorial link is lacking in the present case, I conclude that in the absence of a \"protected investment\", the case has to be dismissed, as falling outside the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal.\n\nIV - The First Preliminary Objection : Collective Mass Claims Actions and the Consent of the Respondent\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThis preliminary objection is based on the contention of the Respondent that its consent to arbitrate by acceding to the ICSID Convention and concluding the BIT does not cover collective mass claims actions, including the present one; that handling mass claims in a single arbitral case or proceeding, or as one arbitral suit or action, necessarily undermines the due process rights of the Respondent and would be unmanageable; and that, in any case, the Tribunal is not empowered, under the Convention and the Rules of Procedure, to effect the procedural changes enabling it to handle such an action.\n\n121.\n\nThe preliminary objection raises three issues :\n\n1. - Does the consent of Argentina cover collective mass claims actions ? and is this a question of jurisdiction or of admissibility as contended by the majority award ?\n\n2. - What is the legal nature of collective mass claims actions or suits, and what are the problems and questions they raise, particularly as to the due process rights of the parties and to the interpretation of the scope of arbitral clauses - i.e. the jurisdictional title - both in municipal and in international law.\n\n3. - Finally, does the Tribunal have the power to effect the procedural changes, or \"adaptations\" as it calls them, that it needs to be able to handle the case (para. 491).\n\nA - A Plea to Jurisdiction or to Admissibility ?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe majority award adopts, \"for distinguishing issues of jurisdiction from issues of admissibility\", the following criterion :\n\n\"If there was only one Claimant, what would be the requirements for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction over its claim ? If the issue raised relates to another aspect of the proceedings, which would not apply if there was just one Claimant, then it must be considered a matter of admissibility and not of jurisdiction\" (para. 249).\n\n123.\n\nApplying this criterion to the present case, the majority award \"answers in the negative\" the question \"whether a specific consent regarding the specific conditions in which the present arbitration would be conducted is required\", on the basis of the following argument :\n\n\"Assuming the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims of several individual claimants...it is difficult to conceive why and how the Tribunal could \u2018loose\u2019 jurisdiction where the number of claimants outgrows a certain threshold...what is the relevant threshold? And can the Tribunal really \u2018loose\u2019 jurisdiction it has when looking at Claimants individually ?\" (paras. 484-490).\n\n124.\n\nOn that basis, the majority award dismisses Argentina\u2019s objection :\n\n\"Issue 1(a) : Argentina\u2019s consent to jurisdiction of the Centre includes claims presented by multiple Claimants in a single proceeding\" (para. 502).\n\n125.\n\nThe majority award considers that :\n\n\"...the relevant question is not \u2018has Argentina consented to the mass proceedings\u2019, but rather \u2018can ICSID arbitration be conducted in the form of \u2018mass proceedings\u2019 considering that this would require an *adaptation and/or modification* by the Tribunal of certain procedural rules provided for under the current ICSID framework\"? (para.491); \"which is a question of admissibility\" (para. 492).\n\n126.\n\nThis legal recharacterization of Argentina\u2019s plea by the majority award is, in my view, conceptually wrong. It adopts an extremely narrow, in fact partial, concept of jurisdiction, limiting it to the ambit within which jurisdiction is exercised. But, as explained above (para. 10 ff), jurisdiction is first and foremost a power, the legal power to exercise the judicial or arbitral function. Any limits to this power, whether inherent or consensual, i.e. stipulated in the jurisdictional title (consent within certain limits, or subject to reservations or conditions relating to the powers of the organ) are jurisdictional by essence. They are no less jurisdictional, in fact more so, than the limits relating to one of the four dimensions of the ambit within which jurisdiction is exercised (para. 13 above).\n\n127.\n\nThe preliminary objection of Argentina draws precisely upon this category of limits to jurisdiction as a power, maintaining that Argentina\u2019s consent cannot be interpreted to cover the power of the Tribunal to hear collective mass claims actions requiring resort to atypical or abnormal procedures. If that is the purport of the preliminary objection, then finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the subject-matter of one claim or even the 60,000 claims (a finding that I already refuted, for absence of a protected investment in the previous section), neither disposes of this preliminary objection, nor does it address it in anyway.\n\nB - The Legal Nature and Specificities of Collective Mass Claims Actions and their Bearing on the \"Consent to Arbitrate\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nTo address this preliminary objection, one has first to examine the legal nature and specific characteristics of mass claims actions, and the abnormal or atypical procedures their handling requires, to be able to evaluate whether a mere consent to submit to arbitration can be construed as extending to include them or not.\n\n129.\n\nIn their pleadings, particularly during the oral phase, the Parties and their legal experts paid special attention to the legal characterization of the present proceedings. The Respondent considered it not a simple multi-party action, but a collective mass claims action; one of the leading experts in the field called by the Respondent, Professor Richard Nagareda, classified it as a class action. Counsel to the Claimants, by contrast, argued that it is a mere multi-party action; as there is no limit to the number of parties in such an action and no known threshold that separates a multi-party from a collective mass claims action. Later on, Counsel to the Claimants spoke of a non-class aggregate proceeding.\n\n130.\n\nThe majority award tries to skirt round the subject (in order not to tie its hands) by using the neutral expression \" \u2018mass proceedings\u2019...as referring simply to the high number of Claimants appearing together as one mass, and without any prejudgement on the procedural classification of the present proceedings as a specific kind of \u2018collective proceedings\u2019 recognized under any specific legal order\" (para. 480). But it does not quite succeed in keeping this neutral stance; for after summarizing part of a recent article surveying different types of collective proceedings25, it ends up classifying the present proceedings as a hybrid, partaking of two species. But this exercise in legal genetic engineering, like all genetic engineering, risks producing a monster. In any case, it does not work here for reasons expounded below.\n\nStacy I. Strong, \"From Class to Collective : The De-Americanization of Class Arbitration\". *Arbitration International*, vol. 26, No 4(2010), pp. 493-548. Footnote 176 of the Award, wrongly cites the author\u2019s name as Stark, and not Strong.\n\n131.\n\nThe survey of different types of collective proceedings, based on Strong\u2019s article, classifies them in two categories :\n\ni - *Aggregate procedures* : I use advisedly \"procedures\" rather than \"proceedings\", because the aggregation takes place before the \"proceedings\" properly speaking, i.e. the adjudicative or judicial phase of examining the claims. It consists of aggregating or centralizing the different individual claims arising \"out of the same fact pattern\", as in the present case, in different ways. In England, the Group Litigation Order establishes a judicial registry of these claims, which are then assigned to the same judge for management purposes. In the US, such related claims are \"consolidated in a single federal venue to ensure efficiencies of scale during the pre-trial period\", beyond which \"the cases are separated and heard individually regarding issues of liability and/or damages\"26.\n\nStrong, *ibid.* p. 504.\n\n132.\n\nBoth methods are legal techniques for rationalizing the distribution of individual claims arising from the same events, upstream, at the pre-trial or pre-judicial stage. But once the individual claims are before the tribunals for judgment, they are handled as such i.e. as individual claims, according to the normal procedures, though the tribunals can use procedural devices normally available to them, such as joinder and consolidation, for purposes of procedural economy. But there is no change or alteration of the procedure followed to handle these claims other than as normal individual claims. And it is on this last point that the \"aggregate procedures\" model does not suit the purposes of the majority award.\n\n133.\n\nii - *Representative proceedings* : This is the most important type of collective proceedings, its prime example being \"class actions\" that emerged relatively recently in the US and elsewhere. The other species of representative proceedings are in fact minor variations on the theme of class actions.\n\n134.\n\nClass actions or representative proceedings can be brought either by a member of the class, acting as a kind of *negotiorum gestor* on behalf of the other members of the class (who can join in or take their distance from the action through the techniques of \"opting in\" or \"opting out\") or by an agent representing the whole class, such as a consumers association or the Sierra Club.\n\n135.\n\nWhat makes class actions or representative proceedings (unlike aggregate claims subject to aggregate procedures only at the pre-trial or pre-judicial stage), feasible or amenable to be treated judicially or adjudicatively in one single proceedings or as one action, is that in a class actions or representative proceedings there is, in the final analysis, only one claim, albeit with many, or even a mass of claimants. The tribunal deals thus with one claim and can examine every aspect of it specifically, through adversarial debate and scrutiny that guarantees to the parties, particularly the respondent, all their due process rights.\n\n136.\n\nThe first attempts to introduce class actions, which are the prime model of representative proceedings, were related to issues of public interest such as the protection of the environment or the consumers. In this, they recall (at least in their rationale, without necessarily assimilating them to) an ancient ancestor, the institution of *actio popularis*, whereby a citizen, in the name of the community, acts in defense of an indivisible public good. And the remedies sought in class actions were geared to the nature of these types of public interest claims, namely declaratory judgments and injunctive relief, i.e. orders to cease and desist, that are the same for all claimants and which are formulated as a function of the subject-matter of the claim, and not as a function of the personality, or the number of the claimants, or their individual subjective grievances.\n\n137.\n\nIt is true, as is stated in the majority award, that in some jurisdictions, the relief \"can take the form of individual damages or representative relief (e.g. declaratory or injunctive relief)\" (para. 483). But the majority award omits to reproduce from Strong\u2019s article it excerpts the following comment on the cumulation of the two types of relief :\n\n\"One approach allows class claimants to pursue individual damages as well as other types of relief. This technique, which is common in the US, has met with a great deal of criticism internally, since the provision of individual damages in a representative suit is seen in many (but not all) civil law systems as violating the defendant\u2019s right to defend against individualized, as opposed to generalized claims, as well as the rights of individualized members of the collective to conduct their own individualized cases\"27.\n\nStrong, *ibid*, at p. 504.\n\n138.\n\nAfter this brief survey of the two main types of \"collective proceedings\", the majority award proposes a legal characterization of the present case as \"a sort of hybrid kind of collective proceedings, in the sense that it starts as aggregate proceedings, but then continues with features similar to representative proceedings due to the high number of claimants involved\" (para. 488).\n\n139.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, this exercise of legal genetic engineering does not work. First of all, there is no explanation whatever of the reason or cause nor of the trigger of such a transmutation of the proceedings, starting as one thing that no sooner transforms itself into quite another. It is understandable that the case starts as aggregate proceedings, in the sense explained above and in the majority award, considering that it groups a multitude of individual claims arising out of the same fact pattern. But these remain individualized claims. Following the aggregate procedures model simply means that they would be collected and managed during the pre-trial or strictly pre-judicial or pre-arbitral phase, in order to rationalize their funneling to other tribunals that will examine them judicially as individual claims. But they would not change nature or characteristics as a result of their prior aggregation. They remain individualized claims.\n\n140.\n\nFor the proceedings to change suddenly into a representative one, the individual claims have to be cast into one claim or transformed into identical fungible claims, which comes down to the same thing (one claim, multiplied by the number of claimants) to enable the tribunal to treat them judicially as one. But this is not possible here, as the claims retain their individualized character.\n\n141.\n\nTo skirt round this fundamental problem, the majority award resorts to the slippage technique, considering that \"group examination of claims is acceptable where claims raised by a multitude of claimants are to be considered identical or *at least sufficiently* homogeneous\" (para 540; emphasis added).\n\n142.\n\nHowever, homogeneity is in the eyes of the beholder. One can always reach a sufficient level of homogeneity, i.e. common denominators, by climbing up the ladder of abstraction and/or by weeding out all the specificities of the claims that appear inconvenient. And that is precisely what the majority award does with the claims under consideration.\n\n143.\n\nIndeed, the majority award sets aside all the specificities of the claims concerning the security entitlements (price, date of purchase, place of purchase, in which currency, applicable law, chosen forum, etc.) as characteristics relevant only to the contractual rights of their holders, i.e. to contract claims; while what counts here, according to the majority award, are the treaty claims, which are homogeneous (paras. 541-543). And the majority award harps on the adjective \"homogeneous\", by repeating it throughout this part in almost every line. But no amount or repetition can exorcize the fundamental flaws in this line of argument. Indeed, it suffices to ask, how can the Tribunal for example evaluate a treaty claim for compensating damages caused to an asset, without knowing (or while making abstraction of) the time the asset was acquired, the price paid for it and the currency of denomination ?\n\n144.\n\nIf one examines what the majority award calls \"the claims deriving from the BIT\" (para. 543), which it considers \"homogeneous\", the result is clear. They are claims related to the Argentinean economic crisis that led to Argentina\u2019s cessation of payment. In other words, this crisis constitutes \"the same fact pattern\" out of which the claims arose, and which is the criterion used for resorting to \"aggregate proceedings\", according to the majority award. But as the award itself states, this aggregation takes place only at the pre-trial, or pre-judicial phase. By contrast, during the judicial phase, the claims are treated individually. In other words, the \"level of homogeneity\" resulting from the circumstance that the claims arose \"out of the same fact pattern\", is sufficient for aggregating and registering them for purposes of pre-trial management and rationalizing their funneling towards the tribunals that will ultimately examine them as individual claims; but not sufficient for what the majority award calls \"group examination\", i.e. their examination as if they are one claim (as in a class action or a representative proceedings), which they are not, either in fact or in law.\n\n145.\n\nThe efforts of the majority award at legal genetic engineering lead nowhere. The hybrid proceedings, brain-child of the majority award\u2019s legal imagination, lacks a theoretical basis to stand on, let alone a solid legal basis. It also raises the question of the extent to which such an imaginary \"hybrid action\" and, for that matter, the particularities of collective proceedings in general, have a bearing on the interpretation of the \"consent to arbitrate\".\n\nC - Judicial Innovation, Collective Proceedings and \"Consent to Arbitrate\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn their pleadings, counsel and legal experts for the Claimants argued - to incite this Tribunal to do the same - that in the US, courts foreshadowed class actions and devised their procedures, before they were formally adopted by legislation and integrated in the codes of civil procedure.\n\n147.\n\nRegardless of the veracity of this narrative and assuming it is true, it does not help much supporting the conclusion sought to be drawn from it, i.e. that the same can be done by this *ad hoc* international arbitral Tribunal. This is because courts in general are part of the judiciary, the judicial branch or arm of the State. Their judicial power, i.e. jurisdiction, thus stems from above, and not from the consent of the parties or litigants before them. As repositories of the judicial power of the State, they have some leeway, particularly in common law jurisdictions, to develop the law and engage, within reasonable limits, in legal experimentation; unlike arbitral tribunals that draw their jurisdiction from the consent of the parties and have to confine their judicial activities within the bounds of this consent.\n\n148.\n\nEven in the U.S, the national jurisdiction where it is contended that the courts foreshadowed class action and devised procedures for them before they were enshrined in legislation, the US Supreme Court, in two successive decisions in 2010 and 2011, has been quite strict in interpreting consent and underscoring the need to respect its bounds, when it came to arbitration, in response to exactly the same question that is put to this Tribunal, i.e. \"Does a regular arbitration clause cover class actions ?\"\n\n149.\n\nI realize that the majority award, following in this the Claimants, refuse to consider the present collective mass claims action as a class action, although its \"hybrid model\" ends up being a \"representative proceeding\", which is more or less the same thing. But the US Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning and answer turns on the \"mass\" character of the action rather than on its characterization as a class action or otherwise.\n\n150.\n\nIn the first of these cases, *Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. Animal Feeds International Corp*28, the Court held :\n\n\"An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration... is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. This is so because class action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator\".29\n\n130 S.Ct.1758 (2010).\n\nIbid. at 1774.\n\n151.\n\nThe Court also noted that the \"changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration [are] fundamental\"; and concluded that consent to class-action arbitration cannot be \"presumed\" from the parties \"mere silence\", given the fundamental differences between class-action arbitration and bilateral arbitration30.\n\nSlip Opinion, at 22-23.\n\n152.\n\nIn the second case *ATandT Mobility LLC v. Concepcion ET UX* (2011)31, the Court, while referring to *Stolt-Nielsen*, and building on it, goes even further, in highlighting the difference between the two types of arbitration :\n\n\"Class arbitration...interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration...class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants. The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected. That risk of error may become unacceptable when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are aggregated and decided at once. Arbitration is poorly suited to these higher stakes\"32.\n\n563 US (2011), (decision of 27 April 2011).\n\nSlip Opinion, at 2.\n\n153.\n\nThe powerful reasoning of these two judgments and the strong arguments they put forward - the fundamental differences between the two modes of arbitration, the regular bilateral one and the class action or representative proceedings arbitration; differences that \"change the nature of arbitration\"; and the great risks to which the later mode exposes defendants - all converge to highlight the necessity of a special consent of the parties in order to resort to class action or representative proceedings arbitration; consent that cannot be merely deduced or assumed from a simple consent to go to arbitration.\n\nD - The Interpretation of Silence\n---------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe majority award totally ignores this widely known and commented upon jurisprudence and arguments. Instead, it goes into a cursory \"interpretation of the silence of the ICSID Framework\".\n\n155.\n\nThe reasoning of the majority award can be summarized as follows : given the \"object\" of the BIT and the \"spirit\" of the ICSID Convention, which are presumably, according to the majority award, reduced solely to affording \"effective protection\" to investments and investors, \"where the BIT covers investments which are susceptible to involve a high number of investors...it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and the spirit of ICSID to require in addition to the consent to ICSID arbitration in general a supplementary express consent to the form of such arbitration\" (para. 518); i.e. \"it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and to the spirit of ICSID to interpret this silence as a \u2018qualified silence\u2019 categorically prohibiting collective proceedings, just because it was not mentioned in the ICSID Convention\" (para. 519). And if consent to ICSID arbitration covers collective proceedings, it has also - presumably by necessity or necessary implication - to cover the power of the Tribunal to devise the adequate procedures to deal with them, in derogation of \"the standard procedure\" (para. 519).\n\n156.\n\nThis wobbly line of argument by affirmation, assumption and reasoning by necessity, does not withstand scrutiny. In the first place, it is premissed on the assumption that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the subject-matter of the mass claims; an assumption that I have refuted in the previous section.\n\n157.\n\nSecondly, the reasoning is also premissed on and proceeds from a purely subjective, truncated and partial representation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, which is a recurrent theme throughout the award. The reader cannot but be struck by the repetition *expressis verbis* in two successive paragraphs (para. 518 and 519), at a few lines interval, of the reference to the \"spirit\" of the ICSID Convention and the \"purpose\" of the BIT. Spiritism apart, the object and purpose of these two treaties - the ICSID Convention and the BIT - are described as being exclusively to afford maximum protection to foreign investment and foreign investors; as if these treaties were \"unilateral contracts\" creating rights for the benefit of one party only. In consequence, according to this vision, all the provisions of these treaties have to be interpreted exclusively with this aim in mind.\n\n158.\n\nViewed from this perspective, all the limitations to the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals, whether inherent or patiently and carefully negotiated and stipulated in the treaty to protect the interests of the State party (which are after all, the collective interests of its population) are seen as obstacles in the way of achieving the \"purpose\" of the treaties, which have to be overcome at any price and by whatever argument.\n\n159.\n\nThis unilateral vision is in stark contrast to the \"object and purpose\" of the ICSID Convention, as expressed in the Report of the Executive Directors in the following terms : \"While the broad objective of the Convention is to encourage a larger flow of private international investment, the provisions of the Convention maintain a careful balance between the interests of investors and those of host States\".33\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, para. 13.\n\n160.\n\nProceeding from these premisses, the majority award simply affirms that \"it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and to the spirit ICSID to interpret this silence [of the ICSID Convention or Framework as it calls it] as a \u2018qualified silence\u2019 categorically prohibiting collective proceedings, just because it was not mentioned in the ICSID Convention\" (para. 519).\n\n161.\n\nThe majority award does not explain at any length what it exactly means here by \"qualified silence\", nor why it considers that this concept does not apply in the present case or the consequences of its application or non application. This results in confusion at two levels, the first of which relates to the meaning and relevance of the term *in casu*. \"Qualified silence\" is not a term of art; for example, it does not appear in law dictionaries. Occasionally, however, one encounters, in writings on American constitutional law, such expressions as \"the qualified silence of the law-maker\" (or \"the intentional imperfection of the law\"). They describe, in a piece of legislation dealing with a particular subject, its silence over certain substantive issues falling within the subject treated, that were left intentionally open (for future legislative treatment, for lack of consensus, etc.). In consequence, analogy cannot be used to extend the legal regulation to these issues by those who subsequently interpret and apply the law, as this would go against the intent of the law-maker. But this is a completely different context, poles apart from that of establishing the existence and scope of the individual consent of a State to submit to arbitration, which is what is at issue here.\n\n162.\n\nThis brings me to the second level of confusion in the majority award. Indeed, the award, in its analysis, confuses here two layers of consent (see above para.15) :\n\na) the consent or acceptance to be bound by the ICSID Convention as such, by ratifying or acceding to it, which by itself does not contain any consent or obligation to arbitrate; and\n\nb) the specific acceptance by a State to submit a dispute or certain disputes to arbitration within ICSID, whether by way of a BIT or otherwise (a compromissory clause, etc.), which constitutes the specific jurisdictional title.\n\nThe two do not coincide in time nor necessarily in their scope (para. 13 above).\n\n163.\n\nArgentina\u2019s jurisdictional plea is directed more specifically to the second layer of consent, though it covers both layers; whilst the majority award addresses only the first layer, ignoring almost totally the second layer of consent, which is the crux of Argentina\u2019s plea.\n\n164.\n\nIf what is at issue here is Argentina\u2019s specific consent to arbitrate, then what counts most in the interpretation of the jurisdictional title is the establishment of the validity and scope of that consent at the time it was given. It is thus paradoxical, that in order to support its affirmation that the ICSID Convention\u2019s silence over \"collective proceedings\", is not a \"\u2018qualified silence\u2019 categorically prohibiting [such] proceedings\", the majority award advances the argument that \"at the time of conclusion of the ICSID Convention, collective proceedings were quasi inexistent, and although some discussions seem to have taken place with regard to multi-party arbitrations, these discussions were not conclusive on the intention to either accept or refuse multi-party arbitrations, and even less so with regard to admissibility of collective proceedings\" (para. 519).\n\n165.\n\nIt is paradoxical because this argument supports exactly the opposite proposition to that which the award is attempting to prove. The fact that class actions or representative proceedings were almost unknown in national jurisdictions, and more so on the international level, at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention in the mid-sixties of the last century, proves that these representative proceedings were way beyond the \"horizon of foreseeability\" of the drafters of the ICSID Convention. Those drafters could not have envisaged such proceedings; nor is there any basis to assume that they would have included them, had they envisaged them, given the fundamental differences between these proceedings and the arbitration model familiar to them (as discussed below). Those drafters were simply creating a framework for *ad hoc* international arbitration, within the parameters of *ad hoc* international arbitration as they knew them at that time, particularly its specific consensual basis for every case, as with all international adjudication. They were not establishing an open-ended standing court of general jurisdiction (*juridiction de droit commun*) covering all possible present and future disputes. This is clearly reflected in the last paragraph of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention :\n\n\"Declaring that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration\"\n\n166.\n\nThus, the above argument of the majority award based on the unforeseeability of collective actions at the time of drafting the Convention, paradoxically bears in favour of interpreting the silence of the ICSID Convention as not extending to cover such an extra-ordinary type of judicial activity as representative proceedings or class actions. However, even if we assume *arguendo* that the ICSID Convention can be over-stretched by subsequent interpretation, pushing back its outer-limits to accommodate collective proceedings, this would not apply to the second layer of consent, the specific consent to arbitrate within the ICSID framework.\n\n167.\n\nHere, the interpretation of the jurisdictional title has to establish the reality, validity and scope of consent, as it was given, at the time it was given, by each party. And it is here that the \"interpretation of silence\" of the jurisdictional title becomes crucial : Does the mere \"consent to arbitrate\" within the ICSID framework cover mass claims actions and proceedings (whatever we call them) ?\n\n168.\n\nAs a rule, silence does not have a meaning in itself. It cannot be made to speak one way or another; unless it is surrounded by circumstances that impregnate it with a certain meaning; what is called in civil law and in French \"*silence circonstanci\u00e9*\", a more expressive term than \"qualified silence\" which is also used, on rare occasions, in international law in the same sense34.\n\nSee for example the WTO Panel Report *Guatemala - Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Grey Portland Cement from Mexico,* Report of the Panel of 24 October 2000, at para. 8.23 : \"We note that \u2018acquiescence\u2019 amounts to \u2018qualified silence\u2019, whereby silence in the face of events that call for a reaction of some sort may be interpreted as a presumed consent\". See also, in the same sense, Mark Villiger, *Customary International Law and Treaties* (The Hague, Kluwer, 1977), p. 39.\n\n169.\n\nThe circumstances that surround and impart meaning to silence, can be factual or legal. Both these types of circumstances exist and can easily be identified *in casu*.\n\n170.\n\nThe elements of fact or factual circumstances that qualify the silence of a jurisdictional title by which a State consents to ICSID arbitration, in the sense of limiting it to normal bi- lateral (or limited multiparty) arbitration, thus excluding collective mass claims actions or representative proceedings, are simply the great differences between these two types of proceedings.\n\n171.\n\nThe sheer difference in volume and number of claims and claimants between the bilateral or even the limited multiparty arbitration (14 Claimants in the largest case in ICSID)35, which permits an individual, detailed and adversarial examination of every claim and claimant, and the 60,000 claimants in the instant case, is staggering. It constitutes what is called in physics a \"quantum leap\" (*saut qualitatif*) which transforms quantitative change beyond a certain point into qualitative change36. The change here is from the micro-analysis and treatment of individual phenomena (i.e. claims and claimants) individually, into the macro-analysis and treatment of large masses of individual phenomena as an impersonal whole, that cannot take into consideration the individuality of the components.\n\nBernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe. ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award of 22 April 2009.\n\nThe argument raised at one point by the Claimants, but not taken up by the majority award (though occasionally it seems to imply it), that collective mass claims actions are mere multi-party actions as there is no recognized threshold that separates them, is extremely tenuous, verging on the absurd. International law knows several such situations. For example, up to now there is no agreed or generally recognized threshold that separates air space, which is part of the territory of the State, from outer-space which is a *res communis*. Similarly, until the Montego Bay UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, there was no general agreement on the width of the territorial sea, i.e. on the threshold that separates that sea, which is part of the territory of the State, from the high seas. But here again, the absence of an agreed threshold did not mean that these two areas did not have, or prevented them from having two radically different legal status. In any case, whatever the threshold that separates, or the criterion for distinguishing, multi-party actions from collective mass claims actions, it is obvious that 60,000 claims fall on the side of collective mass claims actions.\n\n172.\n\nIt is precisely this fundamental difference that the US Supreme Court highlighted in the *Stolt Nielsen* judgement when it found that representative proceedings or \"class action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator\"37.\n\nSupra note 29, and accompanying quotation.\n\n173.\n\nThe other type of circumstances that can surround silence and impart it with meaning and significance, are of a legal nature, pertaining to the legal context of the interpreted instrument, such as the concepts of \"course of performance\", \"course of dealing\" and \"trade usages\", in interpreting contracts, or other legal concepts and principles that form part of the legal environment of the interpreted instrument. One such legal concept or rule which is well known in the arbitration environment but over which the majority award passes in silence, is described in a very recent article by the same author quoted by the majority award, S.I. Strong38, as follows :\n\n\"[T]he first question raised in every arbitration is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this particular dispute. This issue... can be termed \u2018primary consent\u2019... Instead, class arbitration focuses for the most part on what can be called \u2018secondary consent\u2019, meaning consent to this particular type of procedure\". She adds : \"*This concept is by no means unique to class disputes, since traditional multiparty* *arbitrations are also required to establish secondary consent in cases where the arbitration agreements are silent or ambiguous as to multiparty treatment*\"39.\n\nS.I. Strong, \"Does Class Arbitration \u2018Change the Nature\u2019 of Arbitration ? *Stolt Nielsen, ATandT* and Return to First Principles\", 17 *Harvard Negotiation Law Review* , (forthcoming 2012), available electronically at http://ssm/abstract=179128.\n\nIbid, pp. 55-56, emphasis added, footnotes omitted. In footnote 255, Strong cites Lew et al, Comparative International Commercial Arbitration (2003), on the need to establish secondary consent in both class and traditional multiparty arbitration; and in note 256 she cites numerous cases on the requirement of secondary consent in multiparty arbitrations.\n\n174.\n\nAccording to this concept or rule, the need to establish secondary consent applies to both multi-party arbitration and *a fortiori* to collective mass claims actions or representative proceedings.\n\n175.\n\nThis applies also in the ICSID context. That we have no precedents or writings about the subject is simply because the issue did not arise until now before an ICSID tribunal as concerns collective mass claims actions. Concerning multi-party arbitrations, as the majority award states, the issue was raised during the drafting of the ICSID Convention, but the question was left open. It was debated during the latest revision of the Rules, but again was not expressly addressed in the revised Rules of 2006. But the absence of written regulation does not mean absence of rules. Indeed, the few cases of multi-party arbitrations that took place within the ICSID framework (and also NAFTA), were always either with the clear agreement of the parties or with no objection from the Respondent, which amounts to an implied consent. Thus, the rule of \"secondary consent\" was consistently upheld in multi- party arbitration40. And if this is the case in multi-party arbitrations, *a fortiori* it has also to be the case for collective mass claims actions.\n\nSchreuer, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary* (2d edition, 2009), p. 163, para. 279, cites the *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon* case, where Cameroon initially raised the objection that the use of the word \"national\" in singular in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention barred an arbitration with multiple parties on the Claimants side, but subsequently dropped the objection.\n\nE - Mass Claims Processes in International Law\n----------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nMost of the analysis up to now has been of the \"consent to arbitrate\" and its limits in national legal systems, including international commercial arbitration which is, in the final analysis, subject to national law and national judicial control. But of course ICSID arbitration is situated on the international level, i.e. in international law, which is, as described above (paras. 8,16) much more strict and exacting as regards the requirement of consent and its ascertainment as basis of jurisdiction.\n\n177.\n\nThe foregoing analysis thus applies *a fortiori* and with greater legal force when it comes to *ad hoc* international arbitral tribunals, such as the ICSID tribunals, and the interpretation of the \"consent to arbitrate\" before them. The analysis leads inexorably to the conclusion that a mere \"consent to arbitrate\" does not cover the fundamentally different and atypical proceedings of collective mass claims actions, such as the present one (whether we qualify them as collective, class, representative, aggregate or otherwise), and that a \"secondary consent\" is required for such proceedings to be covered.\n\n178.\n\nIn their written and oral pleadings, counsel and legal experts for the Claimants argue that several mass claims processing programs took place on the international level in recent time, with a view to convincing the Tribunal a) that such procedures are possible and admissible on the international level; and b) that the Tribunal, by analogy, has jurisdiction and is empowered to do the same, which also implies, according to them, the Tribunal\u2019s power to devise the appropriate procedures to handle such mass claims.\n\n179.\n\nAlthough the majority award chose to ignore this aspect, I consider it important and highly relevant to examine the other experiences of processing mass claims in international law, in order to establish what can or cannot be done in the present case.\n\n180.\n\nThe analogy that counsel and legal experts for the Claimants sought to draw between the mass claims processing programs that existed up to now on the international level and the present collective mass claims action, is a false analogy. It glosses over fundamental differences between these programs and the present case.\n\n181.\n\nFirst and foremost among these differences is the legal basis on which these programs were established, and which is the crux of the matter here under discussion, namely whether the Respondent, by merely consenting to arbitration within the ICSID framework, has also consented to arbitrate the present collective mass claims action.\n\n182.\n\nIf we examine all the examples of international mass claims programs that have been mentioned by counsel and legal experts for the Claimants, and which are discussed in one of the Claimants legal annexes to which recurrent reference was made41, covering indeed all the known instances, we note the following common major features that distinguish them from the present case :\n\nCLA 185. In fact, it is an excerpt of a book edited by Judge Howard Holtzman and Edda Kristjansdottir, *International Mass Claims Processes : Legal and Practical Perspectives* (OUP 2007), prepared under the auspices of the PCA Steering Committee on International Mass Claims.\n\n183.\n\na) Each one of them, without exception, was specifically established to process a particular set of mass claims. None of them was set in motion by an application to a standing Tribunal, or on the basis of a prior compromissory clause (or another prior jurisdictional title) as in the present case.\n\n184.\n\nb) In all these cases, with one exception, the program, as a specific response to a specific crisis (\"the same set of facts\" giving rise to the claims), was established by an agreement between the parties, i.e. on the basis of the consent of all parties concerned. The one exception is the United Nations Compensation Commission (the UNCC), which was established by the Security Council, using its exceptional powers (mandatory on all member States) under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.\n\n185.\n\nThe fact that all known cases, save for the UNCC, which is of no relevance to the present case, are based on a special agreement between the parties, is of particular significance to the present case, and to the point under discussion here, namely whether a mere consent to arbitrate within the ICSID framework covers subsequent collective mass claims actions. If in all known international cases (barring the fiat of the Security Council) a special agreement is needed, then, in the absence of such agreement, but within an already existing arbitral framework, at least a \"secondary consent\" is needed.\n\n186.\n\n- c) All these mass claims processing programs on the international level, with one notable exception (and another minor one, see below note 42) took the form of administrative compensation commissions, quasi-judicial bodies rather than fully judicial or arbitral tribunals. Of course, they are subject to certain due process requirements, but this is not the same as judicial or arbitral due process. Thus, the procedure is normally non-adversarial, and the remedies can be in terms of flat-rate compensation, etc. The treatment of claims is not necessarily individual. Although, in the UNCC for example, for State claims and large individual claims, the examination was individual. This type of procedure is not relevant to the present case, where the requirements of the judicial or arbitral function and the judicial or arbitral due process have to be completely and strictly observed.\n\n187.\n\nThe one notable exception is the Iran-US Claims Tribunal. And this exception proves the rule. Claims are dealt with individually, though occasionally related claims were dealt with in one case (as is done in all ordinary tribunals). The Iran-US Claims Tribunal was established by special agreement to deal with a specific set of claims. And it functions not as an *ad hoc* tribunal dealing with all these claims at one go, in one suit or action, but as a standing regular Tribunal examining claims individually and adversarially42, the same as the old Mixed-Arbitral Tribunals of the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe other minor exception is the first phase of The Claims Resolution Tribunal for Dormant Accounts in Switzerland (CVRT-I), which also functioned along similar lines.\n\n188.\n\nd) None of these mass claims processing programs, whether called Tribunal, Commission or otherwise, took on itself or was authorized to invent its own procedures from scratch. The main parameters of these procedures, particularly the ones that deviate from the normal patterns and are thus more controversial, were set out in the agreement or the legal instrument establishing the body (or their drafting and revision were kept in the hands of the Parties or the organ that established the program).\n\n189.\n\nOn all these crucial points, the international precedents and experiences make it abundantly clear the necessity of the agreement of all parties in order to establish a mechanism with jurisdiction to process a particular set of mass claims - or collaterally, to endow an already existing body or framework with such jurisdiction - and to devise the procedures for so doing; in stark contradiction with the findings of the majority award in the present case.\n\n190.\n\n*My conclusion* on the first preliminary objection of Argentina is that, in conformity with what is followed both on the national law level, including in international commercial arbitration, and on the international law level, which is the applicable law in the present case, a mere acceptance to arbitrate does not cover collective mass claims actions (regardless of the denomination) and that a special or secondary consent is needed for such collective actions.\n\n191.\n\nIn consequence, Argentina\u2019s consent to the ICSID Convention and the BIT does not extends to collective mass claims actions, and this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the present case.\n\n192.\n\nAnd if the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the case, the question of whether it has the power to devise, revise or adapt the rules of procedure to handle it, becomes moot.\n\n193.\n\nBut as the majority award found that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present collective mass claims action and that, in consequence - reasoning by necessity - it also has to have the power to devise or \"adapt\" the rules of procedure to handle it, I feel duty bound to address this last question.\n\nF - The Limits of Procedural Improvisation\n------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nEven if *arguendo* the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the present collective mass claims action (which I already refuted), it still faces a fundamental obstacle that prevents it from proceeding as the majority award proposes to do. This insuperable obstacle is that the Tribunal is not authorized, nor has the power, under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, to adopt *proprio motu* (on its own motion or initiative), a whole set of rules of procedure, replacing the normal \"Arbitration Rules\" or large segments thereof, without the agreement of the Parties or the approval of the Administrative Council, even if it is only for the purposes of handling the present case.\n\n195.\n\nTwo points of clarification are here in order. First, although this question was raised as part of Argentina\u2019s first preliminary objection, it is based on different grounds, as it assumes *arguendo* that Argentina\u2019s double consent to the ICSID Convention and the BIT covers collective mass claims actions, which is precisely what Argentina contests in its first preliminary objection. If Argentina\u2019s consent is also mentioned here, it is as a third type or layer of consent envisaged in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, when it refers to rules of procedure \"agreed by the parties\", in the context of elaborating rules of procedure for a specific case; on the assumption that the Tribunal has already established its jurisdiction over the case. The distinction between these three layers of consent (to Convention, BIT and within Article 44), should always be kept in mind, which is not the case of the majority award.\n\n196.\n\nThe second point of clarification concerns the legal nature of this preliminary point. What is in question here is the inherent and institutional limitations on the power of the Tribunal to devise, revise or \"adapt\" the rules of procedure in a specific case, i.e. certain limits on its powers in exercising its judicial or arbitral function. As such, it is essentially a question of jurisdiction - jurisdiction in its first and foremost sense of the legal power to exercise the judicial or arbitral function (see above para.10) - and not a question of admissibility as maintained by the majority opinion.\n\n197.\n\nBe that as it may, the results of the examination of this issue must be the same. For if it leads to a finding that the Tribunal is not empowered to undertake the \"revisions\" or \"adaptations\" set out in the majority award, the award would be *ultra vires,* regardless of the legal characterization by the award of this preliminary issue.\n\n198.\n\nThe majority award, having determined that the silence of the \"ICSID framework\" over collective mass claims actions constitutes a \"gap\" - i.e. an unintended omission - and not a \"qualified silence\" - i.e. a deliberate exclusion or limitation (while glossing over the limits of Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate), seeks to rest its power to fill this so-called \"gap\" on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and Article 19 of the Arbitration Rules, describing them as \"the mere expression of the inherent power of any tribunal to resolve procedural questions in the event of lacunae\" (para. 521).\n\n199.\n\nArticle 19 of the Arbitration Rules, entitled \"Procedural Orders\", provides :\n\n\"The Tribunal shall make the orders required for the conduct of the proceedings\". This Article has nothing to do with filling gaps. It merely states the obvious, that the Tribunal controls and directs the unfolding of the proceedings through procedural orders, frequently reflecting also the agreement of the parties. It thus decides such matters as fixing the time- limits, the language or languages used, whether the case will have one or two phases, etc., as well as deciding on the different requests of the parties and the incidents of procedure.\n\n200.\n\nArticle 44 of the ICSID Convention is more to the point here under discussion. Enunciating the applicable procedural law, it provides, in its second sentence :\n\n\"If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question\".\n\n201.\n\nIt is clear from this text that the situation envisaged in that provision is that of an issue arising in the course of the proceedings which is not addressed by any specific rule of the applicable procedural law. In other words, it is a situation where no rule exists at all; and not one where a rule exists, but may not provide the best or most suitable solution to the issue at hand, which raises the question of revising or replacing the existing rule rather than filling a gap.\n\n202.\n\nIt is also clear from the text that what is envisaged in terms of \"filling a gap\" is the odd missing rule (by inadvertence or oversight) or a small missing element or cog of a rule necessary for its implementation, what is called in the general theory of law a \"technical gap\"; and not whole sets or chapters of rules that cover complete segments of procedure (such as the administration of proof or the role and due process rights of the parties in the proceedings). Such major subjects require a \"legislative jurisdiction\" (the jurisdiction of the parties or the organ that adopted the initial legal regulation), going far beyond the limited power of filling gaps that can be encompassed within the judicial or arbitral function.\n\n203.\n\nIndeed, all the examples that can be found of the exercise of such a power, whether in the ICSID framework or by other international tribunals, never go beyond such limited gaps calling for one specific norm or rule to fill it. Thus, in the ICSID context, the examples that can be found of decisions taken in the exercise of the power granted by Article 44 are limited to admitting an *amicus curia* submission (in *Suez and AWG v. Argentina);* or staying proceedings pending the determination, by some other competent forum, of an issue relevant to the tribunal\u2019s own decision (*SGS v. the Republic of the Philippines)*43.\n\nSee Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary* (2nd ed. 2009), Art. 44, paras 57, 58).\n\n204.\n\nThe majority award is conscious of these limitations. Thus, after affirming its power to fill gaps under article 44, it adds : \"...this does not mean that the scope of this power is unlimited...the Tribunal is bound by the limits set forth by Article 44\" (para. 520). It then proceeds to articulate these limits as follows :\n\n\"[T]his power is limited to filling gaps left by the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules...[i]n contrast [to] a *modification* of existing rules [which] can only be effected subject to the parties\u2019 agreement..\"(para. 522, emphasis added). It is \"further limited to the filling of gaps... in the specific proceedings at hand... [i.e.] limited to the design of specific rules to deal with specific problems arising in the proceedings at hand\" (para. 523). Thus, \"the Tribunal cannot i) modify the current arbitration rules [presumably in a specific case] without the Parties consent; ii) adopt a full set of procedure unless the Parties have agreed that the Arbitration Rules.... should not apply without substituting their own rules\" (para. 524).\n\n205.\n\nProblems however arise when the majority award tries to demonstrate how what it proposes to do, by designing specific rules to replace a good part of the \"Arbitration Rules\", falls within these limits. The award starts by posing the key question :\n\n\"Can the Tribunal fill the gap created by the collective aspect of the claim on an *ad hoc* basis and through *the design of specific rules,* or would this require the creation and/or modification of general rules which are under the competence of the Administrative Council ?\" (para. 526, emphasis added).\n\n206.\n\nResponding to this question by the simple application of the limits on the power of the Tribunal under Article 44, as formulated by the majority award itself, leads logically, and inescapably in my submission, to a clear negative answer.\n\n207.\n\nBut the majority award tries to fudge this clear answer by considering that \"[t]his question cannot (and should not) be answered in the abstract...[but] in a concrete manner, i.e. asking itself (i) what are the [needed] specific rules...and (ii) can [they] be considered to fall within [the power of] Article 44 ?\" (para. 527).\n\n208.\n\nThe majority award then embarks on a tortuous argumentation, ending with the Tribunal arrogating to itself the power to set aside, in large measure, the existing Rules of Procedure, and replacing them by another set of rules of its own; acting as a legislator, be it for one case.\n\n209.\n\nIn order critically to examine the reasoning of the majority award in a comprehensible manner, rather than analyzing it statement by statement, I propose to divide the arguments into three categories, corresponding to the three lines of the shifting strategy of justification followed by the award in defense of its proposed course of action :\n\ni) that it is merely filling a gap;\n\nii) that in any case it is introducing innocuous changes that do not affect the substantive rights of the parties and only minimally their procedural rights;\n\niii) and to the limited extent to which these latter rights are affected, their limitation is justified by a balancing of the interests of the parties.\n\n1) On Filling Gaps:\n-------------------\n\n210.\n\nHaving declared that the power of the Tribunal under Article 44 of the Convention \"is limited to filling gaps\" and does not extend to \"a modification of existing rules\" (para. 522), the majority award proceeds to describe the method it proposes to fill the gap, consisting in \"the design of the specific rules... that would be necessary in order to be able to conduct the present proceedings\" (para. 526-527); \"...the adaptations required relat[ing] strictly to the manner of conducting the present proceedings\" (para. 534). In other words, \"it is the manner in which the Tribunal will conduct such examination [of the claims, i.e. the controverted rights and obligations of the Parties] which may diverge from the usual ICSID proceedings\" (para. 534).\n\n211.\n\nBut if the new specific rules cover \"the manner in which the Tribunal will conduct [the] examination of the [claims]\" or \"the conduct of the present proceedings\", this obviously covers most of what is usually covered by the rules of procedure, including those in the Convention and the Arbitration Rules. And these new rules \"*diverge from the usual ICSID proceedings***\"**, i.e. Rules of Procedure (emphasis added). In other words, they set them aside and replace them *in casu.*\n\n212.\n\nObviously, this has nothing to do with filling gaps. First we are not speaking here of a gap, in the current sense in rules of procedure of a \"technical gap\" - the odd, inadvertently unprovided for contingency, or the small missing detail (like a cog or a screw) necessary for implementing a rule - which can be filled by a tribunal or another implementing organ. We are speaking here of whole chapters, segments or sections of regulation. Technically, this is an \"unauthentic\" or \"legislative gap\", calling not for filling a small gap, but for a complement of the legal regulation, which needs a \"legislative jurisdiction\", belonging to the organ or the parties who adopted the original instrument to be complemented, but which lies beyond the \"adjudicative jurisdiction\" of the implementing organ.\n\n213.\n\nSecondly, what the majority award proposes to do is not \"filling a gap\", but modifying (\"diverging from\") the existing rules of procedure. A gap or lacuna is a void, an empty legal space not covered by any rule. But here we have a complete legal regulation, covering almost every instance of the proceedings. What the majority award proposes is to replace most of it by another set of rules, which cannot be seen, by any stretch of imagination, as filling a void. It is clearly a modification or revision of the existing rules, though limited to the current case.\n\n214.\n\nThe majority award tries to defend its position as follows :\n\n\"The Tribunal...can and ought to fill gaps left where the application of existing rules are not adapted to the specific dispute submitted to ICSID arbitration. In such a case, *the filling of the gap does not consist of an amendment of the written rule itself, but rather of an adaptation of its application in a specific case\"* (para. 525, emphasis added).\n\n215.\n\nThis statement is extraordinary in at least two ways : first, it insists on using the language of \"filling gaps\", in the presence of norms dealing with the matter, i.e. where no gap exists, while realizing full well that the suitability of the existing rules is another matter that raises the question of their amendment, and not of filling gaps.\n\n216.\n\nWhence the second extraordinary feature of this argument, the distinction between \"an amendment of the written rule itself\" and \"an adaptation of its application in a specific case\" by \"deviating\" from its prescriptions, i.e. replacing it by another \"specific rule\", as abundantly described in the majority award. This baffling distinction is reminiscent of that other mystifying one between \"conditioning... consent to ICSID jurisdiction to the fulfillment of a condition\" and \"conditioning the effective implementation of such consent... to the fulfillment of such a precondition\" (discussed above, paras. 21-24).\n\n217.\n\nBut no amount of sophistry and playing on words or newspeak can conceal the fact that the proposed adaptations \"diverge from the usual ICSID proceeding\" (para.533), i.e. from the existing Rules of Procedure. Nor can they transform the legal nature of this act or operation, dubbed here as \"adaptation\" which does not consist of providing for an inadvertently overlooked minor contingency or a small missing detail in an existing rule needed for its implementation that would correspond to the meaning of \"filling a gap\"; but of *changing* or *substituting* the existing rules by other \"specific rules\", which clearly constitute an amendment, modification or revision of the existing rules; an operation which lies beyond the limited power granted to the Tribunal under Article 44 of the Convention.\n\n218.\n\nNor does the fact that this so-called \"adaptation\" is effected only for the purposes of the current case, change the legal nature of the act or operation. After all, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is limited to the case before it and its powers and even existence, do not extend beyond that. But in the specific case before it, the Tribunal will not follow the normative prescriptions of the written rule, but will substitute for them other normative prescriptions that \"diverge\" from them (rather than merely complement something that is missing in the normative prescriptions, which would correspond to the description of \"filling a gap\"). This means that in this specific case, the existing rule or rules have been \"amended\", \"modified\", \"revised\" or more radically discarded and totally replaced. In other words, the arbitrators would have exercised a \"legislative jurisdiction\" or \"power\", that lies beyond what is provided for in Article 44 of the Convention.\n\n219.\n\nAnd if in every case or whenever the arbitrators in a specific case consider that there are more suitable or appealing rules of procedure, according to their will of whim, these arbitrators can brush aside the written rules of procedure in deciding the case before them, what would remain of the \"written rule\" and its binding normative effect ? It would be reduced to a mere recommendatory directive at the discretion of the Tribunal. It is true that the \"Arbitration Rules\" are largely *jus dispositivum*. But they can be replaced in a specific case only by the agreement of the parties, and not by the fiat of the Tribunal over the objection of a party.\n\n220.\n\nThe artificial and tenuous character of this argument of the majority award, concerning the legal nature of the operation or act of \"adaptation\" (and whether it is \"filling a gap\" or an \"amendment\" of the Rules of Procedure), explains the slippage of the award\u2019s reasoning to a second line of defense, namely that, in any case, the \"adaptations\" envisaged are innocuous, with no or negligible consequence on the rights of the parties.\n\n2) The Scope of the Proposed \"Adaptations\" and their Incidence on the Rights of the Parties\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nIn its second line of defense or justification, the majority award starts by trying to minimize the magnitude of the \"adaptations\" it proposes to undertake by such statements as: \"...the adaptations...relate strictly to the manner of conducting the present proceedings, and in particular how to collect and weigh evidence\" (para. 534; see also paras. 530,531,533).\n\n222.\n\nBut once the rules governing the manner in which the proceedings are conducted throughout a case (particularly the presentation and adversarial examination of the controverted claims and their supporting evidence by the parties and the assessment of these claims and the weighing of the evidence by the Tribunal) are covered by the \"specific rules\" designed by the Tribunal for the particular case under consideration, how much else is left to be governed by the regular rules of procedure ? In fact, the proposed \"adaptations\" cover large expanses, if not most of what is included in any rules of procedure.\n\n223.\n\nAnother argument in the same vein of minimizing the import of the proposed changes or \"adaptations\" of the rules of procedure, is the insistence of the majority award that these \"adaptations\" do not affect the merits, i.e. the controverted claims, but only the manner in which they will be examined and the way the Tribunal will conduct the proceedings. In other terms, the majority award contends that these \"adaptations\" will not affect the substantive rights and obligations of the parties (para. 530-534). This implies, however, that by contrast they may touch their procedural rights (which the award acknowledges, and tries to justify later on, as discussed below). And after briefly describing the proposed \"adaptations\" in terms of simplification of the marshalling and weighing of evidence and the examination of the claims44, the award states that \"such simplification of the examination process is to be distinguished from the failure to proceed with such examination\" (para. 531).\n\n[I]t is undeniable that the Tribunal will not be in a position to examine all elements and related documents in the same way as if there were only a handful of Claimants.... [but will resort to] a simplified verification of evidentiary material concern[ing] either the depth of examination of a ducument... or the number of documents to be examined, and if so their selection process...\" (Para. 531).\n\n224.\n\nThese affirmations and statements are properly baffling, for several reasons : first, Article 44, which is here under discussion, deals exclusively with rules of procedure. It goes without saying that the Tribunal has no power under this article or in general to touch the controverted substantive rights and obligations of the parties, that constitute the \"object\" or \"subject-matter\" of the claims before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is here to judge, not to retouch, these rights and obligations. If what the Tribunal does on the procedural level affects these substantive rights and obligations, such action of the Tribunal is clearly both illegal and *ultra vires*.\n\n225.\n\nSecondly, the implication that as long as the \"adaptations\" by the Tribunal are confined to \"set[ting] strict boundaries to certain of the Parties\u2019 procedural rights\" (para. 538), in fact abridging or curtailing these rights, without touching directly the Parties\u2019 substantive rights, such adaptation would be justified, is based on a clear fallacy. This fallacy consists of the radical distinction between substantive and procedural rights, and the treatment of the later as a second class category of rights at the disposal and discretion of the Tribunal (a distinction reminiscent of the manner in which the majority award distinguishes between jurisdiction and admissibility).\n\n226.\n\nThis radical distinction is false because if a substantive right, or a right *tout court,* is defined in the general theory of law as \"an interest (or a value) protected by law\", then the procedural rights or guarantees that back it up are an essential part of this legal protection; their curtailment, abridgement, or violation in any way, automatically puts in serious jeopardy the substantive rights they protect. It is a sheer aberration to try radically to separate the two the way proposed by the majority award, pretending that the limitation of one (the procedural rights) does not affect the other (the substantive rights).\n\n227.\n\n- In the third place, the statement that the \"simplification\" of the examination of the claims and the evidence should be distinguished from failure to operate such an examination at all, is off the mark. Obviously, if the Tribunal does not examine the claims and the evidence, it would have totally failed to exercise its judicial or arbitral function. The question is not whether it has undertaken such an examination or not, but whether the so-called \"simplified examination\" it proposes to do, meets the judicial and arbitral standards of due process. The answer to this question depends on the extent to which the simplification affects the procedural rights of the parties, particularly the defense rights of the Respondent.\n\n228.\n\nThe majority award tries to minimize the impact of its proposed \"simplification\" of the procedure (linguistic slippage again from the more alarming \"adaptations\" to the rather virtuous \"simplification\"), to hide the real legal nature of the operation, i.e. \"modification\". It does so by describing briefly the effects of the \"adaptation\" on the respective rights of the two parties.\n\n229.\n\nStarting with the *Claimants*, which is the easier case, the majority award states that the adaptation would concern only \"the way [they] are represented\" (para. 530), acknowledging \"that TFA has been provided with powers which may go beyond the power granted to a normal agent under Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules\" (para.532). But the award immediately adds : \"Admitting the present collective proceedings would thus also mean accepting TFA\u2019s role as due representative of Claimants\" (para. 532).\n\n230.\n\nThis last sentence is yet another extraordinary statement. By which leap of faith, does the taking of jurisdiction by the Tribunal over the case, even in the form of a collective action, (assuming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, an assumption I refuted above), justify and render legal and acceptable to the Tribunal the exorbitant status and powers of TFA ? Again reasoning by necessity that is not evident.\n\n231.\n\nLater on, the majority award justifies the exorbitant character of \"the TFA Mandate Package [which] has the effect to depriving [sic] Claimants of a substantial part of their procedural rights\", by the fact that it \"has been consciously accepted by Claimants\" (para. 546). This can be a valid justification, subject to public policy limitations, if this consent were fully informed and not tainted by fraud or forgery; that which is ascertained by the majority award, but which is contradicted by certain recent criminal condemnations for forgery (of the signatures of the mandates given to TFA) by Italian courts, that the majority award refused to take into consideration.\n\n232.\n\nBe that as it may, what counts most here is the effects of the new \"specific rules\" or \"adaptations\" on the rights of the Respondent, who has contested throughout the power of the Tribunal to introduce these \"adaptations\"; unlike the Claimants who have defended the power of the Tribunal to do so, and thus can be legitimately presumed to have accepted the incidence of these adaptations on their procedural rights, in their own self-interest.\n\n233.\n\nThe \"[*e*]*ffects on Argentina\u2019s defense rights\"* of the proposed \"adaptations\" are assessed by the majority award as follows :\n\n\"It *appears* that the effect of such examination method and procedure on Argentina\u2019s defense rights is *limited and relative*. Whilst it is true that Argentina may not be able to enter into full length and detail into the individual circumstances of each Claimant, it is *not certain* that such approach is at all necessary to protect Argentina\u2019s procedural rights in the light of the homogeneity of Claimants\u2019 claims\"\" (para. 545, emphasis added; see also para. 536).\n\n234.\n\nThis minimalist representation of the effects of the \"adaptations\" on the rights of the Respondent - which contrasts with their more constraining description elsewhere in the majority award (e.g. para. 538) - calls for the following critical comments :\n\n235.\n\ni) Justifying the abridgement and curtailment of the procedural rights of the Respondent, particularly as concerns the individual examination of claims (and claimants) by the argument that the mass claims in question are sufficiently homogeneous, does not stand scrutiny (see above, paras. 139-142).\n\n236.\n\nThis is because it is an absolute due process right of a respondent in a judicial or arbitral proceeding, to have every element of the claim or claims presented against him, examined by the tribunal, through adversarial debate that affords him full opportunity to contest and refute these elements one by one, if he can..\n\n237.\n\nThis procedural right of respondents does not necessarily preempt any and all \"group examination of claims\" (para. 540). For as long as the mass claims are cast into one claim (with a mass of claimants) or are identical claims (which comes to the same thing as the tribunal, by examining one, would have examined them all) - which is the case for example of \"class actions\" - the tribunal can examine adversarially all the aspects and components of this one claim, in spite of the multitude of the claimants, totally safeguarding the due process rights of the respondent45.\n\nEven in class actions, as noted by the US Supreme Court in the *ATandT Mobility LLC v. Concepcion ET UX* case, \"class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants\" (see above para. 152). These risks are exponentially greater when the mass is composed of differentiated claims.\n\n238.\n\nBut in the present case, the Claimants vigourously refute the characterization of their collective mass-claims action as class action. And although these mass-claims can be considered as arising \"out of the same fact pattern\", and thus share some common features (whence a degree of homogeneity), they are not identical and preserve some individualized features that distinguish them from one another. To the extent that the individual claims in the mass differ from each other, it is the absolute due process right of the defense, and the obligation of the Tribunal, to have them examined individually and adversarially by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has also to address and pass judgement on each of them and state the reasons on which it bases its judgement (Article 48/3 of the ICSID Convention). Failure to meet these requirements is a cause of annulment under the ICSID Convention (Art. 52/d).\n\n239.\n\nA \"group examination\" of mass claims that feature certain individual differences among themselves, can at best deliver rough or approximate justice. It may satisfy the due process requirements of an emergency mass claims program or an administrative compensation commission. But it definitely falls well below the stringent due process standard of judicial or arbitral proceedings.\n\n240.\n\nii) One cannot but note the hesitant and guarded language of the above-quoted assessment by the majority award of the effect of the \"adaptations\" on Argentina\u2019s defense rights : - \"it *appears*\" that the effect \"*is limited and relative*\"; *\"it is not certain that such approach*\" of individual examination of differentiated claims \"*is at all necessary to protect Argentina\u2019s defense rights*\" (above, para. 234).\n\n241.\n\nThis language of \"appearance\" (of an effect being \"limited and relative\") and of \"uncertainty\" (whether a due process guarantee is \"at all necessary\" to protect a right), reflects an evident unease of the majority award with its own argument, and its awareness of its frail and risky character. For good reason. For here, the majority award is treading rather heavily on the highly sensitive due process grounds.\n\n242.\n\nIn the first place, the individual adversarial examination of differentiated (or non- identical) claims is an essential part of the very \"object\" or \"subject-matter\" of the Respondent\u2019s procedural defense rights, and is not a mere \"approach\", as the majority award calls it, which it has decided to dispense with, because it considers that \"it is uncertain\" that such an examination \"is at all necessary to protect Argentina\u2019s procedural rights\". In other words, according to the majority award, \"it is not certain\" that the subject-matter of a right - what it prescribes and legally guarantees for its holder - \"is at all necessary\" for the protection of that same right!\n\n243.\n\nApart from logical confusion, this statement of the majority award reveals something even more serious, namely, that the Tribunal has substituted itself for the Respondent and decided in his place the question whether it is necessary for him to exercise some of his procedural defense rights or not. Moreover, it has answered the question on the basis of impressions and \"appearance\", almost by guesswork - \"it is uncertain\" - in order to reach the result it wanted to reach.\n\n244.\n\nProcedural rights, the same as substantive rights, are not at the disposal and the discretion of the Tribunal. If they are ascertained, they have to be upheld and enforced by the Tribunal; not confiscated, scuttled, abridged or curtailed by it. But this is exactly what the majority award has done in the present case. By imposing the \"adaptation\" or \"simplified procedures\", that deny Argentina an individual adversarial examination of the differentiated mass claims, the majority award has unlawfully curtailed the Respondent\u2019s defense rights and thus flagrantly violated the due process arbitral standards, apart from being manifestly *ultra vires*.\n\n3) Balancing of Interests Redux\n-------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe majority award tries to evade this inexorable conclusion by shifting its argument, through yet another slippage, to a third line of defense or justification of the \"adaptations\", to wit, the balancing of the interests of the Parties. A balancing that the majority award operates by comparing the consequences or effects of the \"adaptations\" on the rights of the Parties \"with the consequences of rejecting the claims for lack of admissibility\" (para. 537), in order to answer the question \"whether it would be justified to set strict boundaries to certain of the Parties\u2019 procedural rights, so as to give actual effective protection to the investment\" (para. 538).\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the majority award, the consequences of *admitting* the \"adaptations\" (\"special rules, \"simplified examination\", etc.) on the procedural rights of the Parties are minimal, and the outcome beneficial (\"the effective protection of the investment\"). The \"adaptations\" pose no problem for the *Claimants*, who have requested and defended them all along, and accept their consequences in their own self-interest of protecting their investment. As far as the *Respondent* is concerned, according to the majority award (discussed above, para.232ff.), \"[i]t appears that the effect of such [simplified] examination... on Argentina\u2019s defense rights is limited and relative\", and \"it is not certain\" that the due process guarantees curtailed by the \"adaptations\" are \"at all necessary to protect Argentina\u2019s procedural rights\" (para. 545).\n\n247.\n\nBy contrast, the consequences of *dismissing the case on grounds of inadmissibility* would be serious and prejudicial, according to the majority award. The \"only alternative\" left to *Claimants* would be for each of them \"to file an individual ICSID claim\" which would be \"cost prohibitive to many claimants...[and] may equal a denial of justice\" (para. 537). It would also \"be a much bigger challenge to Argentina\u2019s [the *Respondent\u2019s*] effective defense rights...to conduct 60,000 separate proceedings... than [their] mere limitation\" by the \"adaptations\" (para. 545).\n\n248.\n\nOn the basis of this exercise of \"balancing the interests\" of the Parties\u2019 at stake, according to its own subjective representation and evaluation of these stakes, the majority award finds that the \"adaptations\", i.e. \"the procedure necessary to deal with Claimants\u2019 claims in a collective way\", are \"admissible and acceptable under Article 44 ICSID Convention, Rule 19 Arbitration Rules, as well as under the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention\" (para. 547).\n\n249.\n\nThis exercise of balancing of interests calls for critical examination. It is intrinsically wrong, lies beyond the powers of the Tribunal and is based on wrong premises, as shown in what follows.\n\n250.\n\nThe \"balancing of interests\" as operated by the majority award is intrinsically wrong because, by making the admissibility of the \"adaptations\" depend on the comparison of the consequences of their admission on the procedural rights of the Parties \"with the consequences of rejecting the claims for lack of admissibility\" (para. 537), the majority award is *treating these rights as \"variables\"* (or rather as dependant variables), whose recognition, scope and enforceability by the Tribunal are to be determined as a function of the Tribunal\u2019s subjective evaluation of the right balance of interests between the parties, which thus becomes, according to this logic, the parametric gauge of these rights. This is standing the legal logic on its head. A tribunal is duty bound to apply the law, i.e. to enforce rights not to put them in question, according to its own evaluation of extra-legal (or opportunity) considerations, be they its subjective representation of the interests of the Parties.\n\n251.\n\nSuch \"balancing of interests\" lies beyond the powers of the Tribunal. For, as explained earlier (para. 31), the Tribunal thus acts as if the rules do not exist, and are not themselves the result or outcome of a balancing of interests by those who adopted them. It is at that level, the legislative or conventional level, that the balance of interests takes place, the level of establishing the rules, not of applying them, which is that of tribunals. It is not open to the Tribunal to arrogate to itself the legislative jurisdiction or power of re-examining the rules in order to revise of refashion them, in the name of a rebalancing of interests of its own, according to its will or whim. In other words, such an exercise of \"balancing of interests\" is clearly *ultra vires* the powers of the Tribunal.\n\n252.\n\nApart from the illegality and *ultra vires* character of the \"balancing of interests\", as represented and operated in the majority award, substantively the exercise is based on false premisses of law and fact.\n\n253.\n\ni - To say that the only alternative open to the securities holders if the present collective action is found inadmissible would be for each of them to file an individual ICSID claim, is wrong in fact. For as already shown (above para 33), apart from the Argentinean tribunals, that were not even tried, all the emphasis in the securities entitlement instruments was put on the chosen forum therein for dispute settlement, i.e. the tribunals of some of the major financial centres of the world as *the* judicial guarantee of the financial investment, beyond the reach of Argentina\u2019s law and tribunals. ICSID arbitration was never mentioned in these instruments, nor in the advertisements and the road-shows for the sale of the instruments (as abundantly shown in the pleadings). The one judicial guarantee or recourse that stood out was the chosen forum.\n\n254.\n\nMoreover, one should not forget the Italian courts which were seized by some of the securities entitlement holders who succeeded on numerous occasions in obtaining relief against the banks that sold them the securities. This largely explains the creation by these very banks of the TFA and their belated discovery of ICSID arbitration as a way of deflecting responsibility from themselves.\n\n255.\n\n- ii - To say that dismissing the case for inadmissibility of the adaptations, \"may equal a denial of justice\" is triply wrong, because it is based on three false assumptions. In the first place, to imply that this would deprive the claimants from any efficient dispute settlement means, is wrong as just explained.\n\n256.\n\nSecondly, in order to speak of a denial of justice, a tribunal must first have jurisdiction over the case. But this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the claims (Part III above). It lacks jurisdiction to hear collective mass claims actions, as falling outside Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate (Part IV, *A* to *E* above), and it lacks the power to revise the Arbitration Rules in the instant case, in the absence of both Parties consent, as just discussed. Speaking of \"denial of justice\" in these circumstances is out of place.\n\n257.\n\nThirdly, it is also out of place and even odd in international law to speak in general of an absence of a competent forum (which is not the case here, as per para 253-254 above), in terms of \"denial of justice\". This is because international law, given its a-centralized character, has no system of courts or tribunals of plenary or general jurisdiction (*juridictions de droit commun*) covering all cases and litigants, barring a specific exception attributing jurisdiction over a particular type of matter or litigant to another specialized organ, and where every dispute or every claim can ultimately and necessarily find a competent forum to handle it. By contrast, as explained earlier (para 7), all international courts and tribunals are tribunals of attributed jurisdiction (*juridictions d\u2019attribution*); a jurisdiction based on the consent of the parties or litigants and confined within the limits of this consent.\n\n258.\n\niii - In fact, the majority award tries to claim the same powers as a tribunal of plenary or general jurisdiction through interpretation by calling on the \"spirit\", \"aim\" and/or \"object and purpose\" of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, \"in accordance with the principles of interpretation of treaties\" (para. 528). But the principles of treaty interpretation, as codified in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, prescribe starting with the text in its context and be guided by the object and purpose of the treaty, if need be, to clarify any subsisting ambiguity. These principles do not prescribe nor justify, the invocation left and right by the Tribunal, of the object and purpose, as subjectively represented by it, in order to deduce directly from them the solutions it seeks to reach, jumping over text, context and general rules of international law applicable to the matter. Yet, this is exactly what the majority award does all along, as already noted (see e.g. para. 24, 157-159 above).\n\n259.\n\nIn the specific context of \"balancing of interests\" discussed here, the majority award sollicites the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, according to its subjective and partial interpretation of them as being exclusively the effective protection of the investment, notwithstanding the legitimate interests of the host State, in order to answer in the affirmative the rhetorical question it put at the outset. To recall, this question was \"whether...it would be justified to set strict boundaries to [i.e. abridge] certain of the Parties\u2019 procedural rights [but in fact only to the Respondent\u2019s, as the Claimants requested the \"adaptations\" in their self-interest]... so as to give actual effective protection to the investment\", i.e. the Claimants (para 538). And the answer, reached through the involved reasoning discussed above, is the award\u2019s finding that the \"adaptations\" are \"admissible and acceptable under article 44 ICSID Convention, Rule 19 Arbitration Rules, as well as under the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention (para. 547).\n\n260.\n\nPut in simple words, the answer is that the Tribunal can abridge the procedural rights of one party, the Respondent, against its will, in order to give greater (\"actual effective\") protection to the investment, i.e. to the other Party, the Claimants\u2019 investors. The one- sidedness of this alleged balancing of interests is too glaring to need any further elaboration.\n\n261.\n\nThis is symptomatic of a general strategy followed throughout by the majority opinion, consisting of three stages :\n\ni - starting with a subjective, partial and truncated representation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, as being exclusively the effective protection of investment, all but totally disregarding the legitimate interests of the host State;\n\nii - considering, in consequence, that all limitations on the jurisdiction and powers of the Tribunal are obstacles in the way of achieving this object and purpose, that should be \"down-graded\", (even with untenable arguments) from \"jurisdictional\" to \"admissibility\" issues; wrongly assuming that admissibility is less important in its function and legal effects than jurisdiction;\n\niii - assuming wrongly again that questions of admissibility, are at the discretion of the Tribunal, which can dismiss them at will as a result of its own subjective \"balancing of interests\" in the light of \"the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention\" (para. 547), as interpreted by the Tribunal.\n\nNeedless to say, this strategy has very little to do with rigourous legal reasoning and deciding by law and all the characteristics of sheer policy.\n\n262.\n\nMy *conclusion* on this sub-section (IV F) in general is that the \"adaptations\" of the Arbitration Rules that the majority award prescribes for hearing the present case are manifestly *ultra vires* the powers of the Tribunal under Article 44 of the Convention and Rule 19 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\nG - Epilogue on Policy Considerations\n-------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nConsidering what has just been said, it is ironic that the majority award dismisses offhand the \"Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the appropriateness of ICSID proceedings in the context of sovereign debt restructuring\" (para. 548); adding that\n\n\"[P]olicy reasons are for States to take into account when negotiating BITs and consenting to ICSID jurisdiction in general, not for the Tribunal to take into account in order to repair an inappropriately negotiated or drafted BIT\" (para. 550).\n\n264.\n\nThe majority award should have heeded its own directive, rather than read, or in effect write, into the Convention, the BIT and the Arbitration Rules, what is not there, but what it wishes to see there.\n\n265.\n\nIndeed, the majority award accepts, in full and without reasoning, the Claimant\u2019s contention that Argentina\u2019s policy arguments are \"outdated and irrelevant\" (para. 514), calling them - in only slightly varied terms - \"irrelevant and inaccurate\" (para. 429(v). It also seemingly subscribes to the Claimant\u2019s policy argument that \"opening the door to ICSID arbitration would create a supplementary leverage against such rogue debtors and therefore be beneficial to the efficiency of foreign debt restructuring\" (ibid.). In order to create such leverage over sovereign debtors, which the ICSID Convention did not foresee and which financial markets did not contemplate, then or now, the majority award fashions an unprecedented procedure for adjudicating the present claim of more than 60,000 holders of Argentinean debt, out of the thin air of the tribunal\u2019s gap-filling powers under article 44 of the ICSID Convention. Driven in part by controversial policy considerations, hidden behind references to the spirit of the ICSID Convention and the purpose of the BIT, the majority award blows hot and cold at the same time, uncritically adopting the Claimant\u2019s policy arguments over the Respondent\u2019s, to which it hardly gave any attention.\n\n266.\n\nUp to this point, the reasoning in this dissenting opinion has kept to strict law, and this is how a judicial or arbitral decision should be. But a judge or an arbitrator, particularly an international one, cannot be totally blind to the social, economic and political environment which constitutes the larger context of the case. Policy considerations should never be determinative of a judicial or arbitral decision. But, within the permissible margin of interpretation, they can shed light on what makes sense or nonsense among possible alternative solutions, when seen against the larger background.\n\n267.\n\nIn this respect, the following three major policy issues or queries, collaterally raised and necessarily affected by any decision taken in this case, should have been given more attention:\n\n268.\n\ni - As noted earlier (para. 35), this is the first ICSID case that involves a sovereign debt financial instrument (but I leave the sovereign debt aspect to the following point), that is totally unhinged and detached from any specific economic activity or project in the host country; in other words, completely detached from any form of investment in the economic sense of the term, which is also that of ICSID Convention. Affirming the jurisdiction of ICSID Tribunals over such instruments, would extend it over a vast new field. It would cover virtually all capital market transactions, ranging from standardized financial instruments, such as shares and bonds to structured and derivative products, such as hedges and credit default swaps. It would thus open the way to converting them from specialized tribunals, dealing with disputes arising out of a special type of investment, into commercial tribunals of general jurisdiction, covering all manners of financial transactions, including the most speculative varieties, which have nothing to do, in fact are light years away from the economic investment for the encouragement of which the ICSID Convention was concluded.\n\nIs this the direction for ICSID tribunals to follow?\n\n269.\n\nii - This is also the first ICSID case, to my knowledge, that involves sovereign debt. It raises *prima facie* a crucial question : do ICSID tribunals have jurisdiction over sovereign debt instruments issued internationally, expressed in foreign currency and payable abroad, governed by various external laws and subject to the jurisdiction of various external courts, and traded as dematerialised security entitlements in global capital markets ?\n\n270.\n\nThe majority award evades addressing this question frontally and on its merits, by purportedly deciding the issue on another ground, i.e. finding that these are financial instruments that are, as such, covered by the BIT (a finding refuted in Section III above). But evading the question does not dispose of it. For it remains central not only for the jurisdictional reach of ICSID arbitration in this particular case, but in relation to financial market transactions in general, as discussed in the previous point. The answer also matters greatly for the larger problem of sovereign debt crisis management, i.e. for the manner in which the international community and countries borrowing abroad will resolve the present and future sovereign debt crises and how the burden for such crises will be shared between taxpayers and creditors; a perennial challenge that is now occupying the daily headlines and confronting countries at all levels of development.\n\n271.\n\nIndeed, in view of the actual profound structural crisis of the international financial system; the absence of agreed international procedures regulating State bankruptcy; and the intense international discussions and efforts to improve the sovereign debt restructuring process, the present case raises, in an accute manner, an international public policy issue about the workability of future sovereign debt restructuring, should ICSID tribunals intervene in sovereign debt disputes. It suffices to ponder the potential disrupting effect of different *ad hoc* tribunals following separate ways or deciding at cross purposes with the desperate international efforts to reconstruct a semblance of a coherent international financial architecture. Such decisions can also potentially unravel patiently negotiated settlements (through the effect of the most favoured creditor clause inserted in most settlements). Ramifications that are depicted in a recent article as \"opening Pandora\u2019s box\" for sovereign debt46.\n\nMichael Waibel, *supra* note 8.\n\nIs this a proper role for ICSID\u2019s tribunals ?\n\n272.\n\niii - Finally, the third policy consideration is a cautionary one. It is to caution against the tendency of certain ICSID tribunals to consider any limitation on their jurisdiction - whether inherent in the adjudicative function or carefully negotiated and stipulated in the ICSID Convention or the BITs, to protect the legitimate interests of State parties - as an obstacle in the way of achieving the object and purpose of these treaties, which they interpret as being exclusively to afford maximum protection to investment, notwithstanding the legitimate interests of the host State.\n\n273.\n\nViewed as such, these limitations have to be disposed of, according to the tribunals in question, at any price, be it the proper interpretation of the law. This leads to tenuous and untenable interpretations, particularly of jurisdictional titles, over-stretching the text beyond the breaking point, in order to extend jurisdiction to where it does not exist, particularly beyond its underlying consent.\n\n274.\n\nThis misguided tendency, purporting to serve progress by expanding the rule of law and the role of adjudication in international society, is the worst disservice that can be rendered to the very positive movement that has characterized the last two decades towards increasing resort to adjudication and the multiplication of adjudicative fora on the international level. It is undermining the credibility not only of the ICSID system, but of the very idea of objective international adjudication, by eroding the confidence of States, whose consent remains the basis of jurisdiction, in the objectivity and good judgement of those to whom they may entrust the ascertainment of their rights. The risk of a back-lash is already pointing its head, it threatens to stop net, if not roll back the movement of progressive judicialisation of international law.\n\nWhat is the proper and prudential course for ICSID tribunals to take in this regard?\n\nV - Conclusion\n--------------\n\n275.\n\nIn conclusion, and while reserving my position on the other preliminary objections raised by Argentina, I consider and find that the first and ninth objections are valid and should have been accepted and given effect by the Tribunal.\n\n276.\n\nIn consequence, I consider and find\n\na) that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the sovereign debt instruments (security entitlements in Argentinean bonds) that are at the basis of the mass claims before the Tribunal, because they do not constitute a covered or protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, in the absence of a territorial link with Argentina;\n\nb) that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT over the present collective mass claims action, absent the consent of Argentina, nor does it have the power to devise new procedures to hear such an action.\n\n277.\n\nFor these reasons, and with all due respect for my co-arbitrators, I cannot concur in the majority award and enter this dissenting opinion."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n------------------------------------------\n\n**Abbreviations**\n\nIn this Decision, the Tribunal adopts the following abbreviations:\n\n\"RfA\" refers to Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration of 14 September 2006.\n\n\"R-MJ\" refers to Respondent\u2019s First Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility filed on 8 August 2008.\n\n\"C-MJ\" refers to Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction filed on 7 November 2008.\n\n\"R-R-MJ\" refers to Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility filed on 23 February 2009.\n\n\"C-R-MJ\" refers to Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction filed on 6 May 2009.\n\n\"First Session Tr.\" refers to the transcript made of the First Session of 10 April 2008 (Tr. p. 1/1 means Transcript on page 1 on line 1).\n\n\"First Session Minutes\" refers to the Minutes of the First Session of 10 April 2008.\n\n\"Exh.

Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic (hereinafter referred to as \"Respondent\" or \"Argentina\").\n\n6.\n\nRespondent is represented in this arbitration by its duly authorised attorneys mentioned at page 2 above.\n\n7.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n**II. FACTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n8.\n\nThis Decision concerns the jurisdictional phase of a dispute relating to Claimants\u2019 claims for compensatory damages due to Respondent\u2019s alleged breach of its obligations under the *Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments,* signed in Buenos Aires on 22 May 1990, in two original copies, in the Italian and the Spanish language, both texts being equally authentic (hereinafter \"Argentina-Italy BIT\" or \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") in relation to-bonds issued by Respondent, allegedly held by Claimants, on which payment Respondent defaulted.\n\n9.\n\nConsidering the matter of Argentina\u2019s sovereign debt restructuring on which Claimants\u2019 claims are based, the Tribunal finds it necessary and appropriate to set out in this Section II the factual background to Argentina\u2019s default and its debt restructuring, to the extent it is not disputed between the Parties, by describing the financial market in relation to bonds, followed by a general overview on sovereign debt restructuring, and subsequently setting forth Argentina\u2019s restructuring of its economy and of its debt in relation to bonds in order to eventually address the evolution/development of the dispute.\n\n10.\n\nThe following summary of the factual background is not meant to be exhaustive, and simply aims to lay down the general context of the dispute, while focusing on aspects relevant to this jurisdictional phase.\n\n**(1) General Concepts relating to Financial Market and Bonds**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\n*(i) Bonds.* Generally, \"bonds\" are defined as a debt, in which an interested party loans money to an entity (corporate or governmental) that borrows the funds for a defined period of time at certain interest rates. Bonds are commonly referred to as fixed-income securities and are one of the three main asset classes, along with stocks and cash equivalents.\n\n12.\n\nBonds, generally, have a pre-set final date of repayment, the \"maturity\" date, and pay interest, \"coupon,\" on pre-set dates until the maturity date, usually on an annual or semi-annual basis. Bonds are uniquely identified by a 12-character alpha-numerical International Securities Identifying Number or \"ISIN.\" The ISIN allows electronic trade and settlement in the particular security in markets across the globe.\n\n13.\n\nA set of bonds issued at the same time but having different maturity dates is referred to as \"serial bonds.\" A single bond issue offered to the public on multiple dates is referred to as \"series bonds.\"\n\n14.\n\n\"Sovereign bonds\" have the same characteristics as the normal bonds described above, with the specificity that they are issued by governments and are usually denominated in a foreign currency. \"International sovereign bonds\" are bonds issued by governments denominated in a foreign currency in foreign markets (i.e., outside the country of the issuer). Bonds issued by governments in the country\u2019s own currency are referred to as \"government bonds.\"\n\n15.\n\nA popular example of sovereign debt security is the instrument of \"Brady Bonds,\" first proposed in 1989. They are named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who supported the effort to restructure emerging market debt instruments, following the 1980s debt crisis. Brady Bonds were issued by governments in developing countries as a conversion of bank debts into loans. The key innovation behind the introduction of Brady Bonds was to allow commercial banks to exchange their claims vis-a-vis developing countries into tradable instruments, allowing them to get the debt off their balance sheets. Due to their classification as bonds, rather than bank loans, Brady Bonds were much easier to trade to a broader range of financial market actors. Given that Brady Bonds were in many cases very large by the standards of the bond markets at the time, they were seen as one of the most liquid emerging market securities. Brady Bonds were collateralized, i.e., the repayment of principal and, in some cases, part of the interest payments, was backed by U.S. government bonds (\"Treasuries\"), which the debtor country purchased, using a combination of International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the country\u2019s own foreign currency reserves. The collateral involved made Brady Bonds considerably more attractive to potential investors than ordinary, uncollateralized bonds of the issuing country. The two main types of Brady Bonds are (i) \"par bonds,\" issued at the same value as the original loan, with the coupon on the bonds being below market rate and principal and interest payments are usually guaranteed; and (ii) \"discount bonds,\" issued at a discount to the original value of the loan, with the coupon on the bonds being at market rate and principal and interest payments usually guaranteed.\n\n16.\n\nBrady Bonds are the origin of the emerging sovereign bond market in its current form. The Brady Bond process ended during the 1990s.\n\n17.\n\n*(ii) Process of Issuing Bonds.* The process of issuing new bonds involves a chain of sales in order to achieve distribution of the issued bonds to the final investor.\n\n18.\n\nThe bond issuer enters into an agreement with a group of banks, which undertake to subscribe to and purchase a bond. These banks, commonly referred to as the \"Subscribers\" or \"Lead Managers,\" then organize together with other banks, the so-called \"Underwriters\" or \"Co-Managers,\" a syndicate. The members of this syndicate, jointly referred to as the \"Participants,\" each underwrite differing parts of this bond, depending on their status in the syndicate. These Participants then distribute their specific part of the bond to further \"Intermediaries,\" such as commercial banks, pension funds and other financial institutions, which in turn may or may not distribute their own part to their clients, including individual investors. Thus, the purpose of the subscribers, underwriters and intermediaries is to act as a distribution conduit.\n\n19.\n\nOriginally, bonds were traded in the form of negotiable bearer instruments, imposing significant handling costs and security risks. As trading volume grew, systems were developed to \"dematerialize\" tradable securities, i.e., to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. Therefore, centralized depository systems were established allowing electronic trading of the securities through electronic accounts (so-called \"non-certified securities\").2 On a global scale, a system has developed whereby issuers deposit a single \"global certificate\" representing all the outstanding securities of a class or series with a \"universal depository,\" such as The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"), Euroclear or Clearstream. All securities traded through a universal depository are registered in electronic form, on the books of various Intermediaries (so-called \"book-entry form\") between the ultimate investor, e.g., a retail investor, and the banks participating in the universal depository, i.e., the Participants. The securities, e.g., bonds, are then traded and settled on the basis of changes in the registration of the accounts opened with the Participants for Intermediaries (i.e., Sub-Participants) and the sub-accounts opened with the Intermediaries for their clients.\n\nSusmel, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 11.\n\n20.\n\nEach global certificate is identified by a special number (CUSIP for DTC, ISIN for Euroclear) and each Participant\u2019s account is also identified. The system uses the global certificate\u2019s identification number to keep track of transfers and ownership of the relevant securities. The universal depository issues computer-generated position listing reports indicating the position of the relevant Participant in the global certificate and the amount thereof. Final investors\u2019 position on their securities is usually evidenced by account statements issued by one of the Participants or intermediaries. It is disputed between the Parties whether the use of such central depository systems creates different categories of holders or owners of the relevant categories (see \u00a7\u00a7 374, 411, 415 below).\n\n21.\n\nThe final investor can be anyone and anything from hedge funds, pension funds, central banks, to individuals. With respect to the investor, a distinction is made between \"institutional\" and \"retail\" investors.\n\n22.\n\n\"Institutional investors\" are those that are themselves institutions.\n\n23.\n\n\"Retail investors\" are those who are individuals, investing on their own behalf. A bond issued sold to \"retail\" means, thus, the bond issued is sold to an individual investor. Retail investors who are less-wealthy individuals prefer the certainty of investing in fixed-income bonds to the greater volatility of the stock market. Such retail investors tend to be \"buy and hold\" investors who buy the bond and hold it until maturity. Consequently, \"buy and hold\" investors trade little.\n\n24.\n\nA \"retail bank\" is referred to when a bank purchases bonds from the larger banks which typically serves as underwriters and sells bonds to individual investors, usually through its branch networks.\n\n25.\n\n*(iii) The Bond Market.* The bond market can be divided into a \"primary market\" and a \"secondary market.\"\n\n- The \"primary market\" is defined as the market for newly issued bonds.\n\n- The \"secondary market\" is defined as the market where previously issued securities are bought and sold.\n\n26.\n\nThus, the distinguishing difference between the two markets is that in the \"primary market,\" the money for the bonds is received by the issuer of the bonds from an investor, in principle the Underwriters, whereas in the \"secondary market,\" the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor.\n\n27.\n\n*(iv) Rating of Bonds.* Usually, bonds issues are rated by agencies expressing an opinion as to the creditworthiness of bonds. One of the most important rating agencies is Moody\u2019s Investor Services (hereinafter \"Moody\u2019s\") assigning a rating on a scale from AAA to C. Another important rating agency is Standard & Poor\u2019s, using a rating scale from AAA to D. The rating scales are based on the probability of default by the issuer in question.\n\n**(2) General Overview on Sovereign Debt Restructuring**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\n*(i) Sovereign Default.* The reason for a State to engage in sovereign debt restructuring is the default of the State on its sovereign debt. In this connection, the Tribunal refers to the description of sovereign default as defined by Standard & Poor\u2019s:3\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s generally defines default as the failure to meet a principal or interest payment on the due date (or within the specified grace period) contained in the original terms of a debt issue.\n\nQuestion can arise, however, when applying this definition in different situations and to different types of sovereign obligations. Standard & Poor\u2019s considers a sovereign to be in default under any of the following circumstances:\n\nFor local and foreign currency bonds, notes, and bills issued by the central government and held outside the public sector of the country, a sovereign default occurs when the central government either fails to pay scheduled debt service on the due date or tenders an exchange offer of new debt with less-favorable terms than the original issue. While a central government\u2019s failure to service debt owed to public sector entities, to meet a lease or other nondebt obligation, or to pay on a guarantee may be indicative of significant political/economic stress and imminent default, such an event in and of itself does not constitute a sovereign default. If a debt issue is rated on the basis of payment of one of these nondebt financial obligations and the sovereign\u2019s failure to pay results in a default on the rated issue, the rating of that specific issue will fall to \u2018D\u2019.\n\nFor local currency issued by the central bank, a sovereign default takes place when notes are converted into a new currency of less than equivalent face value.\n\nFor private sector bank loans incurred by the central government, a sovereign default occurs when the central government either fails to pay scheduled debt service on the due date, or negotiates with the bank creditors a rescheduling of principal and/or interest at less-favorable terms than in the original loan. Such rescheduling agreements covering short- and long-term bank debt are considered defaults even where, for legal or regulatory reasons, creditors deem the rescheduling to be voluntary.\n\nIn some cases, rescheduled sovereign bank loans are ultimately extinguished at a discount from their original face value. Typically, such episodes involve exchange offers (such as those linked to the issuance of Brady bonds), debt/equity swaps related to government privatization programs, and/or buybacks for cash. Standard & Poor\u2019s considers such transactions as defaults when they feature less-favorable terms than the original obligation.\n\n[...]\n\nExh. C-127, p. 19; see also Pingle I, \u00a7 31.\n\n29.\n\n*(ii) Sovereign Debt Restructuring.* Sovereign debt restructuring has the aim of preserving the functioning of the defaulting State as well as the international financial system while equitably protecting the interests of the creditors.\n\n30.\n\nThe modem sovereign debt restructuring is rooted in the establishment of the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter \"IMF\") at the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944. According to its Articles of Agreement, the IMF is to \"[t]o promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements among members, and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.\"4 Thus, the IMF\u2019s purpose is, *inter alia,* to prevent sovereign defaults through monitoring and lending, including providing emergency loans intended to assist sovereigns to avoid default in a time of potential crisis.\n\nArticle 1\u00a7 3 of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.\n\n31.\n\nConsidering that the size of defaulting government debt has increased exceptionally while the IMF resources have expanded only slightly, it became clear that negotiating an agreement with the IMF is not a central part of modern sovereign debt restructuring anymore.\n\n32.\n\nRather, from the 1950s through the 1970s, the bigger part of lending to sovereigns was provided by other States or their agencies. The outcome was the establishment of the Paris Club in 1956, when Argentina agreed to meet its public creditors in Paris.\n\n33.\n\nThe Paris Club consists of a group of sovereign lenders \"whose role is to find coordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor countries.\"5 The Paris Club considers itself as a \"non institution,\" remaining strictly informal. However, its work is based on a number of rules and principles agreed by the creditor States in order to facilitate the decision making process and the conclusion of agreements between the member States of the Paris Club and the debtor State.6\n\nhttp://www.clubdeparis.org/\n\n*Ibid.* ; http://www.imf.org/extemal/np/exr/facts/groups.htm.\n\n34.\n\nThe principles of the Paris Club are summarized as follows: (i) decision making on a case-by-case basis; (ii) consensus among the participating creditor States; (iii) conditionality upon the debtor State providing a precise description of its economic and financial situation, that it has implemented and is committed to implement reforms to restore its economic and financial situation, and that it has demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program; (iv) solidarity among the creditor States of the Paris Club to agree to act as a group in their dealings with a given debtor State; and (v) comparability of treatment, i.e., that a debtor State in agreement with its Paris Club creditor States should not accept from its non-Paris Club creditors terms of treatment of its debt less favorable to the debtor than those agreed with the Paris Club.7\n\nhttp://www.clubdeparis.org. See also Pingle I, \u00a7 83 and Slaughter & Burke-White I, \u00a7 22.\n\n35.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the nature of sovereign borrowing changed to \"emerging market debt,\" and ultimately led to the establishment of the London Club, given that the effectiveness of the Paris Club was limited in this market sector. The emerging debt market was rooted in flows of private capital from larger banks in developed, high-income States, which sought to take advantage of the higher interest rates available through loans to sovereigns in the developing world. Introduced by the Baker Plan, named after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, both debtors and creditors understood that funding from international financial institutions depended on a rescheduling agreement with private creditors, i.e., commercial bank lending.\n\n36.\n\nGenerally, a debtor initiates a process in which a London Club \"Advisory Committee\" is formed, which is chaired by a leading financial firm and includes representatives from other exposed firms. Upon signing of a restructuring agreement, the Advisory Committee is dissolved.8 Such restructuring agreement is based on three principles: (i) case-by-case approach, (ii) voluntary participation of the borrowing banks, and (iii) restructuring designed based on the market situation.9\n\nhttp ://www. imf.org/externaPnp/exr/facts/groups.htm.\n\nSee also Pingle I, \u00a7 88 and Slaughter & Burke-White I, \u00a7 25 referring to Lex Rieffel, *Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Case For Ad Hoc Machinery* 27-29 (2003), \u00a7 108.\n\n37.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, caused by the substantial issuing of Brady Bonds, mentioned in \u00b6 15 above, the vast majority of sovereign borrowing from private sources came from bond issues by sovereign States. In the light of the ever growing number of holders of interests in or under a sovereign bond, the closed negotiating framework of the Paris and London Clubs showed its limits.10 Thus, a new mechanism was developed in the form of an \"exchange offer.\"\n\nSlaughter & Burke-White I, \u00a7 29 *et seq.:* Pingle I, \u00a7 96.\n\n38.\n\nWhile many elements of an exchange offer are disputed between the Parties, they do seem to agree on the main object of an exchange offer, which may be summarized as follows: In an exchange offer, the sovereign facing default develops a new issue of bonds that are within the sovereign\u2019s ability to pay and acceptable to most bond holders and offers such new bonds in exchange for the old bonds in the hope of securing the acceptance of a supermajority of the bondholders.\n\n39.\n\nAlthough the Parties agree that the terms and conditions of an exchange offer should ideally aim to ensure an equitable balance between the interests of the sovereign in restructuring its debt according to its payment abilities and the interests of the creditors, they disagree on how and when such aim is best achieved.\n\n40.\n\nCurrently, there exists no formal legal framework establishing precise steps to be followed by the defaulting sovereign or the creditors. Nevertheless, an informal regime has developed consisting of the following principles: (i) sovereign to signal the need of debt restructure; (ii) communication between the sovereign and the creditors; (iii) consensus and consent on the terms of the restructure; and (iv) equitable burden sharing.11\n\nSlaughter & Burke-White I, \u00a7\u00a7 42 *et seq.* and \u00a7\u00a7 87 *et seq.* referring to a proposal of the IMF.\n\n41.\n\nRemaining inefficiencies in the sovereign restructuring practices, in particular with regard to the risk created by holdout creditors, continue to trigger a series of proposals for improvements. Existing proposals include the creation of an international bankruptcy mechanism modelled on U.S. domestic bankruptcy law, or the development of contractual \"collective action clause\" to be included in bonds in order to bind a holdout minority to new payment terms agreed upon by a supermajority of bondholders.12\n\nSee Slaughter & Burke-White I, \u00a7\u00a7 87 *et seq.* and \u00a7\u00a7 90-91 referring with regard to collective action clauses to a report of the IMF encouraging such clauses (report available on http ://www. imf, org/externaFnp/g22/ifcrep.pdf).\n\n**(3) Argentina\u2019s Restructuring of Its Economy and Its Debt in relation to Bonds**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nAfter having laid down the basic concepts necessary to understand the general context of the dispute, the present section focuses on the economic context prevailing in Argentina preceding, during and following the issuance of the bonds at stake in the present dispute.\n\n*(a) Argentina\u2019s Restructuring of Its Economy in the 1990s*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn the 1990s, following the 1980s debt crisis, Argentina embarked on an ambitious effort to restructure its economy in order to encourage growth and reduce debt and inflation by deregulating its economy and privatizing certain industries. Argentina\u2019s Convertibility Plan of 1991 was part of the strategy aimed at addressing inflation, by pegging the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar and limiting the printing of additional currency to an amount necessary to purchase surpluses of U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market.\n\n44.\n\n*(i) Issuing of Sovereign Bonds.* Issuing sovereign bonds was one of the pillars of restructuring Argentina\u2019s economy in the early 1990s. Thus, on 29 October 1992, Law No. 24,156, the Law on Financial Administration and Control Systems (hereinafter \"LFA\") was enacted,13 being the legal foundation for Argentina to issue bonds. It contains several requirements as described below:14\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorization: Either a specific law authorizes the loan, or the loan is included in a general authorization contained in the annual budget law. The relevant law may authorize either the Executive or the Secretary of the Treasury to execute relevant transactions. The annual budget law shall specify the type of debt, the maximum amount authorized for the transaction, the minimum repayment schedule, and the purpose of the financing.15\n\n\u2022 Executive Decision: An executive decision (called a \"Decree\") is issued to approve the debt transaction specifically or to authorize the Ministry of Economy or the Secretary of the Treasury to execute transactions up to a certain amount. Alternatively, the enabling law may authorize the Ministry of Economy or the Secretary of the Treasury directly to enter into sovereign debt transactions.\n\n\u2022 Central Bank opinion: The Central Bank issues an opinion as required by Article 61 of the LFA concerning the impact of the debt on Argentina\u2019s balance of payments.16\n\n\u2022 Intervention of the National Office of Public Credit: This office certifies that the amount of the sovereign debt transaction is within the limits provided by the relevant budget law, and thus complies with Article 60 of the LFA that provides that Government agencies cannot execute debt transactions that are not authorized by the General Budget Law of the respective year or in another specific law.17\n\n\u2022 Approval of the terms and conditions: A decision of the Ministry of Economy or of the Secretary of the Treasury approves the terms and conditions of the bonds, including the subscription agreement, the paying agency agreement, and the prospectus, and authorizes a Government officer to execute the appropriate documentation.\n\n\u2022 Legal opinion by the *Procuration de Tesoro* or the Legal Office of the Ministry of Economy: The *Procuration de Tesoro* or, as the case may be, the Legal Office issues an opinion on the validity of the transaction at stake and certain other requirements. This opinion represents the official position of the Argentine State on the issue.\n\nExit. CLA-ARG-297.\n\nSee Mairal I, \u00a7 \u00a7 39-44. These requirements are not disputed by Respondent.\n\nArticle 60 LFA.\n\nExh. CLA-ARG-297.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n45.\n\nIn addition to enacting a series of laws and decrees, Argentina also implemented various programs facilitating issuing sovereign bonds.\n\n46.\n\nIn particular, in order to raise capital, Argentina implemented the Brady Bond program and started issuing Brady Bonds in early 1993.\n\n47.\n\nArgentina intended to develop a diversified market by issuing bonds in the international financial markets.\n\n48.\n\nThe process of Argentina issuing bonds in Europe was by relying on large investment banks as its lead managers, which studied the markets and competed with each other for Argentina\u2019s business. Argentina\u2019s choice of its lead managers were investment banks such as BNP Paribas, CS First Boston, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley. Thereafter, banking syndicates were established to underwrite and distribute differing volumes of bonds, depending on the underwriters\u2019 status in the syndicate.\n\n49.\n\nThe lead managers would design, together with Argentina, a general bond issuance strategy. Based thereon, they would then suggest to Argentina which commercial banks would participate as co-managers, based, namely, on their ability to reach investors with a profile fitting the bond issuance strategy. In this respect, while it is not disputed that Argentina participated in marketing efforts to banks and large institutional purchasers, the Parties disagree whether Argentina\u2019s bond issuance strategy targeted the Italian retail market, as submitted by Claimants.\n\n50.\n\nIn total, from 1991 through 2001, Argentina placed over US$ 186.7 billion in sovereign bonds across both domestic and international capital markets.18 This included 179 bonds issued in the international capital markets that raised a total of approximately US$ 139.4 billion, of which 37% were denominated in US$, 22% were denominated in Euros, 11% were denominated in Yen, 11% were denominated in Deutsche Mark, 7% were denominated in Italian Lira, 3% in Argentine Pesos and 9% in other currencies.19 Out of the 179 bonds issued by Argentina, 173 were denominated in foreign currencies; six were denominated in Argentine Pesos. Claimants allegedly purchased 83 of the 173 foreign currency bonds.20\n\nCottani I, \u00a7 22, referring to Chart \"All Argentine External Bonds, 1991-2001,\" derived from Bloomberg and Ministry of Economy, \"Titulos Publicos Emitidos en Moneda Nacional\" and \"Titulos Publicos Emitidos en Moneda Extranjera\" (Charts of Argentine Government Bonds in Domestic and Foreign Currency), 31 December 2001. See also R-MJ \u00a7 11, and Exh. RE-195.\n\nNavigant I, Table 2; see also C-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 117-118.\n\nCottani I, \u00a7 22, See also R-MJ \u00a7 11, and Exh. RE-195.\n\n51.\n\nThe 83 bonds allegedly purchased by Claimants are governed by the laws of different jurisdictions, were issued in different currencies, and listed on various international exchanges, such as Buenos Aires, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Milan, Munich, and Vienna. These bonds generally paid a fixed coupon with the final maturity varying from three to thirty years.21\n\nHardie I, \u00a7 19; Cremieux, \u00a7\u00a7 9 *et seq.*\n\n*(b) Argentina\u2019s Financial Crisis and Default of 2001*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Argentina began to suffer a severe economic recession and consequent reduction of fiscal revenues, leading Argentina to incur additional debt.22\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 20.\n\n53.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the specific causes of this recession. Respondent emphasizes external factors such as the Asian, Russian and Brazilian financial crises in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively; the raising of interest rates in the US; the appreciation of the US dollar from 1995 to 1999 affecting export prices; etc.23 In contrast, Claimants invoke failures on Argentina\u2019s side as important factors leading to the recession.24\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 7 *et seq.* and 13 *et seq.*\n\nC-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 108 et seq.\n\n54.\n\nThese adverse economic developments reflected mainly in two ways on the Argentine economy:\n\n(i) Substantial \"capital flight\": Many businesses and individuals fearing a devaluation of the peso started to withdraw money from the Argentine banking system. By the end of 2001, those withdrawals allegedly amounted to approximately US$ 15 billion,25 endangering the entire banking system and forcing Argentina\u2019s central bank to expend substantial parts of its international reserve to defend the value of the peso, and forcing the Government to introduce restrictions on the withdrawal of bank deposits.\n\n(ii) Decrease of capital inflow: As a result of a loss of confidence in the Argentine economy, capital inflows from foreign direct investment declined significantly.26\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 16, Ex. RE-132.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 17.\n\n55.\n\nAs the need for debt relief became clear, Argentina took in 2001 various measures in an attempt to restructure its economy and lighten its debt. Such measures included cutting both federal and provincial government spending, adopting a zero-deficit law, improving its tax administration system, and supporting competition with tax cuts for exporters, as well as global exchange offers in February, June and November 2001.27\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, and \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, see also Exh. RE-195, RF-26.\n\n56.\n\nThese efforts apparently did not suffice to redress the situation. By December 2001, Argentina had allegedly come to a point where it was unable to avoid deferring interest and principal payments on all of its external bond debt owed to both foreign and Argentine creditors.28\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 24.\n\n57.\n\nThese economic difficulties were accompanied by considerable political and social unrests, leading eventually to the resignation of the then President Fernando de la Rua and his entire cabinet on 19 December 2001.\n\n58.\n\nOn 23 December 2001, Argentina defaulted by publicly announcing the deferral of over US$ 100 billion of external bond debt owed to both non-Argentine and Argentine creditors.29\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7 66.\n\n*(c) The Events following Argentina\u2019s Default of 2001*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nAfter President de la Rua\u2019s resignation of 19 December 2001, various difficult attempts to appoint a new president were made. On 1 January 2002, Congress eventually elected Mr. Eduardo Duhalde as President.\n\n60.\n\nIn January 2002, Congress declared a public emergency in social, economic, administrative, financial and exchange matters with the passage of the Public Emergency and Reform Law of 2002 (the \"Emergency Law\").30 The Emergency Law, among other things, terminated the parity between the peso and the dollar. This \"pesification\" was followed by a substantial devaluation of the peso.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 30.\n\n61.\n\nThe effects of the economic crisis on ordinary Argentine citizens were devastating. According to Argentina, by May 2002, unemployment had reached 21.5%, an 8% increase over 1998, the year the crisis began. Another 19% of the population was underemployed.

This led Argentina to envisage the restructuring of its foreign debt.\n\n63.\n\nBased on figures produced by Respondent, by the end of 2002, Argentina\u2019s total public debt burden was approximately US$ 137 billion, representing approximately 130% of its GDP in 2002, and among which approximately US$ 76 billion was owed to resident and non-resident public bondholders.32\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 33.\n\n64.\n\nIn relation to the restructuring of its foreign debt, according to figures brought forward by Respondent in 2003 and relied upon by Claimants, more than US$ 27.5 billion worth of bonds were held by European bondholders, of which approximately US$ 22.2 billion were held by retail bondholders, including US$ 13.5 billion owned by Italian bondholders (approximately 600,000 persons).33\n\nCottani I, \u00a7 46, referring to the presentation of the Secretariat of Finance, Ministry of Economy and Production \"Argentina - From Stabilization to Economic Growth\" of August 2003 at: http://www.argentinedebtinfo.gov.ar/docmnentos/emope presentation english august.pdf.\n\n65.\n\nOn 18 September 2002, pursuant to a resolution of the Executive Committee of the Italian Banking Association (hereinafter \"ABI\"), eight major Italian banks (Banca Antonveneta, Banca Intesa, Banca Sella, BNL, Iccrea Banca, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, San Paolo, and UniCredito) established *l'Associazione per la Tutela degli Investitori in Titoli Argentini* or \"Task Force Argentina\" or \"TFA\" in Rome (see \u00a7 4 above).

RE-137.\n\n71.\n\nOn 22 September 2003, Argentina presented an initial debt restructuring strategy known as the \"Dubai Proposal,\" focusing on the objective of obtaining a reduction in the face value of the unrestructured debt:40\n\n\"[...]\n\nWe also have to ensure liquidity with a new maturity profile in line with Argentina\u2019s real repayment capacity.\n\nFinally, although our decision is not to increase Argentina\u2019s debt, but to reduce it, we have to facilitate a responsible return to the capital markets to ensure compliance with the commitments assumed under the restructuring.\n\n[...]\n\nThe debt to be restructured i[s] defined as \"eligible debt\". It includes all the bonds issued before the cutoff date, December 31, 2001. To have an idea of the size and complexity of Argentina\u2019s debt, the eligible debt encompasses 152 different bonds, issued originally in 14 different currencies, which have been reduced to seven thanks to the Euro, and subject to eight different legislations.\n\n[...]\n\nUndoubtedly, our proposal must be based on Argentina\u2019s repayment capacity in the medium and long term.\n\nThe bond swap and the amendment of the issuance conditions, in the cases in which such amendment is possible, will take place simultaneously. The menu will include comparable bonds, equivalent in terms of present value.\n\n[...]\n\nWe would like to make clear again that there will be no discrimination among bondholders.\n\n[...]\n\nSumming up, we want to have a smaller number of bonds, a smaller number of currencies and jurisdictions so that the resulting bonds may have a higher liquidity.\n\n[...]\n\nThe new bonds will be: Discount bonds, whose value evidences the haircut in the face value; Par bonds, which suffer no face value reduction or a small face value reduction, but that offer coupons and longer payment terms; and last of all Capitalized Bonds. Our offer will also include different alternatives for such bonds, with coupons including a lower fixed interest rate coupled with a variable rate indexed on the basis of the growth of Argentina\u2019s GDP. These indexed bonds reflect our intention to share the benefits of increased growth in the medium term and to pay a lower interest rate flow in the case of possible slowdowns of or drops in Argentina\u2019s GDP. It seems to be a reasonable option since nobody knows which Argentina\u2019s economy growth rate will be in, let\u2019s say, five or ten years.\n\n[...]\"\n\nExh.

The Exchange Offer 2005 provided to the beneficial owners of the roughly US$ 81.8 billion in eligible outstanding debt a choice of options from which to choose the form of their new debt. The bondholders could choose par bonds with the same principal but a lower interest rate than the non-performing debt, discount bonds with reduced principal but a higher interest rate, or quasi-par bonds with a principal and interest rate falling between the two other bond options.

and mutually beneficial way through negotiations....\"\n\n\u2022 February 3, 2005 GCAB press release condemning Minister Lavagna\u2019s announcement of a proposed law that would prohibit any future offer to bondholders who did not accept the current exchange offer commenced by Argentina on January 12, 2005, and stating that this proposal \"ignores the various international legal systems under which the defaulted debt was issued\", and that \"Congressional action in Argentina will not supersede rights under international law.\"\n\nIn addition to such meetings and correspondence, GCAB delivered presentations at several meetings with creditors of Argentina, at which representatives of Argentina were present, setting forth our position concerning a strategy for resolving the dispute between Argentina and the bondholders/creditors. Additionally, GCAB notified representatives of Argentina that we did not \"endorse Argentina\u2019s current unilateral offer, and [were] evaluating all other options, not excluding litigation, to protect investors\u2019 rights.\" Despite our clear warnings, our communicated disapproval of Argentina\u2019s strategy of avoidance and our repeated efforts to negotiate illustrated by the communications listed above, Argentina continues to refuse to negotiate with us in good faith.\n\nGiven that Argentina has steadfastly failed to negotiate with us, and has defaulted on and expropriated the bonds of our constituents, we are left with little choice. Accordingly, we hereby provide you final notice that:\n\nwe and TFA bondholders remain unsatisfied with Argentina\u2019s refusal to negotiate in good faith as we fully contemplated you would under Article 8 of the Bilateral Investment Agreement; and\n\nArgentina has sixty (60) days from receipt of this correspondence to pay the monies it owes to the hundreds of thousands of Italian bondholders/creditors TFA represents.\n\nIf Argentina fails to resolve the dispute amicably and pay within sixty (60) days, the TFA bondholders will have no choice but to commence legal proceedings against Argentina in one or more appropriate for a ([.sic]) to recover the amounts due. On behalf of the TFA bondholders, who are Italian nationals not domiciled in Argentina, and who acquired their bonds prior to Argentina\u2019s default, we hereby accept the offer of consent, expressed by Argentina in Article 8 of the Bilateral Investment Agreement, to submit the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.\n\nIf Argentina refuses to resolve the dispute amicably, we invite you to contact me and/or counsel for the anticipated litigation, Carolyn Lamm of White & Case LLP, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding on an agreed procedure that would facilitate the resolution of the hundreds of thousands of TFA bondholder claims in the most expeditious way for all parties.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAssociazione TASK FORCE ARGENTINA (TFA)\n\n(signed)\n\nNicola Stock\"\n\nExh. C-418.\n\n85.\n\nUnsatisfied with the situation, TFA seriously considered the initiation of an ICSID arbitration against Argentina. For this purpose and in order to be able to represent the concerned Italian bondholders, a new mandate (so-called \"TFA Mandate Package\") was designed by TFA in and consisting of the following documents:\n\n- A Letter of Instructions to Bondholders (\"TFA Instruction Letter\"), explaining the object and modalities of the ICSID arbitration and setting forth instructions for the bondholders how to participate.61\n\n- A Declaration of Consent, Delegation of Authority, and Power of Attorney (\"Power of Attorney\"), in favor of White & Case.62\n\n- A Grant of Mandate to TFA (\"TFA Mandate\"), in which the signatory mandates TFA to act as coordinator of the ICSID arbitration.63\n\n- A questionnaire, seeking information and documents related to nationality and ownership of the bonds.64\n\n- Additional instructions regarding gathering of documents.65\n\nExh. RA-1.\n\nExh. RA-3.\n\nExh. RA-2.\n\nExh. RA-4.\n\nExh. RA-7.\n\n86.\n\nIn the TFA Instruction Letter, in addition to the specific instructions on how to participate in the ICSID proceedings, TFA set forth some basic rules of conduct for the bondholders. In particular it provided that:\n\n\"8. SOME RULES OF THE LEGAL ACTION PLANNED BY TFA THAT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND\n\nIn keeping with the transparency that has always been a hallmark of TFA\u2019s activities to protect Italian bondholders, we wish to highlight some basic rules that the conduct of the ICSID arbitration on behalf of numerous Italian Investors makes it necessary to impose on all of you.\n\nFirst of all, the ICSID arbitration is available only to persons who qualify as \"investors\", that is, to persons who can demonstrate that they purchased and have title to Argentine bonds. Failure to meet this requirement would not only jeopardize the position of the individual participant in the initiative, but could endanger the success of the legal proceeding for the other bondholders as well. It is therefore evident that, for anyone who intends to initiate the ICSID arbitration, it will not be possible to bring a legal action in Italy against the credit institution that sold the bonds to them and at the same time demand the right to continue the proceedings before ICSID; likewise, those who have already filed a claim against their banks may not participate in the ICSID arbitration. Indeed, a final judgment issued by an Italian court of last resort declaring null and void or voiding the agreement for the purchase of the security would cause your status as an investor to cease to exist, whereas such status is indispensable to bring an ICSID arbitration.\n\nDoes this mean that participating in the ICSID arbitration will prevent you from suing the credit institutions at a later day ? Not at all! Anyone who wants to change his/her mind and abandon the ICSID arbitration can do so freely: it will be sufficient to withdraw from the ICSID proceeding, revoke White & Case\u2019s power of attorney *ad litem* and TFA\u2019s mandate in order to initiate whatever legal proceedings is deemed most appropriate. **It is not possible, however, to conduct at the same time two different legal proceedings that are incoherent with one another.**\n\nFinally, we note that the proceedings before ICSID will not toll the running of the statute of limitations to bring your claims, if any, against the banks.\n\n[...]\n\nThe peculiarity and complexity of the case to be presented before ICSID on behalf of TFA make it necessary, for reasons of coherence and uniformity of the representation of all Italian bondholders, to have a single attorney in the proceedings (White & Case) and that the latter have a single interlocutor (TFA). This also requires compliance with certain rules that make it possible for the representation of bondholders, taken as a group, to remain logical and coherent. Accordingly:\n\n(a) it will not be possible to give instructions directly to the attorneys at \"White & Case\" (or the Italian lawyers at \"Grimaldi e Associati\", who will act solely as TFA\u2019s out of court advisors): they will coordinate directly with TFA, which, as mentioned before, will act as your sole agent;\n\n(b) in lum [sic], TFA, acting in the collective interest of all bondholders, will operate autonomously, taking into consideration their general interest without being able to adopt different conducts for each or only some of the various bondholders at their request;\n\n(c) nor will it be possible to conduct autonomously the proceeding initiated jointly with all the bondholders; accordingly, any revocation of TFA\u2019s mandate or of the power of attorney *ad litem* of the American lawyers must necessarily be preceded by withdrawal from the ICSID proceeding; in other words, it will not be possible to revoke TFA\u2019s mandate so as to deal individually with your American lawyer or to appoint other agents. Revoking the mandate or the power of attorney without having previously withdrawn from the proceeding will result in renunciation of the mandates received by TFA and \"White & Case\", respectively.\n\n[...]\"\n\n(Emphasis in the original)\n\n87.\n\nIn the Power of Attorney, the signatory makes the following declarations and statements:\n\n\"Each of the Undersigned [... ]\n\nhereby [...]\n\n1. Declares that he/she owns the following bonds issued by the Argentine Republic, as described on Tab 1.\n\n2. Declares his/her irrevocable consent to submit, jointly with other similarly situated bondholders, the dispute arising under the [...] [BIT] due to the nonpayment by the Argentine Republic [...] of amounts owed under the above-mentioned bonds, including inter aha, the full face amount of the bonds plus interest, fees and damages, for settlement by arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") in Washington [...], and/or other related litigation outside Italy to assert claims and/or enforce rights of the Undersigned arising as a result of the non-payment of the Argentine bonds. The Undersigned further declares his/her acceptance of the Argentina\u2019s offer of consent to ICSID jurisdiction, which is contained in Article 8 of the Agreement [ie the BIT], as of January 1, 2006 and reconfirms any such acceptance and notification of the dispute previously provided. The Undersigned\u2019s consent also covers such other actions that may be deemed necessary or useful to pursue the Undersigned\u2019s rights in this dispute.\n\nDelegates to the law firm of White & Case LLP [...], in particular Carolyn B.

Such delegation of authority and power of attorney includes without limitation the authority and power:\n\n(i) to accept Argentina\u2019s offer of consent to ICSID arbitration under the Agreement, as of January 1, 2006, and to reconfirm any such consent and/or notice of dispute previously provided;\n\n(ii) to initiate and conduct for the Undersigned and on his/her behalf an ICSID arbitration against Argentina and any related litigation or other proceedings outside Italy to protect and further the Undersigned\u2019s interests in relation to the above-mentioned dispute.\n\n[...]\n\nFurther instructions regarding this delegation may be made from time to time by any duly appointed agent of the Undersigned.\n\n1. Acknowledges and agrees that this power of attorney is conferred pursuant to the laws of the District of Columbia to lawyers practicing in the District of Columbia, [...]\"\n\n88.\n\nIn the TFA Mandate, the object of TFA\u2019s mandate is described as follows:66\n\n**\"OBJECT**\n\nSubject to all legal requirements that may from time to time be applicable, the Agent is hereby entrusted with the assignment of providing for the coordination of any arbitral and judicial proceedings of the kind described in the premises hereto that may be undertaken in the name and on behalf of the holders of Bonds pursuant to the Power of Attorney and this Mandate, for the recovery of their investment in the Bonds. In particular, and solely by way of examples, it shall be the Agent\u2019s responsibility:\n\n- to give to the attorneys appointed pursuant to the Power of Attorney any instructions that the Agent, in its role as coordinator, deems useful or appropriate for the purpose of bringing about a positive outcome of the proceedings;\n\n- to appoint other attorneys directly, in addition to es [sic!] replacements for those appointed pursuant to the Power of Attorney, so that they may represent the Principals in proceedings filed outside Italy, in judicial or other venue, including, but not limited to, ICSID arbitral tribunals;\n\n- to revoke the mandates granted to the attorneys identified in the Power of attorney and those appointed pursuant to the preceding paragraph. Accordingly, consistently with the Agent\u2019s role as sole coordinator of legal proceedings commenced by the Agent, it is understood that the Principal(s) may revoke the powers of attorney *ad litem* granted to the above-mentioned attorneys only through the Agent, by instructing it in writing to that effect;\n\n- to perform organizational functions entrusted to it using the Italian banking system or any other means that may be necessary or appropriate for the initiation and conduct of the legal proceedings described in the Power of Attorney and this Mandate. [... ]\n\n- to appoint arbitrators, experts and advisors;\n\n- if it deems it appropriate, to bring against Argentina, outside Italia, in judicial venues having jurisdiction, or before domestic or international arbitral tribunals, or before any conciliation and mediation body, any additional proceeding that may be necessary for the purposes of obtaining reimbursement of principal and payment of interest on the Bonds, or proceedings seeking damages arising out of the failure to comply with the Bonds, or out of the measures adopted by the Argentine Authorities;\n\n- to negotiate and enter into settlement agreements with Argentina, in judicial venues or otherwise, [...]\n\n- to participate in any type of bondholders\u2019 meeting or similar collective decision-making body and to vote in the name and on behalf of the Principal(s);\n\n- to send any communication or notice on behalf of the Principal(s), in order to toll the running of the statute of limitation or other time limits, in relation to the Republic of Argentina, [...];\n\n- to collect on behalf of the Principal(s) the payments received from Argentina and to transfer them through the credit institutions serving as depositaries for the Bonds to the current accounts that will be specified by the Principal(s);\n\n- to obtain recognition and enforcement outside Italy of the arbitration awards issued by the ICSID arbitral tribunal - as well as of any other awards or judgments that may be issued by any adjudicating body outside Italy with respect to the object of this Mandate\n\n- to withdraw from any actions in any legal proceedings contemplated by the Power of Attorney and/or this Mandate, in the name and on behalf of all bondholders who have granted an identical power of attorney *ad litem* and an identical mandate, or to withdraw from any actions in the name and on behalf of the Principal(s), in any of the instances described in Article 4 below;\n\n- to arrange for the banks serving as depositaries for the Bonds to subject the same to transfer restrictions; [...]\n\n- in general, to take any step that it deems useful for the recovery of the amounts due under the Bonds, subject always, as an absolute priority, to equal treatment of all of the owners of bonds issued by Argentina who have signed an identical power of attorney or attorney *ad litem* and an identical mandate.\"\n\nExh. RA-2.\n\n89.\n\nThe TFA Mandate further provides for following terms and conditions of revocation:\n\n**\"EXCLUSIVITY, REVOCATION AND RENUNCIATION**\n\nPrincipal also grants this Mandate in the interest of all of the other bondholders who have granted an identical power of attorney *ad litem* and an identical mandate; such interest arises out of the need to coordinate the arbitral and judicial proceedings mentioned in the premises hereto. Accordingly:\n\n(i) This Mandate, pursuant to Article 1723 of the Civil Code, will not terminate if revoked by the Principal(s), unless there exists a just cause for such revocation; such revocation will become effective upon expiration of the fifteen day period following the time when the Agent became aware of the same;\n\n(ii) even in the absence of just cause, the Principal(s) may validly revoke this Mandate if he/they has/have previously withdrawn from every judicial and arbitral proceeding referred to in the premises hereto which are pending at the time of such revocation; such revocation will become effective upon expiration of the fifteen day period following the time when the Agent became aware of the same;\n\n(iii) if the Principal(s) should initiate any legal action conflicting with the interests pursued by TFA on behalf of all of the bondholders who have granted an identical power of attorney *ad litem* and an identical mandate, by means of any legal proceedings contemplated by this Mandate or the Power of Attorney, with particular reference to the consolidated proceeding before the ICSID: (a) White & Case, as specified in the Instructions to Bondholders, may without any notice whatsoever renounce the mandate granted to them by means of the Power of Attorney; (b) the Agent may renounce this Madate;\n\n[...]\n\n(v) if the Principal(s) revoke the Power of Attorney without the prior agreement of the Agent, the Agent may renounce this Mandate.\n\nIn any event, the Agent shall have the right to renounce this Madate at any time, by giving at least fifteen (15) business days written notice to the Principal(s).\n\n[...]\"\n\n(Emphasis in the original)\n\n90.\n\nTFA\u2019s member banks arranged for the distribution and collection of the Mandate Package among their clients during March and April 2006, which was - according to Claimants\u2019 figures - accepted by over 180,000 Italian bondholders.67\n\nC-MJ \u00a7 261, see also Navigant I, \u00a7 27 and Cremieux, \u00a7 22.\n\n91.\n\nOn 14 September 2006, White & Case filed the Request for Arbitration with ICSID on behalf of these Italian bondholders, Claimants to the present arbitration.\n\n**(5) New Exchange Offer 2010**\n-------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nIn April 2010, Respondent announced the launching of a new Exchange Offer (hereinafter the \"Exchange Offer 2010\").\n\n93.\n\nThis offer was launched on 3 May 2010 and aimed to \"restructure and cancel defaulted debt obligations of Argentina represented by Pre-2005 Eligible Securities, to release Argentina from any related claims, including any administrative, litigation or arbitral claims and to terminate legal proceedings against Argentina in respect of the tendered Eligible Securities in consideration for the issuance of New Securities and, in certain cases, a cash payment.\"68\n\nSee Exchange Offer Prospectus (Exh. C-999B), p. 6; see also Annex A to R-PHB \u00a7 76.\n\n94.\n\nIn this offer, Respondent invited \"the Owners of each Series of Bonds listed in Annexes A-l and A-2 and related claims (collectively, the \u2018Eligible Securities\u2019) to submit offers to exchange Eligible Securities for New Securities and, in certain cases, cash, on the terms and conditions described [t]herein.\"69 The bonds listed in Annexes A-l and A-2 are bonds in which Claimants hold security entitlements, and Claimants were thus eligible to tender into this Exchange Offer 2010.\n\n*Idem*\n\n95.\n\nThe launching of this Exchange Offer 2010 required the temporary suspension of certain effects of the Emergency Law until the earlier of two dates - 31 December 2010 or the date on which the Executive Branch, through the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, announces the conclusion of the second restructuring process of Argentina\u2019s nonperforming debt securities.70 In addition, Argentina further took administrative and legislative steps in connection with the Exchange Offer 2010, approving the budget providing the amount of debt that Argentina may issue, namely through the Exchange Offer 2010, and authorizing the necessary administrative registrations and issuance of new securities, etc.71\n\nSee Annex A to R-PHB \u00a7 79.\n\nSee Annex A to R-PHB \u00a7 80.\n\n96.\n\nWhilst in Claimants\u2019 view this Exchange Offer 2010 was just another punitive offer imposing harsh exchange terms,72 even less favorable than the Exchange Offer 2005, Respondent contends that it merely reflected the result of adequate consultations with creditors\u2019 groups.73\n\nCL-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 139 *et seq.,* \u00a7 144.\n\nAnnex A to R-PHB \u00a7 76.\n\n97.\n\nA considerable number of Claimants eventually tendered into this Exchange Offer 2010, which led to their withdrawal from the present proceedings (see \u00a7\u00a7 216 *et seq.* below).\n\n**B. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n**(1) Request for Arbitration and its Registration by ICSID**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nOn 14 September 2006, Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration, accompanied by Annexes A through E.\n\n99.\n\nOn 26 September 2006, ICSID transmitted to Respondent the Request for Arbitration.\n\n100.\n\nOn 20 October 2006, Respondent sent a letter to ICSID requesting the latter not to register the case arguing that Claimants lack standing to sue and that the nature of this \"group claim\" entail Respondent\u2019s defense right. Respondent therefore concluded that ICSID has no jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n101.\n\nOn 20 November 2006, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter dated 20 October 2006 arguing that ICSID must register the case according to Article 36(3) ICSID Convention. It based its position on two legal opinions rendered by Prof. Christoph Schreuer and Prof. Rudolf Dolzer dated 2 and 16 November 2006, respectively.74\n\nSee letter from Prof. Christoph Schreuer of 2 November 2006 and letter from Prof. Rudolf Dolzer of 16 November 2006 both attached to Claimant\u2019s letter of 20 November 2006 addressed to the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n102.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 letter of 20 November 2006. Respondent again requested ICSID not to register the case alleging that ICSID lacks jurisdiction and that Respondent never consented to an arbitration concerning such kind of claims initiated by \"groups of people\" or \"class action.\"\n\n103.\n\nOn 19 and 22 December 2006, Claimants submitted supplemental Annexes in relation to information contained in Annexes A through E, and submitted Annexes K and L. The substitute annexes reflect: (i) an addition of certain Claimants (separately listed in Annex K), (ii) the withdrawal of certain Claimants (separately listed in Annex L), (iii) limited corrections and substitutions to the information on Claimants (Annexes A-E), (iv) the revision of the aggregate amounts (Annex I), and (v) the addition of one new bond series (Annex J).\n\n104.\n\nOn 6 January 2007, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 18 December 2006 insisting that ICISD register the case and arguing (i) that it is up to the Tribunal to decide on the jurisdiction, and (ii) that the claim at stake is not a \"class action\" but a joint claim in which each Claimant initiates arbitration on its own behalf, and therefore covered by ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n105.\n\nOn 24 January 2007, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 submissions of 19 and 22 December 2006 opposing the incorporation of new Claimants in the arbitration. According to Respondent, the changes made to the Request for Arbitration regarding the identity and number of Claimants is inadmissible. Further, Respondent reiterated its request that the case be refused registration.\n\n106.\n\nOn 1 February 2007, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 24 January 2007 insisting that the case be registered \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n107.\n\nOn 5 February 2007, Claimants submitted \"substituted versions\" of Annexes A through E, K, L, I and J. The substitute annexes reflect: (i) the withdrawal of certain Claimants (listed separately in Annex L), (ii) certain corrections and substitutions to the documentation for other Claimants, and (iii) the revision of certain aggregate amounts based on the foregoing adjustments (Annexes I and J).\n\n108.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, concluding that the dispute is not manifestly outside the jurisdiction of ICSID, the Secretary-General of the ICSID registered Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration with accompanying Annexes A through L, and issued the Notice of Registration.\n\n**(2) Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID invited the Parties to communicate any provisions agreed by them regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment.\n\n110.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, Claimants suggested that the arbitral tribunal be composed of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each Party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties, and appointed Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of The Netherlands, as arbitrator.\n\n111.\n\nOn 12 March 2007, ICSID confirmed receipt of Claimants\u2019 letter of 9 March 2007 and further stated that no further steps regarding the appointment of Prof, van den Berg could be taken until the Parties inform the Centre of their agreement regarding the method for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. It therefore invited Respondent to accept Claimants\u2019 proposals or make other proposals regarding the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n112.\n\nOn 27 April 2007, Claimants sent a letter to the ICSID informing that the Parties have not reached agreement on the method of constituting the Tribunal, and therefore requested that the Tribunal be constituted according to Article 37(2)(b) ICSID Convention, given that more than 60 days had passed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration. Claimants then confirmed the appointment of Prof, van den Berg and suggested the name of a person to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n113.\n\nOn 7 May 2007, Respondent opposed Claimant\u2019s suggestion for President and suggested instead another candidate. Respondent further appointed Prof. Georges Abi-Saab, a national of the Arab Republic of Egypt, as arbitrator.\n\n114.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, ICSID informed the Parties that Prof, van den Berg and Prof. Abi-Saab accepted their appointments as arbitrators and enclosed copies of their signed declarations according to Rule 6(2) ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n115.\n\nOn 25 August 2007, Claimants informed ICSID that the Parties have not been able to reach an agreement regarding the appointment of the third, presiding arbitrator and therefore requested ICSID to make the appointment in accordance with Article 38 ICSID Convention and Rule 4 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n116.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, ICSID confirmed receipt of Claimants\u2019 letter of 25 August 2007 and announced that it would proceed with the appointment after consultation with both Parties in accordance with Rule 4(4) ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n117.\n\nOn 8 November 2007, the Secretary-General of the ICSID proposed a candidate to serve as President of the Tribunal and invited the Parties to comment before 19 November 2007.\n\n118.\n\nOn 16 and 19 November 2007 respectively, Respondent and Claimants both objected to the appointment of the person proposed by the Secretary-General of the ICSID. On 29 November 2007, the Secretary-General informed the Parties of its intention to propose to the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council the appointment of Dr. Robert Briner, of Switzerland, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n119.\n\nOn 6 February 2008, the Secretary-General of the ICSID informed the Parties and the arbitrators that the Tribunal is deemed to be constituted by (i) Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (appointed by Claimants), (ii) Professor Georges Abi-Saab (appointed by Respondent) and (iii) Dr. Robert Briner (appointed by ICSID pursuant to Article 38 ICSID Convention). Further, the Tribunal was informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel at ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n120.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, Respondent requested further information from Dr. Briner on his past experience and his positions in companies and financial institutions.\n\n121.\n\nOn 28 February 2008, Dr. Briner provided further information on his past experience and current positions. On the same day, Respondent acknowledged and thanked Dr. Briner for his response.\n\n122.\n\nOn 27 July 2009 Dr. Robert Briner resigned as President of the Tribunal due to health reasons. On 2 September 2009 Prof. Pierre Tercier, a Swiss national, was appointed, by agreement of the parties, as the new President of the Tribunal.\n\n**(3) Arbitral Procedure**\n--------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn 10 March 2008, ICSID sent a letter to the Parties and the Tribunal with organisational details concerning the First Session to be held on 10 April 2008 at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. The Parties were invited to comment on the proposed draft provisional agenda before 3 April 2008.\n\n124.\n\nDuring March 2008, various exchanges of correspondence took place concerning Respondent\u2019s request that the information contained in Claimants\u2019 Annexes be provided to it in an appropriate form. On 31 March 2008, the ICSID informed the Parties that the Tribunal had taken note of the Parties\u2019 correspondences and had decided to defer its ruling on the matter until the First Session of 10 April 2008.\n\n125.\n\nOn 3 April 2008, both Parties sent their comments on the provisional agenda for the First Session (see \u00a7 123 above). Whilst Respondent had \"no comment to make,\" Claimants made several comments and suggestions regarding the various items of the agenda.\n\n126.\n\nOn 9 April 2008, Claimants sent a letter expressing their concerns about Respondent\u2019s statement that it \"has no comments to make\" on the provisional agenda for the First Session. Claimants feared to be prejudiced if Respondent was to raise any such comments during the First Session.\n\n127.\n\nOn 10 April 2008, the First Session was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. at which a procedural calendar for the further conduct of the proceedings was established. During the First Session it was agreed that the arbitration will be bifurcated in a jurisdictional and a merits phase. With regard to the jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on a joint list of preliminary issues to be submitted before 2 May 2008. The Tribunal stated that it would then decide over any remaining divergence and communicate its decision on 9 May 2008.\n\n128.\n\nOn 2 May 2008, both Parties sent letters announcing that they could reach an agreement on only very limited issues and laid down their respective position concerning the remaining divergences on the scope of the jurisdictional phase. Respondent further requested that Claimants submit the list of the members of Task Force Argentina, and that that the schedule discussed at the First Session be amended to account for document discovery.\n\n129.\n\nOn 5 and 8 May 2008 respectively, each Party commented on the other Party\u2019s submission of 2 May 2008.\n\n130.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, after receiving and considering the Parties\u2019 submissions on the scope of the jurisdictional phase and in the light of the Parties\u2019 disagreement, the Tribunal submitted a \"List of issues to be addressed during the jurisdictional first phase of the proceedings\" (hereafter \"List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008\"), listing the following 11 issues covering Claimants and Respondent\u2019s main positions and objections:\n\n\"(1) Does the consent of Argentina to the jurisdiction of the Centre include claims presented by multiple Claimants in a single proceeding? If so, are the claims admissible?\n\n(2) Is the Declaration of Consent signed by the individual Claimants submitted in this proceeding valid; and what is the role and relevance of Task Force Argentina (if any) in this proceeding?\n\n(3) Is the submission of substitute annexes to the Request for Arbitration permissible? Is it possible to add further Claimants after the filing of the claim?\n\n(4) Were the Claimants entitled to initiate ICSID arbitration in light of the 18-month domestic litigation clause at Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT?\n\n(5) What are the consequences (if any) of the Most-Favored-Nations-Clause (MFN) contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT?\n\n(6) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to hear Claimants\u2019 claims for violation of the MFN provisions contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT with reference to the so-called umbrella clause contained in Article 7(2) of the Argentina-Chile BIT?\n\n(7) Are the Claimants\u2019 claims contract claims or Treaty claims and what (if any) are the consequences of this determination?\n\n(8) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over claims where the relevant bond contains a forum selection clause which refers to national courts, but not to ICSID?\n\n(9) Do the bonds in question satisfy the definition of \"Investment\" under Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT with respect to the provisions on investment \"in the territory\" of Argentina and in \"compliance with the laws and regulations of Argentina\"?\n\n(10) Without making a determination with respect to any individual Claimant, does the Tribunal have jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, and its Additional Protocol, over each Claimant who is a natural person and who ultimately is found to have the following characteristics: (i) a natural person with Italian nationality on September 14, 2006 *(i.e.,* the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration) and February 7, 2007 *(i.e.,* the date of registration of the Request); (ii) who on either date was not also a national of the Argentine Republic; and (iii) who was not domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making the investment?\n\n(11) Without making a determination with respect to any individual Claimant, does the Tribunal have jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT over each Claimant that is a juridical person with Italian nationality on September 14, 2006 *(i.e.,* the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration)?\"\n\n131.\n\nAn amended procedural calendar was further agreed upon. Also, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit by 23 May 2008 a complete list of all present members of Task Force Argentina.\n\n132.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Claimants submitted the list of current members of Task Force Argentina, according to the Tribunal\u2019s request of 9 May 2008, but nevertheless raised certain concerns, in particular regarding the submission of documents on behalf of a third party.\n\n133.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Respondent filed its First Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, accompanied by exhibits and expert reports by Prof. Barry J. Eichengreen, Prof. Anne-Marie Slaughter and Prof. William Burke-White.\n\n134.\n\nOn 8 October 2008, after discussions concerning a possible rescheduling of the hearing and after having heard and taken into account both Parties\u2019 positions as well as the availability of all participants, the Tribunal decided that the hearing date would not be changed and still take place on the week of 22 June 2009, as agreed upon on 9 May 2008.\n\n135.\n\nOn 7 November 2008, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by substitute versions of Annexes A through E, K and L; exhibits; witness statements by Mr. Stefano De Grandi, Mr. Mario Flagella, Mr. Richard Liebars, Mr. Raffaele Martino, Mr. Ajata Mediratta, Mr. Fabrizio Modoni, and Mr. Roberto Ranieri; and expert reports by Dr. Alberto B. Bianchi, Ms. Elizabeth J. Cabraser, Dr. William R. Cline, Dr. Joaquin A. Cottani, Prof. Rudolf Dolzer, Dr. Pablo E. Guidotti, Prof. Geoffrey C. Hazard, Prof. Natalino Irti, Mr. Brent Kaczmarek, Prof. Salvatore Maccarone and Prof. Fabrizio Maimeri, Dr. Hector A. Mairal, Prof. Annibale Marini, Mr. Rex Pingle, Prof. W. Michael Reisman, Mr. Stephen Schaefer, Prof. Christoph Schreuer, Dr. Francisco G. Susmel, and Dr. Guillermo O. Teijeiro.\n\n136.\n\nOn 17 November 2008, the Parties exchanged their requests for document production pursuant to the schedule set forth in the letter of 9 May 2008.\n\n137.\n\nOn 18 November 2008, Respondent sent a letter stating that Claimants had not complied with the deadline for submission of their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It argued that the transmittal letter sent to ICSID was received on 8 November 2008, 12:02 am and that subsequent emails were received at 02:31 am. It further complained that it received the Spanish version of the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction only on 11 November 2008, i.e., four days after the deadline set forth in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 9 May 2008 (see \u00a7 130 above). Respondent therefore requested that the deadline for submission of its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction scheduled for 20 February 2009 be extended to 24 February 2009. It further expressed its wish that the Tribunal would not allow further failures to comply with the established deadlines, absent special circumstances under the terms of Rule 26 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n138.\n\nOn 18 November 2008, the Tribunal advised the Parties that the hearing would take place from Friday, 19 June 2009, through Wednesday, 24 June 2009.\n\n139.\n\nOn 24 November 2008, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 18 November 2008 asking the Tribunal to reject Respondent\u2019s request for extension of time and giving further explanations on why its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and related documents were sent out late. Claimants further stressed that while Respondent had 15 weeks to prepare its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants were only given 10.5 weeks to prepare their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n140.\n\nOn 5 December 2008, the Parties submitted their respective \"Redfern Schedules\" listing their specific requests for document production by the other Party and their objections to the other Party\u2019s requests.\n\n141.\n\nOn 10 December 2008, the Tribunal granted Respondent\u2019s request for extension of the deadline for submission of its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction to 23 February 2009.\n\n142.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 ruling on the Parties\u2019 production for document requests.\n\n143.\n\nSubsequently, correspondence was exchanged between the Parties with regard to\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s compliance with Order No. 1, referred to in \u00a7 142 above; and\n\n(ii) the progress on reaching a conclusion on a confidentiality agreement. None of the issues could be solved among the Parties who requested the Tribunal\u2019s directions.\n\n144.\n\nOn 22 December 2008, the Parties exchanged documents in accordance with Annex A of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No.l. Respondent\u2019s submission of documents appeared to be incomplete.\n\n145.\n\nOn 9 February 2009, Respondent completed its document production as ordered in Procedural Order No. 1 (see \u00a7 142 above).\n\n146.\n\nOn 12 February 2009, the Tribunal directed Respondent to provide an accompanying table to the produced documents which contained references to each specific request that the Tribunal had ordered Respondent to comply with in Procedural Order No. 1, referred to in \u00a7 142 above. Further, the Tribunal invited the Parties to continue their discussions in order to arrive at a Confidentiality Agreement and stated that if the Parties cannot come to such an agreement and if so requested by a Party, the Tribunal will hear the Parties on this matter at the occasion of the June 2009 Hearing and then take the necessary steps.\n\n147.\n\nOn 23 February 2009, Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, accompanied by exhibits; witness statements by Mr. Enrique H. Boilini, Avv. Gianluca Fontanella, Dr. Sergio Mario Illuminato, Ms. Noemi C. La Greca, Mr. Federico Carlos Molina, Ambassador Guillermo Nielsen, and Hon. Luigi Olivieri; and expert reports by Prof. Avv. Guido Alpa, Prof. Avv. Antonio Briguglio, Dr. Pierre-Yves Cremieux, Avv. Remo Danovi, Prof. Barry J. Eichengreen, The Forensic Document Examination Division of the Argentine Federal Police, Ms. Rachel Hines, Prof. Jorge Kielmanovich, Prof. Daniel Marx, Abog. Ismael Mata, Prof. Arthur R. Miller, Prof. Richard A. Nagareda, Prof. Nouriel Roubini, Prof. Alessandro Penati, Prof. Avv. Andrea Perrone, Mr. Hector Jorge Petersen and Mr. Hector Jorge Petersen (h), Prof. Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White, and Prof. Charles W. Wolfram.\n\n148.\n\nOn 9 March 2009, Respondent submitted the table of documents referencing each specific document according to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 12 February 2009 (see \u00a7 146 above).\n\n149.\n\nOn 22 April 2009, Claimants requested that Respondent be ordered to submit documents complementing its previous production, i.e., charts and proposals and other pages accompanying the Analysis Memoranda relating to the bonds issued by Respondent.\n\n150.\n\nOn 6 May 2009, Respondent responded to Claimants letter of 22 April 2009 and requested that Claimants\u2019 request for further document production be rejected.\n\n151.\n\nOn 6 May 2009, Claimants filed their (English) Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by exhibits; witness statements by Mr. Massimo Cerniglia, Mario Flagella, Richard Liebars, Ajata Mediratta, and Fabrizio Modoni; and expert reports by Alberto B. Bianchi, Elizabeth J. Cabrazer, Dr. William R. Cline (second expert opinion), Joaquin A. Cottani, Professor Dr. Dr. Rudolf Dolzer (supplemental expert opinion), Mrs. Cristiana Franco, Mr. Mario Franco, Mr. Alberto Bravo, Pablo E. Guidotti (supplemental expert report), Mr. Iain Hardie (supplemental expert report), Geoffrey C. Hazard JR (supplemental legal opinion), Prof. Natalino Irti (supplemental pro veritate legal opinion), Salvatore Maccarone and Fabrizio Maimeri (supplemental legal opinion), Hector A. Mairal (supplemental legal opinion), Prof. Annibale Marini (supplemental pro veritate legal opinion), Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek (supplemental expert report), Prof. Nicola Picardi, Rex E. Pingle (supplemental expert opinion), and Prof. W. Michael Reisman (second opinion).\n\n152.\n\nSubsequently, correspondence was exchanged between the Parties with regard to Respondent\u2019s requests to amend the schedule of 9 May 2008 with regard to the designation of witnesses and experts and the submission of documents relating to direct and cross-examination of such witnesses and experts for the forthcoming hearing and to hold a pre-hearing conference.\n\n153.\n\nOn 11 May 2009, the Tribunal announced that it would, for the time being, not make any decision with respect to the designation of witnesses and experts for the forthcoming hearing and invited the Parties to confer and try to reach an agreement, reverting to the Tribunal by 15 May 2009. It further stated that it would be prepared to hold a pre-hearing conference call during the first week of June 2009.\n\n154.\n\nOn 14 May 2009, Respondent reiterated its concerns already raised in its letter of 8 May 2009 concerning Claimants\u2019 late submission of their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction and related documents. Whilst electronic copies of the documents were received by ICSID only after the midnight deadline of 6 May 2009, Respondent received the Spanish version of the Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction only on 9 May 2009. Respondent consequently requested the Tribunal to disregard Claimants\u2019 late submissions in application of Rule 26(3) ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n155.\n\nOn 15 May 2009, in accordance with the deadline set in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 May 2009 (see \u00a7 153 above), the Parties submitted to the Tribunal their respective positions concerning the various pre-hearing and hearing matters. Respondent further requested that an additional hearing of 10 days be set.\n\n156.\n\nOn 18 May 2009, Claimants provided certain explanations on the delay in submitting their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction and requested that Respondent\u2019s request to disregard such Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction be rejected.\n\n157.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, the Parties exchanged further correspondence concerning the various pre-hearing and hearing matters. While Respondent insisted that each Party be given the right to cross-examine every witness and expert presented by the other Party and that additional hearing time be arranged, Claimants requested that Respondent\u2019s requests be denied.\n\n158.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, Claimants requested the Tribunal to order Respondent to immediately produce the complementary documents requested in their letter of 22 April 2009 (see \u00a7 149).\n\n159.\n\nOn 21 May 2009, the Tribunal ruled that it accepted Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction despite its delayed submission. It further set forth certain principles for conduct of the forthcoming Hearing on Jurisdiction confirming, among others, that the hearing would last 5.5 days, defining the scope of direct examination of witnesses and experts and setting new deadlines for the designation of witnesses and experts and submission of documents for direct and cross-examination.\n\n160.\n\nOn 26 May 2009, the Tribunal requested Respondent to produce the documents requested by Claimants in their letter of 20 May 2009 or to otherwise give specific reasons for not producing such documents before 5 June 2009.\n\n161.\n\nOn 28 May 2009, in accordance with the deadline set in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 21 May 2009 (see \u00a7 159 above), the Parties submitted their designation of witnesses and experts relevant to the jurisdictional phase. Whilst Claimants did not directly designate witnesses or experts from Respondent for cross-examination, it reserved the right to do so in case Respondent would designate any such witnesses or experts for direct examination and to expand the scope of redirect examination of Claimants\u2019 witnesses or experts accordingly. Respondent submitted a list of witnesses and experts from Claimants for cross-examination and a list of its own witnesses and experts for direct examination.\n\n162.\n\nOn 29 May 2009, Respondent objected to Claimants position in its letter of 28 May 2009 contending that Claimants had not complied with the Tribunal\u2019s request to designate the witnesses and experts for direct and cross examination and that Claimants should not have the right to further designate such witnesses or experts or to expand the scope of their re-direct examination.\n\n163.\n\nOn 31 May 2009, Claimants objected to Respondent\u2019s position in its letters of 28 and 29 May 2009. With regard to Respondent\u2019s designation of witnesses and experts for direct examination, Claimants objected to the examination of Respondent\u2019s handwriting experts and experts on US and Italian tax law. With regard to Respondent\u2019s designation of witnesses and experts for cross-examination, Claimants objected to the examination of Mr. Stock and of their own handwriting experts. Claimants further objected to Respondent\u2019s request to extend the daily hearing schedule.\n\n164.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, the Tribunal ruled that (i) the Parties\u2019 handwriting experts shall not be examined at the hearing because the issue of authenticity of the Claimants\u2019 signatures related to circumstances concerning individual Claimants and were thus not covered by this jurisdictional phase and (ii) Mr. Stock shall not be called as a witness because he has not submitted any statement, opinion or report (i.e., he is not a witness or expert). Regarding the daily hearing schedule, the Tribunal decided not to change it but remained open to discuss the issue during the Hearing. This decision was taken by majority, as communicated to the Parties on 3 June 2009.\n\n165.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, the deadline set in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 21 May 2009 (see \u00a7 159 above), Respondent submitted its documents for direct and cross-examination accompanied by an index, and requested disclosure of documents regarding the direct testimony by Prof. Briguglio and Prof. Nagareda.\n\n166.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, the deadline set in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 26 May 2009 (see \u00a7 160 above), Respondent explained why it deemed that it should be relieved from any obligation to produce any documents called by Claimants in their letter of 20 May 2009 (see \u00a7 158 above).\n\n167.\n\nOn 7 June 2009, Claimants insisted that Respondent be ordered to produce the documents as requested in their letter of 20 May 2009 (see \u00a7 158 above).\n\n168.\n\nOn 7 June 2009, Claimants also responded to Respondent\u2019s submission of 3 June 2009 and raised the following two main objections: (i) Claimants consider Respondent\u2019s submission of its \"Supplemental Exhibits\" as untimely, abusive and partly in disregard of confidentiality obligations, and (ii) Claimants objected to Respondent\u2019s designation of Prof. Nagareda and Prof. Briguglio for direct examination because such direct examination would exceed the scope of examination set forth in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 21 May 2009 (see \u00a7 159 above).\n\n169.\n\nOn 8 June 2009, the Tribunal communicated the organizational details of the Hearing on Jurisdiction to be held from 19 June 2009 through 24 June 2009.\n\n170.\n\nOn 8 June 2009, Respondent reacted to the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 2 June 2009 (see \u00a7 164) expressing concerns that \"two of the members of the Tribunal have simply taken an incomprehensible decision\" by not admitting to call the handwriting experts as experts during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decision of 2 June 2009.\n\n171.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 June 2009 and requested that the Tribunal reject Respondent\u2019s requests.\n\n172.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that in light of certain recent health problems, he would not be allowed to travel to Washington, D.C. for the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n173.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, Claimants acknowledged that the Hearing on Jurisdiction was postponed and understood that related deadlines were presently suspended, including with respect to the submission of examination documents, etc.\n\n174.\n\nOn 17 June 2009, the Tribunal decided on several issues regarding the Hearing: (i) with respect to the issues raised by the Parties in relation to the Hearing, in particular to the testimony of fact and expert witness, the Tribunal reserved its decision for a later stage during the proceedings, once the new dates for the Hearing have been established; (ii) with respect to Claimants\u2019 request for the production of documents as contained in their letter of 20 May 2009, it was denied; (iii) with regard to Claimants\u2019 objection of 7 June 2009 regarding Respondent\u2019s submission of 3 June 2009, the Tribunal invited Respondent to state its position, especially with regard to Claimants\u2019 objection relating to confidential material, before 24 June 2009.\n\n175.\n\nOn 24 June 2009, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 letters of 7 and 9 June 2009 (see \u00a7\u00a7 168 and 171 above) in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions (see \u00a7 174 above). Respondent insisted on the relevance of the question of the authenticity of some of the Claimants\u2019 signatures for this jurisdictional phase. With regard to the confidentiality issue, Respondent stressed that it had not submitted any document filed in sealed proceedings and that there was no general rule of confidentiality governing ICSID arbitration proceedings. It therefore requested that Claimants\u2019 objections be rejected. Respondent further complained about Claimants\u2019 position, as reflected in their letter of 9 June 2009 (see \u00a7 173 above), to suspend the deadline for submission of documents for cross-examination and requested that the Tribunal order Claimants to immediately present such documents.\n\n176.\n\nOn 6 July 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 24 June 2009 requesting once again that the Tribunal (i) exclude the use of confidential documents and (ii) refuse to undo its decision of 2 June 2009 concerning the handwriting experts. Claimants further requested that the Tribunal issue a confidentiality order protecting the confidentiality of the current proceedings. Claimants also stressed that the suspension of the deadline for submission of documents for witnesses\u2019 and experts\u2019 examination was in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s communication of 9 June 2009.\n\n177.\n\nOn 8 and 16 September 2009, Claimants suggested new dates concerning pre-hearing issues and the Hearing on Jurisdiction. It further requested anew that the Tribunal reject Respondent\u2019s request to reconsider the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 2 June 2009 and asked the Tribunal to strike Respondent\u2019s supplemental exhibits and confidential material as submitted by Respondent on 3 June 2009. It also insisted on its request for a confidentiality order.\n\n178.\n\nOn 16 September 2009, Respondent requested the Tribunal to set an entirely new calendar, including dates for witnesses and experts hearings, and considering an additional two weeks for the Hearing on Jurisdiction. It further insisted on the examination of the handwriting experts during the Hearing and on the admission of its documents submitted on 3 June 2009.\n\n179.\n\nOn 17 and 23 September 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 16 September 2009 and formulated the following requests: (i) with regard to the Hearing, that Respondent\u2019s requests to overturn previous decisions on hearing days be denied; (ii) with regard to witnesses and experts, that Respondent\u2019s requests to re-open the designation of witnesses, to overturn the Tribunal\u2019s decision on handwriting experts, and to refuse the direct examination of Prof. Briguglio and Prof. Nagareda be denied; (iii) with regard to the documents for the Hearing, that the admission of Respondent\u2019s \"Supplemental Exhibits\" be limited to those relating expressly to the scope of direct testimony of Claimants\u2019 experts and witnesses; and (iv) that Claimants\u2019 request for a confidentiality order be granted.\n\n180.\n\nOn 14 October 2009, after the procedure had been staying still due to the unfortunate circumstances affecting Dr. Briner and eventually leading to his resignation, the procedure was actively resumed through a joint telephone conference between the Tribunal (with Prof. Pierre Tercier as new President of the Tribunal (see \u00a7 122 above)), the Secretary and the Parties. During the conference call, new pre-hearing deadlines and hearing dates, as well as other organisational aspects were discussed. At the conclusion of the telephone conference, four procedural matters were left open for decision by the Tribunal: (i) whether or not to allow direct and cross-examination of the handwriting experts, (ii) whether or not to allow direct examination of Professors Richard A. Nagareda and Antonio Briguglio, (iii) dates for the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility and thereto related, pre-hearing dates, as well as (iv) the standard of confidentiality to be applied in the present proceeding.\n\n181.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, in which (i) it admitted - under certain restrictions - the direct and cross-examination of the handwriting experts; (ii) it admitted the direct examination by Respondent of Professors Richard A. Nagareda and Antonio Briguglio, and by Claimant of Professor Nicola Picardi; and (iii) it set the dates for the Hearing on Jurisdiction to 7 April 2010 to 13 April 2010.\n\n182.\n\nOn 11 December 2009, Claimants requested some further clarifications concerning Procedural Order No. 2 with regard to the procedure for examination of the handwriting experts and the scope of examination in general.\n\n183.\n\nOn 28 December 2009, the Tribunal provided the Parties with further clarifications on Procedural Order No. 2 and enclosed a draft hearing agenda inviting the Parties to comment thereon by 22 January 2010. It further invited Claimants to submit by 22 January 2010 the documents to be used for its direct, cross and re-direct examination and not yet in the record while Respondent was given a deadline until 19 February 2010 to comment thereon.\n\n184.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Claimants requested clarifications regarding its duty to submit any supplemental exhibits not yet in the record for use during direct, cross and redirect examination, alleging that the outstanding decision of the Tribunal concerning the admissibility of part of Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Exhibits played a role on the scope of Claimants\u2019 submission.\n\n185.\n\nOn 21 January 2010, the Tribunal decided on Claimants\u2019 enquiry of 19 January 2010, postponing (i) Claimants\u2019 deadline for submitting any additional exhibits for witness and expert examination until the issuance of the imminent Procedural Order No. 3 and (ii) Respondent\u2019s deadline for commenting on Claimants\u2019 submission.\n\n186.\n\nOn 22 January 2010, the Parties submitted their comments on the draft Agenda for the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\n(i) Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the draft agenda. Nevertheless, due to scheduling issues, it requested a change in the examination order of certain expert witnesses. It further designated the specific handwriting experts to be examined during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n(ii) Claimants requested to be given more time for their opening and closing statements and to amend the hearing schedule accordingly. They further requested a change in the order of examination of certain expert witnesses due to their limited availability.\n\n187.\n\nOn 27 January 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 3 ruling on the standard of confidentiality to be followed in the present proceeding and rejecting the admissibility of Respondent\u2019s Exhibits RE-427, RE-428, RE-429, RE-435, RE-440, RE-452, RE-462, RE-488, RE-489, RE-490, RE-491, RE-492, RE-493, RE-494, RE-495, RE-496, RE-497, RE-498, RE-499, RE-504 and RE-528, as well as of any other exhibit relating to an expert report or to a transcript of expert examination issued in another arbitration.\n\n188.\n\nOn the same day, according to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 21 January 2010 (see \u00a7 185 above), the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit any additional exhibits not yet in the record for use during direct, cross- and re-direct examination by 1 February 2010. Respondent was invited to comment on Claimants\u2019 submission by 22 February 2010. This latter deadline was subsequently corrected by the Tribunal to 1 March 2010.\n\n189.\n\nOn 1 February 2010, Claimants filed their supplemental exhibits not yet in the record for use during direct, cross- and re-direct examination, as requested by the Tribunal in its letters of 28 December 2009 and 27 January 2010.\n\n190.\n\nOn 2 February 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that on 26 January 2010, Dr. Osvaldo Cesar Gugliemino had resigned from his position as Attorney General of Argentina and that the President of the Argentine Republic had appointed Dr. Joaquin Pedro da Rocha as his successor. On 27 December 2010 Dr. Joaquin Pedro da Rocha was replaced by Dr. Angelina Maria Esther Abbbona as Argentina\u2019s Attorney General.\n\n191.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, Respondent filed its comments on Claimants\u2019 submission of 1 February 2010, including a series of additional documents (see \u00a7 189 above).\n\n192.\n\nOn 2 March 2010, Claimants reacted to Respondent\u2019s submission of 1 March 2010 raising various objections against the submission of additional documents by Respondent. Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue an immediate order directing that the documents submitted by Respondent not be admitted to the record and announced that they would respond in full to Respondent\u2019s submission within one week.\n\n193.\n\nOn 8 March 2010, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal concerning a new claim that Claimants would allegedly have initiated before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York, including as Plaintiffs some of the Claimants, as well as two other litigation procedures initiated in the US. Respondent consequently asked the Tribunal to invite Claimants (i) to inform whether or not these three proceedings \"are the only one initiated in New York or in any other jurisdiction relating to security entitlements in Argentine bonds that comprise individuals or companies that are also Claimants in this arbitration\" and (ii) to confirm whether or not all the Claimants in any of these proceedings are also Claimants in this arbitration.\n\n194.\n\nOn 9 March 2010, ICSID forwarded directions from the Tribunal to the Parties dated 5 March 2010 and 9 March 2010 regarding (i) an updated hearing agenda and (ii) the question of the submission of documents for expert and witness examination.\n\n195.\n\nOn 9 March 2010, Claimants submitted a letter in which they substantiated their previously raised objections (see \u00a7 192 above) against Respondent\u2019s submission of documents of 1 March 2010.\n\n196.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent submitted a second expert report from Hector Jorge Petersen and Hector Jorge Petersen (h) concerning the authenticity of signatures attributed to Claimants and appearing in the powers of attorneys, together with an accompanying note.\n\n197.\n\nOn the same day, Claimants objected strongly to the submission by Respondent of such report and accompanying note.\n\n198.\n\nOn 10 March 2010, ICSID sent out a letter to the Parties conveying a message from the Tribunal stating as follows:\n\n\"Counsel shall not send any further documents until the Arbitral Tribunal has issued its upcoming Procedural Order on the admissibility of all documents relating to the expert and witness examination, including the latest submission by Respondent. In this respect, the Tribunal has taken due note of the Claimants\u2019 objection thereto. However, in order to prevent a further escalation of this issue preventing the Tribunal to focus on the substantial issues of the hearing, the Tribunal invites the Parties to refrain from any further comments until reception of the upcoming Procedural Order.\"\n\n199.\n\nOn 11 March 2010, notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 10 March 2010, Respondent submitted a letter insisting that Messrs. Petersens\u2019 report submitted on 9 March 2010 (see \u00a7 196 above) be admitted. On the same day, Claimants stressed that this submission was in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 10 March 2010 and reserved the right to respond in due course.\n\n200.\n\nOn 18 March 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 4 in which it set forth certain principles on the admissibility and use of the documents submitted for witness and expert examination and invited the Parties to submit certain documents and information in view of the upcoming Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n201.\n\nOn 22 March 2010, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing joint telephone conference together with the Parties and ICSID concerning the organization and agenda of the Hearing on Jurisdiction scheduled on 7-13 April 2010. At the conclusion of the telephone conference, the following procedural matters were left open: (i) the specific order of examination of experts and witnesses, (ii) the presence of experts and witnesses during the hearing, and (iii) the specific role and presence of TFA during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n202.\n\nBetween 25 March 2010 and 1 April 2010, correspondence was exchanged between the Parties and the Tribunal concerning various issues relating to the Hearing on Jurisdiction, such as the admissibility of documents to be used for expert and witness examination, Respondent\u2019s request for immediate access to Claimants\u2019 online database, information on the existence of parallel proceedings relating to Claimants\u2019 security entitlements and the role and presence of TFA during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n203.\n\nOn 29 March 2010, the Tribunal advised the Parties of its decision on the matters left open during the telephone conference of 22 March 2010 (see \u00a7 201 above). The Tribunal therein (i) confirmed the order of examination of experts as witnesses as set forth in the draft agenda circulated to the Parties on 5 March 2010, (ii) gave further specification as to the use of the time allocated to each Party, and (iii) set forth rules as to the presence of experts and witnesses during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n204.\n\nOn 2 April 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 5, in which it ruled over the admissibility of the documents designated by the Parties for expert and witness examination and admitted TFA to attend the Hearing on Jurisdiction \"as Claimants \u2018agent\u2019, without prejudice to the pending issue of the validity of its mandate.\" This Procedural Order was then complemented on 6 April 2010 by Procedural Order No. 6, in which the Tribunal ruled on the admissibility of further documents designated by Respondent for witness and expert examination.\n\n205.\n\nFrom 7 April 2010 to 13 April 2010, the Hearing on Jurisdiction took place at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. After hearing the Opening Statements of Counsel to both Parties, the Parties proceeded with the examination of the following witnesses and experts: Prof. Richard A. Nagareda, Prof. Avv. Antonio Briguglio, Subinspector Lucio Pereyra, Mr. Hector Jorge Petersen, Mr. Massimo Cerniglia, Mr. Mario Franco, Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, Prof. W. Michael Reisman, Mr. Stefano De Grandi, Mr. Joaquin A. Cottani, Prof. Christoph Schreuer, Prof. Nicola Picardi, Mr. Hector A. Mairal and Professor Dr. Dr. Rudolf Dolzer. The last two days were dedicated to the Parties\u2019 Closing Statements.\n\n206.\n\nOn 22 April 2010, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties with instructions concerning the submission of the Post-Hearing Briefs to be submitted by both Parties by 14 June 2010.\n\n207.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 7, in which it ruled on the admissibility of new documents not yet in the record and which both Parties wished to submit in order to use them in their upcoming Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n208.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties listing nine questions that the Tribunal wished the Parties to address in the Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n209.\n\nOn 25 May 2010, both Parties filed new documents admitted into the procedure under Procedural Order No. 7. These documents were submitted by the Parties as C-998 to C-l003 with regard to Claimants, and RD-484 and RF-92 with regard to Respondent.\n\n210.\n\nOn 9 June 2010, the Tribunal granted an extension of the deadline for the submission of the Post-Hearing Briefs to 22 June 2010.\n\n211.\n\nOn 22, 23 and 25 June 2010, the Parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs, together with their response to the Tribunal\u2019s nine questions raised in its letter of 20 May 2010 (see \u00a7 209 above).\n\n212.\n\nOn 25 June 2010, Respondent complained about the delay of the submission of some parts of Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, which was received during the night of 22-23 June 2010 and requested that the Tribunal disregard such submission.\n\n213.\n\nOn 7 July 2010, after having given Claimants the opportunity to comment on Respondent\u2019s letter of 25 June 2010 and after considering both Parties\u2019 respective positions, the Tribunal accepted both Parties\u2019 Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n214.\n\nOn 22 July 2010, Claimants requested the postponement of the deadline for the submission of the Parties\u2019 Statements of Cost due on 22 July 2010. After having invited Claimants to elaborate on the reasons for their request and after having given Respondent the opportunity to comment thereon, the Tribunal decided by Procedural Order No. 8 dated 3 August 2010, to reject Claimants\u2019 request for postponement of the deadline for the submission of the Parties\u2019 Statements of Cost and invited both Parties to submit their Statements of Cost within 24 hours upon receipt of Procedural Order No. 8\n\n215.\n\nOn 4 August 2010, the Parties filed their Statements of Cost.\n\n216.\n\nOn 5 October 2010, Claimants filed a letter submitting that certain Claimants, who tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010, would no longer participate in the present arbitration, thereby reducing the number of remaining Claimants to approximately 60,000. Claimants attached to their letter updated versions of Annexes A, B, C and L to the Request for Arbitration, the latter containing a list of all Claimants who have withdrawn from the arbitration since 14 September 2006.\n\n217.\n\nOn 22 October 2010, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 letter of 5 October 2010 and requested the Tribunal (i) to require Claimants to promptly inform which Claimants have tendered their security entitlements into the Exchange Offer 2010 and (ii) to order that the Argentine Republic and those Claimants with respect to which proceedings will be discontinued under the terms set forth in its letter, equally bear the arbitration costs, and each of them bear their own cost, and that such order of discontinuance be rendered in due course.\n\n218.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, Claimants requested that Respondent\u2019s requests raised in its letter of 22 October 2010 be denied based on the following main arguments: (i) with regard to Respondent\u2019s request for information on the identity of Claimants having tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010, this request has been rendered moot because Respondent is already in possession of such information as Claimants already have submitted a complete list of all Claimants having withdrawn from the arbitration since 14 September 2006 and (ii) with regard to Respondent\u2019s request regarding costs issues as to withdrawn Claimants, this request constitutes an attempt to raise new issues regarding costs and should therefore be rejected and stricken from the record, or alternatively, Claimants should be given the opportunity to brief the Tribunal in full as to this issue.\n\n219.\n\nOn 2 November 2010, Respondent responded, contending that (i) Claimants\u2019 objections to its requests was based on old arguments; (ii) that the information as to the identity of Claimants having tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010 is necessary, since these Claimants would have accepted to abandon, dismiss, withdraw and/or discontinue any proceedings pending against Argentina whilst Claimants who have withdrawn irrespective of the Exchange Offer 2010 have not made such undertaking; (iii) that Claimants are in a better position than Respondent to provide such information; and (iv) that Respondent\u2019s request regarding costs was to be understood as a modality of the request for an order of discontinuance, which the Tribunal shall be free to issue when considered appropriate.\n\n220.\n\nOn 26 November 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9 in which it rejected Respondent\u2019s request for further specific information on the identity of the Claimants having tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010 and announced that the question of the allocation of the arbitration costs concerning the Claimants who withdrew would be dealt with in the Tribunal\u2019s upcoming determination on jurisdiction together with the question of the withdrawal of certain Claimants.\n\n**III. LAW**\n------------\n\n**A. Introductory Remarks**\n---------------------------\n\n**(1) The Arbitral Procedure**\n------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe present procedure is subject to the ICSID legal framework, including the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 1965 (hereinafter \"ICSID Convention\"), the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"Institution Rules\"), the Rules for Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\") and the Administrative and Financial Regulations, in their versions as amended in 2006.\n\n222.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has been duly constituted on 6 February 2008 pursuant to Articles 37 and 38 ICSID Convention and Rule 4 ICSID Arbitration Rules (see \u00a7 119 above). Following the sudden and unfortunate death of the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, Dr. Robert Briner, Prof. Pierre Tercier was appointed by agreement of the Parties on 2 September 2009 as the new President of the Arbitral Tribunal according to Rule 11 ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Parties have not raised objections to the nomination and appointment of any of the present members of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n223.\n\nThrough the various rounds of exchange of written submissions and through the Hearing on Jurisdiction held in Washington D.C. from 7 to 13 April 2010, both Parties have been given wide and equal opportunity to present their case with regard to the jurisdictional and admissibility issues of the present case.75\n\nHearing Tr. Day 7 pp. 1941/14 -1942/10.\n\n224.\n\nHaving read the Parties\u2019 written submissions, having listened to the Parties, the testimony of their witnesses and experts during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, and based on the deliberations held among the members of the Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal considers itself in a position to render the present Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n**(2) Object of the Present Decision**\n--------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe main object and aim of the present decision is to examine the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence over the Claimants\u2019 claims against Argentina and, to the extent that there is competence and jurisdiction, to determine whether or not such claims are admissible. In what follows, the Tribunal will use for convenience the terms jurisdiction and competence interchangeably, without however ignoring the difference between the two concepts (see \u00a7 245 below).\n\n226.\n\nDuring the First Session of 10 April 200876 (see \u00a7 127 above) and as further set forth in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 21 May 2009 (see \u00a7 159 above), it was agreed that the present jurisdictional phase is limited to general issues and shall not include \"issues touching specifically upon each individual claimant,\" except where the presentation of the general issue (of jurisdiction or admissibility) cannot be done without reference to a particular situation.\n\nFirst Session Tr. p. 140/17 and p. 141/3-9.\n\n227.\n\nAs such, the present decision does not aim at determining whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction with regard to each specific Claimant. Instead, it will set forth the general requirements for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction regarding the present case and the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims, and will examine to what extent these requirements can be considered fulfilled without entering into issues touching specifically upon each individual Claimant. To the extent that the Tribunal considers that the general requirements for its jurisdiction and for the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims are fulfilled, it will determine how to address relevant jurisdictional issues touching specifically upon individual Claimants. These issues will then be dealt with in a later decision according to a procedure to be further determined.\n\n228.\n\nWith regard to relevant general issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal, in its letter of 9 May 2008, provided the Parties with a \"List of issues to be addressed during the jurisdictional first phase of the proceedings\" identifying 11 issues which are listed above (see \u00a7 130 above).\n\n229.\n\nThese 11 issues cover Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s main positions and objections with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s hearing and handling of the case, and address various issues including jurisdictional, admissibility and other procedural issues.\n\n230.\n\nWhilst this decision will address the 11 issues listed above, it will not follow the order of such 11 issues.\n\n231.\n\nAfter a brief summary of the Parties\u2019 positions (see section (3) below), the Tribunal will make a short presentation of the legal basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (section B below). The Tribunal will then set forth the requirements for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and determine to what extent these requirements can be deemed fulfilled without entering into issues specifically touching upon individual Claimants (section C below) and, to the extent these requirements are fulfilled, address relevant issues relating to the admissibility of the claims (section D below) and other procedural issues related thereto (section E below).\n\n**(3) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions and Relief Sought**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Parties hold opposing views with regard to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and the admissibility of the present proceedings. The Parties\u2019 respective positions and the requests for relief they seek from the Tribunal can be summarized as follows:\n\n*(a) Respondent\u2019s Position and Requests for Relief*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nIn general, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 claims in their entirety and contends that Claimants have not asserted a plausible or *prima facie* case for violation of any of the protections of the Argentina-Italy BIT. According to Respondent, Respondent could not and consequently did not pay its external debts according to their terms, but offered Claimants, on a non-discriminatory basis, a voluntary exchange offer for new debt on other terms, which Claimants were free to reject with all their rights intact.77\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 4; R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 364 *et seq.*\n\n234.\n\nWith respect to the jurisdiction, Respondent objects to the ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence over Claimants\u2019 claims based mainly on the following arguments:\n\n(i) Respondent contends that the conditions for ICSID jurisdiction are not fulfilled and that Claimants\u2019 claims are an unprecedented abuse of the investment treaty regime, brought without legal basis and for a fundamentally illegitimate motive. According to Respondent, this is a claim of approximately 180,000 unrelated Claimants, arising out of different purported investments acquired individually by each Claimant at different times and under different circumstances.78 The ICSID Convention would not permit such collective claim, nor would the Argentina-Italy BIT. Therefore, Respondent submits that Claimants\u2019 claim is a legally unsupported attempt to turn a sovereign\u2019s non-payment of external debt that is governed by other States\u2019 laws which provide for remedies in the courts of those other States into a violation of investment treaty protection.79\n\n(ii) Further, Respondent declares that it has not consented to such a proceeding in any of the relevant instruments. Therefore, to force Respondent into such a proceeding without its consent would be a fundamental denial of due process, as well as a breach of the ICSID Convention\u2019s \"outer limits.\"80 In addition, even if jurisdiction was to be admitted, the way this proceeding has been initiated would not be in compliance with the requirements of the BIT with regard to preliminary conduct of amicable negotiations and court proceedings,81 and would, in any event, be inefficient, unmanageable and contrary to Respondent\u2019s right to due process.\n\n(iii) Respondent also contends that Claimants\u2019 purported consent is equally invalid because TFA, as the sole mover and controller of Claimants\u2019 claims, violated the duty of full and truthful disclosure by an un-conflicted representative and thereby vitiated any consent given by Claimants. TFA solicited Claimants\u2019 consents to instituting this arbitration, over which they have no control, by fraud and half-truths with the aim of diverting those customers from claiming against the TFA member banks, while prescription in Italy runs in favor of the TFA member banks.82 In addition, the consent allegedly given by Claimants is not irrevocable as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.83\n\n(iv) Respondent further submits that the contractual entitlements created by and acquired by Claimants in secondary securities markets outside Argentina are not \"investments made in the territory\" of Argentina in the sense of the ICSID Convention or the Argentina-Italy BIT. Respondent also contends that in most instances, the sales of the entitlements to Claimants by the members of TFA were not in accordance with Argentine law as they violated both contractual restrictions on such sales and relevant legal regulations. Respondent derives from this that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae.84*\n\n(v) The Tribunal further lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* as Claimants have not shown that they are \"investors\" or that they have satisfied the nationality requirements of the Argentina-Italy BIT.85 Respondent also disputes Claimants\u2019 standing, contending that Claimants in their capacity as holders of security entitlements have only a remote and attenuated relationship to the underlying bonds through secondary market transactions that violated relevant law.86\n\n(vi) Further, Respondent submits that Claimants\u2019 claims are not treaty claims because they depend fundamentally on non-performance of contractual payment obligations for which the relevant contractual instruments provide non-Argentine legal rights and remedies that could not be and were not affected by any act of Respondent.87\n\n(vii) Finally, Respondent contends that Claimants listed in Annex L of the Request for Arbitration have not validly withdrawn from the arbitration and, since White & Case does not represent them, they have not submitted any of the required pleadings and face default.88\n\nR-MJ \u00a71.\n\nR-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 363 *et seq.*\n\nR-MJ \u00a71, R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 7-8, 19-59.\n\nR-PHB \u00a7 267-291; R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 72-141.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 2; R-PHB \u00a7 142, \u00a7\u00a7 158-200.\n\nR-PHB \u00a7 227.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 3, R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 394-405, \u00a7 478.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 3, R-PHB \u00a7 500.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 3, R-PHB \u00a7 394-405.\n\nR-MJ \u00a74, R-PHB \u00a7 363, \u00a7\u00a7 366-371.\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 638-639; R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 253-266.\n\n235.\n\nBased on these considerations, Respondent requests that the Tribunal issue an award:89\n\n\"(a) Determining that it lacks competence and that ICSID lacks jurisdiction over this case;\n\n(b) In the alternative, determining that it lacks competence and ICSID lacks jurisdiction because both Argentina and Claimants have not provided valid consent to this proceeding, and, further, TFA\u2019s abuse of right in bringing the claims in this proceeding renders invalid such consent as Claimants may have offered and inadmissible these proceedings;\n\n(c) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae',*\n\n(d) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* or that Claimants lack standing;\n\n(e) In the alternative, determining that Claimants have not satisfied the necessary prerequisites for bringing a claim under the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(f) In the alternative, determining that Claimants listed in Claimants\u2019 Annex L have defaulted and ordering them to pay a *pro rata* share of Argentina\u2019s costs;\n\n(g) Ordering Claimants to pay all of Argentina\u2019s costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees; and\n\n(h) Granting any further relief requested against Claimants that the Tribunal deems fit and proper.\"\n\nR-PHB \u00a7 501.\n\n236.\n\nThe above Requests for Relief as contained in the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief of 22 June 2010 (\u00a7 501) and its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 23 February 2009 (\u00a7 730) are slightly different from the Requests for Relief it formulated in its First Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 8 August 2008 and providing as follows:90\n\n\"(a) Determining that it lacks competence and that ICSID lacks jurisdiction to entertain this collective action;\n\n(b) In the alternative, determining that it lacks competence and ICSID lacks jurisdiction because Claimants have not provided valid consent, and, further, TFA\u2019s abuse of right in bringing the claims in this proceeding renders invalid such consent as Claimants may have offered;\n\n(c) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae;\n\n(d) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction ratione personae or that Claimants lack standing;\n\n(e) In the alternative, determining that Claimants have not satisfied necessary prerequisites to bringing a claim under the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(f) Ordering Claimants to pay all of Argentina\u2019s costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees; and\n\n(g) Granting any further relief requested against Claimants that the Tribunal deems fit and proper.\"\n\nSee R-MJ \u00a7401.\n\n237.\n\nIn addition, in its letters of 22 October 2010 and 2 November 2010 (see \u00a7\u00a7 217 and 219 above), Respondent requested the Tribunal to issue an order for discontinuance concerning the Claimants who had withdrawn from the proceedings.\n\n*(b) Claimants\u2019 Position and Requests for Relief*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nClaimants submit that throughout the 1990s, Respondent proceeded to issue over 170 sovereign bonds, intentionally targeting retail investors, including in particular Italian retail investors like Claimants. By virtue of Argentina\u2019s subsequent acts surrounding its default in late 2001 and directed at all Claimants collectively, Claimants were deprived of the value of their investments. In particular, Claimants raise the following allegations:\n\n(i) Respondent first repudiated its obligations under the bonds and, subsequently, refused to negotiate with bondholders thereby pursuing a unilateral, punitive exchange offer targeting, *inter alia,* Italian retail investors, including Claimants;\n\n(ii) Thereafter, Respondent enacted legislation repudiating all obligations to Claimants, which destroyed the value of their investments;91\n\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s acts as a rogue debtor violated its international treaty obligations, the reason why Claimants submitted claims pursuant to the \"Argentina-Italy BIT\" and under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereafter \"ICSID\").92\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 2-10.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 7-8.\n\n239.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration of 14 September 2006, Claimants formulated the following Requests for Relief:\n\n\"212. Claimants hereby request that the Arbitral Tribunal to be constituted in this case issue a final award:\n\n1. Declaring that the Argentine Republic has breached its obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT, and is liable to Claimants therefor;\n\n2. Awarding Claimants compensatory damages in an amount to be specified at a later stage;\n\n3. Awarding Claimants costs associated with these proceedings, including all professional fees and disbursements;\n\n4. Awarding Claimants pre-award and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed; and\n\n5. Awarding Claimants such further or other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n213. Claimants reserve the right to amend this Request for Arbitration and assert additional claims as permitted by the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"\n\n240.\n\nAfter the initiation of these proceedings, the Tribunal decided to deal first with issues of jurisdiction and admissibility and to deal with the merits of the case in a second phase (see \u00a7\u00a7 127-130 above).\n\n241.\n\nWithin such context and with regard to the jurisdictional phase of the present proceedings as limited in scope to the extent described above (\u00a7\u00a7 127-130), Claimants contend that ICSID and the Tribunal have full jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims, which meet all relevant requirements set forth in the ICSID Convention, Arbitration Rules and the Argentina-Italy BIT.93\n\nC-MJ \u00a7 15; C-R-MJ \u00a7 353, \u00a7\u00a7 656, 675, \u00a7\u00a7 788, 793 and 798; C-PHB \u00a7 6.\n\n242.\n\nConsequently, Claimants request that the Tribunal decide as follows with respect to the 11 issues presented in this jurisdictional phase (see \u00a7 130 above):94\n\n\"(1) Argentina consented to arbitrate claims by multiple Claimants, and those claims are admissible.\n\n(2) Claimants\u2019 consent to arbitrate pursuant to a valid declaration of consent, and the role of Task Force Argentina or any other alleged conflict does not vitiate such consent.\n\n(3) Claimants\u2019 submission of substitute annexes to the Request for Arbitration was permissible.\n\n(4) Claimants were entitled to commence arbitration and the 18-month domestic litigation clause in Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT was not a barrier.\n\n(5) The MFN clause allows Claimants to bypass any requirement to resort to domestic court before commencing arbitration.\n\n(6) By operation of the MFN clause, Claimants can benefit from the protection of the umbrella clause in the Argentina-Chile BIT.\n\n(7) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 prima facie treaty claims under the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n(8) The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 treaty claims is unaffected by any forum selection clauses in Claimants\u2019 bonds.\n\n(9) The bonds held by Claimants satisfy the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and the ICSID Convention. Their investments were made \"in the territory\" of Argentina and \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of Argentina.\"\n\n(10) The Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention over Claimants who are natural persons, provided certain requirements are met.\n\n(11) The Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention over Claimants that are juridical persons and had Italian nationality on September 14, 2007.\"\n\nC-MJ Section IV \u00a7 22 ; C-R-MJ Section IV; see further C-PHB \u00a7 449.\n\n243.\n\nClaimants also request the Tribunal to order Respondent to bear all legal fees and expenses incurred by Claimants in connection with this arbitration.95\n\nC-MJ Section IV \u00a7 23.\n\n**(4) Structure of the Present Decision**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 225 *et seq.* above), the present decision deals with general questions of jurisdiction, as well as admissibility.\n\n245.\n\nThe Convention does not define the concept of \"jurisdiction\" of the Centre or of \"competence\" of the Tribunal contemplated in Articles 25 and 41 ICSID Convention (see \u00a7 225 above).96 Nevertheless, in their Report, the Executive Directors have interpreted the concept of \"jurisdiction of the Centre\" as a \"convenient expression to mean the limits within which the provisions of the Convention will apply and the facilities of the Centre will be available for conciliation and arbitration proceedings.\" In other words, the concept of jurisdiction under the Convention also covers issues which may usually be regarded as issues of \"admissibility.\"97 It is thus not surprising that some tribunals have questioned the usefulness of the term in the framework of ICSID.98\n\nThe differences between the concept of \"jurisdiction\" of the Centre compared to the concept \"competence\" of the arbitral tribunal seem to be more linked to the difference in the nature and role of the Centre compared to the arbitral tribunal rather then to a real difference of concept, see Gerold Zeiler, \"Jurisdiction, Competence and Admissibility,\" in: International Investment Law for the 21 st Century, Essays in Honour of Christoph Schreuer, Oxford University Press 2009, pp 77 -81.\n\nSee e.g. *The Rompetrol Group N. V. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 18 April 2008, \u00a7\u00a7 11 *et seq.* (hereinafter *\"Rompetrol\")* In contrast, some authors and tribunals have expressed a different view on this topic: see e.g. Zeiler, op. cit. fit. 96, pp. 90-91, who, referring to the Methanex case, supports the view that since the objections mentioned in Rule 41 ICSID Arbitration Rules do not include objections of inadmissibility of the claim, this provision does not confer to the Tribunal a separate power to rule on objections to admissibility.\n\nChristoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition, 2009, Ad Art. 25 \u00a7 18 and references quoted therein.\n\n246.\n\nWithin the context of the present dispute and its particularities, it is useful and important to distinguish issues of jurisdiction from issues of admissibility for the following reasons.\n\n247.\n\nAlthough a lack of jurisdiction or admissibility may both lead to the same result of a tribunal having to refuse to hear the case, such refusal is of a fundamentally different nature99 and therefore carries different consequences:100\n\n(i) While a lack of jurisdiction *stricto sensu* means that the claim cannot at all be brought in front of the body called upon, a lack of admissibility means that the claim was neither fit nor mature for judicial treatment;101\n\n(ii) Whereby a decision refusing a case based on a lack of arbitral jurisdiction is usually subject to review by another body, a decision refusing a case based on a lack of admissibility can usually not be subject to review by another body;\n\n(iii) Whereby a final refusal based on a lack of jurisdiction will prevent the parties from successfully re-submitting the same claim to the same body, a refusal based on admissibility will, in principle, not prevent the claimant from resubmitting its claim, provided it cures the previous flaw causing the inadmissibility.\n\nSee in this respect Paulsson, who called them \"as different as night and day\" (Jan Paulsson, \"Jurisdiction and Admissibility,\" in G. Aksen, K. H. Bockstiegel, M.J. Mustill, P.M. Patocchi, and A.M. Whitesell (eds), Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce and Dispute Resolution, Liber Amicorum in honour of Robert Briner (2005), pp. 601 *et seq.).*\n\nSee also Zeiler, op. cit fn. 96, pp. 81 *et seq.*\n\nSee PAULSSON, *op. cit.* fn. 99, and *The Societe Generale de Surveillance v. Republic of the Philippines,* (ICSID Case ARB/02/6), Decision of 29 January 2004 (\u00a7 153), 8 *ICSID Reports* 518 (hereinafter *\"SGS v. Philippines\").*\n\n248.\n\nTherefore, and in the light of the many objections raised in the present proceedings with regard to various aspects of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and proceedings, the Tribunal has deemed it not only appropriate but also necessary to distinguish issues relating to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction *stricto sensu* and admissibility issues.\n\n249.\n\nIn this respect, the guiding thought of the Tribunal for distinguishing issues of jurisdiction from issues of admissibility has been the following cornerstone consideration:\n\n**If there was only one Claimant, what would be the requirements for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction over its claim? If the issue raised relates to such requirements, it is a matter of jurisdiction. If the issue raised relates to another aspect of the proceedings, which would not apply if there was just one Claimant, then it must be considered a matter of admissibility and not of jurisdiction.**\n\n250.\n\nThis thought will be further developed along the Tribunal\u2019s analysis which is structured as follows:\n\n(i) The Tribunal will start with a short presentation of the fundaments and scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence as deriving from the relevant legal provisions of the BIT and the Convention (see section B below);\n\n(ii) Based on this presentation, the Tribunal will then set forth the requirements for its jurisdiction as set forth by the relevant legal provisions and examine to what extent these requirements can be considered fulfilled without entering into issues specifically touching upon individual Claimants (see section C below);\n\n(iii) To the extent these requirements can be considered fulfilled, the Tribunal will address relevant issues relating to the admissibility of the claims (see section D below); and\n\n(iv) Finally, to the extent that the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it has, in principle, jurisdiction and that the claims are, in principle, admissible, it will address other procedural issues relevant for the conduct of the present proceedings (see section E below).\n\n**B. Legal Basis for the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIt is not contested between the Parties that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must be based on the relevant provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT as well as Article 25 ICSID Convention.102 What is, however, disputed is the scope of jurisdiction as deriving from these instruments and provisions.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7 308; R-MJ \u00a7 174, R-R-MJ \u00a7241.\n\n252.\n\nBefore entering into the analysis of the various jurisdictional and other procedural requirements for ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal considers it useful to briefly discuss the scope of application and effect of the relevant legal provisions. This will facilitate the determination of the specific scope of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence in the present dispute, which will serve as basis for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the jurisdictional requirements.\n\n**(1) Article 25 ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nTo recall, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n[....]\"\n\n254.\n\nArticle 25 ICSID Convention is generally understood as prescribing the following requirements for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\n255.\n\n*(i) Existence of a legal dispute:* The ICSID Convention does not provide for a definition of what constitutes a \"legal dispute.\" ICSID tribunals have generally defined this concept as referring to \"disputes regarding the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or to disputes regarding the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of a legal obligation.\"103 Similarly, the International Court of Justice defines a dispute as \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.\"104\n\nSee Reed/Paulsson/Blackaby, Guide to ICSID Arbitration, Kluwer International, 2004, p. 15. See also 2011 ed., p. 26.\n\nSee the case concerning East Timor, I.C.J. Reports 1995, pp. 89, 99. See also Schreuer, *op. cit.* fn.98, Ad Article 25 \u00a7 42 and references quoted in footnote n. 44.\n\n256.\n\n*(ii) A dispute arising directly out of an \"investment\":* In order to be subject to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction, the dispute must concern an \"investment\" and the claims put forward by either Party must arise directly from such investment. Again, the ICSID Convention does not provide for any definition or explanation of the terms \"arising directly out of\u2019 or \"an investment.\"105 Attempts by tribunals to define the concept of investments are numerous and will be examined further below when determining whether an investment may be deemed to exist in the present case (see \u00a7\u00a7 343 *et seq.* below).\n\nSchreuer, *op. cit.* fn.98, Ad Article 25 \u00a7 85.\n\n257.\n\n*(iii) A dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State:* The dispute must exist between a Host State having ratified the Convention and an investor of another State, having also ratified the Convention. With regard to the investor, the nationality requirement is understood to be two-fold, i.e., subject to a positive and a negative requirement: (i) the investor must possess the nationality of a Contracting State, and (ii) not simultaneously possess the nationality of the Host State. The fulfilment of the nationality requirement set forth in Article 25 is considered an objective condition to the Convention\u2019s application, which is not subject to the Contracting Parties\u2019 arrangement. Article 25(2) however, does not provide for a definition of the concept of nationality, which is according to general principles of international law left to the law of the State of which nationality is claimed. Article 25(2) merely provides certain clarifications as to the time at which the nationality requirement must be fulfilled, while drawing a distinction between natural persons and juridical persons. In addition, with regard to juridical persons, Article 25(2) provides the parties with the possibility to take into account foreign control over a juridical person when determining its nationality for the purposes of the Convention.\n\n258.\n\n*(iv) Existence of a written consent of both Parties:* In order for consent for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction to be given, a State must not only have generally consented to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention, it must also have consented to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction in the specific case at hand. This specific consent must then be matched by the consent of the concerned investor. Consent must be given in writing and be explicit. However, the Convention does not define the concept of written form, and in practice the form of such consent has evolved and may differ depending on the type, contractual- or treaty-based, of the dispute. Within the context of BIT-based arbitration, it is widely admitted that an arbitration clause contained in a BIT and providing for ICSID arbitration constitutes a valid written offer for ICSID arbitration by the relevant State. Actually, Article 8(3) of the BIT in the present case states with so many words: \"With this purpose and under this Agreement, each Contracting Party grants its anticipated and irrevocable consent that any dispute may be subject to arbitration.\" Such an offer of consent may be validly accepted by an investor through the initiation of ICSID proceedings.106\n\nSchreuer, *op. cit.* fn. 98, Ad Art. 25 \u00a7\u00a7 427 et seq., \u00a7 448; Reed/Paulsson/Blackaby, *op. cit.* fn. 103, p. 35.\n\n**(2) Argentina-Italy BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n259.\n\nOn 22 May 1990, the Republic of Italy and the Argentine Republic signed the Argentina-Italy BIT which entered into effect on 14 October 1990, and on which Claimants\u2019 claims as well as the Tribunal\u2019s competence are allegedly based.\n\n*(a) General Scope and Aim of the Argentina-Italy BIT*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nWith regard to the general purpose of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the preamble of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n261.\n\nIn its authentic Spanish version:\n\n\"[...]\n\nCon el deseo de crear condiciones favorables para una mayor cooperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica entre los dos Pa\u00edses y, en particular, para la realizaci\u00f3n de inversiones por inversores de una Parte Contratante en el territorio de la otra y;\n\nConsiderando que la \u00ednica manera de establecer y conservar un adecuado flujo internacional de capitales es a trav\u00e9s del mantenimiento de un clima satisfactorio para las inversiones dentro del respeto a las leyes del pa\u00eds receptor;\n\nReconociendo que la conclusi\u00f3n de un Acuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y la rec\u00edproca protecci\u00f3n de las inversiones contribuir\u00e1 a estimular las iniciativas empresariales que favorezcan la prosperidad de las dos Partes contratantes.\n\n[...]\"\n\n262.\n\nIn its authentic Italian version:\n\n\"[...]\n\ndesiderando creare condizioni favorevoli per una maggiore cooperazione economica fra i due Paesi ed, in particolare, per la realizzazione di investimenti da parte di investitori di una Parte Contraente nel territorio dell\u2019altra;\n\nconsiderando che l\u2019unico modo per stabilire e mantenere un adeguato flusso intemazionale di capitali consiste nell\u2019 assicurare un clima propizio agli investimenti, nel rispetto delle leggi del Paese ricevente;\n\nriconoscendo che la conclusione di un Accordo per la Promozione e la reciproca Protezione degli Investimenti contribuir\u00e0 a stimolare iniziative imprenditoriali idonee a favorire la prosperit\u00e0 delle due Parti Contraenti,\n\n[...]\"\n\n263.\n\nIn its unofficial English translation by Claimants:\n\n\"[...]\n\nDesiring to create favourable conditions for greater economic cooperation between the two States and, in particular, for the realization of investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party;\n\nConsidering that the only way of establishing and maintaining an appropriate international flow of capital is to ensure a favourable climate for investments, in compliance with the laws of the receiving State;\n\nRecognizing that entering into this Agreement on the Promotion and Protection of Investments will stimulate entrepreneurial intiatives which will increase the prosperity of both Contracting Parties.\n\n[...]\n\n264.\n\nIn accordance with this general aim of the BIT, the BIT is then construed as follows:\n\n(i) Article 1 provides for definitions of various key terms used throughout the BIT, including the terms \"investment,\" \"investor,\" \"returns\" and \"territory\";\n\n(ii) Articles 2 to 6 contemplate various standards of investment protection and promotion, including fair and equitable treatment to investors of the other Contracting Party (Article 2(2)), national treatment standard and most-favored nation principle (Article 3), compensation for damages or losses related to certain events (Article 4), protection against nationalization and expropriation (Article 5), assurance of the possibility to transfer and repatriate capital, revenues, considerations and compensation of damages (Article 6), while Article 7 extends such protection to subrogated parties;\n\n(iii) Articles 8 and 9 provide for a mechanism of settlement of disputes, Article 8 applying to disputes between investors and a Contracting Party (see \u00a7 267 below), and Article 9 applying to disputes between the Contracting Parties, i.e., Argentina and Italy;\n\n(iv) Article 10 contemplates the principle that if another applicable law or treaty provides for a more favorable treatment, such more favorable treatment shall apply;\n\n(v) Articles 11 to 13 are of a more technical nature and address questions of entry into force and duration of the BIT.\n\n265.\n\nIn addition to the core of the BIT, Argentina and Italy further signed an \"Additional Protocol,\" which provides specifications and clarifications concerning Articles 1 and 3 BIT:\n\n(i) With regard to Article 1 BIT and the concept of \"individual\" investor defined therein, the Additional Protocol provides for specific domiciliation requirements for individuals of a Contracting Party to benefit from the protection of the BIT;\n\n(ii) With regard to Article 3 (and Article 10) BIT and the principles of most favored nation and most favorable treatment contemplated therein, the Additional Protocol specifies the scope of application of these principles: (a) with regard to problems relating to the entry, stay, work and movement in each Contracting Party\u2019s territory of relevant citizens of the other Contracting Party and their families and (b) in general, by excluding from its scope of application \"investments made within facilitated credit set forth in bilateral agreements\" such as the Treaty signed in Rome on 10 December 1987 and establishing a Particular Association between Italy and Argentina and the General Treaty of Cooperation and Good Relationships signed in Madrid on 3 June 1988 between Argentina and Spain.\n\n266.\n\nIn summary, the Argentina-Italy BIT resembles other BITs concluded at that time and does not contain any \"out of the ordinary\" provision or principle.\n\n*(b) Article 8 BIT*\n-------------------\n\n267.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7 264), in Article 8 BIT, Argentina and Italy set forth the principles for settlement of disputes arising between investors of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, i.e., the Host State.\n\n268.\n\nArticles 8(1) through 8(9) BIT in the Spanish authentic text provides as follows:\n\n\"1. Toda controversia relativa a las inversiones que surja entre un inversor de una de las Partes Contratantes y la otra Parte, respecto a cuestiones reguladas por el presente Acuerdo ser\u00e1, en la medida de lo posible, solucionada por consultas amistosas entre las partes en la controversia.\n\n2. Si esas consultas no aportaran una soluci\u00f3n, la controversia podr\u00e1 ser sometida a la jurisdicci\u00f3n administrativa o judicial competente de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio est\u00e1 situada la inversi\u00f3n.\n\n3. Si todav\u00eda subsistiera una controversia entre inversores y una Parte Contratante, luego de transcurrido un plazo de dieciocho meses desde la notificaci\u00f3n del comienzo del procedimiento ante las jurisdicciones nacionales citadas en el p\u00e1rrafo 2, la controversia podr\u00e1 ser sometida a arbitraje internacional.\n\nA ese fin, y de conformidad con los t\u00e9rminos de este Acuerdo, cada Parte Contratante otorga por el presente su consentimiento anticipado e irrevocable para que toda controversia pueda ser sometida al arbitraje.\n\n4. A partir del momento en que se inicie un procedimiento arbitral, cada una de las partes en la controversia adoptar\u00e1 todas las medidas necesarias a fin de desistir de la instancia judicial en curso.\n\n5. En caso de recurrirse al arbitraje internacional, la controversia ser\u00e1 sometida, a elecci\u00f3n del inversor, a alguno de los \u00f3rganos de arbitraje designados a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\na) Al Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (C.I.A.D.I.) creado por el \u00abConvenio sobre el arreglo de diferencias relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y nacionales de otros Estados\u00bb, abierto a la firma en Washington el 18 de marzo de 1965, cuando cada Estado parte en el presente Acuerdo haya adherido a aqu\u00e9l. Mientras dicha condici\u00f3n no se cumpla, cada una de las Partes Contratantes da su consentimiento para que la controversia sea sometida al arbitraje de conformidad con el reglamento del Mecanismo Complementario de Conciliaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje del Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones.\n\nb) A un tribunal de arbitraje \"ad hoc\" establecido para cada caso. El Arbitraje se efectuar\u00e1 de acuerdo con el Reglamento Arbitral de la Comisi\u00f3n de la Naciones Unidas para el Derecho Mercantil Internacional (C.N.U.D.M.I.) al cual se refiere la Resoluci\u00f3n de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas No. 31/98 del 15 de diciembre de 1976. Los \u00e1rbitros ser\u00e1n tres. Si los mismos no son nacionales de la Partes Contratantes, deber\u00e1n ser nacionales de Estados que tengan relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas con ellas.\n\n6. Ninguna de la Partes Contratantes que sea parte en una controversia podr\u00e1 plantear, en ninguna etapa del proceso de arbitraje, ni de la ejecuci\u00f3n de una sentencia arbitral, excepciones basadas en el hecho que el inversor, parte contratante en la controversia, haya percibido una indemnizaci\u00f3n destinada a cubrir todo o parte de las p\u00e9rdidas sufridas, en cumplimento de una p\u00f3liza de seguro o de la garant\u00eda prevista en Art\u00edculo 7 del presente Acuerdo.\n\n7. El tribunal arbitral decidir\u00e1 sobre la base del derecho de la Parte Contratante parte en la controversia - incluyendo las normas de esta \u00faltima relativas a conflictos de leyes -, las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos particulares concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n los principios de derecho internacional en la materia.\n\n8.

Las Partes Contratantes se abstendr\u00e1n de tratar, a trav\u00e9s de los canales diplom\u00e1ticos, argumentos concernientes al arbitraje o a un proceso judicial ya en marcha hasta que los procedimientos correspondientes hubieran sido concluidos, salvo que las partes en la controversia no hubieran cumplido el laudo del tribunal arbitral o la sentencia del tribunal ordinario, seg\u00fan los t\u00e9rminos de cumplimiento establecidos en el laudo o en la sentencia.\"\n\n269.\n\nArticle 8(1) through 8(9) BIT in the Italian authentic text provides:\n\n\"1. Qualsiasi controversia relativa agli investimenti insorta tra una Parte Contraente ed un investitore dell\u2019altra, riguardo problemi regolati dal presente Accordo, sar\u00e0 per quanto possibile risolta mediante consultazioni amichevoli tra le parti in controversia medesime.\n\n2. Se tali consultazioni non consentissero una soluzione, la controversia potr\u00e0 essere sottoposta alla competente magistratura ordinaria od amministrativa della Parte Contraente nel cui territorio si trovi l\u2019investimento.\n\n3. Ove tra un a Parte Contraente ed investitori sussista ancora controversia, dopo trascorso un periodo di 18 mesi dalla notifica di inizio di una azione avanti le magistrature nazionali indicate al paragrafo 2, tale controversia potr\u00e0 essere sottoposta ad arbitrato intemazionale. A tale effetto ed ai sensi del presente Accordo, ciascuna Parte Contraente conferisce fin d\u2019ora consenso anticipato ed irrevocabile affinch\u00e9 qualsiasi controversia possa essere sottoposta all\u2019arbitrato.\n\n4. Pin dal momento in cui abbia avuto inizio un procedimento arbitrale, ciascuna delle parti nella controversia adotter\u00e0 ogni utile iniziativa intesa a desistere dall\u2019azione giudiziale in corso.\n\n5. In caso di ricorso all\u2019arbitrato intemazionale, la controversia sar\u00e0 sottoposta, a scelta dell\u2019investitore, a uno degli organismi di arbitrato qui di seguito indicati:\n\na. al Centro Intemazionale per la Risoluzione delle Controversie relative ad Investimenti (I.C.S.I.D.), istituito dalla Convenzione sul \"Regolamento delle Controversie relative agli investimenti tra Stati e cittadini di altri Stati\", aperta alla firma in Washington il 18 marzo 1965, qualora ognuno dei Paesi parte nel presente Accordo vi avesse aderito. Ove questa condizione non sussista, ciascuna delle Parti Contraenti conferisce il proprio consenso affinch\u00e9 la controversia sia sottoposta ad arbitrato, in conformit\u00e0 alla regolamentazione sui \"meccanismi\" aggiuntivi per la conciliazione e l\u2019arbitrato del Centro Intemazionale per il Regolamento delle Controversie relative ad Investimenti.\n\nb. Ad un Tribunale arbitrale \"ad hoc\" istituito caso per caso. L\u2019arbitrato si effettuer\u00e0 secondo il Regolamento Arbitrale della Commissione delle Nazioni Unite sul Diritto Commerciale Intemazionale (UNCITRAL), di cui alla Risoluzione dell\u2019Assemblea Generale delle Nazioni Unite 31/98 del 15 dicembre 1976: Gli arbitri saranno in numero di tre e, se non cittadini delle Parti Contraenti, dovranno essere cittadini di Paesi che abbiano relazioni diplomatiche con le Parti Contraenti.\n\n6. Nessuna delle Parti Contraenti, che sia parte in una controversia, potr\u00e0 sollevare in una fase della procedura di arbitrato n\u00e9 in sede di esecuzione di una sentenza di arbitrato, eccezioni basate sul fatto che un investitore parte avversa abbia, per effetto di una polizza di assicurazione o della garanzia prevista all\u2019Articolo 7 del presente Accordo, ricevuto un indennizzo destinato a coprire in tutto od in parte le perdite subite.\n\n7. Il Tribunale Arbitrale decider\u00e0 sulla base del diritto della Parte Contraente parte nella controversia - comprese le norme di quest\u2019ultima relativi ai conflitti di leggi -, delle disposizioni del presente Accordo, di clausole di eventuali particolari accordi relativi all investimento, nonch\u00e9 sulla base dei principi di diritto intemazionale applicabili in materia.\n\n8. Le sentenze arbitrali definitive vincolanti per le parti nella controversia. Ciascuna Parte Contraente si impegna ad eseguire le sentenze, in conformit\u00e0 alla propria legislazione nazionale ed alle Convenzioni intemazionali in materia vigenti per ambo le Parti Contraenti.\n\n9. Le parti Contraenti si asterranno dal trattare per via diplomatica argomenti attinenti ad un arbitrato od un procedimento giudiziario gi\u00e0 in corso, finch\u00e9 le procedure relative non siano concluse e le parti nella controversia non abbiano poi adempiuto al lodo del tribunale arbitrale od alla sentenza del competente tribunale interno, secondo i termini di adempimento stabiliti nel lodo o nella sentenza medesimi.\"\n\n270.\n\nArtide 8(1) through 8(9) BIT in Claimants\u2019 unofficial English translation provides:\n\n\"1. Any dispute in relation to the investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement shall be settled, if possible, by means of amicable consultation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute has not been settled in such consultation, it may be subject to the competent ordinary or administrative court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment is located.\n\n3. If, after 18 months from the notification of commencement of an action before the national courts indicated in the above paragraph 2, the dispute between the Contracting Party and the investors still continues to exist, it may be subject to international arbitration.\n\nWith this purpose and under this Agreement, each Contracting Party grants its anticipated and irrevocable consent that any dispute may be subject to arbitration.\n\n4. Since the commencement of the arbitration proceeding, each disputing party will adopt any initiative suitable to desist from the judicial action in course.\n\n5. In case of international arbitration, the dispute will be subject, upon choice of the investor, to one of the following arbitration bodies:\n\na) International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (I.C.S.I.D.), established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature in Washington on March 18, 1965, provided that both Contracting Parties are parties to the said Convention. If this condition is not satisfied, each of the Contracting Parties agrees that the dispute shall be subject to arbitration in compliance with the Additional Facility Rules for conciliation and arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\nb) Ad hoc arbitration tribunal. The arbitration will be carried out according to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), approved by the General Assembly Resolution 31/98 of December 15, 1976. There will be three arbitrators who, if not citizens of the Contracting Parties, must be the citizens of the countries with which the Contracting Parties have diplomatic relations.\n\n6. No Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute is allowed to raise, during the arbitration procedure or while the arbitration decision is being enforced, exceptions based on the fact that the investor involved in the dispute received, in force of an insurance policy or security provided under Art. 7 hereof, a compensation which covers, in whole or in part, the losses suffered.\n\n7. The arbitration tribunal will decide on the basis of the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on the conflict of laws - and of the provisions of the Agreement, of clauses of any particular agreements relating to the investment, as well as on the basis of the applicable principles of international law.\n\n8. The arbitration decisions will be definitive and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party undertakes to enforce the decisions in compliance with its national legislation and international conventions applicable to both Contracting Parties.\n\n9. The Contracting Parties will refrain from diplomatic negotiations on issues relating to an arbitration or judicial proceeding in course, until the related proceeding has not been concluded and the parties have not complied with the arbitration decision or the decision of the competent internal court according to the terms of performance provided in such arbitration or judicial decision.\"\n\n271.\n\nThus, whilst Article 8(1) firstly defines the scope of its application by referring to \"any dispute relating to the investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement,\" Article 8(1) to (3) then provides for three different settlement mechanisms: (i) amicable consultations (Article 8(1)), (ii) proceedings before the competent ordinary or administrative court of the Host State (Article 8(2)), and (iii) international arbitration (Article 8(3)).\n\n272.\n\nArticle 8(4) to 8(8) further contains supplementary principles applicable where a party initiates international arbitration proceedings, providing for either ICSID or *ad hoc* arbitration upon the choice of the investor (Article 8(5)), as well as for a choice of law in favor of the law of the Host State, the provisions of the BIT, as well as the applicable principles of international law (Article 8(7)). Article 8(9) finally prohibits the Contracting Parties from conducting diplomatic negotiations on issues relating to an ongoing litigation or arbitration.\n\n273.\n\nArticle 8 BIT is at the heart of the Parties\u2019 controversy regarding the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: The Parties not only disagree on the scope and nature of the disputes subject to the settlement mechanisms set forth in Article 8, but also on how these three mechanisms interact, and in particular whether some of them are a mandatory prerequisite to the coming into play of other mechanisms, and if so, whether or not they have been duly complied with.\n\n**(3) Relationship between Article 25 ICSID Convention and Article 8 BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) In General*\n----------------\n\n274.\n\nAs mentioned above, Article 8(5) BIT provides that in case of an international arbitration initiated under Article 8(3) BIT, the dispute would be subject, upon the choice of the investor, to either ICSID or *ad hoc* arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n275.\n\nIn other words, through the express designation of ICSID arbitration in Article 8 BIT, Italy and Argentina, which are both Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention, express their consent required under Article 25 ICSID Convention to submit specific disputes with nationals of each other to ICSID arbitration. The scope of this consent is therefore defined by and must be determined according to the relevant provisions of the BIT, and in particular by Article 8.\n\n276.\n\nIn this respect, the Parties disagree on the actual and admissible scope of this consent. They disagree on how these two provisions - Article 25 ICSID Convention and Article 8 BIT - interact, and in particular on whether Article 25 ICSID Convention sets forth the outer limits of the consent given under Article 8 BIT and, if so, whether the Parties\u2019 consent as expressed in Article 8 goes beyond these outer limits.\n\n*(b) With regard to the Subject Matter of the Dispute*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nAccording to Article 8(1) BIT, the settlement mechanism provided for in Article 8, including ICSID arbitration, applies to \"[a]ny dispute in relation to the investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement.\"\n\n278.\n\nThrough this phrase, Argentina and Italy defined the nature and kind of disputes that the Contracting Parties wished to submit to the dispute settlement mechanisms provided under Article 8, i.e., disputes \"in relation to the investments\" made \"in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement.\"\n\n279.\n\nInsofar as ICSID arbitration is concerned, this phrase arguably implements the requirements of Article 25 reserving ICSID jurisdiction to \"legal disputes arising directly out of an investment.\" To recall, Article 25(1) ICSID Convention provides as follows (see \u00a7 253 above):\n\n\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n(i) To the extent that the BIT provides an investor with specific rights for the protection of its investment, a dispute relating to the existence, scope or violation of such a right can be deemed a \"legal dispute\" in the sense of Article 25 ICSID Convention.\n\n(ii) To the extent that Article 8(1) requires a \"relation\" between the dispute and the investment, it would appear to implement the requirement of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention that only disputes arising \"directly out of an investment\" is subject to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. Now, it is true that Article 8(1) does not expressly provide for the need of \"directness\" between the investment and the dispute and merely requires the existence of a \"relation\" between them. The question thus arises whether such less restrictive wording may be considered going beyond ICSID\u2019s outer limits and should therefore be interpreted with due regard to the requirement of \"directness\" of such relationship. This question will be addressed in more detail below when determining the existence of a legal dispute arising out of the BIT (below \u00a7\u00a7 301 *et seq.).*\n\n*(c) With regard to the Parties*\n--------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7257), Article 25 ICSID Convention requires that the dispute at stake exists between a Host State having ratified the Convention and an investor of another Contracting State. To this extent, ICSID arbitration initiated under Article 8 BIT may only take place between the Host State, i.e., Argentina or Italy, and an investor of the other State\u2019s nationality. This is duly reflected in Article 8(1) BIT, which applies only to disputes between \"a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.\" As such, Article 8(1) BIT reflects the objective requirements of Article 25 ICSID Convention that the investor be of the nationality of a Contracting State other than the Host State.\n\n281.\n\nWith regard to the nationality of the investor, Article 25 ICSID does not provide for any specification as to when an investor is deemed to be of the nationality of a particular State. Thus, while the requirement that the investor be of the nationality of a Contracting State other than the Host State is an objective requirement, the criteria to determine whether such requirement is fulfilled are not set forth by the ICSID Convention and may therefore be further determined by the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n\n282.\n\nIn this respect, the BIT contains the following provision with regard to the nationality of an investor:\n\n\u2022 Article 1(2) BIT provides as follows:\n\n\"2. \"Investor\" shall mean any individual or corporation of one Contracting Party that has made, makes or undertakes to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\na) \"individual\" shall mean, for each Contracting Party, an individual who is a citizen of such Contracting Party, in compliance with the laws thereof;\n\nb) \"corporation\" shall mean, in relation to each Contracting Party, any entity incorporated in compliance with the legislation of a Contracting Party, having its office in the territory of such Party and being recognized thereby, such as public entities that conduct economic activities, partnerships and corporations, foundations and associations, independent of whether liability is limited or not. \"\n\n\u2022 Par. 1 of the Additional Protocol provides as follows:\n\n\"1. With reference to Article 1:\n\na) Individuals of each Contracting Party who, when making an investment, maintained their domicile for more than two years in the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment was made, cannot benefit of this Agreement.\n\nIf an individual of one Contracting Party maintains at the same time its registered residence in its State and domicile in the other State for more than two years, he/she will be considered equivalent, for the purposes of this Agreement, to individuals of the Contracting Party in the territory of which they made investments.\n\nb) The domicile of an investor will be determined in compliance with laws, regulations and provisions of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment was made.\"\n\n283.\n\nWhile Article 1(2) BIT focuses on the definition of the term of \"investor,\" the Additional Protocol sets forth further eligibility criteria for an investor to benefit from the protection offered by the BIT. As such, these provisions aim to define the general scope of application *rationae personae* of the BIT, including but not limited to issues of nationality.\n\n284.\n\nWithin this context, Article 1(2) BIT requires that the investor be (i) with regard to physical persons, an individual having citizenship of the other Contracting Party, according to the latter\u2019s laws, and (ii) with regard to corporations, a corporation being incorporated in the other Contracting Party\u2019s territory in accordance with its legislation.\n\n285.\n\nThus, the BIT provides that the question of whether an investor is an \"investor of the other Contracting Party\" in the sense of Article 8(1) BIT is subject to the law of the Contracting State of which nationality is claimed. This can be said to reflect Article 25 ICSID Convention, which does not impose any criteria with regard to the determination of the nationality.\n\n286.\n\nIn addition thereto, the Additional Protocol to the BIT sets forth further criteria of eligibility for an investor to benefit from the protection offered under the BIT, in particular domiciliation requirements, which are to be examined under the laws of the Host State, i.e., Argentina.\n\n287.\n\nIn summary, under the BIT, an investor must not only be of the nationality of the other Contracting Party, but it must further fulfil the domiciliation requirements of Par. 1 of the Additional Protocol.\n\n*(d) With regard to the Procedure to Be Followed*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7 271), Article 8 BIT provides for three different types of dispute settlement mechanisms and the Parties disagree on the scope and nature of the disputes subject to these mechanisms, as well as on the interaction of these three mechanisms. In particular, it is disputed between the Parties whether these three mechanisms are to be considered as mere alternatives or whether they provide for a sequential dispute resolution system implementing a mandatory three-steps mechanism, in which arbitration constitutes the ultimate step to be initiated only after completion of the first two steps.\n\n289.\n\nWhilst Article 25 ICSID Convention sets forth the requirements for the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, and the ICSID Arbitration Rules further set forth the specific rules to be followed in order to initiate arbitration proceedings falling under ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction, the ICSID framework is silent with regard to the question of whether such arbitration proceedings can be rendered conditional upon the fulfilment of further requirements, and if so, what are the effects of such additional requirements on ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction for handling of the case.\n\n290.\n\nWhether or not Article 8 BIT provided for additional requirements and whether these requirements should be deemed of such nature and importance to be an inseparable part of the Parties\u2019 consent will be addressed below when examining the existence and scope of the Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID jurisdiction (see \u00a7\u00a7 423 *et seq.* and \u00a7\u00a7 467 *et seq.* below).\n\n**(4) Other Relevant Legal Provisions and Principles**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal takes guidance from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\") in particular Article 31 (\"General rule of interpretation\") and 32 (\"Supplementary means of interpretation\").\n\n292.\n\nAs already mentioned in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3 of 27 January 2010, this Tribunal shares the generally accepted view that the decisions of ICSID tribunals, like those of other investment dispute settlement mechanisms, are not legally binding precedents. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider itself bound by previous decisions of other international tribunals.\n\n293.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is also of the opinion that, subject to the specific provisions of a treaty in question and of the circumstances of the actual case, it should pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals, where it believes that such consideration is appropriate in the light of the specific factual and legal context of the case and the persuasiveness of the legal reasoning of these earlier decisions.107\n\nOn the precedential value of ICSID decisions, *see* Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse? Freshfields lecture 2006, in Arbitration International Vol. 23 (2007) No. 3, pp. 368 *et seq:,* see also August Reinisch, The Role of Precedents in ICSID Arbitration, in Austrian Arbitration Yearbook 495-510 (2008).\n\n**(5) ICSID, BIT and Mass Claims**\n----------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe present proceedings are particular insofar as they gathered as of the date of their initiation, on Claimants\u2019 side, over 180,000 individuals and corporations. In the light of this figure, the present proceedings can be qualified as \"mass claims\" proceedings. The same remains true despite the recent withdrawal of several thousands of Claimants, thereby reducing the number of remaining Claimants to approximately 60,000 (see \u00a7 216 above), subject to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on whether such \"withdrawal\" is admissible.\n\n295.\n\nWhile it has happened in the past that multiple claimants initiated ICSID arbitration proceedings, this appears to be the first case in ICSID\u2019s history that \"mass claims\" are brought before it.\n\n296.\n\nIt is undeniable that the large number of Claimants raises a series of questions and challenges. In particular, the large number of Claimants makes it impossible to treat and examine each of the 180,000 claims (or 60,000 claims for that matter) as if it were a single claim, and certain generalisations and/or group examinations will be unavoidable. The question thus arises whether these or any other relevant characteristics of the present \"mass claims\" which will be addressed further below, may constitute a hurdle to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and/or to the admissibility of the claims (see \u00a7\u00a7 480 and \u00a7\u00a7 515 *et seq.).*\n\n297.\n\nNeither the ICSID framework nor the BIT addresses the issue of such mass proceedings and therefore fail to provide a clear answer to this question. Also, the Parties disagree on how this silence should be interpreted and what it means with regard to the present mass proceedings. While Respondent argues that, in the light of their characteristics, mass proceedings are contrary to the system of ICSID arbitration and were not covered by Respondent\u2019s consent, Claimants, in contrast, hold the view that the \"mass\" aspect of the claim is a mere procedural aspect, which does not raise any issues of consent or jurisdiction, and which can thus be duly addressed by the arbitrators under their usual power to rule upon the procedure of the arbitration.\n\n298.\n\nConsequently, the issue of the \"mass claims\" will have to be addressed under a two-fold approach: first, within the context of the Parties\u2019 consent (see \u00a7\u00a7 480 *et* *seq.* below), and secondly, within the context of admissibility of the present proceedings (see \u00a7\u00a7 506, 515 *et seq.* below).\n\n**C. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introductory Remarks**\n----------------------------\n\n299.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7 250(ii) above), this section will deal with the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the claims. In particular, it will focus on examining whether the four basic conditions for jurisdiction are given. If so, the Tribunal will deal with issues of admissibility in the next section.\n\n300.\n\nThus, after dealing with the nature of the dispute and examining whether it arises out of the BIT ((2)) and relates to an \"investment\" (jurisdiction *rationae materiae)* ((3)), the Tribunal will address relevant issues of nationality, capacity and characteristics of the Parties involved (jurisdiction *rationae personae)* ((4)), before examining the existence and scope of Claimants\u2019 and then Argentina\u2019s consent ((5) &(6)).\n\n**(2) Legal Dispute Arising out of the BIT - Issues 7 & 6**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues at Stake and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nIt is uncontested between the Parties, that there is a dispute which can be considered a \"legal dispute\" in the sense of Article 25 ICSID Convention. What is contested between the Parties is whether this legal dispute arises out of rights and obligations contemplated in the BIT, or whether they are of a mere contractual nature arising out of the relevant bond documents relating to the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements. In other words, the Parties disagree whether the claims submitted to this Tribunal fall within the scope of protection of the BIT.\n\n302.\n\nThus, the issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- Do the present claims arise out of the BIT, i.e., are they so-called treaty claims or, on the contrary, pure contract claims or claims of another nature? (see Issue No. 7 of the List of 11 Issues of May 9, 2008)\n\n- What, if any, are the consequences of this determination? In particular:\n\n(i) If they are treaty claims, would the alleged facts, if proven, possibly constitue a treaty violation?\n\n(ii) If they are contract claims or claims of another nature, or in case of a treaty claim where the alleged facts would not constitue a violation of the treaty, can their case still be heard based on the MFN Clause of Article 3(1) BIT in connection with the Umbrella Clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT? (See Issue No. 6 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n303.\n\nIn this context, it is to be recalled that according to generally accepted practice, the task of the Tribunal at the stage of determining whether it has jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established, are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.108 In performing this task, the Tribunal applies a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on its face. In the words of the tribunal in *Saipem v. Bangladesh:* \"If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction [rationae materiae] will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.\"109\n\n*Saipem S.p.A, v. The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 84 *et seq.* (hereinafter *\"Saipem\").*\n\n*Saipem,* \u00a7 91.\n\n304.\n\nThe key legal provisions and documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the BIT, Article 7(3) of the Argentina-Chile BIT, as well as the relevant bond documents, including but not limited to the Subscription Agreements between the subscribers and Argentina,110 the Syndication Agreements between the syndicate of banks and Argentina,111 the sales contracts between the commercial banks and the final purchaser of the securities, as well as the Offering Circulars of the relevant bonds,112 their Terms and Conditions, and other documents related to the bonds.113\n\nSee e.g. Exh. C-122 and RF-18.\n\nSee e.g. Exh. C-123, C-350 and C-353.\n\nSee e.g. Bond 1 Offering Circular Exh. C-l.\n\nSee e.g. Trust Deed Exh. C-93, Fiscal Agency Agreement Exh. C-95, etc.\n\n305.\n\nIn particular, Article 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT in the unofficial English translation submitted by Claimants provides as follows:\n\n\"1. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments made by the investors of the other Contracting Party, returns and other assets relating to such investments, as well as all other issues governed by this Agreement, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or the investors of third States.\n\n2. The provision of paragraph 1 hereof does not apply to advantages and privileges that one Contracting Party accords or will accord to third countries as a consequence of its participation in customs or economic unions, common market associations, free exchange zones or as a consequence of regional or sub-regional agreements, multilateral international economic treaties or treaties against double taxation, other tax treaties or treaties aimed at simplifying cross-border exchanges.\"\n\n306.\n\nArticle 7(2) of the Argentina-Chile BIT in the unofficial English translation submitted by Claimants further provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation that it has entered into in relation to the investments of nationals of companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory.\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n307.\n\n*Respondent\u2019s Position.* Respondent contests that the present claims are \"treaty claims\" falling under the scope of protection of the BIT. Respondent supports this position with the following main arguments:\n\n(i) The operative facts of which Claimants complain are simply those attendant to non-payment under the bonds, i.e., to a contractual claim, which do not fall under the scope of protection of the BIT. None of the sovereign acts Claimants rely upon is capable of falling within the substantive protection of the BIT, because those acts did not and could not impair the rights represented by Claimants\u2019 security entitlements since they were not created and are not governed by Argentine law and are enforceable outside Argentina.114\n\n(ii) Under such circumstances the Tribunal simply lacks jurisdiction, and such jurisdiction may not be extended through an import of the Umbrella Clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT based on the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.115\n\n- First, the MFN clause cannot override core matters (such as an Umbrella Clause) which must be subject to specific negotiations between the Contracting Parties.\n\n- Second, Articles 1, 3 and 8 BIT are limited to \"matters regulated in this Agreement,\" and the tribunal would thus have no jurisdiction over claims based on standards not regulated in the BIT, such as an Umbrella Clause. The MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT cannot be construed to extend the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to categories of disputes beyond those set forth in the jurisdictional clause of the basic treaty. Claimants are seeking to establish jurisdiction over a type of claim not covered by the grant of jurisdiction of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n- Third, the MFN treatment granted in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is limited to \"treatment in Argentina\u2019s territory.\" Argentina\u2019s obligations under the bonds would not qualify as \"treatment in Argentina\u2019s territory\" in the light of the foreign forum selection clauses contained in the bond documents, and would therefore not qualify for MFN treatment.\n\n- Finally, based on Article 8(7) BIT which requires to give due regard to \"the terms of any particular agreement entered into regarding the investment,\" Claimants cannot rely on the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT to override the contractually agreed fora contained in the bond documents.\n\nR-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 363 *et seq.*\n\nR-R-MJ, \u00a7\u00a7 543 *et seq.*\n\n308.\n\nAlternatively, in the event Claimants\u2019 claims were considered treaty claims, Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to establish a *prima facie* breach of the BIT by Respondent. In this respect, Respondent contends that a mere invocation of various BIT provisions, as done by Claimants, may not suffice to satisfy the *prima facie* standard as otherwise the standard would be meaningless.116 Respondent insists that Argentina is not a rogue debtor, that the 2001 crisis was unprecedented and could not be resolved merely through economic reform, that Argentina\u2019s actions were in accord with the actions of other sovereign debtors, and that there was no bad faith on Argentina\u2019s side.117\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 528-529.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 46 *et seq.,* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 68 *et seq.*\n\n309.\n\n*Claimants\u2019 Position.* In contrast, Claimants contend that the present claims are sufficiently established as treaty claims deriving from violations of the BIT and arising from sovereign acts of Argentina:118\n\n(i) Claimants need at this stage only present plausible treaty claims capable of falling within the scope of the BIT in order to establish jurisdiction.\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 claims are directed at Respondent\u2019s failure to meet its international law obligations, and in particular its obligations under the BIT, based on Argentina\u2019s exercise of sovereign authority. This is duly reflected and supported in their submissions. These claims are therefore sufficiently established as treaty claims for the purpose of the jurisdictional phase.\n\n(iii) These treaty claims are distinct from and their nature unaltered by any contract claims they may have against Argentina.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 656-661; C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 355 et *seq.*\n\n310.\n\nAlternatively, in the event Claimants\u2019 claims were considered contractual claims, Claimants contend that these claims would fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the scope of protection offered under the Argentina-Italy BIT through the operation of the MFN clause of Article 3(1) allowing Claimants to invoke the Umbrella Clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT: A breach of the Umbrella Clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT would simultaneously constitute a breach of the MFN clause of Article 3(1) Argentina-Italy BIT, which in turn clearly constitutes a \"matter regulated in this agreement\" in the sense of Article 8 BIT and therefore falls within the scope of jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) Alleged Breaches of the BIT\n-------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 302-303), for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction its task at the stage of determining whether it has jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established, are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which have been invoked and that in performing this task, the Tribunal is to apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on its face.\n\n312.\n\nClaimants allege the following breaches by Respondent of various provisions of the BIT, in particular of Articles 2, 3 and 5:119\n\n(i) The violation by Argentina of its obligations under Article 2(2) BIT to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by ignoring any concept of proportionality in responding to its temporary financial crisis and continuing to impose through arbitrary legislative and other regulatory actions an unjust excessive burden on Claimants long after the abatement of any issues;120\n\n(ii) The violation by Argentina of its obligations under Article 2(2) BIT to abstain from adopting discriminatory measures that impair the enjoyment of Claimants\u2019 investments, by discriminating between Claimants (and other international investors) on the one hand, and domestic investors in Argentine pension funds on the other hand, by shielding such domestic investors from the negative impact on their investments of Argentina\u2019s acts surrounding its financial restructuring;121\n\n(iii) The violation by Argentina of its obligation under Article 3(1) BIT to provide national treatment to Claimants, by providing a more favorable treatment to its domestic investors, in particular its pension funds, than to Claimants, shielding the former from some of the economic effects of the moratorium whilst not extending these advantages to the Claimants;122\n\n(iv) The violation by Argentina of its obligation under Article 5 BIT not to expropriate Claimants\u2019 investments without payment of adequate, effective and immediate compensation, by expropriating Claimants of their investment through the unilateral restructuring of its public debt and the enactment of legislation thereby destroying the value of Claimants\u2019 investment;123\n\n(v) The violation by Argentina of its obligation under Article 3(1) BIT to accord most-favored nation treatment to Claimants\u2019 investments and in connection with Article 7(2) Argentina-Chile BIT, according to which Argentina undertook to observe any other obligation that it has entered into in relation to the investments of nationals of the other contracting party. By not respecting its obligations under the bonds, Argentina would have violated Article 7(2) Argentina-Chile BIT, which in turn, constitutes a violation of Article 3(1) Argentina-Italy BIT.124\n\nRfA, Section V, \u00a7\u00a7 179-211.\n\nRfA, Section V, \u00a7 186.\n\nRfA \u00a7 190.\n\nRfA \u00a7\u00a7 193-104.\n\nRfA \u00a7\u00a7 196-198.\n\nRfA \u00a7\u00a7 1 *99 et seq.*\n\n313.\n\nThe facts on which Claimants base their above allegations relate to the acts of Argentina preceding and following its public default in December 2001, and in particular the way it consulted with its creditors, the way it reached a decision on how to deal with its foreign debt, and the nature, scope and effects on Claimants\u2019 security entitlements of the legislation and regulations it promulgated in implementation of its decision.\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, *prima facie,* these facts, if established, are susceptible of constituting a possible violation of at least some of the provisions of the BIT invoked by Claimants, particularly:\n\n(i) The arbitrary promulgation and implementation of regulations and laws can, under certain circumstances, amount to an unfair and inequitable treatment. It may even further constitute an act of expropriation where the new regulations and/or laws deprive an investor from the value of its investment or from the returns thereof.\n\n(ii) The allegations by Claimants with regard to different treatment afforded to domestic investors, such as Argentine pension funds, are susceptible of constituting a discriminatory treatment in breach of the obligation to refrain from discriminatory measures and to provide for national treatment.\n\n315.\n\nConsequently, it is sufficient to note - at this stage - that the facts as presented by Claimants, if proven, are susceptible of constituting a violation of the BIT provisions invoked by Claimants. Whether Claimants\u2019 presentation of the facts is accurate will, if necessary, be examined during the merits stage of these proceedings.\n\n(ii) Contract Claims v. Treaty Claims\n-------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nIt is in principle admitted that with respect to a BIT claim an arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction where the claim at stake is a pure contract claim. This is because a BIT is not meant to correct or replace contractual remedies, and in particular it is not meant to serve as a substitute to judicial or arbitral proceedings arising from contract claims. Within the context of claims arising from a contractual relationship, the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in relation to BIT claims is in principle only given where, in addition to the alleged breach of contract, the Host State further breaches obligations it undertook under a relevant treaty. Pure contract claims must be brought before the competent organ, which derives its jurisdiction from the contract, and such organ - be it a court or an arbitral tribunal - can and must hear the claim in its entirety and decide thereon based on the contract only.\n\n317.\n\nAs an exception to this principle, a BIT sometimes provides for a so-called \"Umbrella Clause,\" which requires a State to observe any obligation arising from particular commitments it has entered into with regard to investments.125 Under a broad - and not undisputed - interpretation of these clauses as adopted by some arbitral tribunals and scholars, a State\u2019s breach of contract with a foreign investor or breach of an obligation under another treaty or law becomes, by virtue of an Umbrella Clause contained in the relevant BIT, a breach of the BIT actionable through the mechanism provided in such treaty, i.e., through ICSID arbitration.126 The present Argentina-Italy BIT does not contain such Umbrella Clause. Nevertheless, Claimants contend that, based on the MFN clause of Article 3 of the BIT, they are entitled to invoke and rely on the Umbrella Clause contained in the subsequent Argentina-Chile BIT. This theory, however, only applies in case the Tribunal considers that the claims at stake are pure contract claims.\n\nEthan Shenkman / Jason File, Contract Claims in Investment Treaty Arbitrations: Recent Umbrella Clause Case Developments, in The International Comparative Legal Guide to: International Arbitration, Global Legal Group Ltd., 6th edition 2009, p. L.\n\nSee, e.g., Shenkman/File, *op. cit.* fn.125, p. 1 et seq.; Kim Rooney, ICSID and BIT Arbitrations in China, in Journal of International Arbitration, Vol. 24, No. 6 (2007), p. 695; Edward Baldwin / Mark Kantor / Michael Nolan, Limits to Enforcement of ICSID Awards, in Journal of International Arbitration, Vol. 23, No. 1 (2006), pp. 3 et seq.; Emmanuel Gaillard, Investment Treaty Arbitration and Jurisdiction over Contractual Claims. The SGS Cases Considered, in Todd Weiler (ed.), International Investment Law and Arbitration, Leading Casese from the ICSID, NAFTA, Bilateral Treaties and Customary International Law, Cameron May, 2005, pp. 325 et seq. and 336 et seq.\n\n318.\n\nA claim is to be considered a pure contract claim where the Host State, party to a specific contract, breaches obligations arising by the sole virtue of such contract. This is not the case where the equilibrium of the contract and the provisions contained therein are unilaterally altered by a sovereign act of the Host State. This applies where the circumstances and/or the behavior of the Host State appear to derive from its exercise of sovereign State power. Whilst the exercise of such power may have an impact on the contract and its equilibrium, its origin and nature are totally foreign to the contract.\n\n319.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimants, as owners of security entitlements, have a potential contract claim against Argentina for payment of the principal amount and interest of such security entitlement.127 This relationship is of a private and contractual nature, subject to the terms and conditions of the bonds, which vary depending on the bond series. The terms and conditions of the relevant bonds provide for forum selection clauses, whereby the specific fora again vary from one series of bond to another.\n\nSee Annex A to R-PHB \u00a7 8, although the Parties disagree with regard to the conditions for the exercise of such claims..\n\n320.\n\nIt is undisputed that Argentina, as debtor of the bonds, has failed to perform its obligations under these bonds. Argentina may (or may not) thereby have breached contractual obligations towards Claimants or other owners of security entitlements; this question is not at stake here. What is, however, relevant is that Argentina justifies its failure based on the exceptional circumstances surrounding its public default and linked to its devastating financial situation at the end of 2001. The Emergency Law that Argentina enacted thereafter was a reaction to these circumstances and part of an attempt to redress the finances of Argentina.\n\n321.\n\nThe Emergency Law had the effect of unilaterally modifying Argentina\u2019s payment obligations, whether arising from the concerned bonds or from other debts. Argentina does not contend that it had any contractual right of doing so, such as for example, a force majeure provision. Argentina has not invoked any contractual or legal provision excusing its non-performance of its contractual obligations towards Claimants. In fact, Argentina relies and justifies its non-performance based on its situation of insolvency, which has nothing to do with any specific contract.\n\n322.\n\nIt is true that an insolvent debtor may in principle benefit from special regimes such as bankruptcy or other mechanisms of financial redress, and such mechanisms can very well affect the way a contract is performed by partially or fully liberating the debtor from its obligations thereunder. However, such a mechanism is subject to specific rules and conditions. First of all, it requires a legal basis contemplating the basic principle and then providing for its implementation through the designation of competent authorities, the formulation of a specific procedure taking into account both the debtor\u2019s and the creditors\u2019 interests, and the provision of distribution principles of the debtor\u2019s assets with regard to the entirety of the creditors\u2019 group and not just with regard to a specific contract or creditor.\n\n323.\n\nIn the present case, the situation is somewhat peculiar, since the debtor is a sovereign State. Argentina, which considered itself insolvent, decided to promulgate a law entitling it not to perform part of its obligations, which Argentina had undertaken prior to such law, and fixing sovereignly the modalities and terms of such liberation. Such a behavior derives from Argentina\u2019s exercise of sovereign power. Thus, what Argentina did, it did based on its sovereign power; it is neither based on nor does it derive from any contractual argument or mechanism.\n\n324.\n\nIn other words, the present dispute does not derive from the mere fact that Argentina failed to perform its payment obligations under the bonds but from the fact that it intervened as a sovereign by virtue of its State power to modify its payment obligations towards its creditors in general, encompassing but not limited to the Claimants.\n\n325.\n\nWhilst it is true that there exists no international bankruptcy regime for States, certain principles have nevertheless been developed by the international community with regard to sovereign debt restructuring. The scope and content of these principles, as well as the question whether or not Argentina complied with these principles are matters relating to the merits of the present dispute and are, at this stage, not relevant. It is only relevant to note that the dispute, and in particular Claimants\u2019 claims and Argentina\u2019s defense thereto, relate to the actions Argentina took in order to remedy its financial insolvency. Such actions were based on a sovereign decision of Argentina outside of a contractual framework. Thus, Argentina\u2019s actions were the expression of State power and not of rights or obligations Argentina had as a debtor under a specific contract.\n\n326.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal considers that the claims brought forward by Claimants in the present arbitration are not pure contractual claims but treaty claims based on acts of a sovereign, which Claimants allege are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\n\n(iii) Potential Contract Claims against the Italian Banks\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nRespondent repeatedly brought forward that Claimants\u2019 claims against Argentina are \"covered-up\" contract claims, which should actually be directed against the banks and not against Argentina. Whether or not Claimants may have any contractual or other claims against the Italian banks, who acted as Intermediaries or Participants in the bond distribution process (see \u00a7 18 above), is irrelevant.\n\n328.\n\nThe present proceedings focus solely on whether Argentina complied with its obligations of protection and promotion of Italian investments under the BIT. In other words, it only concerns the direct relationship between Argentina (the Host State) and the Claimants (the alleged investors) as arising out of the BIT, and not their relationship as arising out of the bond distribution process under the relevant contractual bond documents, which involve other actors such as the banks.\n\n329.\n\nFor the purpose of examining Claimants\u2019 rights and Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT, third parties such as banks intervening in the process of the bond issuance and distribution are to be considered auxiliaries of Argentina, who helped the latter create the basis for Claimants\u2019 alleged investment.\n\n330.\n\nIf such third parties, in particular the Italian banks, have breached any of their own obligations towards Argentina and/or the Claimants, redress can be sought by either Argentina and/or Claimants against these banks under the remedies provided for in the relevant contractual bond documents or in the applicable statutory laws and/or regulations concerning purchase and sale of securities. Such liability, however, does not seem to derive from the BIT and would therefore in principle have no place in the present proceedings.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n331.\n\nIn conclusion, and in response to Issue No. 7, the Tribunal holds that the claims at stake are treaty claims in nature and fall under the scope of the BIT and therewith under the jurisdiction *rationae materiae* of the Tribunal, and in particular:\n\n(i) The allegations of Claimants and the facts on which these allegations are based are susceptible of constituting a violation of provisions of the BIT and establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with regard to the present claims;\n\n(ii) The claims brought forward by Claimants in the present arbitration are not pure contractual claims but treaty claims based on acts of Argentina, a sovereign, which Claimants allege are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT;\n\n(iii) If third parties, in particular the Italian banks, have breached any of their own obligations towards Argentina and/or the Claimants, redress can be sought by either Argentina and/or Claimants against these banks under the remedies provided for in the relevant contractual bond documents or in the applicable statutory laws and/or regulations concerning purchase and sale of securities. Such liability, however, does not seem to derive from the BIT and would therefore in principle have no place in the present proceedings.\n\n332.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary anymore to examine Issue No. 6, i.e., whether the Tribunal may also have jurisdiction based on the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT in connection with the MFN Clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT. To the extent that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction already derives from the treaty nature of the claims at stake, the question of the interaction between the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT and the MFN Clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT becomes moot.\n\n**(3) Legal Dispute relating to an Investment - Issues 9 & 8**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nIt is uncontested between the Parties that Claimants\u2019 claims arise in connection with their security entitlements in the relevant Argentine bonds. However, the Parties disagree whether these claims can be considered arising out of an investment within the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, since Respondent contests that the security entitlements at stake constitute investments in the sense of Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.\n\n334.\n\nThus, the issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- Analyzing the term \"investment\" as defined in Article 1(1) BIT and establishing whether bonds and thereto related security entitlements fall within the scope of such definition (see Issue No. 9 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008).\n\n- If so, it may possibly have to be determined whether such definition is in line with the spirit of the term \"investment\" in Article 25 ICSID Convention.\n\n- If so, determining whether the investment was made:\n\n(i) \"in compliance with the law,\"\n\n(ii) \"in the territory of Argentina,\" and\n\n(iii) in this respect determining whether the forum selection clauses influence the place where the alleged investment is deemed to have been made (see Issue No. 8 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008).\n\n335.\n\nThe key legal provisions in dealing with the above issues are the following: Articles 1(1), 8 BIT (see \u00a7\u00a7 268-270 above), Article 25 ICSID Convention, as well as the forum selection clauses contained in the relevant bond documents.128\n\nSee e.g. RF-5, Trust Deed \u00a7 17.2; see also Exh. RF-6, 1993 FAA \u00a7 20; Exh. RF-7, 1994 FAA \u00a7 22, Exh. RF-8, Swiss Bond Prospectus \u00a7 13, etc..\n\n336.\n\nIn particular, Article 1(1) BIT in the unofficial English translation submitted by Claimants provides:\n\n\"Article 1\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. \"Investment\" shall mean, in compliance with the legislation of the receiving State and independent of the legal form adopted or of any other legislation of reference, any conferment or asset invested or reinvested by an individual or corporation of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in compliance with the laws and regulations of the latter party.\n\nIn particular, investment includes, without limitation:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as collateral securities over the property of third parties - to the extent they may be used for investment;\n\n(b) shares, quotas and other holdings, including minority or indirect holdings, in companies incorporated in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties;\n\n(c) bonds, private or public financial instruments or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues;\n\n(d) credits which are directly related to an investment, lawfully created and documented pursuant to the legislation in force in the State where the investment is made;\n\n(e) copyrights, intellectual or industrial property rights - such as patents, licenses, registered trademarks, secrets, industrial models and designs -as well as technical\n\n(f) processes, transferrals of technological know-how, registered business names and goodwill;\n\n(g) any right of economic nature conferred under any law or agreement, as well as any license and concession granted in compliance with the applicable provisions governing the performance of the related economic activities, including prospecting, cultivating, extracting and exploiting of natural resources.\"129\n\nThe English text of the BIT differs from the Italian and Spanish text of the BIT in that Article 1(g) in the English text of the BIT is equal to Article 1(f) in the Italian and Spanish text and a part of Article 1(e) of the Italian and Spanish text, namely, \"processes, transferals of technological knowhow, registered business names and goodwill\" is included in the English text of the BIT as Article 1(f). In the Tribunal\u2019s view the omission in Article 1(e) and addition of a further sub-paragraph in Article 1 of the English text BIT appears to be a mistake. Therefore, the Tribunal relies on the Italian and Spanish text of the BIT as being equally authentic.\n\n337.\n\nIn comparison thereto, Article 1(1) BIT as published in the Boletin Oficial de la Republica Argentina No. 27,480 of 25 September 1992 provides as follows:\n\n\"ARTICULO 1\n\nDefiniciones\n\nA los fines del presente Acuerdo:\n\n1. El t\u00e9rmino \"inversi\u00f3n\" designa, de conformidad con el ordenamiento jur\u00eddico del pa\u00eds receptor e independientemente de la forma jur\u00eddica elegida o de cualquier otro ordenamiento jur\u00eddico de conexi\u00f3n, todo aporte o bien invertido o reinvertido por personas f\u00edsicas o jur\u00eddicas de una Parte Contratante en el territorio de la otra, de acuerdo a las leyes y reglamentos de esta \u00faltima.\n\nEn este marco general, son considerados en particular como inversiones, aunque no en forma exclusiva:\n\n(a) bienes muebles e inmuebles, como tambi\u00e9n cualquier otro derecho \"in rem\", incluidos-en cuanto sean utilizables para inversiones\u2014los derechos reales de garant\u00eda sobre propiedad de terceros;\n\n(b) acciones, cuotas societarias y toda otra forma de participaci\u00f3n, aun minoritaria o indirecta en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes;\n\n(c) obligaciones, t\u00edtulos p\u00fablicos o privados o cualquier otro derecho a prestaciones o servicios que tengan un valor econ\u00f3mico, como tambi\u00e9n las ganancias capitalizadas;\n\n(d) cr\u00e9ditos directamente vinculados a una inversi\u00f3n, regularmente contra\u00eddos y documentados seg\u00fan las disposiciones vigentes en el pa\u00eds donde esa inversi\u00f3n sea realizada;\n\n(f) derechos de autor, de propiedad industrial o intelectual -tales como patentes de invenci\u00f3n; licencias; marcas registradas; secretos, modelos y dise\u00f1os industriales\u2014, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n procedimientos t\u00e9cnicos, transferencias de conocimientos tecnol\u00f3gicos, nombres registrados y valor llave;\n\n(g) cualquier derecho de tipo econ\u00f3mico conferido por ley o por contrato y cualquier licencia o concesi\u00f3n de acuerdo con las disposiciones vigentes que regulan estas actividades econ\u00f3micas, incluyendo la prospecci\u00f3n, cultivo, extracci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales.\"\n\n338.\n\nAs to the official Italian version of Article 1(1) BIT, it provides as follows:\n\n\"Articolo 1\n\nDefinizioni\n\nAi fini del presente Accordo:\n\n1. Per investimento si intende, conformemente all\u2019ordinamento giuridico del Paese rice vente ed indipendentemente dalla forma giuridica prescelta o da qualsiasi altro ordinamento giuridico di riferimento, ogni conferimento o bene investito o reinvestito da persona fisica o giuridica di una Parte Contraente nel territorio dell\u2019altra, in conformit\u00e0 alle leggi e regolamenti di quest\u2019ultima.\n\nIn tale contesto di carattere generale, sono considerati specificamente come investimenti, anche se non in forma esclusiva:\n\na. beni mobili ed immobili, nonch\u00e9 ogni altro diritto in rem, compresi -per quanto impiegabili per investimento - i diritti reali di garanzia su propriet\u00e0 di terzi;\n\nb. azioni, quote societarie e ogni altra forma di partecipazione, anche se minoritaria o indiretta, in societ\u00e0 costituite nel territorio di un delle Parti Contraenti;\n\nc. obbligazioni, titoli pubblici o privati o qualsiasi altro diritto per prestazioni o servizi che abbiano un valore economico, come altres\u00ec redditi capitalizzati;\n\nd. crediti direttamente collegati ad un investimento, regolarmente assunti e documentati secondo le disposizioni vigenti nel Paese in cui tale investimento sia effettuato;\n\ne. diritti d\u2019autore, di propriet\u00e0 industriale od intellettuale - quali brevetti di invenzione; licenze; marchi registrati; segreti, modelli e designs industriali -nonch\u00e9 procedimenti tecnici, trasferimenti di conoscenze tecnologiche, denominazioni registrate e l\u2019avviamento;\n\nf. ogni diritto di natura economica conferito per legge o per contratto, nonch\u00e9 ogni licenza e concessione rilasciata in conformit\u00e0 a disposizioni vigenti per l\u2019esercizio delle relative attivit\u00e0 economiche, comprese quelle di prospezione, coltivazione, estrazione e sfruttamento di risorse naturali.\"\n\n339.\n\nTo recall (see \u00a7 270 above), Article 8(7) BIT provides as follows:\n\n\"The arbitration tribunal will decide on the basis of the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on the conflict of laws - and of the provisions of the Agreement, of clauses of any particular agreements relating to the investment, as well as on the basis of the applicable principles of international law.\"\n\n340.\n\nThe relevant bond documents contained forum selection clauses, according to which disputes arising out of the bonds and thereto related titles, such as coupons, were submitted to the jurisdiction of specific courts of various different countries and cities. Below are two examples of such forum selection clauses:\n\n- From the Swiss Bond Prospectus (RF-8, \u00a7 13):\n\n\"Any dispute which might arise between Bondholders and/or Couponholders on the one hand and the Republic on the other hand regarding the Permanent Global Certificate, the Bonds and/or the Coupons shall be settled in accordance with Swiss law and falls within the jurisdiction of the Ordinary Courts of the Canton of Geneva, the place of jurisdidion being Geneva, with the right of appeal to the Swiss Federal Court of Justice in Lausanne, where the law permits, whose decision shall be final. Only for that purpose and for the purpose of execution in Switzerland, the Republic elects legal and special domicile at the Embassy of the Republic of Argentina, Jungfraustrasse 1, 3005 Bern, Switzerland, which has agreed forthwith to notify the Republic of any communication received under this Section.\n\nThe above-mentioned jurisdiction is also exclusively valid for the declaration of cancellation of Bonds and Coupons.\n\nThe Republic hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the above mentioned Swiss courts and any Federal court sitting in the City of Buenos Aires as well as any appellate court of any thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding against it arising out of or relating to the Bonds.\"\n\n- From the Trust Deed with Chase Manhattan Trustees Limited (RF-5, \u00a7 17.2):\n\n\"17.2 Jurisdiction: The Republic irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of England; any New York State or Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City; and the courts of the Republic of Argentina (the \"Specified Courts\") over any suit, action, or proceeding against it or its properties, assets or revenues with respect to the Notes, the Coupons or the Trust Deed (a \"Related Proceeding\"). The Republic waives any objection to Related Proceedings in such courts whether on the grounds of venue, residence or domicile or on the ground that the Related Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Republic also agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any-such\u2014Related Proceeding (a \"Related Judgment\") shall be conclusive and binding upon it and may be enforced in any Specified Court or in any other courts to the jurisdiction of which the Republic is or may be subject (the \"Other Courts\"), by a suit upon such judgment.\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n341.\n\nRespondent contends that the security entitlements purchased by Claimants do not constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. Respondent bases its position on the following main arguments:\n\n*(i) No investment in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID :* In order to qualify as \"investment\" under Article 25(1) ICSID, a specific economic transaction or operation must meet certain objective criteria known as the *\"Saini* factors,\" including typically (a) a substantial contribution of the investor, (b) a certain duration, (c) the existence of an operational risk, (d) a certain regularity of profit, and (e) a contribution to the economic development of the host State.130 According to Respondent, these criteria are not met (or the information provided by Claimants is not sufficient to determine whether they are met). Respondent further contends that the concept of investment in Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, as defined by the *Salini* factors, determines the outer limits of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction with regard to the nature of the disputes. As such, parties cannot override such outer limits by providing for a broader definition of the term \"investment.\" In addition to *Salini,* Respondent relies upon a number of other ICSID arbitrations.131\n\n*(ii) No investment \"made within the territory of Argentina\":* Respondent contends that even if Claimants\u2019 security entitlements were to be considered investments, they are not made within the territory of Argentina as required by Article 1 BIT. According to Respondent, these security entitlements do not show a sufficiently significant physical and legal connection to Argentina because (i) they did not cause any transfer of money into the territory of Argentina, (ii) they are located outside of Argentina and are beyond the latter\u2019s scope of territorial jurisdiction based on the foreign law and forum selection clauses contained in the relevant bond documents, and (iii) the indirect holding systems of these entitlements implicates a cut-off point beyond which claims are not permissible because they have only a remote connection with the investment.132\n\n*(iii) Investment not \"in compliance with Argentinean law* Respondent further contends that Claimants\u2019 security entitlements were not purchased in compliance with the laws and regulations of Argentina as required by Article 1 BIT. According to Respondent, the terms \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of [Argentina]\" must be read in connection with Article 8(7) BIT, which refers not only to Argentine law but also to Italian and European law, as well as to \"the terms of any particular agreements entered into regarding the investment,\" i.e., to the specific selling restrictions contained in the relevant bond documents, and general principles such as the principle of good faith. Respondent contends that where any relevant provisions or principles are violated, the investment becomes illegal and cannot be protected by the BIT. Based on the alleged violation by the Italian banks of various European laws and regulations, of the specific selling restrictions allegedly prohibiting the sale to retail purchasers, and of the principle of good faith, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 security entitlements have been purchased in violation of applicable laws and regulations and do therefore not qualify for protection under the BIT.133\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 266-270; R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 425-468, referring, *inter alia,* to *Salini Construttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A. v.

Claimants justify their position based mainly on the following arguments:134\n\n*(i) \"Investments\" in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention and Article 1 BIT:* Claimants bring forward that Article 25(1) ICSID Convention does not define the concept of investment, and leaves this definition to the Contracting Parties. In this respect, Article 1 BIT contains a definition of what is to be considered an investment. Claimants contend that Claimants\u2019 security entitlements clearly constitute investments in the sense of Article 1 BIT because they duly qualify as \"bonds, private or public financial instruments or any other right to performances or services having economic value\" and/or \"any right of economic nature conferred under any law or agreement\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) lit. c and lit. f BIT. In addition, Claimants further contend that the security entitlements fulfill all necessary *Salini* factors, while these factors are not to be seen as rigid but need to be appreciated adopting a flexible and pragmatic approach and giving due consideration to the economic reality of the investment at stake.135 Looking at the economic reality of the bond issuance process, and the role therein of Claimants\u2019 security entitlements, Claimants\u2019 investment constitute a substantial contribution, carry a certain risk, produce regular profits, are of a certain duration and contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development.\n\n*(ii) Investment \"made within the territory of Argentina\"* : Claimants contend that Claimants\u2019 investment were made within the territory of Argentina, because that is where the bonds funds were ultimately made available. In this respect Claimants bring forward that *(a)* it is not necessary that funds be physically transferred to the Host State, as long as the funds are made available to the Host State; *(b)* even Argentine tax law considers these bonds as located in Argentina for tax purposes; *(c)* the bonds have a strong connection to Argentina, since they were issued by the Argentine Government pursuant to Argentinean law; and *(d)* Argentina knew and supported the sales of security entitlements to retail investors and are therefore estopped from claiming that Claimants are too remotely connected to the bonds.136\n\n*(iii) Investment made in compliance with Argentinean law.* According to Claimants, the terms \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of [Argentina]\" of Article 1 BIT refer to Argentinean law only. In this respect, Argentina does not dispute that the bonds were issued in compliance with Argentine sovereign debt legislation, so that the requirement of compliance with Argentinean law is met. Claimants contend that a potential breach by the Italian banks of other laws and regulations is irrelevant to the qualification of the bond and/or security entitlements as protected investment. Further, even if any non-Argentinean laws or regulations were to be considered, Claimants contend that Argentina is estopped from relying on the breach of such laws or regulations, since Argentina fully knew and controlled the bond issuance process and thereby knew and accepted such breaches.137\n\nSee C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 376 *et seq.*\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 699-719, referring, *inter alia,* to *Salini,* 622; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

Thus, the question of the definition of the concept of investment is to this extent relevant for the stage of the jurisdiction.\n\n344.\n\nIn this respect, a number of arbitral tribunals hold the view that whether or not a dispute at stake relates to an investment is subject to a two-fold test, i.e., a sort of \"double barrelled\" test:\n\n- On the one hand, the alleged investment must fit into the definition of investment as provided by the relevant BIT, which reflects the limits of the State\u2019s consent;\n\n- On the other hand, the alleged investment must also correspond to the inherent meaning of investment as contemplated by the ICSID Convention, which sets the limits of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence.\n\n345.\n\nLooking at the definition of investment provided in Article 1(1) BIT (see \u00a7\u00a7 336-338 above), it corresponds largely to the definition of other contemporaneous BITs, such as the BIT between Italy and Bangladesh of 1990 (Article 1), between Italy and Bolivia of 1990 (Article 1), between Italy and Kuwait of 1987 (Article 1), between Italy and Uruguay of 1990 (Article 1), between Argentina and Belgium/Luxembourg of 1990 (Article 1), between Argentina and the United Kingdom of 1990 (Article 1).138\n\nRegarding BITs signed by Italy, see Volume RB to R-MJ. These BITs are also available on http://www.unctadxi.org/templates/DocSearch 779.aspx.\n\n346.\n\nAnalysing the concept of an investment, one can identify two different aspects thereof: (i) the contribution that constitutes the investment, and (ii) the rights and the value that derive from that contribution.\n\n347.\n\nThese two aspects are addressed somewhat differently by the BIT and the ICSID Convention as interpreted by a number of arbitral tribunals:\n\n(i) The definition provided at Article 1(1) BIT, and in particular the list of examples of what is considered an investment under the BIT, is drafted in a way describing the rights and values which may be endangered by measures of the Host State, such as an expropriation, and therefore deserve protection under the BIT. Thus the focus here is on the rights and the value that potential contributions from investors may generate. Nevertheless, this definition is of course based on the premise of the existence of such contribution. This namely derives from the wording of other provisions such as for example Article 2 of the BIT which provides that *\"[E]ach Contracting Party shall encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to invest in its territory\"*\n\n(ii) In contrast, the concept of investment as contempated by the ICSID Convention relates more to the contribution itself. As mentioned above (see \u00a7 256), Article 25 ICSID Convention does not provide for any specific definition of the concept of investment, and this silence was intended by the drafters of the Convention in order to leave certain room to further develop this notion. Thus, a number arbitral tribunals have attempted to further define the concept of investment under Article 25 ICSID Convention. This has been regularly done by reference to some or all of the so-called *Salini* factors, developed in the *Salini* decision (see \u00a7 341 above). According to these *Salini* factors, for a transaction or activity to qualify as \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25 ICSID Convention, it would require (i) a contribution, (ii) of a certain duration, (iii) of a nature to generate profits or revenues, (iv) showing a particular risk, and (v) of a nature to contribute to the economic development of the Host State. This definition focuses on the nature of the contribution constituting the investment, and not on the rights and value deriving therefrom.\n\n348.\n\nAt this juncture, it may be recalled that whilst BITs in general, including the present BIT, address both substantive investment protection rules and dispute resolution procedure, the ICSID Convention is concerned mainly with dispute resolution rules. Bearing this distinction and the above considerations in mind, the Tribunal makes the following analysis.\n\n349.\n\nIf it is obvious that the definition of Article 1(1) BIT and the criteria developed by a number of arbitral tribunals with regard to Article 25 ICSID Convention do not coincide, this is so because they can be said to focus each on a different aspect of the investment, i.e., they each look at the investment from a different perspective.139 The two perspectives can be viewed to be complementary, and to merely reflect a two-folded approach of the BIT and the ICSID Convention towards investment: At first, it is about encouraging investments, i.e., creating the frame conditions to encourage foreign investors to make certain contributions, and once such contributions are made, it is about protecting the fruits and value generated by these contributions. Following this interpretation, the double approach can also be considered as being illustrated in the Preamble of the ICSID Convention as well as in the BIT:\n\n- According to the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, one of the key considerations of the Convention is \"the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein\" combined with the recognized need to establish international dispute settlement mechanisms ensuring effective protection of such private international investments;\n\n- According to the Preamble of the BIT, it aims to \"create favorable conditions for greater economic cooperation between the two States, in particular, for the realization of investments,\"140 which presupposes the implementation of material standards of protection of such investments as set forth in Articles 2 to 5, combined with effective procedural remedies as established in Articles 8 and 9.\n\nSee *Malicorp Limited v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18), Award of January 2011, \u00a7 110.\n\nTranslated by the Tribunal from the Italian version \"creare condizioni favorevoli per una maggiore cooperatzione economica fra i due Paesi ed, in particolare, per la realizzazione di investimenti.\" The Spanish version has the same meaning \"crear condiciones favorables para una mayor cooperacion economica entre los dos Paises y, en particular, para la realizacion de inversiones.\"\n\n350.\n\nThus, within this interpretation, as it arises further from the wording of Article 1(1) and the aim of the BIT, the definition of investment provided in the BIT focuses on what is to be protected, i.e., the fruits and value generated by the investment, whilst the general definitions developed with regard to Article 25 ICSID Convention focus on the contributions, which constitute the investment and create the fruits and value. In summary, a certain value may only be protected if generated by a specific contribution, and - vice versa - contributions may only be protected to the extent they generate a certain value, which the investor may be deprived of.\n\n351.\n\nIn other words, if it is to be applied, the \"double barrelled\" test does not mean that one definition, namely the definition provided by two Contracting Parties in a BIT, has to fit into the other definition, namely the one deriving from the spirit of the ICSID Convention. Rather, it is the investment at stake that has to fit into both of these concepts, knowing that each of them focuses on another aspect of the investment.\n\n(ii) Investment under Article 1(1) BIT\n--------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal\u2019s own English translation of Article 1(1) BIT, the term \"investment includes, without limitation\":\n\n- lit. (a): \"movable and immovable goods, as well as any other right in rem, including - to the extent usable as investment - security rights on property of third parties;\"\n\n- lit. (b): \"shares, company participations and any other form of participation, even if representing a minority or indirectly held, in companies established in the territory of a Contracting State;\"\n\n- lit. (c): \"obligations, private or public titles or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues;\"\n\n- lit. (d):\"credits which are directly linked to an investment, which is constituted and documented in accordance with the provisions in force in the State where the investment is made;\"\n\n- lit. (e):\"copyrights, intellectual or industrial property rights - such as invention patents, licenses, registered trademarks, secrets, industrial models and designs - as well as technical processes, transfer of technology, registered trade names and goodwill;\"\n\n- lit. (f): \"any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract, as well as any license and concession granted in compliance with the applicable provisions applicable to the concerned economic activities, including the prospection, cultivation, extraction and exploitation of natural resources.\"\n\n353.\n\nAnalysing the structure of the various subsections of Article 1(1), it appears that they reflect a categorization of various types of investments from the perspective of rights and values that they generate: lit. (a) refers to property rights on movable and immovables, lit. (b) relates to participations into companies, lit. (c) refers to financial instruments, lit. (d) refers to credits, lit. (e) to rights on immaterial property and technology transfer, and lit. (f) to all kinds of further rights of economic value.\n\n354.\n\nFirstly, this list covers an extremely wide range of investments, using a broad wording and referring to formulas such as \"independent of the legal form adopted,\" or \"any other\" kind of similar investment. It even contains a residual clause in lit. (f), encompassing \"any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract.\" In other words, the definition provided for in Article 1(1) is not drafted in a restrictive way. Based on its wording, as well as on the broader aim of the BIT as described in the Preamble, Article 1(1) cannot be seen to have intended to adopt a restrictive approach with regard to what kind of activity or dealing was meant to qualify as an investment.\n\n355.\n\nSecondly, lit. (c) specifically addresses financial instruments. It is true that the term \"obligations\" is a broad term and can refer to any kind of contractual obligation, i.e., debt, and it is also true that the term \"title\" is also very broad. However, put in the context of the further terms listed in lit. (c) such as \"economic value\" or \"capitalized revenue,\" as well as considering that lit. (f) already deals with the more general concept of \"any right of economic nature,\" lit. (c) is to be read as referring to the financial meaning of these terms. Thus, the term \"obligation\" may be understood as referring to an economic value incorporated into a credit title representing a loan. This kind of obligations would in the English language more commonly be called \"bond,\" rather than \"obligation.\" Similarly, the term \"title\" in Spanish and Italian would be more accurately translated into the English term of \"security,\" which means nothing more than a fungible, negotiable instrument representing financial value.\n\n356.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that the bonds, as defined above in \u00a7 11, constitute \"obligations\" and/or at least \"public securities\" in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c) of the BIT.\n\n357.\n\nWith regard to the security entitlements that Claimants hold in these bonds, they also represent \"securities\" in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c), since they constitute an instrument representing a financial value held by the holder of the security entitlement in the bond issued by Argentina.\n\n358.\n\nThe question now is whether the connection between the security entitlements and the bonds could be seen as so remote as to consider that the dispute is not \"directly\" related to an investment, since the dispute related primarily to the rights arising from Claimants\u2019 security entitlements. The Tribunal sees no valid reason that would support such conclusion:\n\n- The bonds at stake were always meant to be divided into smaller negotiable economic values, i.e., securities. It has been sufficiently demonstrated by Claimants that the underwriters would not have subscribed to any of the bonds, without having previously ensured that the bonds were re-sellable to the Intermediaries and their end customers;\n\n- The security entitlements are the result of the distribution process of the bonds through their division into a multiude of smaller securities representing each a part of the value of the relevant bond. The security entitlements have no value per se, i.e., independently of the bond;\n\n- The fact that the distribution process happens electronically, without the physical transfer of any title, does not change anything to the fact that rights effectively passed on to acquirers of security entitlements in the bonds.\n\n359.\n\nIn other words, whatever the technical nuances between bonds and security entitlements may be, they are part of one and the same economic operation and they make only sense together.\n\n360.\n\nThis is confirmed by the scope and the terms of the Exchange Offer 2010. Although Respondent insists that under the underwriting agreements, the underwriter committed to a single lump-sum payment to Argentina for the issuance of the bonds and after that took all responsibility for selling the bonds on the open market,141 Argentina at the same time admits that the tendering of holders of security entitlements into the Exchange Offer 2010 was necessary to discharge Argentina in connection with the issuance of the bonds, including the payment in connection with security entitlements.142 Whilst it is true, as contended by Argentina,143 that the requirements for eligibility under the Exchange Offer 2010 have no relationship whatsoever to the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction or the question whether BIT protection exists under the BIT, they are relevant to understand the relationship between the security entitlements and the bonds. In this respect, it cannot be ignored that by considering holders of security entitlements, such as Claimants, a necessary component of the Exchange Offer 2010, Argentina admitted their importance within the broader context of the bond issuance and distribution process. If the Underwriters were really the sole purchasers of the bonds and thereby the sole \"bondholders,\" why would it be necessary to \"engage [into the Exchange Offer 2010] all parties that had beneficial interests in the bonds\"144? Why would that not bear on the Underwriters\u2019 shoulders? Because this is not the way an Exchange Offer is meant to work, and this evidences that bonds and security entitlements therein cannot be regarded as two separate investments relating to different rights or values.\n\nAnnex A to R-PHB \u00a7 3.\n\nAnnex A to R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 69-70. \"In particular, in order to retire some or all of the defaulted bonds through the Exchange Offer, Argentina had to find a way to engage all parties that had beneficial interests in the bonds\" (\u00a7 70).\n\nAnnex A R-PHB \u00a7 67.\n\nAnnex A R-PHB \u00a7 70.\n\n361.\n\nConsequently, the bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"investments\" in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c) BIT.\n\n(iii) Investment under Article 25 ICSID Convention\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nUnder Article 25 ICSID Convention, the relevant question is whether the bonds and the security entitlements therein were generated by a contribution that is in line with the spirit and aim of Article 25 ICSID Convention.\n\n363.\n\nOne approach would be to follow the *Salini* criteria and check whether the contribution made by Claimants fulfil all these requirements. However, and irrespective of the adequacy of the individual *Salini* criteria, the Tribunal finds that this would not be the right approach, for the following main reason.\n\n364.\n\nIf Claimants\u2019 contributions were to fail the *Salini* test, those contributions -according to the followers of this test - would not qualify as investment under Article 25 ICSID Convention, which would in turn mean that Claimants\u2019 contributions would not be given the procedural protection afforded by the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal finds that such a result would be contradictory to the ICSID Convention\u2019s aim, which is to encourage private investment while giving the Parties the tools to further define what kind of investment they want to promote. It would further make no sense in view of Argentina\u2019s and Italy\u2019s express agreement to protect the value generated by these kinds of contributions. In other words - and from the value perspective - there would be an investment, which Argentina and Italy wanted to protect and to submit to ICSID arbitration, but it could not be given any protection because - from the perspective of the contribution - the investment does not meet certain criteria. Considering that these criteria were never included in the ICSID Convention, while being controversial and having been applied by tribunals in varying manners and degrees, the Tribunal does not see any merit in following and copying the *Salini* criteria. The *Salini* criteria may be useful to further describe what characteristics contributions may or should have. They should, however, not serve to create a limit, which the Convention itself nor the Contracting Parties to a specific BIT intended to create.\n\n365.\n\nThe other approach consists in verifying that Claimants made contributions, which led to the creation of the value that Argentina and Italy intended to protect under the BIT. Thus the only requirement regarding the contribution is that it be apt to create the value that is protected under the BIT.\n\n366.\n\nIn this respect, there is no doubt that Claimants made a contribution: They purchased security entitlements in the bonds and thus, paid a certain amount of money in exchange of the security entitlements. The value generated by this contribution is the right attached to the security entitlements to claim reimbursement from Argentina of the principal amount and the interests accrued. As mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 352-361), this right is protected under Article 1(1) lit. (c) of the BIT.\n\n367.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitutes a contribution which qualifies as \"investment\" under Article 25 ICSID Convention.\n\n(iv) Two Alternative Views on \"Investment\" Lead to the Same Result\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nIf the so-called \"double-barrelled\" test is not applied in the present case and no distinction is made as is stated in \u00a7\u00a7 346-351 above, the result is the same.\n\n369.\n\nAccording to one alternative view, it is argued that, in the case of a BIT arbitration under the ICSID Convention, the \"double barrelled\" test need not be applied since the ICSID Convention does not contain a definition of \"investment\" and the State Parties to the BIT have agreed to such a definition in a treaty between them, i.e., the BIT.145 That view leads also to the conclusion that there is an \"investment\" in the present case because, as mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7 352-361), the bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"investments\" in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c) BIT.\n\nSee for an overview regarding this issue, *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16 (Germany/Ukraine BIT), Award of 31 March 2011, \u00a7\u00a7 137-143.\n\n370.\n\nA third view on this question also leads to the same result. Pursuant to that view, the term \"investment\" has an objective meaning in itself. Accordingly, the term \"investment\" *under the BIT* has an inherent meaning, irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration. As it is observed by the tribunal in *Romak S.A. v. Uzbekistan,* conducting its proceedings on the basis of the Uncitral Arbitration Rules:\n\nThe term \"investment\" has *a* meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the [Germany - Ukraine] BIT.\n\n.... The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term \"investments\" under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk.... By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT\u2019s non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of \"investment,\" the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an \"investment.\" In the general formulation of the tribunal in *Azinian, \"labelling... is no substitute for analysis,\"146*\n\n(Emphasis in original)\n\n*Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan* (PCA Case No. AA280), Award of 26 November 2009, \u00a7 180 and \u00a7 207.\n\n371.\n\nThe term \"investment\" *per se* in Article 1(1) of the Argentina - Italy BIT can indeed be analysed in the same manner as the term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (see \u00a7\u00a7 362-367 above). That analysis is similar to the analysis on the basis of the criteria identified above in *Romak* (i.e., a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk). The conclusion is again that Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitutes a contribution which qualifies as \"investment\" *per se* under Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n(v) Made in Argentina\n---------------------\n\n372.\n\nIn order to determine whether Claimants\u2019 investment was made in Argentina, the Tribunal will first determine the place where an investment is generally considered to be made (i), and then examine whether the presence of forum selection clauses in contractual documents relating to the investment may influence such a determination (ii).\n\n373.\n\n*(i) With regard to the place where the investment is considered made,* Respondent contends that the investment cannot be considered \"made in the territory of Argentina,\" because the purchase price paid by Claimants for their security entitlements never ended up in Argentina. Instead, only the lump sum payment made by the underwriters to Argentina can be considered made in the territory of Argentina, whilst payments for purchases of security entitlements were made to the various Intermediaries.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the determination of the place of the investment firstly depends on the nature of such investment. With regard to an investment of a purely financial nature, the relevant criteria cannot be the same as those applying to an investment consisting of business operations and/or involving manpower and property. With regard to investments of a purely financial nature, the relevant criteria should be where and/or for the benefit of whom the funds are ultimately used, and not the place where the funds were paid out or transferred. Thus, the relevant question is where the invested funds ultimately made available to the Host State and did they support the latter\u2019s economic development? This is also the view taken by other arbitral tribunals.147\n\nSee e.g. *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 11 July 1997, \u00a7 41. See also *SGS Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 6 August 2003, \u00a7\u00a7 136-140, where emphasis was led on the fact that the aim of SGS\u2019s activity was to \"raise the financial revenue of the State\" (\u00a7 139); *SGS v. Republic Philippines,* \u00a7\u00a7 111.\n\n375.\n\nA further question is whether it is necessary that investment of purely financial nature be further linked to a specific economic enterprise or operation taking place in the territory of the Host State. Based on the above consideration (see \u00a7 355) that in Article 1 BIT Argentina and Italy designated financial instruments as an express kind of investment covered by the BIT and thereby intending to provide such investment with BIT protection, the Tribunal considers that it would be contrary to the BIT\u2019s wording and aim to attach a further condition to the protection of financial investment instruments.\n\n376.\n\nRespondent makes an additional argument out of the fact that the payment of the purchase price occurred after the payment of the lump sum price by the underwriters, and that only the latter payment can be considered to have been made available to Argentina. The Tribunal is of the opinion that such argument ignores the reality of the bond issuance process. Indeed, although the payment of the lump sum price for the bonds and the payment of the purchase price by the individual holders of security entitlements happened at different points in time, the latter constitutes the basis for the former. As mentioned above (see \u00a7 359), the bonds and the security entitlements are part of one and the same economic operation and they make only sense together: Without the prior insurance to be able to collect sufficient funds from the individual purchasers of security entitlements, the underwriters would never have committed to the payment of the lump sum payment. In other words, the lump sum payment is an advance made by the underwriters to Argentina on the future payments of individual investors.\n\n377.\n\nThus, the funds generated by the purchase of the relevant security entitlements are - for the purpose of establishing where they were made - no different than the lumps sum payment paid by the underwriters for the bonds.\n\n378.\n\nThere is no doubt that the funds generated through the bonds issuance process were ultimately made available to Argentina, and served to finance Argentina\u2019s economic development. Whether the funds were actually used to repay pre-existing debts of Argentina or whether they were used in government spending is irrelevant. In both cases, it was used by Argentina to manage its finances, and as such must be considered to have contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development and thus to have been made in Argentina.\n\n379.\n\n*(ii) With regard to the question whether the presence of forum selection clauses in contractual documents* relating to the investment may influence the determination of the place of investment, Respondent contends that based on the forum selection clauses contained in the bond documents, the bonds must be considered located outside of Argentina and beyond the latter\u2019s scope of territorial jurisdiction. The Tribunal considers Respondent\u2019s argument inapposite for two main reasons:\n\n- Following Respondent\u2019s line of argumentation would mean that forum selection clauses determine the place where contractual performance is supposed to take place. *In casu,* Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlement would be considered made at the place of the selected forum. The Tribunal disagrees with this view. Rather, forum selection clauses are clauses of a procedural nature aiming to determine the place of settlement of a dispute relating to a contractual performance. They have nothing to do with the place where a party is supposed to perform its obligations;\n\n- Even if forum selection clauses had an influence on the place of contractual performance, they would not be relevant to determine the place where the investment, pursuant to Article 1(1) BIT and Article 25 ICSID Convention, was made. As mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 319 *et seq.),* rights and obligations deriving from the BIT have an independent basis from rights and obligations deriving from the contract, and may as such - in principle - not be affected by contractual provisions dealing only with contractual rights and obligations.\n\n380.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \u2018made in the territory of Argentina\u2019.\n\n(vi) In Compliance with the Law\n-------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants\u2019 investment, i.e., the purchase of security entitlements, were not made in compliance with the law, because these purchases would have been done in violation by the Italian banks of certain selling restrictions applicable to the bonds, as well as to local regulations regarding the marketing of such financial instruments and the principle of good faith. According to Respondent, these violations would be relevant to appreciate the legality of the investment in the light of Article 8(7) of the BIT.\n\n382.\n\nAt the stage of the jurisdiction, the Tribunal\u2019s examination is limited to verifying the existence of a dispute relating to an investment, and focuses thus on the definition of the investment (see \u00a7\u00a7 343 *et seq.* above). It is not concerned yet with the question whether the investment was validly made, i.e., whether it fulfils the necessary requirements to enjoy full protection under the BIT. This will be a matter to be dealt at the merits stage of the present dispute, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s findings on jurisdiction.\n\n383.\n\nThus, at this stage the Tribunal\u2019s examination is limited to the question whether the investment fits into the definition of Article 1(1). In contrast, Article 8(7) of the BIT deals with the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, and may be relevant when appreciating the validity of the investment. It may however not serve as a basis to extend the definition of an investment as provided for in Article 1(1) of the BIT. These two provisions have different contexts and different purposes.\n\n384.\n\nWith regard to the \"lawfulness\" of the investment, which forms part of the definition of the concept of investment under Article 1(1) BIT, Article 1(1) par. 1 merely requires that the investment be made \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of the [Host State],\" i.e., Argentina. It is undisputed between the Parties that the bonds have been issued by Argentina in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations (see \u00a7 44 above).148 As such, they were made \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of Argentina.\"\n\nSee R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7521 \"the issuances of the bonds were in conformity with Argentine Law.\"\n\n385.\n\nThe alleged breach of applicable regulations Respondent relies on, concerns breaches allegedly committed by the Italian banks and not by Claimants. As mentioned above (see \u00a7 327 *et seq),* such breaches should not be relevant for the purpose of examining Claimants\u2019 rights and Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT. As such, an alleged misconduct of the Italian banks may not render the security entitlements unlawful pursuant to Article 1(1) BIT. Whether it may render such investment invalid under the laws applicable to the dispute according to Article 8(7) BIT is an issue to be dealt with at the merits stage of the present dispute, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s findings on jurisdiction.\n\n386.\n\nConsequently, the relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered made \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of [Argentina]\" pursuant to Article 1(1) BIT.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n387.\n\nIn conclusion, and in response to Issue No. 9 and 8, the Tribunal holds that the present dispute arises out of an investment pursuant to Article 1 BIT and (if needed) Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. In particular:\n\n(i) According to one view, the \"double-barrelled\" test developed with regard to the concept of \"investment\" does not mean that the definition of investment provided by two States in a BIT has to fit into the definition deriving from the spirit of the ICSID Convention. Rather, arguably, it is the investment at stake that has to fit into both of these concepts, knowing that each of them focuses on another aspect of the investment;\n\n(ii) In any event, the relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"investments\" pursuant to Article 1(1) lit. (c) BIT;\n\n(iii) If needed to be applied, Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitute a contribution which qualifies as \"investment\" under Article 25 ICSID Convention;\n\n(iv) The relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered made \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of [Argentina]\" pursuant to Article 1(1) BIT;\n\n(v) The bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"made in the territory of Argentina.\"\n\n**(4) Between Argentina and Italian Investors - Issues 10 & 11**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIt is uncontested that Argentina has the necessary capacity to be a party to the present arbitration. Therefore, the present section will focus on determining relevant issues concerning Claimants. These issues appear to be threefold: (i) the issue of nationality, whereby it is contested whether Claimants qualify as \"Italian\" in the sense of the BIT; (ii) the issue of legal capacity, whereby it is disputed whether those Claimants which are corporations have the necessary capacity to be a party to the BIT and can be protected thereunder; and (iii) the issue relating to the \"investor\" status of Claimants, whereby it is disputed whether Claimants, who have purchased their security entitlements through various layers of intermediaries, can still be classified as the \"investor,\" i.e., the party having made the investment.\n\n389.\n\nIn this regard, it should be recalled that according to the First Session of 10 April 2008149 and the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 21 May 2009, the present analysis is limited to general issues and shall not include \"issues touching specifically upon each individual claimant,\" except where the presentation of the general issue (of jurisdiction or admissibility) cannot be done without reference to a particular situation.150\n\nFirst Session Tr. p. 140/17; p. 141/3-9.\n\nSee Conference Call of 14 October 2009.\n\n390.\n\nConsequently, the present decision will not decide on whether Claimants have the Italian nationality or necessary capacity, but it will merely confirm which are the conditions which Claimants must fulfil so as to qualify as a party under the BIT. With regard to the issue relating to the investor status of Claimants, the present decision will not address the individual investor status of each Claimant. Rather, it will be limited to address from a general perspective whether a party purchasing a security entitlement in the way Claimants allege they purchased their security entitlements would qualify as investor in the sense of the BIT.\n\n391.\n\nThus, the issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- What are the conditions under which physical persons may benefit from the protection of the BIT, and thereby be a party to the present arbitration? (see Issue No. 10 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n- What are the conditions under which juridical entities may benefit from the protection of the BIT, and thereby be a party to the present arbitration? (see Issue No. 11 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008), and in particular, do corporations established under Italian law and which do not have \"legal personality\" benefit from such protection and capacity?\n\n- Does a party which acquires a security entitlement in a bond through similar mechanisms as used in the present case for the purchase by Claimants of their security entitlements still qualify as the party making the investment, i.e., as the investor?\n\n392.\n\nThe key legal provisions and documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Article 1 BIT, Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the BIT, Article 25(2) ICSID Convention, and Articles 36, 75, 78 Italian Civil Procedure Code.\n\n393.\n\nArticles 1(2) and (3) BIT in the unofficial English translation submitted by Claimants provides:\n\n\"2. \"Investor\" shall mean any individual or corporation of one Contracting Party that has made, makes or undertakes to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(a) \"individual\" shall mean, for each Contracting Party, and individual who is a citizen of such Contracting Party, in compliance with the laws thereof.\n\n(b) \"corporation\" shall mean, in relation to each Contracting Party, any entity incorporated in compliance with the legislation of a Contracting Party, having its office in the territory of such Party and being recognized thereby, such as public entities that conduct economic activities, partnerships and corporations, foundations and associations, independent of whether their liability is limited or not.\n\n3. For the purposes of this Agreement, legal deeds and capacity of corporations in the territory of the Contracting Party receiving the investment will be governed by the legislation of that Contracting Party.\"\n\n394.\n\nIn comparison thereto, the relevant parts of Article 1(2) BIT as published in the Boletin Oficial de la Republica Argentina No. 27,480 of 25 September 1992 provide as follows:\n\n\"2. El termino \"inversor\" comprende toda persona fisica o juridica de una Parte Contratante que haya realizado, realice o haya asumido la obligacion de realizar inversiones en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante.\n\n- Por \"persona fisica\" se entiende, con relacion a cada una de las Partes Contratantes, toda persona fisica que tenga la ciudadania de ese Estado, de acuerdo a sus leyes.\n\n- Por \"persona juridica\" se entiende, con relacion a cada una de las Partes Contratantes, cualquier entidad constituido de conformidad con la legislacion de una Parte Contratante, con sede en el territorio de esa Parte y por esta ultima reconocida, tales como entidades publicas que realizan actividades economicas, sociedades de personas o de capitales, fundaciones y asociaciones, independientemente de que su responsabilidad sea limitada o no.\n\n- A los efectos del presente Acuerdo, los actos juridicos y la capacidad de cada persona juridica en el territorio de la Parte Contratante donde se efectua la inversion seran regulados por la legislacion de esta ultima.\"\n\n395.\n\nAs to the official Italian version of Article 1(2) and 3 of the Italian text of the Argentina-Italy BIT, it provides as follows:\n\n\"2. Per \"investitore\" si intende ogni persona fisica o giuridica di una Parte Contraente che abbia effettuato, effettui o abbia assunto obbligazione di effettuare investimenti nel territorio dell\u2019altra Parte Contraente.\n\na. Per \"persona fisica\" si intende, per ciascuna Parte Contraente, una persona fisica che abbia la cittadinanza di tale parte, in conformita a le sue leggi.\n\nb. Per \"persona giuridica\" si intende, con riferimento a ciascuna Parte Contraente, qualsiasi entita costituita conformemente alia normativa di una parte Contraente, con sede nel terrtorio di tale Parte e da questa ultima riconosciuta, come Enti publlici che esercitino attivita econonmiche, societa di persone o di capitali, fondazioni, associazinoe e, questo, indipendentemente dal fatto che la loro responsabilita sia limitata o meno.\n\n3. Agli effetti del presente Accordo, gli atti giuridici e la capacita di ciascuna persona giuridica nel territorio della Parte Contraente destinataria di un investimento, saranno regolati dalla legislazione di quest\u2019ultima.\"\n\n396.\n\nIn addition, Article 1 Additional Protocol to the BIT provides as follows in the various languages:\n\n(i) In the unofficial English version:\n\n\"1. With reference to Article 1:\n\na) Individuals of each Contracting Party who, when making an investment, maintained their domicile for more than two years in the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment was made, cannot benefit of this Agreement.\n\nIf an individual of one Contracting Party maintains at the same time its registered residence in its State and domicile in the other State for more than two years, he/she will be considered equivalent, for the purposes of this Agreement, to individuals of the Contracting Party in the territory of which they made investments.\n\nb) The domicile of an investor will be determined in compliance with laws, regulations and provisions of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment was made.\"\n\n(ii) In the official Spanish version:\n\n\"Con referencia al Articulo 1:\n\na) No podran prevalerse del Acuerdo las personas fisicas de cada Parte Contratante que, al momento de efectuar la inversion, hubieran tenido su domicilio por mas de dos anos en el territorio de la Parte Contratante donde la inversion se realizo.\n\nEn caso que una persona fisica de una Parte Contratante tuviera simultaneamente residencia registrada en su pais y domicilio por mas de dos anos en el de la otra Parte Contratante se equiparara, a los fines del presente Acuerdo, a las personas fisicas nacionales de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se realizo la inversion.\n\nb) El domicilio de un inversor ser\u00e1 determinado de conformidad con las leyes, reglamentos y disposiciones de la Parte Contrante en cuyoterritorio se realiz\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n.\"\n\n(iii) In the Italian official version:\n\n\"1. Con riferimento all\u2019Articolo 1:\n\na) Non potranno beneficiare dell\u2019Accordo le persone fisiche di ciascuna Parte Contraente le quali, al momento di effettuare un investimento, abbiano mantenuto il loro domicilio per pi\u00f9 di due anni nella Parte Contraente nel cui territorio l\u2019investimento sia stato realizzato.\n\nQualora una persona fisica di una Parte Contraente mantenga contemporaneamente la residenza anagrafica nel proprio Paese ed il domicilio per pi\u00f9 di due anni nell\u2019altro, essa verr\u00e0 equiparata, ai fini del presente Accordo, alle persone fisiche della Parte Contraente nel cui territorio abbia realizzato investimenti.\n\nb) Il domicilio di un investitore sar\u00e0 determinato in conformit\u00e0 alle leggi, regolamenti e disposizioni della Parte Contraente nel territorio della quale l\u2019investimento sia stato realizzato.\"\n\n397.\n\nArtide 36 Italian Civil Code in its original Italian version provides as follows:\n\n**\"Art. 36 Ordinamento e amministrazione delle associazioni non riconosciute**\n\nL'ordinamento interno e l'amministrazione delle associazioni non riconosciute come persone giuridiche sono regolati dagli accordi degli associati.\n\nLe dette associazioni possono stare in giudizio nella persona di coloro ai quali, secondo questi accordi, e conferita la presidenza o la direzione (Cod. Proc.Civ. 75, 78).\"\n\n398.\n\nPartly based on the translation provided by Prof. Picardi,151 which the Tribunal considers to be a fair reflection of the Italian version, Article 36 can be translated as follows:\n\n**\"Art. 36 Organisation and administration of non-recognized associations**\n\nThe internal organization and administration of associations not recognized as juridical persons are regulated according to the association agreement.\n\nSaid associations may stand in court through the person who, in accordance with such agreement, hold the office of president or director (Civil Procedure Code 75, 78).\"\n\nPicardi, \u00a7 229.\n\n399.\n\nArticle 75 and 78 Italian Civil Procedure Code in their original Italian version provide as follows:\n\n**\"Art. 75. (Capacita' processuale)**\n\nSono capaci di stare in giudizio le persone che hanno il libero esercizio dei diritti che vi si fanno valere. Le persone che non hanno il libero esercizio dei diritti non possono stare in giudizio se non rappresentate, assistite o autorizzate secondo le norme che regolano la loro capacita'.

Those who cannot freely exercise rights cannot stand in a corresponding legal proceeding if they are not represented, assisted or authorized according to the rules governing their legal capacity. Legal entities stand in a proceeding through the person that legally represents them according to the law or their articles of association.

The guardian *ad litem* will leave its office upon intervention of the person entitled to the representation or assistance. A guardian *ad litem* is also appointed in case of conflict of interests between the legal representative and the individual or entity which is represented in the proceeding.\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n401.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *rationae personae* with regard to Claimants who are natural persons. Respondent\u2019s main arguments are as follows:\n\n(i) Claimants are not investors within the meaning of Article 1(2) BIT because\n\n(i) Claimants did not make an investment in the territory of the Argentine Republic, and (ii) Claimants lack standing because in their capacity as holders of security entitlements acquired through multiple intermediaries they are only remotely connected with the underwriters and the underlying bonds;152\n\n(ii) Claimants have failed to provide any evidence whatsoever of compliance with the nationality requirements of Article 25 ICSID Convention and the nationality and domicile requirements of the BIT and its Additional Protocol. Referring to arbitral tribunals, Respondent contends that the nationality requirement of a claim before an ICSID tribunal has in each case to be satisfied before an ICSID proceeding can be initiated or even registered. With regard to natural persons, Respondent has serious doubts that the individual Claimants listed in Annexes A and B meet the nationality and domicile requirements and submit that there is a high likelihood of the existence of thousands of cases of dual nationality.153 With regard to juridical persons, Respondent contends that to qualify as a \"juridical person\" under Article 1(2) BIT the concerned entity must have legal personality, which is not the case of approximately 40% of the Claimants listed in Annex C such as \"assoziani non-recognosciuta,\" ecclesiastical associations, local branches of national associations, trade unions, political parties, etc.154\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 271-283; 365; 374-475; R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 590-600; 642-651.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 365; R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 590-600, referring to *Mihaly International Corporation v. Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2), Award of 15 May 2002, \u00a7 120; *Champion Trading Company and Ameritrade International Inc. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9), Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 October 2003, \u00a7\u00a7 3.1-3.4. See also R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 480 *et seq.*\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 366, R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 602-611, referring to C-MJ \u00a7 863.\n\n402.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* pursuant to Article 25 ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) BIT and its Protocol over each and every Claimant who (i) is a natural person and who was an Italian national on 14 September 2006 and 7 February 2007, was not an Argentine national at either of those dates, and was not domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making his or her investment;155 and (ii) is a juridical entity that on 14 September 2006 was duly organized under Italian law with its principal place of business in Italy and that did not have Argentine nationality on that date.156\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 830; 853. See also C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 443 *et seq.*\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 854; 865. See also C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 446 *et seq.*\n\n403.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s objections, Claimants requests the Tribunal to reject them based on the following main arguments:\n\n(i) Respondent does not contest the principle that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants fulfilling the above mentioned requirements, but raises objections based on the standing of individual Claimants and lack of specific evidence;\n\n(ii) These objections are improper at this stage of the proceedings. Respondent is trying to arbitrate the factual issues pertaining to each Claimant\u2019s standing contesting the *prima facie* evidence of nationality. The task of establishing nationality is a task that the Tribunal expressly postponed until after it has made a determination that it has jurisdiction over the claim;\n\n(iii) Claimants contend that they will submit adequate evidence of nationally in due time, such information being already available in Claimants\u2019 database;\n\n(iv) With regard to juridical persons, Respondent\u2019s objection regarding the alleged lack of legal personality is inapposite. Claimants contend that legal personality is not a prerequisite to qualify as juridical person under Article 1(2) BIT. Since the definition of \"juridical person\" of Article 1(2) lit. b BIT expressly includes foundations and associations, independent of whether their liability is limited or not, Claimants contend that the term \"juridical person\" does not solely refer to entities with legal personality. According to Claimants, the relevant element to determine whether a Claimant is a juridical person under Article 1(2) lit. b BIT is whether it has the right to litigate. All entities involved have such right.\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) Jurisdiction *Rationae Personae -* In General\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nAs already set forth above (see \u00a7\u00a7 280-287 and 392-396), the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae* derives from, Article 1(2) BIT and Article 1 Additional Protocol to the BIT, Article 25 ICSID Convention and has to be established based on the requirements set forth therein.\n\n405.\n\nIn other words, as called to decide on a dispute arising out of the BIT, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* over any person, who is entitled to claim protection under this BIT and who has the capacity to conduct arbitration thereunder.\n\n406.\n\nThe question thus is under what conditions Claimants can be considered to be entitled to claim protection under the BIT and have capacity to be a party to the present arbitration.\n\n(ii) With regard to Natural Persons\n-----------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nBased on the relevant legal provisions and as described above (see \u00a7\u00a7 280-287 and 392-396), in order to benefit from the protection of the BIT and be a party to the present ICSID arbitration conducted thereunder, a physical person must:\n\n(i) Have the Italian nationality on the relevant date, such date being the date on which the Parties consented to arbitration *(in casu* the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration, see \u00a7 49 above), i.e., 14 September 2006, as well as the date of registration of such Request, i.e., 7 Frebruary 2007. The question of whether a person has on such date the Italian nationality is subject to Italian law;\n\n(ii) Not have the Argentinean nationality on neither of the relevant dates. The question of whether a person has Argentinean nationality is subject to Argentinean law;\n\n(iii) Not have been domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making the investment. The question of whether a person has been domiciled in Argentina is subject to Argentinean law;\n\n(iv) Have made an investment, which falls within the scope of the BIT.\n\n408.\n\nIt appears that these conditions are actually not contested by Respondent, whose objections relate to whether these conditions are fulfilled.\n\n409.\n\nWhilst it is true that in order to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae* these conditions need to be fulfilled with regard to each Claimant, the present decision does not aim at making a determination with respect to any individual Claimant and only aims to determine the general conditions for its jurisdiction over such Claimants. Insofar, it is not necessary at this stage to determine whether the information submitted by Claimants so far sufficiently evidences the fulfilment of these conditions.\n\n410.\n\nThus, Respondent\u2019s doubts as to the nationality or domicile of certain Claimants are irrelevant at this stage.\n\n411.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s objection as to the quality of investors of Claimants, it is based on the allegedly remote connection between the security entitlements and the original underwriters and underlying bonds. This objection has to be rejected for the Tribunal has come to the conclusion, in the preceding section (see \u00a7 358 above), that not only the bonds themselves, but also any security entitlement held in those bonds and distributed by the Participants and other Intermediaries to Claimants constitute an investment in the sense of Article 1 BIT and Article 25 ICSID Convention. Thus, to the extent that Claimants are holders of such security entitlements, they are to be considered \"investors\" under the terms of the BIT and subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae.*\n\n412.\n\n**Consequently,** at this stage of the proceedings, it is sufficient to establish that pursuant to the relevant legal provisions, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* over each and any Claimant being a natural person (i) with Italian nationality on 14 September 2006 and 7 February 2007, (ii) who on either date was not also a National of the Argentine Republic, (iii) who was not domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making the investment, and (iv) has made an investment falling under the scope of the BIT, whereby Claimants having purchased a security entitlement in one of the concerned bonds issued by Argentina are to be considered \"investors.\"\n\n(iii) With regard to Juridical Persons\n--------------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nBased on the relevant legal provisions and as described above (see \u00a7\u00a7 280-287 and 392-396), in order to benefit from the protection of the BIT and be a party to the present ICSID arbitration conducted thereunder, a juridical person must:\n\n(i) Have the Italian nationality on the relevant date, such date being the date on which the Parties consented to arbitration (in casu, the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration, see \u00a7 91 above), i.e., 14 September 2006. The question of whether a person has on such date the Italian nationality is subject to Italian law.\n\nAs transposed into the BIT, this requirement of \"nationality\" means that the concerned juridical person must be an Italian \"corporation\" in the sense of Article l(2)(b) BIT, i.e., an entity incorporated in compliance with the legislation of Italy, having its office in the territory of Italy and being recognized thereby.\n\n(ii) Have made an investment, which falls within the scope of the BIT.\n\n414.\n\nRespondent\u2019s objections are manifold. Insofar as they do not relate to the basic principles, but rather to whether the above-mentioned conditions have been fulfilled, they will be disregarded at this stage of the proceedings. Respondents however also contends that the concept of corporation set forth in Article l(2)(b) BIT applies only to corporations possessing legal personality under Italian law, and further reiterates its objection as to the quality of investors of Claimants due to the allegedly remote connection between the security entitlements and the bonds.\n\n415.\n\nWith regard to the latter objection, it has to be rejected for the same reasons as mentioned above (see \u00a7 411).\n\n416.\n\nWith regard to the nature of the capacity necessary for corporations to benefit from the protection of the BIT and be a party to the present arbitration, the Tribunal is of the opinion that neither Article l(2)(b) BIT nor Article 25 ICSID Convention limits the scope of eligible entities to those having full legal capacity, and also encompasses entities which enjoy limited civil capacity to the extent that such entities have the capacity to make an investment under the BIT and further to sue and to be sued.\n\n417.\n\nThe reasons are the following:\n\n(i) Based on the wording of Article l(2)(b) BIT and the situation under Italian law, it has to be concluded that not only entities with full legal capacity qualify as \"juridical persons\" under Article l(2)(b) BIT. Under Article 36 Italian Civil Code (quoted at \u00a7 397 above), associations not recognized as legal entities (hereinafter \"non-recognized associations\") have the procedural capacity to stand in court and to be represented by their president or director. In other words, whilst non-recognized associations may not have legal personality, they possess certain attributes of legal personality and in particular the right to sue and to be sued.157 To the extent that the relevant Claimants had the capacity to make the relevant investment, and that they also have the statutory right to litigate in their own names, and that their constituents all have the requisite nationality, the \"juridical person\" requirement of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention must be considered satisfied.\n\n(ii) The ICSID Convention does not define the concept of juridical person, and does in particular not expressly require a non-natural investor to have specific legal personality.158 Thus, although this question is controversial, the Tribunal finds that the ICSID Convention does not provide for a clear \"yes or no\" answer and that the specific requirements regarding the legal personality of a non-natural investor therefore eventually depends on the scope *rationae personae* of the relevant BIT and the legal capacity required for a non-natural investor to acquire an investment protected by the BIT under the law applicable to such investor and to sue or be sued in its own name with regard to such investment.159\n\n(iii) Where a non-natural investor falls within the definition of juridical persons provided for in the BIT, and where such investor has under the law applicable to it the legal capacity to acquire an investment protected under the BIT and to sue and to be sued, it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and the ICSID Convention to deny such investor the capacity to initiate ICSID arbitration. Indeed, it would make no sense to allow on one hand an investor to make an investment protected under the BIT, and deny on the other hand such investor the right to invoke protection under the BIT for violation of the rights attached to such investment.\n\nSee Picardi, \u00a7\u00a7 228 *et seq.*\n\nSee Schreuer, op. cit. fn. 98, Ad Article 25 \u00a7 689, and references to the historical debate concerning the term of juridical person.\n\nSee *Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I.-DIPENTA v. People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08), Award of 10 January 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 37 et seq., where the Tribunal recognized the capacity of an \"external\" consortium to be a party to an arbitration, based on its capacity to act in its own name, to sue and to be sued. The Tribunal rejected its jurisdiction not because of a lack of legal capacity of the claimant, but because the claimant was not the party bound by the contract underlying the investment, see \u00a7 37(iii).\n\n418.\n\nHaving regard to these considerations, the Tribunal finds that in order to qualify as \"juridical person\" under Article I(2)(b) BIT it is sufficient that Italian law affords those Claimants who constitute entities or other forms of organizations with the capacity to make the investment and the right to litigate in their own name. It is not necessary that they be granted full legal personality under Italian law.\n\n419.\n\nIn the light of the limited scope of the present decision, it is not necessary at this stage to determine which of the Claimants constitute entities in the sense of Article I(2)(b) BIT.\n\n420.\n\nIn addition, in order to benefit from the protection of the BIT and be a party to the present arbitration, these entities must fulfil the criteria of \"Italian nationality.\" According to general international law, applied to corporate entities and other forms of organizations, the nationality requirement means that such entities and organizations must be duly constituted and organized under Italian law and/or have their *'siege social'* in Italy.160 These requirements do not really seem to be disputed between the Parties, Respondent\u2019s objections focusing solely on whether they have been met.161 This question is however premature at this stage and will be examined when dealing with questions relating to individual Claimants (see \u00a7 227 above).\n\nSee Schreuer, *op. cit.* fn. 98, Ad Article 25 \u00a7\u00a7 694 *et seq.,* and references quoted therein.\n\nSee R-MJ \u00a7 364 and R-PHB \u00a7 491, where Respondent states that \"Claimants did not produce any *prima facie* evidence of being incorporated, having their seat in Italy and being recognized under Italian law,\" thereby implicitly admitting that the law of incorporation and/or recognition and the place of the seat are the relevant criteria to determine the nationality of non-natural investors.\n\n421.\n\n**Consequently,** at this stage of the proceedings, it is sufficient to establish that pursuant to the relevant legal provisions the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* over each and any Claimant being a juridical person with Italian nationality on 14 September 2006, meaning that it was on such date constituted in compliance with the legislation of Italy, had its *siege social* in the territory of Italy, and was recognized by Italian law in the sense that it had the civil capacity to make such investment and to litigate in its own name.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n422.\n\nIn conclusion, and in response to Issues Nos. 10 and 11, the Tribunal finds that without making a determination with respect to any individual Claimant, it has jurisdiction *rationae personae* pursuant to Article 1(2) BIT, and its Additional Protocol, and Article 25 ICSID Convention, over each Claimant:\n\n(i) **who is a natural person** and who ultimately is found:\n\n- to have had Italian nationality on 14 September 2006 and 7 February 2007;\n\n- not to also have had Argentinean nationality on either of such dates;\n\n- not to have been domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making the investment;\n\n- to have been an investor as of the date of the alleged breach by Argentina of its treaty obligations.\n\n(ii) **who is a juridical person** and who ultimately is found to have had the Italian nationality on 14 September 2006, meaning that it:\n\n- was on such date constituted in compliance with the legislation of Italy;\n\n- had its *siege social* in the territory of Italy; and\n\n- was recognized by Italian law in the sense that it had the civil capacity to make an investment under the BIT and to litigate in its own name, without necessarily having full legal personality.\n\n**(5) Subject to the Claimants\u2019 Written Consent - Issue 2**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nIt is contested between the Parties whether Claimants validly consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID jurisdiction. In particular, Respondent challenges the validity of the TFA Mandate Package and contends that the mandate given by Claimants in this TFA Mandate Package is not fit to constitute a consent in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. Claimants, on the other hand, contest Argentina's entitlement to challenge the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent.\n\n424.\n\nAgain, in accordance with the limits of the jurisdictional phase, the present decision will not decide whether each Claimant has validly consented to the present arbitration. The Tribunal will limit its analysis to the question whether Claimants\u2019 consent, as expressed in the relevant documents of the TFA Mandate Package, is fit to constitute a valid consent to the present ICSID arbitration taking into account the representation mechanism implemented by the TFA Mandate Package.\n\n425.\n\nThus, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- What is the law applicable to the question of the validity of the Parties\u2019 consent?\n\n- How far need the Tribunal go when examining the existence of consent to ICSID arbitration? In particular:\n\n(i) Is the Tribunal\u2019s scope of examination limited to the mere existence of a consent, or does it further extend to the validity of such consent?\n\n(ii) If extending the Tribunal's scope of review also to the validity of such consent, what are the relevant validity requirements? In this respect, does the multiplicity of Claimants impose certain additional requirements as to the form and content of Claimants\u2019 consent to arbitration?\n\n(iii) What is the relevance and consequence of the argument that Argentina lacks standing to challenge the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent?\n\n- To the extent specific requirements apply to the validity of the consent, are these requirements fulfilled (see Issues 2(a) & 2(b) of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)? In particular:\n\n(i) What is the role and effect of the TFA Mandate Package, other thereto related documents and the Request for Arbitration with regard to Claimants\u2019 consent?\n\n(ii) What is the role and impact on Claimants\u2019 consent of the alleged conflict of interest allegedly affecting TFA?\n\n(iii) Can the consent provided for in the TFA Mandate Package be considered \"irrevocable\" in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.\n\n426.\n\nThe key legal provisions and other documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Article 8 BIT, Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, the TFA Mandate Package, and Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n427.\n\nAs to the specific content and wording of the TFA Mandate Package, it is set forth above in \u00a7\u00a7 86-89.\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n428.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants have not validly consented to the present ICSID arbitration, based mainly on the following arguments:\n\n*(i) Claimants\u2019 consent does not fulfill the applicable substantive requirements :* First, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 consent is vitiated by TFA\u2019s conflict of interests (which aims to protect the Italian banks from their liability towards Claimants), and was obtained through TFA\u2019s misrepresentations and non-disclosure of relevant information. As such, it was given in violation of the good faith principle and has been fraudulently obtained. TFA\u2019s improper conduct is evidenced by the existence of counterfeited signatures on the relevant documents of the TFA Mandate Package.162 Second, the terms of the TFA Mandate Package provide TFA with full control over the arbitration and deprives Claimants\u2019 of basic procedural rights, which is inadmissible. Claimants can therefore not be considered to be legitimately represented by TFA and White & Case in these proceedings and may therefore not be deemed to have validly consented to the present arbitration.163 Third, Claimants have not agreed to the \"irrevocability\" of the purported consent represented in the TFA Mandate, and can therefore not perfect an ICSID arbitration agreement.164\n\n*(ii) Claimants\u2019 consent does not fulfill the applicable form requirements'.* Respondent contends that according to Italian law, the Powers of Attorney issued to TFA and White & Case should have been executed in front of a notary. This has not been done. In addition thereto, there exist strong doubts about the authenticity of the Claimants\u2019 signature on the relevant documents of the TFA Mandate Package, including the Power of Attorneys. Thus, the relevant Powers of Attorney are invalid and Claimants can therefore not be considered to have validly consented to the present ICSID arbitration.165\n\nR-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 144 *et seq.*\n\nR-PHB \u00a7142, \u00a7\u00a7201 *et seq.*\n\nR-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 225 *et seq.*\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 205, R-PHB \u00a7 144.\n\n429.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants contend that they have validly consented to submit a dispute like the present one to ICSID arbitration. Claimants submit that their consent is fully valid, based on the following main arguments:166\n\n(i) Claimants validly consented in writing to arbitrate this dispute (through the signature of the Power of Attorney), which is all that is required as a matter of international law. The documentation Claimants submitted is more than sufficient to demonstrate Claimants\u2019 consent and there is no ground for the Tribunal to second-guess Claimants\u2019 consent;\n\n(ii) The role of TFA is irrelevant in determining whether Claimants consented to arbitrate;\n\n(iii) In any event, TFA\u2019s role is entirely proper. Argentina\u2019s allegation of fraud is wrong and based on the speculative assertion that Claimants have a claim against the Italian banks. Further, there is no conflict of interest; on the contrary, TFA and Claimants have a convergent interest to win these proceedings;\n\n(iv) Formal requirements of Italian law are not applicable to the Powers of Attorneys, which are subject to the law of the District of Columbia;\n\n(v) Respondent\u2019s policy argument as to the impact of an ICSID arbitration on sovereign debt restructuring are irrelevant and inaccurate.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 390 *et seq.,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 355 *et seq.* See aso C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 104 *et seq,* and \u00a7\u00a7 244 *et seq.*\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) Law Applicable to the Question of Consent\n---------------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7 274), Article 8 and in particular Article 8(3) contemplate the Parties\u2019 consent required under Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. It is widely acknowledged that the question of the existence and validity of consent in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention is not subject to the law applicable to the merits designated in Article 42 ICSID Convention, but rather to Article 25 ICSID Convention itself and the instruments expressing such consent.167 This is also the view of the present Tribunal, which considers that questions of consent under Article 25 ICSID Convention are subject to principles of international law, and not pursuant to any particular national law.168 This applies not only with regard to the material content of the consent, i.e., to its substantive validity, but also with regard to its form, i.e., to its formal validity. In this respect, Article 8(7) BIT, which refers to the law applicable to the merits of the dispute in the sense of Article 42 ICSID Convention, is irrelevant for the determination of the existence of consent.\n\nSee e.g. Schreuer, op. cit. fn. 98, \u00a7 578 *et seq.* and references quoted therein.\n\nSee also *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. the Slovak Republic* (ARB/97/4), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00a7 35.\n\n(ii) Scope of Examination of the Tribunal\n-----------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Tribunal must verify the existence of a consent, as an objective condition to its jurisdiction (see \u00a7 258 above). However, the question of the scope of such examination arises: How far does the examination of the Tribunal need to go in order to verify the existence of consent? And, in particular, is such examination limited to the existence of consent, or should it extend also to the formal and substantive validity of such consent? What, if any, are the documents or other evidence that may be required from Claimants to verify the existence and/or validity of such consent?\n\n432.\n\nWith regard to the formal requirements, Article 8 BIT does not appear to impose any specific form requirement, whilst Article 25(1) ICSID Convention only requires the consent to be in \"written\" form. No notarization or supplementary other procedure is requested.\n\n433.\n\nWith regard to the substantive requirements, both Article 8 BIT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention are silent and there are no internationally recognized specific rules regarding such requirements. In addition, Article 25(1) ICSID Convention does not require the submission of any particular document or evidence. This question is therefore to be assessed by the Tribunal.\n\n434.\n\nAs such, one could argue that a tribunal\u2019s role is limited to the examination of the existence of a written document, incorporating the parties\u2019 consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, without further examination regarding other aspects of such consent.\n\n435.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that such an approach may - depending on the circumstances - not give sufficient regard to the crucial role of consent, which constitutes the cornerstone of ICSID and BIT arbitration. Under the particular circumstances of the present case and the nature and scope of Respondent\u2019s objections, the Tribunal considers that it not only has the duty to examine the existence of a written document incorporating a consent to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration, but it should also ask itself whether such consent reflected Claimants\u2019 sincere intention.\n\n(iii) Relevant Substantive Validity Requirements\n------------------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7 435), the Tribunal believes that in the present case its examination regarding consent should go beyond the mere formal existence of the consent. In this respect, the Tribunal finds that reference should be made to international law and in particular the general principles of law requiring that any consent be genuine and intended, i.e., free from coercion, fraud and/or from any essential mistake.\n\n437.\n\nThus, consent that was not freely given, i.e., given under threats or coercion, was in fraudulently induced,169 or was based on an essential mistake170 may not constitute a valid consent under general principles of law. It is generally admitted that under such circumstances the party, who is victim of coercion, fraud or mistake may avoid the contract. The Tribunal holds that the same principle should apply to the concept of consent under Article 8(3) and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.\n\nA consent is fraudulously induced when it is based on a willfully inaccurate representation on a willful concealment of information, which in accordance with good faith and fair dealing should have been disclosed.\n\nA mistake is considered essential, where the party would not have given it consent had it known about the mistake.\n\n438.\n\nAt this point, a distinction should be drawn between the genuine character of the consent and the motivations lying behind this consent. The reasons why a person decides to give its consent to a specific commitment are in principle irrelevant for it to be valid, provided they are based on a correct understanding of the underlying facts and law. In other words, an investor who consents to ICSID arbitration must understand and want to initiate ICSID arbitration as a dispute resolution means for the dispute at stake. The reasons why such investor opts for ICSID arbitration, the question whether or not the decision to give its consent is a \"good\" decision, e.g., whether it is the best way to get the sought redress or whether there may be further more suitable options, is in contrast irrelevant for the validity of the consent, provided such consent was free and informed.\n\n439.\n\nWith regard to the \"irrevocability\" of the consent, this irrevocability is not a prerequisite of a valid consent but rather a consequence of the existence of a valid consent: If a party has validly consented to ICSID arbitration, such consent is irrevocable. Thus, although irrevocability and validity go hand in hand, irrevocability does not constitute a separate validity requirement. Thus, whilst it is necessary, it is also sufficient that the party giving its consent be aware of and agrees with such irrevocable nature.\n\n440.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal shall examine not only the existence of a written document incorporating consent, but also the validity of such consent, whereby the only relevant validity requirement is that such consent be given in a free and informed manner. Other validity requirements which may apply under national laws to specific kinds of contracts or actions are however irrelevant and will not be taken into account by the Tribunal.\n\n(iv) Argentina\u2019s Standing to Challenge Claimants\u2019 Consent\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nClaimants contend that Argentina does not have standing to challenge Claimants\u2019 consent and that such challenge could only be raised by Claimants themselves.\n\n442.\n\nIndeed, the avoidance of a contract based on a coercion, fraud or mistake is in principle reserved to the party whose consent is affected by such flaw. It can in principle not be invoked by the other party, who has validly consented to the contract.\n\n443.\n\nHowever, the particularity of the case is that the alleged fraud and/or mistake is alleged to have been caused by a third party, TFA. The question therefore arises whether the party, validly bound by its own consent, can invoke the other party\u2019s flawed consent to challenge the validity of the contract.\n\n444.\n\nConsidering (i) the crucial role of consent in ICSID and BIT arbitration, (ii) the relevant third party, i.e., TFA\u2019s role in the present dispute, and (iii) the fact that Argentina had no link with or control over TFA, the Tribunal considers that Argentina is not precluded from invoking a lack of consent from Claimants in relation to TFA\u2019s role and behaviour.\n\n445.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that all of Respondent\u2019s arguments are admissible or otherwise fit to establish a lack of consent. The Tribunal shall stick to the scope of examination and the validity requirements described above (\u00a7\u00a7 431-440) and address only those arguments which fall within the scope of such examination. In addition, when proceeding to such examination, the Tribunal shall give due regard to the fact that Claimants themselves do not invoke such lack of consent, which may impose a higher standard of proof than if the mistake or fraud is invoked by the affected party itself.\n\n(v) Existence and Validity of Claimants\u2019 Consent\n------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7 258), within the context of BIT based arbitration, it is widely admitted that consent is given through the initiation of ICSID proceedings, which constitutes the acceptance by an investor of the Host State\u2019s offer to arbitrate. Thus, it is the Request for Arbitration that embodies the consent of the investor, unless the investor has otherwise previously expressed its consent, e.g. in a notice of dispute. Where such Request is filed by a lawyer, that lawyer must be duly authorized to do so, based on an appropriate power of attorney. In other words, in such a circumstance, it is the power of attorney instructing the lawyer to launch the arbitration proceedings on behalf of the investor and the request thereby filed by the empowered attorney which contain and simultaneously constitute the consent of the investor.\n\n447.\n\nAs mentioned before (see \u00a7 430 above), the validity of such power of attorney as embodiment and expression of an investor\u2019s consent is thus subject to general principles of international law. Indeed, one must distinguish the validity of the power of attorney itself and the validity of the consent embodied therein. While the former is a matter of procedure (and thereby of admissibility) and is regulated in Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules, the latter is a matter of jurisdiction and subject to the law applicable to the consent itself, i.e., international law.\n\n448.\n\nTherefore, objections regarding the formal invalidity of a power of attorney would - if at all - be relevant under Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules. In this respect, it should be stressed that the filing of ICSID arbitration is not an action reserved to lawyers admitted to practice in a specific jurisdiction or bar. It is open to any investor, irrespective of its legal qualifications and such investor is not required to resort to the assistance of a lawyer, although such assistance may in practice be highly recommended. Consequently, even if lawyers are asked to intervene by preparing and participating to the ICSID proceedings on the investor\u2019s behalf, there is no reason to impose on such lawyers and their principal specific limitations or restrictions existing in their home jurisdiction and applicable to domestic court or arbitration proceedings. This is so irrespective of whether or not lawyers are, under the locally applicable professional rules, prevented from representing or limited in the way of representing such an investor in ICSID arbitration, and may engage their liability towards their client and/or relevant authorities in their home jurisdiction. It may, under certain circumstances, further raise questions with regard to the admissibility of the arbitration proceedings initiated by such lawyers (see \u00a7\u00a7 506 *et seq.* below). It may however in principle not affect the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration, unless the circumstances at hand simultaneously constitute a fraud, a coercion or a mistake in the sense described above (see \u00a7\u00a7 436-440) and being the basis for the investor\u2019s consent.\n\n449.\n\nThus, the core question in order to determine the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent is the following:\n\n**In view of the content and specificities of the TFA Mandate Package, the alleged circumstances surrounding its signature and the representation mechanism implemented by such Package, can Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration still be considered a free and informed consent?**\n\n450.\n\nThe TFA Mandate Package is composed of (i) the TFA Instruction Letter, (ii) the Power of Attorney, (iii) the TFA Mandate, and (iv) additional questionnaires and instructions, as further described above (see \u00a7\u00a7 85-89).\n\n451.\n\nThe TFA Instruction Letter provides in section 8 thereof some \"basic rules that the conduct of the ICSID arbitration on behalf of numerous Italian Investors makes it necessary to impose on all of [the bondholders].\"171 These rules focus mainly on two issues: (i) the eligibility of a person to participate in the ICSID arbitration, and (ii) rules concerning the conduct of such arbitration:\n\n- With regard to the eligibility requirements, the TFA Instruction Letter requires that a person wishing to participate in the ICSID arbitration must be an \"investor,\" i.e., hold a security entitlement in the relevant Argentine bonds. In addition thereto, the TFA Instruction Letter sets forth that anyone who intends to initiate ICSID arbitration may not bring - as long as the arbitration proceedings are ongoing - any legal action in Italy against any credit institution, i.e., bank, that sold the bonds to them. The TFA Instruction Letter justifies this restraint by an alleged risk that legal proceedings against the banks may lead to the annulment of the purchase of the bonds, which in turn would annihilate the status of \"investor\" of the concerned person. Nevertheless, the TFA Instruction Letter also provides that it is possible for the \"investors\" to change their mind and revoke the mandates related to the ICSID arbitration, whereby a revocation of these mandates in principle triggers the investor\u2019s withdrawal from the ICSID proceeding. It is further mentioned that the running of the statute of limitations for claims against the banks will not be tolled by the participation to the ICSID proceeding.\n\n- With regard to the rules concerning the conduct of the arbitration, the TFA Instruction Letter introduces and explains the role of TFA and the appointed lawyers White & Case, further described in the TFA Mandate. Based on these two documents, TFA is given all powers to take any action necessary to conduct the arbitration and/or settle the dispute, without direct consultation with Claimants, who are deprived of the right to give instructions either to TFA or to White & Case. The TFA Instruction Letter and the TFA Mandate justify this restraint as necessary for reasons of coherence and uniformity of representation of all Italian bondholders, and base it on the principle that TFA\u2019s role is to act in the collective interest of all bondholders.\n\nSee TFA Instruction Letter (Exh. RA-2), Section 8, first paragraph.\n\n452.\n\nBased on the TFA Instruction Letter and the TFA Mandate, as well as the supplementary documentation included in the TFA Mandate Package, each Claimant then had to sign a Power of Attorney, in which it (i) declared being a holder of relevant Argentine bonds, (ii) declared giving its irrevocable consent to submit to ICSID arbitration and to accept Argentina\u2019s offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 BIT, and (iii) conferred to White & Case the power to initiate and conduct on its behalf the ICSID arbitration and other actions necessary to manage the Claimant\u2019s rights as deriving from its status as bondholder.\n\n(vi) Existence of a Clear Consent to ICSID Arbitration\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the Power of Attorney constitutes a written power of attorney and contains a clear and unambiguous expression of irrevocable consent by the relevant Claimant to initiate ICSID arbitration against Argentina in relation to its non-payment of amounts due under the relevant bonds, and to entrust White & Case with the conduct of such arbitration. Based thereon, this Power of Attorney constitutes a written consent in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.\n\n454.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n- Whether or not this Power of Attorney also complies with Italian law or law of the District of Columbia is irrelevant for the purpose of assessing its validity under Article 8 BIT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the Powers of Attorney were signed by the relevant Claimants. The argument of a possible falsification of certain signatures is irrelevant at this stage, and will - if necessary - be examined when dealing with issues relating to individual Claimants.\n\n- Further, objections relating to the validity of the Power of Attorney itself fall under Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules and are not of a nature to challenge the validity of the consent embodied therein (see \u00a7 448 above).\n\n- In addition, Claimants\u2019 intention to participate to the ICSID proceedings is further confirmed by the series of further documents, such as copies of identification documents and documents establishing the holding of the security entitlement, which each Claimant had to submit together with the TFA Mandate Package.\n\n(vii) Validity of Claimants\u2019 Consent to ICSID Arbitration\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThus, the question now is whether the consent of the Claimants, who signed this Power of Attorney, may have been truncated by coercion, fraud or an essential mistake caused by TFA and/or White & Case. Respondent alleges that the restraints set forth in the TFA Mandate Package preventing Claimants from freely pursuing the banks is fraudulent, to the extent that it is based on a misrepresentation of key facts and legal issues aiming at unduly protecting the banks from law suits and with the effect of depriving Claimants of a redress against such banks. In other words, Respondent\u2019s argument suggests that these documents concealed TFA\u2019s real purpose, i.e., protecting its banks, and that had Claimants known such real purpose, they would not have given their consent to the TFA Mandate Package and thereby to ICSID arbitration.\n\n456.\n\nThe system put in place by the TFA Mandate Package provides for certain restrictions, such as the waiver of Claimants to sue the Italian banks for the duration of the ICSID proceedings, limitations related thereto imposed on the revocation of the TFA Mandate Package, and the principle that Claimants are passive participants to the arbitration, all relevant decisions being made by TFA and White & Case on behalf of these Claimants,. With regard to these restrictions and limitations the Tribunal finds as follows:\n\n457.\n\n*(i) With regard to Claimants\u2019 inability to give instructions and make decisions regarding the conduct of proceedings,* the Tribunal holds that this restriction was clearly set forth in the TFA Mandate Package. In this respect, Claimants were aware that by accepting the TFA Mandate Package, they would be unable to exercise themselves certain procedural rights individually, and in particular they would not be in a position to instruct the lawyers and direct the proceedings individually. In addition, it is also understandable that proceedings involving several thousand claimants cannot be conducted in the same manner as proceedings with a handful of claimants, and that the coordination and management of such proceedings may therefore affect the scope of power and freedom of the parties to decide on how to conduct the proceedings. The question may arise whether this cutting into Claimants\u2019 rights may have gone too far. This question is however not a question of consent: Claimants knew what they were doing. It is a question of admissibility: Is it admissible for Claimants to entrust a third party with rights as extensive as those of TFA? This question will thus be addressed together with other issues of admissibility (see \u00a7\u00a7 536 *et seq.* below).\n\n458.\n\n*(ii) With regard to Claimants\u2019 inability to sue the banks whilst ICSID arbitration is ongoing,* the Tribunal finds that this restriction (rightfully or wrongfully) indeed benefits the banks. Under the TFA Mandate Package scheme, banks are protected from being sued by Claimants as long as the ICSID arbitration is ongoing and Claimants participate thereto. Based thereon, Respondent alleges that TFA, whose membership is composed of such banks, is affected by a conflict of interest which truncates Claimants\u2019 consent. The Tribunal holds that the restriction imposed on Claimants with regard to the temporary limitation to sue the banks is neither fraudulent, nor does it attach Claimants\u2019 consent with any essential mistake. The reasons are the following:\n\n- Whilst the representation mechanism implemented by the TFA Mandate Package does impose certain restrictions on Claimants, it should not be forgotten that it also actually entitles Claimants to conduct ICSID arbitration, at the cost and expense of the TFA\u2019s member banks. Indeed, it is very unlikely that many of the Claimants would individually be in a position to initiate and conduct ICSID arbitration, if they had to finance the arbitration themselves.\n\n- It is further true that the TFA member banks may indirectly benefit from this scheme, since there is a likelihood of reducing the risks that they get sued by Claimants. However, there is no certainty regarding the existence of scope of any claims against the TFA member banks and these banks are actually paying a certain price for this \"risk reduction,\" since they are financing the ICSID proceedings. In other words, from TFA\u2019s perspective, the TFA Mandate Package is a sort of a risk insurance, for which they pay a premium (the cost of the ICSID arbitration), in return for which they are protected to a certain extent against a risk (lawsuits from Claimants).\n\n459.\n\nThis scheme may appear uncommon and it raises questions relating to TFA\u2019s role in the proceedings, such as issues of conflict of interests between TFA and Claimants. However, these are more considerations of admissibility of the proceedings, rather than of consent of Claimants (see \u00a7\u00a7 529 *et seq.* below). The key factor with regard to Claimants\u2019 consent is not related to the motivations of TFA, but rather to the question whether through the TFA Mandate Package Claimants\u2019 were fraudulently induced in doing something they did not want to do, or whether they unconsciously waived a right or lost an option, which - if conscious thereof - they would not have been willing to concede at the price of being able to conduct ICSID arbitration.\n\n460.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants would not have agreed to ICSID arbitration had they been better aware of the risks related to such ICSID arbitration, in particular the alleged risk of losing their potential claims against the TFA member banks. The Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to bring sufficient evidence supporting such contention.\n\n461.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the TFA Mandate Package contains sufficient information to allow Claimants to make an informed consent. It clearly sets forth that during the ICSID arbitration Claimants cannot simultaneously initiate legal claims against the TFA member banks and that the statute of limitation for such claims is not tolled. Further, it is also comprehensive with regard to the way the proceedings will be conducted, restricting Claimants from exercising themselves a number of decisional and procedural rights. Of course, one could argue that some information of the TFA Mandate Package could have been better explained or should have been more comprehensive. However, one should also take into account that the present dispute is not a consumer dispute, although a number of the Claimants may have a consumer like profile. It is a dispute surrounding multi faceted financial investments. Thus, the degree and nature of the information provided did not need be of the same extent and nature than in the context of pure consumer transactions, and TFA was entitled to assume a certain level of sophistication and knowledge of the investors.\n\n462.\n\nThus, based on the information contained in the TFA Mandate Package the Tribunal finds that it allowed Claimants to make an informed choice between (i) ICSID arbitration at the cost of TFA and at the temporary detriment of Claimants\u2019 potential claims against TFA\u2019s member banks, or (ii) civil litigation against the banks, at Claimants\u2019 own expense and without the option of simultaneous ICSID arbitration against Argentina.\n\n463.\n\nIn addition, even if the TFA Mandate Package did not contain sufficient information or did to some extent misrepresent certain information, such a flaw would have been cured by the subsequent events. Indeed, various associations started to assist Italian purchasers of Argentinean bonds by disseminating information on available legal means and even by supporting them in the revocation of the TFA Mandate Package, the tolling of the prescription period and/or the filing of legal claims against the banks.172 Thus, even if at the time of signature of the TFA Mandate Package, some of the Claimants did not have a full picture of what they were doing, they were able to get such a full picture afterwards through the various actions of associations, legal proceedings and news reports on the ongoing ICSID arbitration. Given that Claimants themselves do not invoke a lack of consent, it is sufficient that they were in a position to appreciate the scope of their commitment to ICSID arbitration, and it is irrelevant whether or not they eventually really understood such commitment.\n\nSee Cerniglia, \u00a7\u00a7 4 *et seq.,* see also Hearing Tr. Day 4 pp. 933/10-939-22, and pp. 952/8-953/21; and Illuminato, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5, 9\n\n464.\n\nThus, whilst the Tribunal does not take a position on TFA\u2019s representation scheme resembling a \"seduction operation,\" there is no indication that such operation was systematically fraudulent, coercive or otherwise caused Claimants to agree to ICSID arbitration based on an essential mistake.\n\n465.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal considers that there is at this stage no indication that Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration through the TFA Mandate Package and the initiation of the present proceedings by White & Case in accordance with such package would be invalid.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n466.\n\nIn conclusion and in response to Issue No. 2, the Tribunal holds that the way in which Claimants consented to the ICSID arbitration through the relevant documents contained in the TFA Mandate Package is - as a matter of principle -valid. In particular:\n\n(i) Based on the circumstances leading to the execution of the documents embodying Claimants\u2019 consents, in particular, the Declaration of Consent and the Power of Attorney, there is at this stage no indication that such execution would have been achieved based on systematical fraud, coercion or essential mistake vitiating Claimants\u2019 consent;\n\n(ii) Whether or not such fraud, coercion or mistake may exist with regard to individual Claimants based on the specific circumstances of the individual case remains open and will be addressed, to the extent necessary and appropriate, when dealing with issues concerning individual Claimants;\n\n(iii) Questions regarding TFA\u2019s specific role and relevance, as well as issues relating to conflict of interests or breach of professional obligations by White & Case are issues relating to the admissibility of the proceedings, and not to the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent. They will be addressed, to the extent necessary and appropriate, when dealing with the issue of admissibility (see \u00a7 642 *et seq.* below).\n\n**(6) Subject to Argentina\u2019s Written Consent - Issues 1(a), 4 & 8**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nIt is uncontested that through Article 8(3) BIT, Argentina, in principle, consented to ICSID arbitration with regard to a dispute falling within the scope of the BIT and according to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Whilst the principle is not contested, the scope and the modalities of this consent are disputed. In particular, it is disputed between the Parties whether Respondent\u2019s consent, as expressed in the BIT, covers \"mass claims\" within the context of sovereign debt restructuring.\n\n468.\n\nThus, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- What is the scope of Argentina\u2019s consent under Article 8, and in particular:\n\n(i) Does the fact that the dispute relates to sovereign debt restructuring somehow exclude Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration?\n\n(ii) Which are the elements of the dispute that must be covered by Argentina\u2019s consent, and in particular:\n\n- Is the multiplicity of Claimants an element that must be covered by Argentina\u2019s consent or is it only a procedural modality? (see Issue 1(a) of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n- Is the previous negotiation and litigation requirement an element which draws the limits of the consent, or is it a modality of the consent? (see Issue 4 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n(iii) Based thereon, can Argentina be considered to have consented to the present proceedings? (see Issue 1(a) of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n- What are, if any, the effects of the contractual forum selection clauses in the relevant bond documents on Argentina\u2019s consent? (see Issue 8 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n469.\n\nThe key legal provisions and other documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Articles 1 and 8 BIT in connection with Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, (see \u00a7\u00a7 336 and 268 *et seq.* above), as well as the forum selection clauses contained in the relevant bond documents.173\n\nSee above \u00a7 340.\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n470.\n\nWith regard to Argentina\u2019s consent, Respondent contends that it has not and cannot be considered to have consented in any of the relevant instruments to ICSID arbitration over a dispute relating to sovereign debt restructuring and taking the form of an unprecedented mass action.\n\n471.\n\nRespondent bases its position on the following main arguments:174\n\n(i) The ICSID framework is silent concerning the possibility of collective proceedings;\n\n(ii) At the time of the conclusion of ICSID Convention and BIT, collective claims were allowed neither in Italy nor in Argentina, and could therefore not have been envisaged by Argentina;\n\n(iii) The present proceeding is an unprecedented proceeding, neither Party could have expected;\n\n(iv) The present proceeding would change the nature of ICSID claims as it was envisioned, from one focused on studied analysis of the grievances brought by an individual investor for a singular, precise harm, to one focused on mass or class claims in which the circumstances of each Claimants can no longer be realistically examined and the peculiarities of each investment are ignored in favor of the lowest common denominator;\n\n(v) The opening of ICSID arbitration with regard to sovereign debt restructuring would be counterproductive and go against current efforts to modernize foreign debt restructuring process;\n\n(vi) The forum selection clauses contained in the bond documents clearly show that Argentina did not consent to submit the disputes arising from the bonds to ICSID arbitration;\n\n(vii) Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration is, in any event, conditional upon the compliance with the preliminary negotiation and litigation requirement set forth in Articles 8(1) and (2).\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 136 *et seq.,* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 138 *et seq.,* 159 *et seq.,* 168 *et seq.,* \u00a7\u00a7 183 *et seq,* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a711 *et seq.*\n\n472.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants contend that Argentina validly consented to submit a dispute like this one to ICSID arbitration:175\n\n(i) Claimants contend that Respondent gave its express consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT and its consent contains no limitation on the number of Claimants who may submit such dispute. This is evidenced by the use of the plural in Article 8 BIT, as well as by the nature of some of the types of investment listed in Article 8(1) BIT, which necessarily implies a plurality of investors;\n\n(ii) Claimants further submit that the existence of forum selection clause contained in the contractual documents may not influence the validity of the consent given by Argentina with regard to treaty claims;\n\n(iii) Claimants finally contend that Article 8 sets forth three alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, none of them being a pre-condition to the others. Consequently, the non-compliance with the negotiation or litigation mechanism provided in Article 8(1) and Article 8(2) has no bearing on Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 113 *et seq.,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 292 *et seq.,* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 147 *et seq.,*\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) In General\n--------------\n\n473.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7 258), within the context of BIT based arbitration, it is widely admitted that consent of the Host State is given through the provision in the relevant BIT of a dispute resolution clause providing for ICSID arbitration. This is the case of Article 8, in particular Articles 8(3) and 8(5) BIT, in which Argentina consented to submit \"disputes relating to investments\" and \"in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement\" to ICSID arbitration, if so chosen by the investor.\n\n474.\n\nAs arises from sections(2) and (3) above, the present dispute is a dispute arising out of the BIT and relating to an investment. So far, it is a dispute falling within the scope of Argentina\u2019s consent as expressed in Article 8 BIT.\n\n475.\n\nIn view of the specificities of the present arbitration, the question arises whether Respondent\u2019s consent covers all relevant elements of the present dispute.\n\n(ii) Regarding Foreign Debt Restructuring\n-----------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s argument that ICSID arbitration should be excluded concerning disputes arising from foreign debt restructuring, the Tribunal finds that this argument is without merit.\n\n477.\n\nIt is to be recalled that a State has the possibility under Article 25(4) ICSID Convention to notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes from that it would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre. No such notification has been made by Argentina.\n\n478.\n\nIn the absence of such notification, the core question with regard to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction is whether the investment at stake is protected under the concerned BIT providing for ICSID arbitration in case of breach of such protection. If this is the case, then the State\u2019s consent must be considered to extend to such investment and the dispute falls within the scope of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n479.\n\nTo the extent that the Tribunal has accepted that actions of Argentina relating to its foreign debt restructuring may, in principle and under certain circumstances, affect Claimants\u2019 rights and are therefore susceptible of constituting a violation of provisions of the BIT (see \u00a7\u00a7 311-330, 331 above), there is no reason to exempt foreign debt restructuring situations from the scope of application of the BIT.\n\n(iii) Regarding \"Mass Claims\"\n-----------------------------\n\n480.\n\nIt should be stressed that there is no uniform terminology concerning the various kinds of proceedings involving a high number of parties, and that various jurisdictions, courts and authors refer to different terms and meanings. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the Tribunal will refer to \"mass proceedings\" as a qualification for the present proceedings, whereby this term should be understood as referring simply to the high number of Claimants appearing together as one mass, and without any prejudgment on the procedural classification of the present proceedings as a specific kind of \"collective proceedings\" recognized under any specific legal order.\n\n481.\n\nRespondent contends that its consent does not extend to disputes taking the form of \"mass proceedings,\" mainly because the \"mass\" aspect of the proceedings is not possible within the normal ICSID framework and implies adaptations to such framework, which cannot be done by the Tribunal itself and are of such importance that they must be specifically covered by Respondent\u2019s consent.\n\n482.\n\nIn order to determine whether the \"mass\" aspect of the present arbitration should be subject to the express consent of Respondent, it is first necessary to examine more in detail the nature and characteristics of such proceedings, which fall under the more general concept of \"collective proceedings.\"\n\n483.\n\n*(i) Types of Collective Proceedings and their Key Features.* It is impossible to list all the various types of collective proceedings existing worldwide within the context of court litigation or arbitration. A certain categorization into two main types of collective proceedings is, however, possible:176\n\n- *Representative proceedings:* Some jurisdictions address collective injuries by creating mechanisms allowing claims to be brought for representative relief. Whilst forms of representative relief vary greatly, they have in common that a high number of claims arise as one single action. The mechanism in which these claims are brought together vary and can be categorized by reference to their approach to three different issues: (i) the nature of the claim, with regard to which representative relief can take the form of a purely procedural device available regardless of the type of substantive law at issue, or be limited to certain fields of law (e.g., consumer law, antitrust, etc.); (ii) the nature of the representative, who can be a private named individual on behalf of a large group of unnamed others or an approved intermediary entity on behalf of all injured individuals; (iii) the nature of the relief, which can take the form of individual damages or representative relief (e.g., declaratory or injuctive relief).\n\n- *Aggregate proceedings:* Some jurisdictions address collective injuries through judicial aggregation of claims, such as, for example, the English Group Litigation Order (GLO), which results in the creation of a judicial registry of individual claims that arise out of the same fact pattern, and then are assigned to the same judge for management purposes. Whilst this sort of collective proceeding is relatively uncontroversial in the context of court proceedings, where courts can simply apply pre-existing rules of procedure regarding joinder, intervention or consolidation to create the necessary procedure, the situation is more delicate in the context of arbitration. Although certain principles and mechanisms have developed through the concept of \"multiparty and multicontract arbitrations,\" typically involving a handful of parties, many issues remain where the number of parties reaches the \"mass\" level.\n\nFor a quick overview see Stacy I. Starck, From Class to Collective: The De-Americanization of Class Arbitration, in Arbitration International, Vol. 26 No. 4 (2010), pp 493-548, pp 501-508, which refers further to a third type, i.e., \"settlement-only proceedings,\" which permit parties to a mass dispute to create a collective for settlement purposes only.\n\n484.\n\nThe Tribunal will refrain from trying to identify and give a name to further subcategories in order to avoid endless discussions over the correct terminologies. Suffice is to say that although various legal systems have developed certain types of collective proceedings, their scope, modalities and effects remain different from one jurisdiction to another, and that there is, as of today, no harmonized approach towards such collective proceedings. Nevertheless, it appears that all these various forms of collective proceedings share a common \"raison d\u2019etre\": Collective proceedings emerged where they constituted the only way to ensure an effective remedy in protection of a substantive right provided by contract or law; in other words, collective proceedings were seen as necessary, where the absence of such mechanism would *de facto* have resulted in depriving the claimants of their substantive rights due to the lack of appropriate mechanism.177\n\nSee Starck, *op. cit.* fn.176, pp 183-212, pp 195-196.\n\n485.\n\nThe issues raised by the development of collective proceedings are manifold and depend on the type of collective proceedings. In the context of arbitration, these issues arise in slightly different terms and focus mainly around the following problems: Representative proceedings raise issues relating to consent, especially for those who subscribe to a view of arbitration that requires the parties\u2019 explicit consent not only to arbitration of the dispute but also to the procedure to be used in the arbitration. In contrast, aggregate proceedings raise issues of a more technical nature, in particular the question whether ordering the parties to proceed collectively is within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion and authority.\n\n486.\n\nLooking at the way the present arbitration was initiated, the present proceedings appear to be aggregate proceedings, in which each individual Claimant is aware of and consented to the ICSID arbitration. As such, the present proceedings cannot be compared to US class-actions, in which a representative initiates a proceeding in the name of a class composed of an undetermined number of unidentified claimants. In the present arbitration, the number of Claimants is established and so is their identity.\n\n487.\n\nHowever, one cannot ignore that some features of the present proceedings, in particular the way it is conducted, resemble representative actions: Although Claimants made the individual and conscious choice of participating to the arbitration, their participation is thereafter limited to a passive participation in the sense that a third party, TFA, represents their interests and makes on their behalf all the decisions relating to the conduct of the proceedings. The high number of Claimants further makes it impossible for the representative to take into account individual interests of individual Claimants, and rather limits the proceedings to the defense of interests common to the entire group of Claimants.\n\n488.\n\nIn summary, the present proceedings seem to be a sort of a hybrid kind of collective proceedings, in the sense that it starts as aggregate proceedings, but then continues with features similar to representative proceedings due to the high number of Claimants involved.\n\n489.\n\n*(ii) \"Mass\" Aspect and Consent.* As mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 453-455 and \u00a7 474), both Parties have consented to ICSID arbitration as dispute resolution method for disputes arising out of the BIT. The only remaining question is whether a specific consent regarding the specific conditions in which the present arbitration would be conducted is required, i.e., regarding the form of collective proceedings.\n\n490.\n\nThis question led the Tribunal to the conclusion that the answer should be in the negative, mainly for the following reasons:\n\n- Assuming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims of several individual Claimants, it is difficult to conceive why and how the Tribunal could loose such jurisdiction where the number of Claimants outgrows a certain threshold. First of all, what is the relevant threshold ? And second, can the Tribunal really \u2018loose\u2019 a jurisdiction it has when looking at Claimants individually ?\n\n- In addition, the collective nature of the present proceeding derives primarily from the nature of the investment made. The ICSID Convention aims at promoting and protecting investments, without however further defining the concept of investment and leaving this task to the parties through relevant instruments such as BITs (see \u00a7\u00a7 257 and 362 *et seq.* above). Thus, where the BIT covers investments, such as bonds, which are susceptible of involving in the context of the same investment a high number of investors, and where such investments require a collective relief in order to provide effective protection to such investment, it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and to the spirit of ICSID, to require in addition to the consent to ICSID arbitration in general, a supplementary express consent to the form of such arbitration. In such cases, consent to ICSID arbitration must be considered to cover the form of arbitration necessary to give efficient protection and remedy to the investors and their investments, including arbitration in the form of collective proceedings.\n\n491.\n\nThus, with regard to the \"mass\" aspect of the present proceedings, the Tribunal considers that the relevant question is not \"has Argentina consented to the mass proceedings?\", but rather \"can an ICSID arbitration be conducted in the form of \u2018mass proceedings\u2019 considering that this would require an adaptation and/or modification by the Tribunal of certain procedural rules provided for under the current ICSID framework?\" If the answer is in the affirmative, then Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration includes such mass aspect. If the answer is in the negative, then ICSID arbitration is not possible, not because Argentina did not consent thereto but because mass claims as the ones at stake are not possible under the current ICSID framework.\n\n492.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal is of the opinion that the \"mass\" aspect of the present proceedings relates to the modalities and implementation of the ICSID proceedings and not to the question whether Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration. Therefore, it relates to the question of admissibility and not to the question of jurisdiction. It will thus be addressed below when dealing with admissibility issues (see \u00a7\u00a7515 *et seq.* below).\n\n(iv) Regarding the Negotiation and 18 Months Litigation Requirement\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nRespondent argues that the requirement of negotiation and litigation set forth in Articles 8(1) and 8(2) are of such a nature and importance that they constitute an essential part of and motive for Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. In other words, Respondent contends that it would not have consented to ICSID arbitration if such arbitration had not been made conditional upon the implementation of a prior mechanism of negotiation and 18 months litigation.\n\n494.\n\nThe present issue comes down to the following question: What is conditional? Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction or the implementation of such consent in a case as the present one? Indeed, there is a difference between conditioning its consent to ICSID jurisdiction to the fulfilment of a pre-condition, and conditioning the effective implementation of such consent, i.e., the possibility to resort to ICSID arbitration, to the fulfilment of such a pre-condition.\n\n495.\n\nIn the case at hand, the question is not as much \"has Argentina consented to ICSID jurisdiction?\" This would make little sense in the light of Argentina's adherence to the Washington Convention and its acceptance of ICSID arbitration under Article 8 BIT for the present type of dispute (see \u00a7 474 above). The question is rather \"under what circumstances will ICSID arbitration be possible under the terms of Argentina\u2019s consent?\"\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the negotiation and 18 months litigation requirements relate to the conditions for implementation of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration, and not the fundamental question of whether Argentina consented to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration. Thus, any non-compliance with such requirements may not lead to a lack of ICSID jurisdiction, and only - if at all - to a lack of admissibility of the claim, and will thus be addressed when dealing with issues of admissibility (see \u00a7\u00a7 567 *et seq.* below).\n\n(v) Regarding the Forum Selection Clauses\n-----------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nRespondent further argues that the introduction of forum selection clauses in the relevant bond documents is to be interpreted as an exclusion of consent to ICSID arbitration for disputes deriving from such bonds.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow Respondent in this respect as it conflates contract claims and treaty claims. As explained above (see \u00a7\u00a7 316 *et seq.),* even though Claimants claims relate to the bonds, they are based on alleged breaches by Argentina of the BIT and not on contractual rights provided to Claimants under the bond documents. The forum selection clauses apply only to claims based on contractual rights, and may not affect treaty claims, which the bond documents did neither anticipate nor deal with.\n\n499.\n\nConsequently, the presence of forum selection clauses in the contractual bond documents is irrelevant for the assessment of the existence and/or validity of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n500.\n\nIn conclusion and in (partial) response to Issues Nos. 1(a), 4 and 8, the Tribunal finds that Argentina validly consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration. In particular:\n\n(i) The fact that the present dispute relates to foreign debt restructuring is *per se* irrelevant to the determination of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n(ii) Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction includes claims presented by multiple Claimants to the extent that such claims are admissible under the ICSID framework;\n\n(iii) The negotiation and litigation requirement provided in Articles 8(1) and (2) of the BIT does not condition Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration, and merely relates to the circumstances under which such consent is to be given full effect and be implemented;\n\n(iv) The presence of forum selection clauses in the contractual bond documents are irrelevant to the determination of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n**(7) Conclusion on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over the present claims as follows:\n\n(i) The claims at stake are treaty claims in nature and fall under the scope of the BIT and therewith under the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal (see \u00a7\u00a7 331-332 above). In particular:\n\n- The allegations of Claimants and the facts on which these allegations are based are susceptible of constituting a violation of provisions of the BIT and establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with regard to the present claims;\n\n- The claims brought forward by Claimants are not pure contractual claims but treaty claims based on acts of Argentina, a sovereign, which Claimants allege are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT;\n\n- If third parties, in particular the Italian banks, have breached any of their own obligations towards Argentina and/or the Claimants, redress can be sought by either Argentina and/or Claimants against these banks under the remedies provided for in the relevant contractual bond documents or in the applicable statutory laws and/or regulations concering purchase and sale of securities. Such liability, however, does not seem to derive from the BIT and would therefore in principle have no place in the present proceedings;\n\n- Under these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary anymore to examine Issue No. 6, i.e., whether the Tribunal may also have jurisdiction based on the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT in connection with the MFN Clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT. To the extent that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction already derives from the treaty nature of the claims at stake, the question of the interaction between the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT and the MFN Clause of the Agrentina-Italy BIT becomes moot.\n\n(ii) The present dispute arises out of an investment pursuant to Article 1 BIT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention (see \u00a7 387 above). In particular:\n\n- According to one view, the \"double-barrelled\" test developed with regard to the concept of \"investment\" does not mean that the definition of investment provided by two States in a BIT has to fit into the definition deriving from the spirit of the ICSID Convention. Rather, arguably, it is the investment at stake that has to fit into both of these concepts, knowing that each of them focuses on another aspect of the investment;\n\n- In any event, the relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"investments\" pursuant to Article 1(1) lit. (c) BIT;\n\n- If needed to be applied, Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds constitute a contribution which qualifies as \"investment\" under Article 25 ICSID Convention;\n\n- The relevant bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered made \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of [Argentina]\" pursuant to Article 1(1) BIT;\n\n- The bonds and Claimants\u2019 security entitlements therein are both to be considered \"made in the territory of Argentina.\"\n\n(iii) With regard to the jurisdiction *rationae personae* and without making a determination with respect to any individual Claimant (see \u00a7 422 above), the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, its Additional Protocol and Article 25 ICSID Convention, over each Claimant:\n\n- **who is a natural person** and who is ultimately found:\n\n\u2022 to have had Italian nationality on 14 September 2006 and 7 February 2007;\n\n\u2022 not to also have had Argentinean nationality on either of such dates;\n\n\u2022 not to have been domiciled in the Argentine Republic for more than two years prior to making the investment;\n\n\u2022 to have been an investor as of the date of alleged breach by Argentina of its treaty obligations.\n\n- **who is a juridical person** and who is ultimately found to have had the Italian nationality on 14 September 2006, meaning that it:\n\n\u2022 was on such date constituted in compliance with the legislation of Italy;\n\n\u2022 had its *siege social* in the territory of Italy; and\n\n\u2022 was recognized by Italian law in the sense that it had the civil capacity to make an investment under the BIT and to litigate in its own name, without necessarily having full legal personality.\n\n(iv) The way in which Claimants consented to the ICSID arbitration through the relevant documents contained in the TFA Mandate Package is - as a matter of principle - valid (see \u00a7 466 above). In particular:\n\n- Based on the general circumstances leading to the execution of the documents embodying Claimants\u2019 consents, in particular the Declaration of Consent and the Power of Attorney, there is at this stage no indication that such execution would have been achieved based on fraud, coercion or essential mistake vitiating Claimants\u2019 consent;\n\n- Whether or not such fraud, coercion or mistake may exist with regard to individual Claimants based on the specific circumstances of the individual case remains open and will be addressed, to the extent necessary and appropriate, when dealing with issues concerning individual Claimants;\n\n- Questions regarding TFA\u2019s specific role and relevance, as well as issues relating to conflict of interests or breach of professional obligations by White & Case are issues relating to the admissibility of the proceedings, and not to the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent. They will be addressed, to the extent necessary and appropriate, when dealing with the issue of admissibility (see \u00a7 642 *et seq.* below).\n\n(v) Argentina validly consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration (see \u00a7 500 above). In particular:\n\n- The fact that the present dispute relates to foreign debt restructuring is *per se* irrelevant to the determination of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n- Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction includes claims presented by multiple Claimants to the extent that such claims are admissible under the ICSID framework;\n\n- The negotiation and litigation requirement provided in Articles 8(1) and (2) of the BIT does not condition Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration, and merely relates to the circumstances under which such consent it to be given full effect and implemented;\n\n- The presence of forum selection clauses in the contractual bond documents are irrelevant to the determination of Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n502.\n\n**Consequently,** with regard to the relevant issues set forth in the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008, the Tribunal finds as follows:\n\n(i) **Issue 1(a):** Argentina\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre includes claims presented by multiple Claimants in a single proceeding;\n\n(ii) **Issue 2(a):** The Declaration of Consent signed by the individual Claimants submitted in this proceeding is in principle valid, whereby the potential existence of a fraud, coercion or essential mistake invalidating the consent of a specific individual Claimant based on the specific circumstances of the individual case remains open and will be dealt with in a later stage of the proceedings;\n\n(iii) **Issue 5:** The MFN clause has no consequences on the ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence;\n\n(iv) **Issue 6:** Whether the Tribunal may also have jurisdiction based on the Umbrella Clause of the Argentina-Chile BIT in connection with the MFN Clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT is irrelevant to the extent that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction already derives from the treaty nature of the claims at stake;\n\n(v) **Issue 7:** Claimants\u2019 claims are to be considered Treaty Claims arising out of the BIT and therewith fall under the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal;\n\n(vi) **Issue 8:** The presence of forum selection clauses referring to national courts in the bond documents do not apply to Treaty Claims and do thereby not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over such Treaty Claims;\n\n(vii) **Issue 9:** The bonds in question, and in particular the security entitlements held by Claimants in these bonds, qualify as\u2019\u2019Investment\" under Article 1(1) BIT made \"in the territory of Argentina\" and \"in compliance with the laws and regulations of Argentina\";\n\n(viii) **Issue 10:** The Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* over each Claimant who is a natural person to the extent set forth above in \u00a7 (7) (iii);\n\n(ix) **Issue 11:** The Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae* over each Claimant who is a juridical person to the extent set forth above in \u00a7 (7) (iii).\n\n503.\n\nThe remaining Issues 1(b), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b), 4 and 5 are issues of admissibility and will be dealt with in the section below.\n\n**D. Admissibility of the Claim**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introductory Remarks**\n----------------------------\n\n504.\n\nIn section C above, the Tribunal has established that it has - as a matter of principle and without making a determination with respect to any individual Claimants -jurisdiction over the present dispute. However, in order for the Tribunal to hear the present case, it is further necessary that the claims raised by Claimants be admissible.\n\n505.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 245 *et seq.)* the difference between jurisdictional and admissibility issues is not always clear. Consequently, some of the issues addressed in this section may have been invoked by the Parties within the context of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. However, the Tribunal considers that these issues are not matters of jurisdiction but of admissibility. Where this applies, any argument raised by the Parties with regard to these issues and aiming to establish a lack of jurisdiction is addressed below as an argument of lack of admissibility.\n\n**(2) Mass Action - Issue 1(b)**\n--------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal considers that the \"mass\" aspect is not a hurdle to its jurisdiction, it must further examine whether this \"mass\" aspect is - as it is a point of dispute between the Parties - admissible under the current ICSID framework.\n\n507.\n\nThus, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- Is a \"mass action\" like the present one compatible with the current ICSID framework and spirit, also giving due regard to the existing framework for sovereign debt restructuring?\n\n- If so, what are the procedural adaptations that the Tribunal would need to implement in order to make such a \"mass action\" workable in an ICSID arbitration. In particular:\n\n(i) With regard to admissibility requirements, should the Tribunal refer to principles applicable to \"class actions\" and other aggregate litigations as known under certain legal regimes?\n\n(ii) With regard to modalities of the procedure, may the Tribunal limit procedural rights of one Party where such limitation is necessary to ensure the other Party\u2019s procedural rights?\n\n- Are such adaptations covered by the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide on procedural issues?\n\n508.\n\nThe key legal provisions in dealing with the above issues are the following: Article 44 ICSID Convention and Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n509.\n\nArticle 44 ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\n510.\n\nArticle 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules provides as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall make the orders required for the conduct of the proceeding.\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n511.\n\nRespondent contends that mass proceedings as the present one are not admissible under the current ICSID framework. To support its position, Respondent brings forward the following main arguments:178\n\n(i) The ICSID framework does not provide and does not allow mass claims. Article 44 ICSID Convention simply permits the Tribunal to decide procedural questions with respect to matters over which it already has jurisdiction. It does not provide a basis for the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over proceedings that are not authorized by the ICSID Convention and to which the parties did not consent in the relevant BIT;\n\n(ii) The present mass action cannot be compared to a multi-party arbitration, and resembles more a type of class action. Even if such mass claim was considered allowed under the current ICSID framework, the way this arbitration was initiated and conducted is not in compliance with generally recognized principles applicable to class actions and similar collective proceedings (e.g., regarding the role and position of the representative);\n\n(iii) Such mass claim proceedings are unmanageable because individualized facts and circumstances are relevant not only for the merits but also for the jurisdiction (e.g., whether the specific investment was made in accordance with applicable laws, whether the Claimants\u2019 signature are all authentic, etc.) and could not be duly ascertained.\n\nSee R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 138 *et seq.,* 154 *et seq.,* 264; R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 159 *et seq.,* 178 *et seq.,* 184 *et seq:,* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 22 *et seq.*\n\n512.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that the opening of ICSID arbitration with regard to sovereign debt restructuring would be counter-productive in so far as it would encourage hold outs.179 As such, it would go against current efforts to modernize foreign debt restructuring processes. Consequently, in order to preserve the efficiency of foreign debt restructuring mechanisms, the Tribunal should deem the present claims inadmissible.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 62.\n\n513.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants contend that the present mass proceedings are within the jurisdictional limits of ICSID, the question of its management being a question of mere procedure covered by Article 44 ICSID Convention and thereby within the power of the Tribunal. Claimants\u2019 main arguments are as follows:180\n\n(i) This proceeding is not different from any other multi-party arbitration, the only particularity being the unusually high number of Claimants. Multi-party proceedings are widely admitted under current ICSID arbitration practice, and since the ICSID framework contains no limitation on the number of possible parties, there is no reason to treat this claim differently from any other multiparty arbitration;\n\n(ii) Collective proceedings are further consistent with the purpose and object of the BIT, since the high number of Claimants is inherent to the nature of the investments protected by the BIT (see \u00a7 490 above);\n\n(iii) The present claims are proper and manageable: (a) Claimants are from a single jurisdiction, they have identical claims arising out of the same State measures under the same BIT and stand in an identical posture vis-a-vis Respondent; (b) the individual facts and issues detailed by Respondent (i.e., the individual circumstances of the purchase of the bonds) are not material to the Tribunal\u2019s core task of determining whether a specific set of actions taken by Argentina constituted a violation of the BIT; (c) Argentina\u2019s due process rights would not be infringed; and (d) the Tribunal is well-equipped to adopt procedures to handle the claims under Article 44 ICSID Convention. Consequently, it is only just and efficient to hear these cases jointly.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 313 *et seq.,* 333 *et seq.,* 350 *et seq.;* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 316 *et seq.,* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 125 *et seq.,* \u00a7\u00a7190 *et seq.*\n\n514.\n\nWith regard to the policy argument raised by Respondent, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2019s view is outdated and irrelevant. The major threat to the efficiency of foreign debt restructuring would be rogue debtors, such as Argentina. Consequently, opening the door to ICSID arbitration would create a supplementary leverage against such rogue debtors and therefore be beneficial to the efficiency of foreign debt restructuring.\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n515.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 489-492), the Tribunal finds that the issue of whether or not the present mass proceedings could be conducted in the form of collective proceedings is an issue of admissibility and not of consent.\n\n516.\n\nTo recall, Respondent contends that arbitration in the form of collective proceedings is not provided for by ICSID, that this silence is a \"qualified silence\" that should be interpreted to mean that collective arbitration is not possible and not admissible under the current ICSID framework, and in particular that the Tribunal cannot rely on Article 44 ICSID Convention or Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules to create its own solution to the problems raised by the high number of Claimants.\n\n517.\n\nIt is undisputed that the ICSID framework contains no reference to collective proceedings as a possible form of arbitration. The key question here is how to interpret this silence. In particular, the Tribunal is tasked with the assessment of whether this silence should be considered a \"qualified silence,\" meaning an intended silence indicating that it does not allow for something that is not provided, or whether it is to be considered a \"gap,\" which was unintended and which the Tribunal has the power to fill. In the latter case, the Tribunal shall further determine whether the adaptations which would be needed to fill this gap, i.e., to manage the present proceedings, fall within the scope of its powers as deriving from Article 44 ICSID Convention and/or Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n(i) Interpretation of the Silence of the ICSID Framework\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 489-492), the Tribunal finds that, in the light of the absence of a definition of investment in the ICSID Convention, where the BIT covers investments which are susceptible of involving a high number of investors, and where such investments require a collective relief in order to provide effective protection to such investment, it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT, and to the spirit of ICSID, to require in addition to the consent to ICSID arbitration in general, a supplementary express consent to the form of such arbitration.\n\n519.\n\nFor these same reasons and as further developed below, the Tribunal finds that it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and to the spirit of ICSID to interpret this silence as a \"qualified silence\" categorically prohibiting collective proceedings, just because it was not mentioned in the ICSID Convention:\n\n- First, at the time of conclusion of the ICSID Convention, collective proceedings were quasi inexistant, and although some discussions seem to have taken place with regard to multi-party arbitrations, these discussions were not conclusive on the intention to either accept or refuse multi-party arbitrations, and even less so with regard to the admissibility of collective proceedings;\n\n- ICSID sets forth a standard arbitration mechanism. Insofar as investments can be of a varying nature and scope, it is possible that the current ICSID procedure may not be fully adapted to resolve a dispute arising out of any kind of investment. Indeed, where an investment, protected under a BIT providing for ICSID arbitration, shows certain particular characteristics, these characteristics may influence the way of conducting the arbitration, and lead the Tribunal to make certain adaptations to the standard procedure in order to give effect to the choice of ICSID arbitration. The need for certain adaptations to the standard ICSID arbitration procedure merley derives from the impossibility to anticipate all kinds of possible investments and disputes, and is certainly not a sufficient motive to simply close the door of ICSID arbitration to investors who are not \"standard investors\" having made \"standard investments.\" However, it is understood that adaptations made to the standard procedure must be done in consideration of the general principle of due process and must seek a balance between procedural rights and interests of each party.\n\n520.\n\nThus, the silence of the ICSID framework regarding collective proceedings is to be interpreted as a \"gap\" and not as a \"qualified silence.\" Consequently, the Tribunal has, in principle, the power under Article 44 ICSID Convention to fill this gap. However, this does not mean that the scope of this power is unlimited. Rather, the Tribunal is bound by the limits set forth by Article 44 ICSID Convention.\n\n(ii) Powers of the Arbitral Tribunal under Article 44 ICSID Convention and Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n521.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7 509), Article 44 ICSID Convention provides that where the ICSID framework is silent on a procedural question, which is also not subject to the parties\u2019 agreement, the Tribunal shall decide the question. Within the context of arbitration proceedings, this rule is further complemented by Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules, according to which \"the Tribunal shall make the orders required for the proceeding.\" These provisions are the mere expression of the inherent power of any tribunal to resolve procedural questions in the event of lacunae.181\n\nSee e.g. Schreuer, *op. cit.* fn. 98, Ad Article 44 \u00a7 54.\n\n522.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the power of a tribunal is limited to the filling of gaps left by the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. In contrast, a modification of existing rules can only be effected subject to the parties\u2019 agreement, in accordance with minimum standards of fair procedure and to the extent that the rules to be modified are not mandatory (in the sense that they restate mandatory provisions of the Convention).182\n\nSee e.g. Schreuer, *op. cit.* fn. 98, Ad Article 44 \u00a7\u00a7 20 *et seq.*\n\n523.\n\nA tribunal\u2019s power is further limited to the filling of gaps left by the ICSID framework in the specific proceedings at hand, and a tribunal\u2019s role is not to complete or improve the ICSID framework in general. As such, a tribunal\u2019s power to fill gaps will usually be limited to the design of specific rules to deal with specific problems arising in the proceedings at hand.\n\n524.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal cannot:\n\n- modify the current arbitration rules without the Parties\u2019 consent. A revision of the ICSID Arbitration Rules can only be done by the Administrative Council, which is the body competent to adopt the Arbitration Rules under Article 6(1)(c) ICSID Convention; or\n\n- adopt a full set of rules of procedure unless the Parties have agreed that the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Administrative Council should not apply without substituting their own rules.\n\n525.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, can and ought to fill gaps left where the application of existing rules are not adapted to the specific dispute submitted to ICSID arbitration. In such a case, the filling of the gap does not consist of an amendment of the written rule itself, but rather of an adaptation of its application in a specific case.\n\n526.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 518-520), the Tribunal finds that the silence of the ICSID Convention concerning collective proceedings is to be seen as a \"gap.\" As such, the Tribunal has, in principle, the power to fill this gap. The key question at hand thus, is the following:\n\n**Can the Tribunal fill the gap created by the collective aspect of the claim on an** ***ad hoc*** **basis and through the design of specific rules, or would this require the creation and/or modification of general rules which are under the competence of the Administrative Council?**\n\n527.\n\nThis question cannot (and should not) be answered in the abstract. Not only would this imply creating general principles thereby relying on a terminology, which is as diverse and varied as the currently existing forms and modalities of collective proceedings, but it would also go beyond the powers of the Tribunal to fill a specific gap regarding the conduct of specific proceedings. What the Tribunal however can (and should) do is to analyse this question in a concrete manner, i.e., asking itself (i) what are the specific rules that would be necessary in order to be able to conduct the present proceedings under the ICSID framework, and (ii) can these specific rules, in the light of their nature and scope, be considered to fall within the power of the Tribunal as deriving from Article 44 ICSID Convention and Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n528.\n\nWhen answering these questions, the Tribunal shall, in accordance with the principles of interpretation of treaties, not only ask itself whether, from a technical perspective, it can make such adaptations, but also whether, based on the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, it should do so.\n\n(iii) Nature of the Necessary Adaptations to the ICSID Standard Procedure\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nNotwithstanding the high number of Claimants involved, the Tribunal must examine not only the elements necessary to determine its jurisdiction (i.e., the nationality of the Claimants, their status of investor and the existence of their investment, etc.), but also those necessary to establish Claimants\u2019 claims and relating to the merits of the case (i.e., the existence of a breach by Argentina of its obligations under the BIT, the effect of such breach on Claimants\u2019 investment, etc.). Thus, the high number of Claimants may not serve as an excuse not to examine such elements and adaptations to the procedure may therefore not affect the object of the Tribunal\u2019s examination.\n\n530.\n\nHowever, it appears that adaptations to hear the present case collectively would concern not that much the object of the examination, but rather (i) the way the Tribunal will conduct such examination, and/or (ii) the way Claimants are represented.\n\n531.\n\nWith regard to the examination, it is undeniable that the Tribunal will not be in a position to examine all elements and related documents in the same way as if there were only a handful of Claimants. In this respect, the Tribunal would need to implement mechanisms allowing a simplified verification of evidentiary material, while this simplification can concern either the depth of examination of a document (e.g. accepting a scanned copy of an ID document instead of an original), or the number of evidentiary documents to be examined, and if so their selection process (i.e. random selection of samples instead of a serial examination of each document) (see \u00a7\u00a7 668 *et seq.* below). However, such a simplification of the examination process is to be distinguished from the failure to proceed with such examination.\n\n532.\n\nWith regard to the mechanism of representation, it is true that TFA has been provided with powers which may go beyond the power granted to a normal agent under Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules (see \u00a7\u00a7 455 *et seq.* above). Admitting the present collective proceedings would thus also mean accepting TFA\u2019s role as due representative of Claimants.\n\n533.\n\n**In conclusion,** the procedure necessary to deal with the collective aspect of the present proceedings concerns the method of the Tribunal\u2019s examination, as well as the manner of representation of Claimants. However, it does not affect the object of such examination. Further, the Tribunal remains obliged to examine all relevant aspects of the claims relating to Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT as well as to Respondent\u2019s obligations thereunder subject to the Parties\u2019 submissions. Thus, it is the manner in which the Tribunal will conduct such examination which may diverge from usual ICSID proceedings.\n\n(iv) Admissibility of the Necessary Adaptations\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nConsidering the above (\u00a7\u00a7 529-533), the adaptations required to deal with the collective aspect of the claims are issues which relate strictly to the manner of conducting the present proceedings, and in particular, how to collect and weigh evidence. In other words, the nature of these measures and their scope do not exceed the powers of the Tribunal as deriving from Article 44 ICSID Convention and Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n535.\n\nThe Tribunal is entitled to proceed with such adaptations under the relevant provisions of the ICSID framework. As mentioned above (see \u00a7 528), the Tribunal is, however, of the opinion that it should not only examine whether it can do so but also whether it should do so based on the aim and purpose of the ICSID Convention and in particular, with regard to the equilibrium established by the Convention with regard to the Parties\u2019 respective rights.\n\n536.\n\nFor this purpose, the Tribunal will firstly examine the implications of the intended adaptations. These implications are twofold: (i) It will not be possible to treat each Claimant as if he/she was alone and certain issues, such as the existence of an expropriation, will have to be examined collectively, i.e., as a group; and (ii) the implications will likely limit certain of Claimants\u2019 and Argentina\u2019s procedural rights to the extent that Claimants have to waive individual interests in favor of common interests of the entire group of Claimants, while Argentina will not be able to bring arguments in full length and detail concerning the individual situation of each of the Claimants.\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it appropriate to compare the consequences of these implications to the consequences of rejecting the claims for lack of admissibility and requesting each Claimant to file an individual ICSID claim. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that not only would it be cost prohibitive for many Claimants to file individual claims but it would also be practically impossible for ICSID to deal separately with 60,000 individual arbitrations. Thus, the rejection of the admissibility of the present claims may equal a denial of justice. This would be shocking given that the investment at stake is protected under the BIT, which expressly provides for ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration.\n\n538.\n\nThus, the question arises whether in the light of the present circumstances it would be justified to set strict boundaries to certain of the Parties\u2019 procedural rights, while adapting a method of examination so as to give actual effective protection to the investment. The challenge lies in finding the right balance.\n\n539.\n\nIn the search for the right balance, the Tribunal considers the following issues to be relevant: (i) under what conditions is it acceptable to change the method of examination from individual to group treatment; (ii) to what extent are Argentina\u2019s defense rights affected in comparison to 60,000 separate proceedings; and (iii) is it admissible to deprive Claimants of certain procedural rights, such as provided for under the TFA Mandate Package?\n\n540.\n\n*(i) Pre-conditions for group treatment:* The Tribunal is of the opinion that group examination of claims is acceptable where claims raised by a multitude of claimants are to be considered identical or at least sufficiently homogeneous. The question is thus whether Claimants\u2019 claims are to be considered identical or sufficiently homogeneous.\n\n541.\n\nIn this respect, it is important to recall that the present proceedings concern only potential treaty claims and do not deal with any contractual claims Claimants may have against Argentina and/or the banks (see \u00a7\u00a7 316-332 above). Thus, the identity or homogeneity requirement applies to the investment and the rights and obligations deriving therefrom based on the BIT and not to any potential contractual claims. In other words, in the present case, it is irrelevant whether Claimants have or do not have homogeneous contractual rights to repayment by Argentina of the amount paid for the purchase of the security entitlements. The only relevant question is whether Claimants have homogeneous rights of compensation for a homogeneous damage caused to them by potential homogeneous breaches by Argentina of homogeneous obligations provided for in the BIT.\n\n542.\n\nTherefore, the specific circumstances surrounding individual purchases by Claimants of security entitlements are irrelevant. If Italian or other banks have breached any obligations they had towards Claimants or Argentina, such a breach is to be addressed in a recourse action against the relevant banks (see \u00a7\u00a7 327-330 above) and is foreign and external to the present arbitration which concerns solely Argentina\u2019s behavior with regard to Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n543.\n\nWith regard to the nature of the claims deriving from the BIT, it appears to be homogeneous:\n\n- The rights deriving from Claimants\u2019 investment and Argentina\u2019s obligations to protect these rights are the same with regard to all Claimants to the extent that they derive from the same BIT and the same provisions. Indeed, first, the provisions of the BIT invoked by Claimants are identical for all Claimants; second, the rights allegedly affected all derive from Claimants\u2019 purchase in Italy of security entitlements in Argentinean bonds; third, all these security entitlements were subject to the Exchange Offer 2005 (see \u00a7 312 above);\n\n- The events leading to the alleged disregard of such rights and obligations, i.e. to the breach by Argentina of the relevant provisions, are the same towards all Claimants. They all relate to the acts of Argentina preceding and following its public default in December 2001, and in particular the way it consulted with its creditors, the way it reached a decision on how to deal with its foreign debt, as well as the way it implemented such decision, namely through its Exchange Offer 2005 and the legislation and regulations relating thereto. In doing so Argentina treated all Claimants in the same manner and did not differentiate between different kinds of Claimants (see \u00a7 313 above).\n\n- The legislation and regulations promulgated and implemented by Argentina, together with the implementation of its Exchange Offer 2005, affected all Claimants in the same way. Thus, the potential damage caused to Claimants is, by nature the same for all Claimants although the scope of such damage will of course depend on the scope of their individual investment.\n\n544.\n\nConsequently, Claimants\u2019 claims are to be considered sufficiently homogeneous to justify a simplification of the examination method and procedure.\n\n545.\n\n*(ii) Effects on Argentina\u2019s defense rights:* It appears that the effect of such examination method and procedure on Argentina\u2019s defense rights is limited and relative. Whilst it is true that Argentina may not be able to enter into full length and detail into the individual circumstances of each Claimant, it is not certain that such approach is at all necessary to protect Argentina\u2019s procedural rights in the light of the homogeneity of Claimants\u2019 claims. In addition, the only alternative would be to conduct 60,000 separate proceedings. The measures that Argentina would need to take to face 60,000 proceedings would be a much bigger challenge to Argentina\u2019s effective defense rights than a mere limitation of its right to individual treatment of homogeneous claims in the present proceedings.\n\n546.\n\n*(iii) Deprivation of Claimants\u2019 procedural rights:* It is undeniable that the TFA Mandate Package has the effect to depriving Claimants of a substantial part of their procedural rights, such as the decision on how to conduct the proceedings, the right to instruct the lawyers, etc. However, as mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 457-465), the setting of strict boundaries in relation to Claimants\u2019 procedural rights has been consciously accepted by Claimants in order to benefit from the collective treatment of their claims before an ICSID tribunal. In addition, the Tribunal did not find that such agreement was affected by any vice which would render it invalid. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason to disregard - as a matter of principle -Claimants\u2019 conscious choice.\n\n547.\n\n**In conclusion,** under the present circumstances, the procedure necessary to deal with Claimants\u2019 claims in a collective way is admissible and acceptable under Article 44 ICSID Convention, Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules, as well as under the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(v) Policy Considerations\n-------------------------\n\n548.\n\nTo recall (see \u00a7 476 above), the Tribunal found that Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the appropriateness of ICSID proceedings in the context of sovereign debt restructuring are not an impediment to the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n549.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal finds that those policy arguments are also not an impediment to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, such policy arguments are inapposite. As mentioned above (\u00a7 478), the real question is whether the investment at stake is protected under a BIT providing for ICSID arbitration in case of breach of such protection. If this is the case, then ICSID has jurisdiction, and it would be wrong to hinder the effective exercise of such jurisdiction through the rejection of the admissibility of the claims based merely on policy considerations. This is all the more the case here as the present policy considerations are controversial and based on Respondent\u2019s assumption that the biggest threat to the stability and fairness of sovereign debt restructuring are holdout creditors.\n\n550.\n\nPolicy reasons are for States to take into account when negotiating BITs and consenting to ICSID jurisdiction in general, not for the Tribunal to take into account in order to repair an inappropriately negotiated or drafted BIT. The present BIT is clear, it includes bonds and security entitlements (see \u00a7\u00a7 352-361 above). Whether or not ICSID is the best way to deal with a dispute relating to these bonds and security entitlements in the context of foreign debt restructuring is irrelevant. The Parties chose ICSID arbitration for this kind of dispute. They, as well as the Tribunal, are bound by such choice and cannot evade it based on controversial policy reasons.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n551.\n\nIn conclusion and in (partial) response to Issue No. 1(b), the Tribunal holds that the mass aspect of Claimants\u2019 claims does not constitute an impediment to their admissibility. In particular:\n\n(i) The silence of the ICSID framework regarding collective proceedings is to be interpreted as a \"gap\" and not as a \"qualified silence;\"\n\n(ii) The Tribunal has, in principle, the power under Article 44 ICSID Convention to fill this gap to the extent permitted under Article 44 ICSID Convention and Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules;\n\n(iii) The procedure necessary to deal with the collective aspect of the present proceedings concern the method of the Tribunal\u2019s examination, as well as the manner of representation of Claimants. However, it does not affect the object of such examination. Thus, the Tribunal remains obliged to examine all relevant aspects of the claims relating to Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT as well as to Respondent\u2019s obligations thereunder subject to the Parties\u2019 submissions;\n\n(iv) Such procedure is admissible and acceptable under Article 44 ICSID Convention, Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules, as well as under the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention;\n\n(v) Respondent\u2019s policy arguments regarding the appropriateness of ICSID proceedings in the context of sovereign debt restructuring are irrelevant for the determination of the admissibility of the claims.\n\n**(3) Consultation Requirement - Issue 4**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provision*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nArticle 8(1) BIT provides that the investor and the Host State shall in case of a dispute try first to settle their dispute through the means of amicable consultation. The Parties hold diverging views as to the nature of this consultation requirement and the consequence of a non-compliance therewith on the admissibility of the present claims.\n\n553.\n\nThus, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal here are the following:\n\n- Is the requirement of preliminary amicable consultation a mandatory requirement, which constitute a hurdle to the admissibility of a claim introduced without fulfilling such requirement? (connected with Issue 4 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n- If so, can the consultation requirement be considered to have been met in the present case?\n\n- If not, should Claimants be considered to have been released from such consultation requirement based on the futility rule?\n\n554.\n\nThe key legal provision concerning the above issues is Article 8(1) BIT, which in its unofficial English version provides as follows (see \u00a7 267 *et seq.* above):\n\n\"1. Any dispute in relation to the investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in relation to the issues governed by this Agreement shall be settled, if possible, by means of amicable consultation between the parties to the dispute.\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n555.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Article 8 BIT articulates a multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system setting forth mandatory requirements which Claimants have not complied with and therefore, constitute a jurisdictional bar.\n\n556.\n\nIn particular, Respondent submits that Article 8 provides for a mandatory three-step dispute resolution as further supported by the wording and spirit of Article 8(3) and 8(4) BIT.183\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 382 *et seq:,* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 652 *et seq:,* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 267 *et seq.*\n\n557.\n\nWith regard to the consultation requirement, Respondent contends that Claimants have not complied therewith because (i) it is unclear how far TFA actually represented Claimants at the time of the talks between TFA and Respondent, (ii) TFA\u2019s attitude was one of bad faith, and (iii) the talks with TFA concerned Argentina\u2019s default and not any alleged treaty violation.\n\n558.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants contend that Article 8 BIT may not constitute a bar to the present arbitration based mainly on the following arguments:184\n\n(i) Based on the permissive language used, Article 8 BIT aims to provide the parties with different options of dispute resolution and does not institute a compulsory multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system;\n\n(ii) Even if the Tribunal considered that Article 8 instituted a mandatory multilayered sequential dispute resolution system, Claimants have complied with the various requirements. With regard to the requirement of amicable consultation, Claimants have complied with this requirement through TFA and it is Argentina which refused to negotiate with TFA. In order to conduct adequate consultation talks in the sense of Article 8(1) BIT it is not necessary to identify the specific legal basis of the dispute during the consultations, but it is sufficient that the talks relate to the facts at the basis of the dispute;\n\n(iii) Any further attempt at consultation would have been futile in the light of the Emergency Law, which prohibits the Argentinean Government from entering into a settlement agreement.\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 544 *et seq:,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 543 *et seq:,* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 323 *et seq.*\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) Existence of Consultations\n------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nAccording to the Parties, after the announcement of Argentina\u2019s default, talks took place between TFA and the Argentinean Government and continued until 2005.185 TFA conducted these talks in the name of Italian bondholders, who signed the TFA Negotiating Mandate with the aim to \"represent the interests of the subscribers of Argentinean bonds in the frame of the restructuring of the debt, which will be subject to the consultation with the Argentinean Authorities or with other Argentinean issuers.\"186\n\nSee above \u00a7 84.\n\nSee above \u00a7 66.\n\n560.\n\nThus, based on the wording of the TFA Negotiating Mandate, the object of the consultations to be conducted by TFA were not limited to contractual claims and encompassed all \"interests\" of the Italian bondholders in relation to the restructuring of Argentina\u2019s debt. It further arises from the correspondence between TFA and the Argentinean authorities that TFA\u2019s complaints towards Argentina did not only focus on the mere non-payment of its debt by Argentina but also on the way Argentina was handling these issues through its restructuring plan and its attitude towards creditors. As such, TFA\u2019s talks with Argentina also encompassed the main facts on which Claimants based their present claims. For consultation talks to be conducted in accordance with Article 8(1) BIT, it is not necessary to identify or name specific legal issues. Rather, it is sufficient that the context of the dispute be the same as the context of the dispute brought forward under Article 8 BIT. Consequently, the talks conducted by TFA with the Argentine authorities can be considered talks aiming at a settlement of the present claims.\n\n(ii) TFA\u2019s Role in the Consultations\n------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nThe remaining question is whether TFA can be considered to have been representing Claimants during these talks. Indeed, it is not entirely clear how many of the Italian bondholders who signed the TFA Negotiating Mandate are also Claimants to the present arbitration. However, this question can remain open for the following reason: Whilst Argentina contends that it is unclear how far TFA actually represented Claimants at the time of the talks, Respondent did not contend having otherwise tried to contact Claimants to conduct separate talks.187 Thus, although it may be unclear how many of the Claimants signed the TFA Negotiating Mandate, it is undeniable that TFA did represent to a certain extent the interests of some of the Italian bondholders and that Argentina could not have been unaware that a considerable number of Italian bondholders had not accepted its Exchange Offer and that a dispute had arisen in this respect. Thus, Argentina cannot allege that Claimants failed to fulfil the consultation requirement of Article 8(1) based on the denial of TFA\u2019s authorities without trying to engage in talks with such Italian bondholders or at least setting up conditions under which Argentina would recognize TFA\u2019s authority.\n\nRespondent actually contends that \"Argentina has no way of even knowing who such owners [of security entitlements] are,\" see Annex A to RSP PHB \u00a7 6.\n\n562.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Argentina is precluded from invoking a failure on Claimants\u2019 side to fulfil the consultation requirement under Article 8(1) BIT.\n\n(iii) Consultations Requirement as Expression of Good Will\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nIn addition, even if it considered the present circumstances not sufficient to comply with the consultation requirement of Article 8(1) BIT, this would still not constitute a hurdle to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims for the following reason:\n\n564.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT is not to be considered of a mandatory nature but as the expression of the good will of the Parties to try firstly to settle any dispute in an amicable way:\n\n- This derives first from the wording of Article 8(1) BIT which provides that consultations should be conducted *\"en la medida del possible\"* or *\"per quanto possibile,\"* i.e., \"to the extent possible.\" Indeed, Article 8(1) BIT is not drafted in any way as to impose the consultation requirements upon the Parties under any circumstances. It is only refers to the possibility of such amicable settlement talks, whereby such term is to be reasonably understood as referring not only to the technical possibility of settlement talks, but also to the possibility, i.e. the likelyhood, of a positive result.\n\n- It also derives from the general purpose and aim of such provision, which is to allow amicable settlement where such settlement is wanted and supported by both Parties. Where one or both Parties did not have the good will to resort to consultation as an amicable means of settlement, it would be futile to force the Parties to enter into a consultation exercise which is deemed to fail from the outset. Willingness to settle is the *sine qua non* condition for the success of any amicable settlement talk.\n\n565.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal considers that a potential non-compliance with the consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT would simply express that the premises for an amicable settlement were not given because one or both of the Parties were not willing to give the dispute an amicable end. As such, it could not be considered to constitute *per se* a hurdle to the admissibility of the claim, thereby preventing any other dispute resolution means provided in Article 8 BIT to come to play.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n566.\n\nIn conclusion and in (partial) response to Issue No. 4, the Tribunal holds that the prior consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT does not constitute an impediment to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims. In particular:\n\n(i) Consultations did take place between TFA, as representative of Italian bondholders, and Argentina;\n\n(ii) Argentina is precluded from invoking the non-fulfilment by Claimants of the consultation requirement; and\n\n(iii) Even if Claimants were considered not to have fulfilled this requirement, this non-compliance would simply express that the premises for an amicable settlement were not given and cannot be interpreted as constituting a hurdle to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n**(4) 18 Months Litigation Requirement - Issues 4 & 5**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nTo recall, Article 8(2) BIT provides for a requirement to resort to local courts for a duration of 18 months in case the previously-conducted consultations have failed. The Parties hold diverging views as to the nature of this litigation requirement and the consequence of a non-compliance therewith on the admissibility of the present claims.\n\n568.\n\nOn the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal in this regard are the following:\n\n- Is the 18 months litigation requirement a mandatory prior prerequisite for the conduct of arbitration proceedings, the non-fulfillment of which constitutes a hurdle to the admissibility of a claim? (see Issue 4 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008)\n\n- If so, can Claimants be considered to have been released from the 18 months litigation requirement, either\n\n\u2022 based on the futility rule or\n\n\u2022 based on the MFN clause of Article 3(1) BIT in connection with the \"more favorable\" arbitration clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT? (see Issues 4 and 5 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008).\n\n569.\n\nThe key legal provisions and other documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Articles 3(1) and 8(2)-(4) BIT and Article 10 Argentina-Chile BIT.\n\n570.\n\nThe wording and content of Articles 3(1) and 8(1) to (4) BIT is reproduced above at \u00a7\u00a7 305 and \u00a7\u00a7 267 *et seq.*\n\n571.\n\nArticle 10 Argentina-Chile BIT provides as follows in its Spanish authentic version:\n\n\"(1) Toda controversia relativa a las inversiones en el sentido del presente Tratado, entre una Parte Contratante y un national o sociedad de la otra Parte Contratante sera, en la medida de lo posible, solucionada por consultas amistosas entre las dos partes en la controversia.\n\n(2) Si la controversia no hubiera podido ser solucionada en el termino de seis meses a partir del momento en que hubiera sido planteada por una u otra de las partes, sera sometida, a pedido del nacional o sociedad.\n\no bien a jurisdicciones nacionales de la Parte Contratante implicada en la controversia;\n\no bien al arbitraje internacional en las condiciones descriptas en el parrafo 3.\n\nUna vez que un nacional o sociedad haya sometido la controversia a las jurisdicciones de la Parte Contratante implicada o al arbitraje internacional, la eleccion de uno u otro de esos procedimientos sera definitiva.\n\n(3) En caso de recurso al arbitraje internacional la controversia podra ser llevada ante uno de los organos de arbitraje designados a continuacion a eleccion del nacional o sociedad;\n\nAl Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a inversiones (CIADI), creado por el \"Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a las Inversiones sobre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados\", abierto a la firma en Washington el 18 de marzo de 1965, cuando cada Estado parte en el presente Convenio haya adherido a aquel. Mientras esta condicion no se cumpla, cada Parte Contratante da su consentimiento para que la controversia sea sometida al arbitraje conforme con el Reglamento del Mecanismo Complementario del CIADI;\n\nA un tribunal de arbitraje ad hoc establecido de acuerdo con las reglas de arbitraje de la Comision de las Naciones Unidas para el Derecho Mercantil Internacional (CNUDMI).\"\n\n*(b) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n572.\n\nAs mentioned above (see \u00a7\u00a7 555 *et seq),* Respondent contends that Article 8 BIT articulates a multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system setting forth a three-step mandatory process which Claimants have not complied with and therefore, constitutes a jurisdictional bar. Accordingly to Respondent, this is in particular true with regard to the 18 months litigation requirement, which Claimants have not fulfilled.188\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 661 *et seq.,* 694 *et seq.*\n\n573.\n\nRespondent further contends that the arguments invoked by Claimants in order to circumvent the 18 months litigation requirement are not convincing:189\n\n(i) The mere argument that resort to domestic courts would involve time or money may not render such litigation \"futile.\"\n\n(ii) The Emergency Law does not prevent Claimants from submitting a dispute before the Argentinean courts under the BIT.\n\n(iii) Claimants may not invoke the MFN clause to circumvent the mandatory consultation requirement for the following reasons: (a) the MFN clause applies only to investments, not to dispute resolution mechanisms; (b) the MFN clause concerns only treatment \"in the territory\" of Argentina whereas arbitration is to be conducted abroad; (c) it cannot be stated that the resort to Argentinean courts is necessarily a \"less favorable\" treatment; and (d) even if the MFN clause operates to incorporate the dispute resolution clause under the Argentina-Chile BIT, Claimants have still failed to conduct adequate consultations so that the necessary requirements for arbitration under the Argentina-Chile BIT are not met either.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 387 *et seq.;* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 661 *et seq.,* 694 *et seq.;* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 267 *et seq.*\n\n574.\n\nIn contrast and as mentioned above (see \u00a7 558 above), Claimants contend that Article 8 BIT aims to provide the Parties with different options of dispute resolution and does not institute a compulsory multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system. In other words, the 18 months litigation requirement is not a mandatory prior prerequisite for the initiation of arbitration proceedings and its non-compliance is therefore irrelevant.190\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 544 *et seq.;* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 543 *et seq.;* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 323 *et seq.*\n\n575.\n\nEven if considered a mandatory preliminary requirement, Claimants submit that they should be relieved from having to comply with such requirement for the following two main reasons: (i) because conducting litigation before the Argentine courts would have been futile and would have defeated the very object and purpose of the BIT, and (ii) even if not considered futile, Claimants would be exempted from any potential obligation to go before local courts based on the broad wording of the MFN clause of Article 3(1) BIT, which entitles Claimants to invoke the more favorable dispute resolution clause contained in the Argentina-Chile BIT and which does not require prior court litigation.191\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 557 *et seq.,* \u00a7\u00a7 594 *et seq.;* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 556 *et seq.,* \u00a7\u00a7 643 *et seq.;* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 330 *et seq.,* \u00a7\u00a7 347 *et seq.*\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n576.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimants did not submit their dispute to the Argentine courts before initiating the present arbitration. Thus, the first question is whether Claimants should have done so.\n\n(i) The System Put in Place by Article 8 BIT\n--------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nArticle 8 BIT provides for three different types of dispute resolution means: amicable consultations (Article 8(1)), proceedings before the ordinary or administrative courts of the concerned State (Article 8(2)), and international arbitration (Article 8(3)). As to the relationship between these three mechanisms, the Tribunal finds that both the structure of Article 8 BIT as well as its wording indicate a certain order among these three means:\n\n- Article 8(1) establishes the core principle of amicable consultations as the first and foremost means of dispute settlement;\n\n- Article 8(2) then introduces the second means, i.e., the submission of the dispute to the ordinary or administrative courts, applicable under the following circumstance: \"if the dispute has not been settled in such consultations.\" Thereby, the recourse to courts is linked to some extent to the absence or failure of amicable consultations;\n\n- Article 8(3) then introduces the method of international arbitration whereby it is introduced within a specific context: \"[i]f, after 18 months from the notification of commencement of an action before the national courts indicated above in paragraph 2, the dispute between the Contracting Party and the investors still continues to exist [...]\";\n\n- Article 8(4) then provides that in case of commencement of arbitration proceedings, each disputing party shall take any appropriate measures to desist from the judicial action in course.\n\n578.\n\nThus, the order, structure and wording of Article 8 clearly indicate that these three dispute resolution means were, to some extent, interconnected, with the underlying idea that it is the failure of one of them that would trigger the next one. In other words, Article 8 did not provide for a mere \"pick and choose\" solution, leaving the disputing parties free to pick any of the means at any time. Article 8 provided for an integrated system, built upon a certain hierarchy or order of the three interconnected means of dispute resolution.\n\n(ii) General Consequences of a Disregard of the System\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nAt the same time, the wording of Article 8 BIT itself does not suffice to draw specific conclusions with regard to the consequence of non-compliance with the order established by Article 8. In this respect, regard should be given to the context, as well as to the purpose and aim of Article 8. The system put in place by Article 8 is a system aimed at providing the disputing parties with a fair and efficient dispute settlement mechanism. As such, the idea of fairness and efficiency must be taken into account when interpreting and determining how the system is supposed to work and what happens if one part of the system fails or is otherwise disregarded by one party.\n\n580.\n\nThus, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement is in itself not yet sufficient to preclude Claimants from resorting to arbitration. The real question is whether this disregard, based on its circumstances, can be considered compatible with the object and purpose of the system put in place by Article 8, or whether it goes against it.\n\n581.\n\nAnswering this question requires to examine more in detail the object and purpose as well as the meaning of the 18 months litigation requirement and the interests at stake. According to Respondent, the 18 months litigation requirement was put in place to give the Host State the opportunity to address the allegedly wrongful act within the framework of its own domestic legal system and to provide a chance to resolve the dispute in a potentially shorter period than international arbitration.192 In this respect, it would be irrelevant whether the 18 months time frame is a realistic time frame for the reaching of a final decision, the purpose of this paragraph being merely to provide the Host State with an opportunity to address the issue before resorting to international arbitration. Thus, the relevant question is not \"could the dispute have been efficiently settled before the Argentine courts?\", but \"was Argentina deprived of a fair opportunity to address the dispute within the framework of its own domestic legal system because of Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement?\"\n\nR-PHB \u00a7 290.\n\n582.\n\nThis question in turn requires a weighting of the interests of the Parties, i.e., of Argentina in being given the opportunity to address the dispute through the framework of its domestic legal system, and of Claimants in being provided with an efficient dispute resolution mechanism. Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that the disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement can only be considered incompatible with the system of Article 8 where it unduly deprived the Host State of a fair opportunity to address the issue through its domestic legal system. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that this opportunity must not only be a theoretical opportunity, but there must be a real chance in practice that the Host State, through its courts, would address the issue in a way that could lead to an effective resolution of the dispute.\n\n583.\n\nWhere, based on the overall circumstances of the case, it appears that such opportunity was only theoretical and/or could not have led to an effective resolution of the dispute within the 18 months time frame, it would be unfair to deprive the investor of its right to resort to arbitration based on the mere disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement. The reason is that such disregard would not have caused any real harm to the Host State, whilst in contrast, the deprivation of the investor\u2019s right to resort to arbitration would, in effect, deprive him of an important and efficient dispute settlement mean.\n\n584.\n\nThis conclusion derives more from a weighting of the specific interests at stake rather than from the application of the general principle of futility: It is not about whether the 18 months litigation requirement may be considered futile; it is about determining whether Argentina\u2019s interest in being able to address the specific claims through its domestic legal system would justify depriving Claimants of their interests of being able to submit it to arbitration.\n\n(iii) Consequences of Claimants\u2019 Disregard of the 18 Months Litigation Requirement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nBy not resorting to the Argentine courts, Claimants disregarded the 18 months litigation requirement. It is further established that Claimants had the possibility to bring claims before the Argentine courts. However, looking at the nature of the claims that were available to Claimants, the Tribunal finds that none of them would have been suited to address the present claims in such a way as to effectively resolve the dispute:\n\n- *Claims for compensation:* Claims for compensation for the damage caused to Claimants by Argentina\u2019s actions surrounding its default were deemed to fail in view of the Emergency Law and other relating decrees and budget laws,193 which prohibited the Argentine government from entering into any juridical, extra-juridical or private transaction. Thus, even in the case that Claimants would have won the case before the courts, the government would still have been under the impossibility to pay out the compensation.194\n\n- *Claims for unconstitutionality of the Emergency Law* : Claimants could have initiated proceedings aiming at declaring the Emergency Law unconstitutional for breach of the BIT. However, claims for compensation could only be filed once the Emergency Law would have been considered unconstitutional, which is highly unlikely to have been possible within the 18 months time frame.\n\nSee also Law 25,561 of January 2002 and Resolution 73/2002, by which Argentina deferred the repayment of its sovereign debt, and the subsequent decrees and budget laws maintaining such deferral, see Bianchi I, \u00a7 42 and Bianchi II, \u00a7\u00a7 59 *et seq.*\n\nSee Bianchi I, \u00a7\u00a742 *et seq.* and Bianchi II, \u00a7\u00a7 59 *et seq.*\n\n586.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds that in the light of the uproar created by Argentina\u2019s Emergency Law, the Argentinean Government could have arranged for an examination of the constitutionality of the Emergency Law. Such examination could have brought clarity on the effectiveness of claims before the Argentinean courts against the Argentinean Government. However, Argentina did apparently not see the need to proceed with such examination.\n\n587.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that Argentina\u2019s legal system does generally not provide for mass claims mechanisms,195 and that Claimants would therefore have needed to initiate separate claims.196 This would have been incredibly burdensome for them and for the courts, and would very likely have caused substantial delay in the handling of the cases by the courts.\n\nSee Nagareda, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 15-16; Mata, \u00a7\u00a7 52 *et seq.,* R-R-MJ \u00a7 152.\n\nSee MATA, \u00a7\u00a7 35 *et seq.,* 49 *et seq.*\n\n588.\n\nIn the light of the Emergency Law and other relevant laws and decrees, which prohibited any kind of payment of compensation to Claimants, the Tribunal finds that Argentina was not in a position to adequately address the present dispute within the framework of its domestic legal system. As such, Argentina\u2019s interest in pursuing this local remedy does not justify depriving Claimants of their right to resort to arbitration for the sole reason that they decided not to previously submit their dispute to the Argentinean courts.\n\n589.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary anymore to examine Issue No. 5, i.e., whether the MFN clause contained in Article 3(1) BIT may have entitled Claimants to rely on the allegedly more favorable dispute resolution clause contained in Article 10(1) Argentina-Chile BIT.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n590.\n\nIn conclusion and in (partial) response to Issues Nos. 4 and 5, the Tribunal holds that the disregard by Claimants of the 18 months litigation requirement does not preclude them from resorting to ICSID arbitration. In particular, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n(i) Article 8 provides for an integrated dispute resolution mechanism built upon a certain hierarchy or order of three interconnected means whereby the wording of Article 8 itself does not suffice to draw specific conclusions with regard to the consequences of non-compliance with the order established by Article 8.\n\n(ii) The question whether Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement justifies precluding them from resorting to arbitration requires a weighting of interests between Argentina\u2019s interest to be given the opportunity to address the dispute through the framework of its domestic legal system and Claimants\u2019 interest in being provided with an efficient dispute resolution means.\n\n(iii) Based on the circumstances of the present case and in particular the Emergency Law and other relevant laws and decrees, Argentina\u2019s interest in pursuing the 18 months litigation requirement does not justify depriving Claimants of their right to resort to arbitration for the sole reason that they decided not to previously submit their dispute to the Argentinean courts.\n\n591.\n\nIn view of the above conclusions, the question whether Claimants could have relied on the MFN clause of Article 3(1) BIT in connection to Article 10(1) Argentina-Chile BIT in order to evade the 18 months litigation requirement (Issue No. 5 of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008) is moot.\n\n**(5) Withdrawal and Addition of Claimants - Issues 3(a) and 3(bl**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Relevant Facts*\n--------------------\n\n592.\n\nThe following facts may be recalled in connection with the issues relating to the withdrawal and addition of Claimants:\n\n- Claimants, as presented by Claimants, are those described in the Annexes A, B and C to the Request for Arbitration, the total number of whom at the time of initiation of the arbitration exceeded 180,000.197 Annexes A and B to the Request for Arbitration contain a list of natural persons; Annex C to the Request for Arbitration contains a list of juridical entities.198 (see \u00a7 1 above)\n\n- On 19 and 22 December 2006, Claimants submitted supplemental Annexes in relation to information contained in Annexes A through E, and submitted Annexes K and L. The substitute annexes reflect: (i) an addition of certain Claimants (separately listed in Annex K), (ii) the withdrawal of certain Claimants (separately listed in Annex L), (iii) limited corrections and substitutions to the information on Claimants (Annexes A-E), (iv) the revision of the aggregate amounts (Annex I), and (v) the addition of one new bond series (Annex J), (see \u00a7 103 above)\n\n- On 5 February 2007, Claimants submitted \"substituted versions\" of Annexes A through E, K, L, I and J. The substitute annexes reflect: (i) the withdrawal of certain Claimants (listed separately in Annex L), (ii) certain corrections and substitutions to the documentation for other Claimants, and (iii) the revision of certain aggregate amounts based on the foregoing adjustments (Annexes I and J), (see \u00a7 107 above)\n\n- On 7 February 2007, the Secretary-General of the ICSID registered Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration with accompanying Annexes A through L, and issued the Notice of Registration, (see \u00a7 108 above)\n\n- On 7 November 2008, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by substitute versions of Annexes A through E, K and L. (see \u00a7 135 above)\n\n- On 5 October 2010, Claimants filed a letter submitting that certain Claimants, who tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010, would no longer participate in the present arbitration, thereby reducing the number of remaining Claimants to approximately 60,000. Claimants attached to their letter updated versions of Annexes A, B, C and L to the Request for Arbitration, the latter containing a list of all Claimants who have withdrawn from the arbitration since 14 September 2006. (see \u00a7 216 above)\n\n- On 26 November 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9 in which it rejected Respondent\u2019s request for further specific information on the identity of the Claimants having tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010 and announced that the question of the allocation of the arbitration costs concerning the Claimants who withdrew would be dealt with in the Tribunal\u2019s upcoming determination on jurisdiction together with the question of the withdrawal of a number of Claimants, (see \u00a7 220 above)\n\nSee C-MJ \u00a7 164, stating that the total number of Claimants at the time of filing the C-MJ is 180,285. See also Navigant I \u00a7 27 and Cremieux \u00a7 22.\n\nAnnex D to the Request for Arbitration contains a power of attorney and delegation of authority for each Claimant being a natural person to White & Case LLP *(see* page 1 above). Annex E to the Request for Arbitration contains a power of attorney and delegation of authority for each Claimant being a juridical person to White & Case LLP.\n\n*(b) Issues and Relevant Legal Provisions*\n------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nAs summarized in the preceding section, between the filing of the Request for Arbitration and its registration, as well as thereafter, the number of Claimants has changed and, from time to time, Claimants have submitted substitute annexes with updated information on the number and identity of Claimants. It is disputed between the Parties whether it is admissible to change the number of Claimants once the Request for Arbitration has been filed, and what the consequences of such changes are.\n\n594.\n\nThus, the specific issues to be determined by the Tribunal in this regard are the following:\n\n(i) To what extent is it admissible to add new Claimants to the present arbitration proceedings? And if so, what are the consequences of such addition? (see Issue No. 3(b) of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008);\n\n(ii) To what extent is it admissible to withdraw existing Claimants? And, to the extent possible, what are the conditions for withdrawing existing Claimants? In addition, what are the consequences of a withdrawal of a Claimant?\n\n595.\n\nThe key legal provisions and other documents in dealing with the above issues are the following: Articles 36, 44 and 45 ICSID Convention; Rules 24, 25 and 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules; and Rules 1 *et seq.* ICSID Institution Rules.\n\n596.\n\nArticle 36 ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General who shall send a copy of the request to the other party.\n\n(2) The request shall contain information concerning the issues in dispute, the identity of the parties and their consent to arbitration in accordance with the rules of procedure for the institution of conciliation and arbitration proceedings.\n\n(3) The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dis- pute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of registration or refusal to register.\"\n\n597.\n\nTo recall, Article 44 ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\n598.\n\nArticle 45 ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) Failure of a party to appear or to present his case shall not be deemed an admission of the other party\u2019s assertions.\n\n(2) If a party fails to appear or to present his case at any stage of the proceedings the other party may request the Tribunal to deal with the questions submitted to it and to render an award. Before rendering an award, the Tribunal shall notify, and grant a period of grace to, the party failing to appear or to present its case, unless it is satisfied that that party does not intend to do so.\"\n\n599.\n\nRules 24 and 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules provide as follows:\n\n\"Rule 24  \nSupporting Documentation\n\nSupporting documentation shall ordinarily be filed together with the instrument to which it relates, and in any case within the time limit fixed for the filing of such instrument.\n\nRule 25  \nCorrection of Errors\n\nAn accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may, with the consent of the other party or by leave of the Tribunal, be corrected at any time before the award is rendered.\"\n\n600.\n\nRule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules provide as follows:\n\n\"Discontinuance at Request of a Party\n\nIf a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.\"\n\n601.\n\nArticles 1 and 2 ICSID Institution Rules provide as follows:\n\n\"Rule 1   \nThe Request\n\n(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the Convention shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General at the seat of the Centre. The request shall indicate whether it relates to a conciliation or an arbitration proceeding. It shall be drawn up in an official language of the Centre, shall be dated, and shall be signed by the requesting party or its duly authorized representative.\n\n(2) The request may be made jointly by the parties to the dispute.\n\nRule 2  \nContents of the Request\n\n(1) The request shall:\n\n(a) designate precisely each party to the dispute and state the address of each;\n\n(b) state, if one of the parties is a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, that it has been designated to the Centre by that State pursuant to Article 25(1) of the Convention;\n\n(c) indicate the date of consent and the instruments in which it is recorded, including, if one party is a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, similar data on the approval of such consent by that State unless it had notified the Centre that no such approval is required;\n\n(d) indicate with respect to the party that is a national of a Contracting State:\n\n(i) its nationality on the date of consent; and\n\n(ii) if the party is a natural person:\n\n(A) his nationality on the date of the request; and\n\n(B) that he did not have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute either on the date of consent or on the date of the request; or\n\n(iii) if the party is a juridical person which on the date of consent had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute, the agreement of the parties that it should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention;\n\n(e) contain information concerning the issues in dispute indieating that there is, between the parties, a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment; and\n\n(f) state, if the requesting party is a juridical person, that it has taken all necessary internal actions to authorize the request.\n\n(2) The information required by subparagraphs (1)(c), (1)(d)(iii) and (1)(f) shall be supported by documentation.\n\n(3) \"Date of consent\" means the date on which the parties to the dispute consented in writing to submit it to the Centre; if both parties did not act on the same day, it means the date on which the second party acted.\"\n\n*(c) Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n602.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants\u2019 repeated use of substitute annexes to unilaterally change the identity of Claimants is incompatible with the ICSID Convention and Rules. In particular:\n\n(i) The addition of new Claimants after the filing of the Arbitration Request is not permissible without Argentina\u2019s consent. It is in breach of Article 36 ICSID Convention and may not be justified by Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules, which does not apply to corrections concerning the number and identity of the parties themselves.199\n\n(ii) The withdrawal of Claimants is not admissible without the consent of Argentina or the permission by the Secretary-General according to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules. This derives from the irrevocable nature of a State and/or investor\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. Claimants cannot rely on Article 44 ICSID Convention to override the irrevocable nature of the parties\u2019 consent, which constitutes a prerequisite for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. Consequently, the Claimants listed in Annex L remain parties to the present arbitration without however being represented by White & Case and are thus, without adequate representation.200 In their latest correspondence, Respondent has stated that it does not oppose the discontinuance of the proceedings in respect of those Claimants who, among those listed in Claimants\u2019 Annex L, have entered into the Exchange Offer 2010, and that it would agree to the discontinuance as to Claimants having withdrawn for other reasons, provided they agree to discontinuance on the same terms as those applicable to those who have tendered into the Exchange Offer 2010.201\n\nSee R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7240 *et seq.*\n\nSee R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 258 *et seq.*\n\nSee letter from Respondent of 22 October 2010 (see above \u00a7217)\n\n603.\n\nClaimants contend that the addition and withdrawal of Claimants through the submission of substitute annexes is fully consistent with the ICSID framework and that the Tribunal has full authority to accept these annexes under Article 44 ICSID Convention. Claimants support their position with the following main arguments:202\n\n*(i) Before the Registration:* Claimants contend that the admissibility of annexes submitted before the registration is part of the Request for Arbitration accepted by ICSID Secretary-General and is thus not reviewable by the Tribunal. It has already been admitted.\n\n*(ii) After the Registration:* The submission of substitute annexes is fully consistent with ICSID framework and their amendment is further authorized by Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n*(iii) No prejudice to Respondent:* In addition, Claimants contend that the changes to the annexes do not prejudice Respondent because most of them were submitted before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal so that none of Respondent\u2019s defense rights were affected. While Claimants assert that no new Claimants were added after the registration of the Request for Arbitration, they contend that the withdrawal of certain Claimants after the registration actually benefit Respondent so that it cannot claim any prejudice in this respect.\n\nSee C-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 503 *et seq.,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 507 *et seq.,* C-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 309 *et seq.*\n\n*(d) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n604.\n\nThe question of the addition and withdrawal of Claimants was addressed by the Parties together with the issue of the admissibility of substituted annexes to the Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal considers that, whilst the addition and withdrawal of Claimants has been effected through the submission of specific substitute annexes, questions regarding the additions and withdrawal of Claimants are to be distinguished from questions regarding the admissibility of modifications to instruments or supporting documents filed in the form of the substitute annexes. Indeed, the question of being a claimant is one of the cornerstones of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and not just part of any instrument or supporting document in the sense of Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules submitted in support of allegations made in the Request for Arbitration or other written submissions. The question concerning the admissibility of the substitute annexes as \"any instrument or supporting document\" will therefore be addressed separately (see \u00a7\u00a7 672 *et seq.* below).\n\n(i) Addition of Claimants\n-------------------------\n\n605.\n\nIt appears that all additions of Claimants have been made by means of Annex K, as substituted, before the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration of 7 February 2007. Claimants therefore contend that the admissibility of such additions, as contemplated in the submission of substitute Annex K, has already been accepted by the ICSID Secretary-General when registering the Request for Arbitration.\n\n606.\n\nIt is true that the ICSID Secretary-General reviews the request for arbitration and takes the decision whether to accept or refuse to register it. However, this examination is limited to making sure that the request for arbitration in question contains all information requested in Article 36 ICSID Convention in connection with Rules 1 *et seq.* ICSID Institution Rules, including information on the identity of the parties, and that the request for arbitration is not \"manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" Where certain documents or information are missing, the ICSID Secretary-General will prompt the parties to submit the additional information or documents before accepting the request. Only where the ICSID Secretary-General considers that a request for arbitration is manifestly outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction he or she will refuse to register a request. Thus, the scope of examination of the ICSID Secretary-General is limited and cannot be considered to cover all aspects relevant to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and/or to the admissibility of the case as such.\n\n607.\n\nAs mentioned above, the addition of Claimants is to be distinguished from other corrections or additions to supporting information or documents. The identity of Claimants is a core element of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. Consequently, the question of who are the actual Claimants to the present arbitration cannot be considered to have been definitely dealt with by the ICSID Secretary-General and is subject to the examination of the Tribunal. This question includes the question of who duly initiated the arbitration.\n\n608.\n\nArticle 36 ICSID Convention requires as a matter of principle that relevant information on the parties\u2019 identity be submitted with the request for arbitration. In this regard, two issues arise in connection with the present arbitration:\n\n- Firstly, the timing of the information relating to Claimants: The identity of Claimants was changed, in the sense that Claimants were added, after the filing of the Request for Arbitration;\n\n- Secondly, the form in which information on Claimants\u2019 identity was submitted: Instead of inserting relevant information in the Request for Arbitration, Claimants submitted information on their identity in the form of annexes to such Request.\n\n609.\n\nWith regard to the timing of the submission of the annexes, the Tribunal does not consider it problematic for the following two main reasons: (i) Article 36 ICSID Convention does not prohibit that the lack of relevant information in the request for arbitration may be cured before its registration; it actually conforms to ICSID\u2019s practice and the powers of the Secretary-General to give parties the opportunity to complement their request for arbitration before its registration if any core information is missing; and (ii) since the question of the identity of the Claimants is subject to the Tribunal\u2019s competence, it can only be finally examined once the Tribunal is constituted. When the Tribunal took over the case and started with the examination, all new Claimants had already been added, and the examination of \"old\" and \"new\" Claimants jointly did not cause any particular prejudice to Respondent.\n\n610.\n\nOne further point is Respondent\u2019s argument that the subsequent addition of Claimants in fact constituted the filing of new requests for arbitration, which should have been the object of separate proceedings. However, the Tribunal finds that this does not lead to the inadmissibility of the addition of Claimants for two main reasons:\n\n- First, it is possible to unilaterally withdraw a request for arbitration before its registration and one could easily consider the withdrawal of one among several Claimants through the withdrawal of its request for arbitration. This would not lead to any particular problem and would just reduce the number of Claimants. Conversely, under the circumstances of the present case, it is also possible to add claimants prior to the registration of the request for arbitration.\n\n- Second, the question of addition of Claimants to a claim is closely related to the question of whether \"mass proceedings\" are admissible under the ICSID framework. The Tribunal considers that such proceedings were admissible (see \u00a7\u00a7 515-551 above), and the nature of such mass proceedings may require making certain adjustments to the number and identity of Claimants.\n\n611.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the addition of Claimants after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and before its registration through the submission of Annex K, as substituted, is admissible and does not contravene any of the provisions of the ICSID Convention and Rules.\n\n612.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal rules that the present arbitration proceedings were validly initiated by all the Claimants mentioned in Annex K as being in the record before the date of the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration, i.e., 7 February 2007.\n\n(ii) Withdrawal of Claimants\n----------------------------\n\n613.\n\nSince the filing of the Request for Arbitration on 14 September 2006, Counsel for Claimants informed ICSID, the Tribunal and Respondent on various occasions of the \"withdrawal\" of several thousands of Claimants from the proceedings. This \"withdrawal\" happened in several stages, namely, on 19/22 December 2006, 5 February 2007, 7 November 2008, and 5 October 2010 (see \u00a7\u00a7 103, 107, 135 and 216 above, as summarized in \u00a7 592 above) and was effected through the submission of substitute versions of Annex L, listing each time the Claimants who were withdrawing. All in all, it is common ground between the Parties that out of approximately 180,000 Claimants about 120,000 have purportedly withdrawn.\n\n(a) Withdrawal, Discontinuance and Default\n------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nWith regard to \"withdrawals\" announced before the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration on 7 February 2007, they are unproblematic since it is admitted under Rule 8 ICSID Institution Rules that a claimant may unilaterally withdraw its request for arbitration before its registration. As such, Claimants listed in Annex L of 19 and 22 December 2006 and the substitute Annex L of 5 February 2007 are deemed to have validly withdrawn their Request for Arbitration.\n\n615.\n\nWith regard to \"withdrawals\" announced after the date of the Notice of Registration, the situation is different. After the registration of a request for arbitration, a claimant may not unilaterally withdraw its request for arbitration without the consent of the other party. In other words, once a request for arbitration is registered, a unilateral withdrawal by a party is no longer possible and a party may only be excluded from the proceedings through the mechanism of discontinuance under Rules 43 and 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n616.\n\nThus, the notices by which Counsel for Claimants informed the Tribunal and Respondent of the withdrawal of further Claimants on 7 November 2008 and 5 October 2010 in the form of substitute versions of Annex L cannot, by themselves, effect the withdrawal of the concerned Claimants from the proceedings.\n\n617.\n\nHowever, as an expression of the desire of these Claimants not to participate anymore in the proceedings, these notices may be interpreted in a twofold manner: (i) as requests for discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules and/or (ii) as announcement of default by the concerned Claimant in the sense of Article 45 ICSID Convention.\n\n618.\n\nIn order to determine whether the concerned Claimants\u2019 \"withdrawal\" is to be considered a request for discontinuance or a default, the Tribunal has to consider the following: Did the concerned Claimants wish to withdraw from the ICSID proceedings, i.e., not participate anymore, or did they merely wish to revoke the TFA Mandate Package and continue to be part of the proceedings but without being represented by TFA and White & Case.\n\n619.\n\nBased on Claimants\u2019 submissions, it appears that the intention of the concerned Claimants was to withdraw from the proceedings in the sense of not being anymore part thereof, contrary to the wish to continue the proceedings in a different setting of representation. The latter would anyway not be possible under the terms of the TFA Mandate Package, which interlinks the withdrawal from the ICSID arbitration and the revocation of the TFA Mandate Package (see \u00a7\u00a7 86 et *seq.).*\n\n620.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal holds that the concerned Claimants\u2019 \"withdrawal\" is to be considered a request for discontinuance pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules, thereby subject to the conditions and modalities set forth in Rule 44.\n\n(b) Conditions for Discontinuance\n---------------------------------\n\n621.\n\nAccording to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules (quoted at \u00a7 600 above), the Tribunal may only issue an order for discontinuance where the other party has not objected thereto. In case of objection, Rule 44 provides that \"the proceedings shall continue,\" meaning that the Tribunal shall issue an award on the dispute as initially commenced.\n\n622.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position regarding the concerned Claimants\u2019 withdrawal is the following: Initially, Respondent objected to the withdrawal of Claimants and insisted that these Claimants be considered in default, that the proceedings be continued and that any award be considered binding on these Claimants.203\n\nR-MJ \u00a7 372, R-R-MJ \u00a7 638.\n\n623.\n\nIn its communication of 22 October 2010 (see \u00a7 217 above), Respondent changed its position stating as follows:\n\n\"[...] the Argentine Republic does not oppose discontinuance of the proceedings in respect of those Claimants who, among those listed in Claimants\u2019 Annex L, have entered into the 2010 Exchange Offer.\n\n[...]\n\nIn any event, the Argentine Republic would consider agreeing to discontinuance as to Claimants wishing to withdraw for other reasons, provided they agree to discontinuance on the same terms as those applicable to those who tendered into the 2010 Exchange Offer.\"\n\n624.\n\nWith regard to the terms of discontinuance \"applicable to [the Claimants] who tendered into the 2010 Exchange Offer,\" Respondent refers to the acceptance by such Claimants \"to abandon, dismiss, withdraw and discontinue such proceedings (with each party to bear its own attorney fees and costs, except that Argentina shall not bear any court fees).\"204 The full paragraph of the relevant part of the Exchange Offer 2010 prospectus provides as follows:\n\n\"[...] your tendered Eligible Securities are not the subject of any administrative, litigation, arbitral, or other legal proceedings against Argentina or the trustee or fiscal agent of such Eligible Securities (including claims for payment of past due interest, principal or any other amount sought in connection with your tendered Eligible Securities or for compensation of lawyers\u2019 costs and court fees), except that, to the extent that your tendered Eligible Securities are the subject of such proceedings, (a) **you agree to abandon, dismiss, withdraw and discontinue such proceedings (with each party to bear its own attorney fees and costs, except that Argentina shall not bear any court fees) in full and final settlement** thereof if and to the extent that cancellation of the tendered Eligible Securities and settlement (including delivery of your New Securities and payment of cash, if applicable) occur pursuant to the terms of the Invitation, and you agree to promptly take any necessary or appropriate steps to implement such withdrawal and dismissal, including, without limitation, the termination of any power of attorney or agency agreement, (b) you hereby authorize Argentina (or its legal counsel) to file any document with any administrative body, court, tribunal or other body before which any such proceedings are pending or that has issued or recognized any payment order, judgment, arbitral award or other such order in order to have the proceedings withdrawn, dismissed and discontinued with prejudice and (c) you agree to deliver and hereby authorize your legal counsel to deliver to your custodian, the information agent and Argentina (or its legal counsel) without undue delay following the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date, as applicable, all additional documents, court filings or further authorizations as requested by Argentina to withdraw, dismiss and discontinue with prejudice any pending administrative, litigation, arbitral or other legal proceeding against Argentina in full and final settlement thereof.\" (Emphasis added)\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letters of 2 November 2010 and C-999B, p. 88 \u00a7 20.\n\n625.\n\nIn its letter of 22 October 2010, Respondent simplifies the above cost requirements as follows:\n\n\"In addition, we note that the terms of the 2010 Exchange Offer provide that the Argentine Republic would not be responsible for any costs in connection with any proceeding dismissed pursuant to acceptance of the 2010 Exchange Offer. Accordingly, the Argentine Republic respectfully requests the Tribunal to order that **the Argentine Republic and those Claimants with respect to which proceedings will be discontinued under the terms of this letter, equally bear the arbitration costs, and each of them bear their own costs.\"** (Emphasis added)\n\n626.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7623), Respondent also extends those conditions to Claimants who have purportedly withdrawn for other reasons.\n\n627.\n\nIn summary, the terms of the discontinuance under the Exchange Offer 2010 as simplified in Respondent\u2019s letter of 22 October 2010 are two-fold:\n\n- They imply the acceptance of a specific allocation of costs relating to present arbitral proceedings, and\n\n- They imply the \"full and final\" character of the discontinuance, i.e., with prejudice to reinstatement.\n\n(c) Terms of Discontinuance\n---------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Tribunal can only order discontinuance to the extent it is accepted by Respondent, i.e., to the extent that such discontinuance would be \"full and final\" and that costs be allocated as requested by Respondent.\n\n629.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent\u2019s conditions acceptable. It considers that in the present case a discontinuance under Article 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules is of a \"full and final\" character:\n\n- It is \"final\" in the sense that the discontinuance bears prejudice to reinstatement and that the Claimants affected by the discontinuance may neither \"resume\" the present proceedings nor institute new proceedings based on the same claim. Based on the circumstances of the present case, in particular the fact that it is Claimants who decided to withdraw - after several years and without specifying any particular reason - from proceedings which they themselves initiated and which required substantial defense work and efforts from Argentina, it would not be fair to allow them to withdraw now and to re-file the same claim later.\n\n- Further, it is \"full\" in the sense that it applies to the entirety of the claims of the concerned Claimants and not only to some of them or to some aspects thereof.\n\n630.\n\nWith regard to the allocation of costs, Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules does not provide for any specific rule. The Tribunal therefore refers to Article 61(2) ICSID Convention, according to which, the tribunal has, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the power to determine the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses shall be paid.\n\n631.\n\nIn the exercise of such power and discretion, the Tribunal considers that the terms of the discontinuance concerning the costs as suggested by Respondent are reasonable. After all, Claimants are the ones who initiated the present proceedings, and Claimants, or at least the majority of them, are the ones who decided not to pursue the proceedings any longer. Thus, it is reasonable that they bear, at least partly, the arbitration costs. On the other hand, it is also likely that Respondent\u2019s overall behavior in 2010 with regard to Claimants\u2019 claims played a certain role in Claimants\u2019 decision to continue or withdraw from the present proceedings. For example, one of the aims of the Exchange Offer 2010 was to provide a way to release Argentina from claims related to the bonds; another one was to terminate legal proceedings against Argentina in respect of the tendered Eligible Securities in consideration for the issuance of New Securities (see \u00a7 93 above). Thus, the Tribunal finds that both sides bear an equal share of the cost burden. Therefore, the Tribunal accepts the cost allocation as suggested by Respondent.\n\n632.\n\nIn summary, Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance shall each bear half of the arbitration costs (i.e., the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members and the charges for use of the Centre\u2019s facilities) and bear their own cost. In other words, the concerned Claimants and Respondent shall not be held liable for each other\u2019s cost, which include in particular legal costs.\n\n633.\n\nThe manner in which those costs are to be attributed is addressed in Chapter IV below (\"Costs\").\n\n634.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal issues the cost order in the Dispositive part of this Decision (see \u00a7 713 below).\n\n635.\n\n**In conclusion,** the terms of a discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules with regard to Claimants listed in Annex L as substituted at 5 October 2010 are not subject to any relevant objection from Respondent.\n\n(d) Consequences of the Discontinuance\n--------------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal finds it useful to specify the consequences and implications of a discontinuance of the proceedings with regard to the withdrawing Claimants.\n\n637.\n\nWith regard to the proceedings, discontinuance means that the proceedings involving the Claimants who are withdrawing will terminate. Within the context of a claim involving multiple Claimants, and in which only a certain number of the Claimants withdraw, discontinuance does not mean the termination of the entire proceedings. Rather, only those Claimants who are withdrawing will stop being parties to the present proceedings. Thus, as long as one Claimant remains, the present proceedings will continue. Only once the number of withdrawing Claimants is equal to the number of Claimants having filed the Request for Arbitration as adjusted in Annex K before the date of the Notice of Registration of the Request, it would mean the end of the entire proceedings.205\n\nSee also *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A v.

The Tribunal further finds that the present arbitral proceedings are discontinued as of the date of dispatch of the present Decision with regard to all Claimants listed in Annex L as substituted by Claimants on 5 October 2010. In particular:\n\n(i) The addition of Claimants after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and before its Notice of Registration through the submission of substitute versions of Annex K is admissible and does not contravene any of the provisions of the ICSID Convention and Rules;\n\n(ii) The withdrawal of Claimants before the date of the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration is admissible and these Claimants are thus deemed to have validly withdrawn their Request for Arbitration;\n\n(iii) The withdrawal of Claimants after the registration of the Request for Arbitration is to be considered as a request for discontinuance pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules, which is to be granted to the extent that Respondent does not object thereto;\n\n(iv) The terms of a discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules with regard to Claimants listed in Annex L as submitted by Claimants on 5 October 2010 are not subject to any relevant objection from Respondent;\n\n(v) The request for discontinuance is therefore granted and the proceedings are herewith discontinued with regard to all Claimants listed in Annex L as substituted, the latest one have been submitted by Claimants on 5 October 2010;\n\n(vi) The Tribunal issues the cost order set forth below at \u00a7 713 below (see also \u00a7 682 *et seq.* below).\n\n641.\n\nAs an administrative measure, the present proceedings are herewith renamed\n\n*\"Abaclat et al. v.

In Respondent\u2019s view, the initiation of this proceeding constitutes an abuse of rights by TFA which is pursuing hidden interests, foreign to Claimants\u2019 interest in the present arbitration.206 The Tribunal should not exercise its powers for purposes other than those established by the consent of the Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 241 *et seq.,* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 394 *et seq.,* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 230 *et seq.*\n\n645.\n\nOpposing Respondent\u2019s submissions in this regards, Claimants contend that the abuse of rights theory is not applicable in international proceedings. Further, according to Claimants, even if applicable, there is no relevant abuse of rights in the present case because the alleged abuse of rights would be committed by TFA and not by Claimants. Such abuse of rights is not imputable to Claimants and would therefore be irrelevant.207\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 473 *et seq.,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 483 *et seq.,* R-PHB \u00a7 216 et *seq.*\n\n*(c) Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe theory of abuse of rights is an expression of the more general principle of good faith. The principle of good faith is a fundamental principle of international law, as well as investment law.208 As such, the Tribunal holds that the theory of abuse of rights is, in principle, applicable to ICSID proceedings and has, in fact, been previously applied by several ICSID and non-ICSID tribunals in investment cases.209 The question is thus whether the conditions of an abuse of rights are met, and - if so - what the consequences of such abuse may be.\n\nSee e.g. Hersch Lauterpacht, Development of International Law by the International Court, London, 1958, p. 164. \"There is no right, however well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on the ground that it has been abused.\" See also *Mobil Corporation and others v.

Either one addresses the issue within the context of jurisdiction or within the context of admissibility:\n\n(i) It can be seen as an issue of consent and thus of jurisdiction, where one party considers procedural aspects to be key components of the consent of the Host State; or\n\n(ii) It can be seen as an issue of admissibility, where the key question is whether the way in which the investor initiated the proceedings, although in accordance with the applicable provisions, aim to obtain a protection, which he is - under the principle of good faith - not entitled to claim.\n\n650.\n\nThe difference between these various approaches carries important practical consequences and ought to be carefully examined. There are certainly good reasons in support for each of these approaches, and the choice of the appropriate approach will eventually depend on the circumstances of the case at stake.\n\n(ii) Qualification of the Alleged Abuse of Rights\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nAt present, Respondent\u2019s contentions with regard to abuse of rights are mainly threefold:211\n\n(i) Respondent contends that Claimants did not acquire the investment in accordance with the principle of good faith due to the Italian banks\u2019 alleged behavior consisting in the breach of various selling restrictions and other related obligations;\n\n(ii) Respondent contends that the way these proceedings were initiated and are conducted amount to an abuse of rights by TFA, who is pursuing its own interests to the detriment of Claimants\u2019 real interests;\n\n(iii) Respondent has never consented to ICSID proceedings being conducted under such circumstances.\n\nR-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 241 *et seq.,* R-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 394 *et seq.,* R-PHB \u00a7\u00a7 230 *et seq.*\n\n652.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s first contention referred to in \u00a7 651 above, the Tribunal considers it to relate to the merits of the case. The Tribunal has already set forth above (see \u00a7\u00a7 381-386) that for the purposes of jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 investment were to be considered made in accordance with the applicable law and that any misconduct of the Italian banks could not be imputed to Claimants.\n\n653.\n\nThe only remaining question is whether the circumstances invoked by Respondent could lead to the conclusion that Claimants\u2019 investments do not deserve the protection of the BIT. The Tribunal finds that this issue requires to be addressed in relation to the merits of Claimants\u2019 claim for the following reasons:\n\n- Based on the principle of severability of the arbitration clause: Even if the investment was considered to be invalid, it would not *per se* invalidate the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide on its validity;\n\n- The circumstances invoked require a more detailed factual analysis than what is usually conducted at the stage of jurisdiction (see \u00a7 303 above), which justifies dealing with these issues together with the relevant allegations of breaches of the BIT by Respondent.\n\n654.\n\nWith regard to the second and third contentions referred to in \u00a7 651 above, the Tribunal has already found above (see \u00a7\u00a7 489 *et seq.)* that Respondent\u2019s consent covered the mass aspect of the proceedings and that TFA\u2019s role therein was not of such a nature as to vitiate Claimants\u2019 consent (see \u00a7\u00a7 455 *et seq.).* Consequently, a potential abuse of rights allegedly committed by TFA would not relate to the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal and could only - if at all - relate to its admissibility.\n\n655.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal will limit its analysis to the question whether Respondent\u2019s allegation that TFA abused the ICSID process to pursue hidden interests, foreign to the interests of Claimants with regard to their investment, may render the present proceedings inadmissible.\n\n(iii) Lack of Relevant Abuse of Rights\n--------------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nRespondent\u2019s allegations of abuse of rights and abuse of process are directed against TFA. Respondent submits that the Tribunal should not allow the present proceedings because TFA is pursuing its own interests, which conflict with Claimants\u2019 interests, and which are foreign to the interests that the BIT and the ICSID Convention aim to protect.\n\n657.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, even if TFA was pursuing interests which conflict with Claimants\u2019 interests, this would not lead to the inadmissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims for the following reasons:\n\n- For ICSID proceedings to be dismissed based on an abuse of rights, it would be necessary that the abuse concerns the very rights that ICSID proceedings aim to protect, i.e., the investors\u2019 rights under the relevant BIT.\n\n- In the present arbitration, the alleged abuse of rights does not concern Claimants\u2019 rights as arising out of the BIT but TFA\u2019s interests as arising out of Claimants\u2019 pursuit of ICSID proceedings.\n\n- Respondent has not alleged that Claimants themselves were in any way abusing their right to resort to ICSID arbitration in order to protect their investment.\n\n- Dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims would mean depriving them of a remedy they are entitled to invoke, because of the alleged behaviour of a third party on which Claimants have no influence.\n\n658.\n\n**In conclusion,** the fact that a third party, such as TFA, may allegedly have taken a certain advantage from the conduct by Claimants of the present ICSID arbitration may be morally condemnable, but it cannot lead to the inadmissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims to the extent that the rights Claimants intend to seek protection for are rights protected under the BIT, which are not claimed in an abusive manner by Claimants.\n\n*(d) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n659.\n\nIn conclusion and in (partial) response to Issue No. 2(b), the Tribunal finds that TFA\u2019s role in the proceedings does not amount to an abuse of rights which would justify dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of admissibility.\n\n**(7) Conclusion on Admissibility**\n-----------------------------------\n\n660.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants\u2019 claims are admissible to the following extent:\n\n(i) The mass aspect of Claimants\u2019 claims does not constitute an impediment to their admissibility. In particular:\n\n- The silence of the ICSID framework regarding collective proceedings is to be interpreted as a \"gap\" and not as a \"qualified silence;\"\n\n- The Tribunal has, in principle, the power under Article 44 ICSID Convention to fill this gap to the extent permitted under Article 44 ICSID Convention;\n\n- The procedure necessary to deal with the collective aspect of the present proceedings concern the method of the Tribunal\u2019s examination, as well as the manner of representation of Claimants. However, it does not affect the object of such examination. Thus, the Tribunal remains obliged to examine all relevant aspects of the claims relating to Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT as well as to Respondent\u2019s obligations thereunder subject to the Parties\u2019 submissions;\n\n- Such procedure is admissible and acceptable under Article 44 ICSID Convention, Rule 19 ICSID Arbitration Rules, as well as under the more general spirit, object and aim of the ICSID Convention; and\n\n- Respondent\u2019s policy arguments regarding the appropriateness of ICSID proceedings in the context of sovereign debt restructuring are irrelevant for the determination of the admissibility of the claims.\n\n(ii) The prior consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT does not constitute an impediment to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims. In particular:\n\n- Consultations did take place between TFA, as representative of Italian bondholders, and Argentina;\n\n- Argentina is precluded from invoking the non-fulfilment by Claimants of the consultation requirement; and\n\n- Even if Claimants were considered not to have fulfilled the consultation requirement, this non-compliance would simply express that the premises for an amicable settlement were not given and cannot be interpreted as constituting a hurdle to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n(iii) The disregard by Claimants of the 18 months litigation requirement does not preclude them from resorting to ICSID arbitration. In particular:\n\n- Article 8 provides for an integrated dispute resolution mechanism built upon a certain hierarchy or order of three interconnected means whereby the wording of Article 8 itself does not yet suffice to draw specific conclusions with regard to the consequences of a non-compliance with the order established by Article 8;\n\n- The question whether Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months litigation requirements justifies precluding them from resorting to arbitration requires a weighing of interests between Argentina\u2019s interest to be given the opportunity to address the dispute through the framework of its domestic legal system and Claimants\u2019 interest in being provided with an efficient dispute resolution means;\n\n- Based on the circumstances of the present case and in particular the Emergency Law and other relevant laws and decrees, Argentina\u2019s interest in pursuing the 18 months litigation requirement does not justify depriving Claimants of their right to resort to arbitration for the sole reason that they decided not to previously submit their dispute to the Argentinean courts; and\n\n- Consequently, the question whether Claimants could have relied on the MFN clause of Article 3(1) BIT in connection to Article 10(1) Argentina-Chile BIT in order to evade the 18 months litigation requirement is moot.\n\n(iv) In conclusion and in (partial) response to Issues Nos. 3(a) and 3(b), the Tribunal finds that the present arbitral proceedings have been effectively initiated by all Claimants listed in Annex K as substituted before the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration of 5 February 2007. The Tribunal further finds that the present arbitral proceedings are discontinued as of the dater of dispatch of the present Decision with regard to all Claimants listed in Annex L as substituted by Claimants on 5 October 2010. In particular:\n\n- The addition of Claimants after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and before its Notice of Registration through the submission of substitute versions of Annex K is admissible and does not contravene any of the provisions of the ICSID Convention and Rules;\n\n- The withdrawal of Claimants before the date of the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration is admissible and these Claimants are thus deemed to have validly withdrawn their Request for Arbitration;\n\n- The withdrawal of Claimants after the registration of the Request for Arbitration is to be considered as a request for discontinuance pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules, which is to be granted to the extent that Respondent does not object thereto;\n\n- The terms of a discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules with regard to Claimants listed in Annex L as submitted by Claimants on 5 October 2010 are not subject to any relevant objection from Respondent;\n\n- The request for discontinuance is therefore granted and the proceedings are herewith discontinued with regard to all Claimants listed in Annex L as submitted by Claimants on 5 October 2010;\n\n- The Tribunal issues the cost order set forth below at \u00a7 713 below.\n\n(v) TFA\u2019s role in the proceedings does not amount to an abuse of rights by Claimants which would justify dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of admissibility.\n\n661.\n\n**Consequently,** with regard to the relevant Issues of the List of 11 Issues of 9 May 2008, the Tribunal holds:\n\n(i) **Issue 1(b):** Claimants\u2019 claims are admissible to the extent described in \u00a7 660 above;\n\n(ii) **Issue 2(b):** In the proceedings, TFA is to be seen as Claimants\u2019 agent pursuant to Rule 18 ICSID Arbitration Rules, and its role in the proceedings does not amount to an abuse of rights which would justify dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of admissibility;\n\n(iii) **Issue 3(b):** It is possible to add further Claimants after the filing of the claim, to the extent that additions are made before the date of the Notice of Registration of the Request for Arbitration, i.e., 7 February 2007;\n\n(iv) **Issue 4:** Claimants were entitled to initiate ICSID arbitration notwithstanding the 18-month domestic litigation clause under Article 8(2) BIT;\n\n(v) **Issue 5:** The MFN Clause contained in Article 3(1) BIT has no consequences on the admissibility of the present proceedings.\n\n662.\n\nThe remaining Issue 3(a) concerning the admissibility of substitute annexes is an issue of procedure and will be dealt with in the section below (see \u00a7\u00a7 672-680).\n\n**E. Other Procedural Issues**\n------------------------------\n\n663.\n\nIn sections C and D above, the Tribunal has established that it has - in principle -jurisdiction over the present dispute and that the claims raised by Claimants are - in principle - admissible. In particular, the Tribunal has established that it has the power to model and design the present procedure so as to make it workable to the \"mass\" nature of the present claims.\n\n664.\n\nThis section aims at dealing with general and more specific procedural modalities of such mass proceedings.\n\n**(1) In General: Managing the Procedure**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Introduction*\n------------------\n\n665.\n\nAs mentioned before (see \u00a7 537 above), the present case involves a number of Claimants, which makes it *de facto* impossible to deal with all them *seriatim.* Based thereon, as well as on the homogeneity of the claims (see \u00a7 541 above), the Tribunal considers that it has the power to deal with the present proceedings in the form of collective proceedings as the Tribunal\u2019s method of examination (see \u00a7 529-533). The Tribunal now needs to determine which specific method of examination would be appropriate in the light of the circumstances of the case.\n\n666.\n\nDuring the Hearing the Parties and the Tribunal briefly discussed so-called \"sampling procedure,\" also referred to sometimes as \"bell weather proceedings,\" \"pilot case proceedings,\" etc. The Tribunal contemplates the possibility to resort to such form of collective proceedings in order to deal with certain aspects of the present case.\n\n667.\n\nHowever, in order to decide whether, and if so, to what extent such sampling procedure constitutes an appropriate approach to the present mass claims, the Tribunal is of the view that it should first obtain an overview with regard to the merits of the present case.\n\n*(b) Splitting of the Merits Phase*\n-----------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nTherefore, similarly to the jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal rules that the merit phase shall be split in two phases:\n\n- *Phase 1:* In a first phase, the Tribunal will establish which isssues are the core issues regarding the merits of the case, and, in particular, which conditions would need to be required in order to further resolve Claimants\u2019 claims;\n\n- *Phase 2:* In a second phase, and based on the result of the first phase, the Tribunal will determine how to best address these issues and conditions.\n\n669.\n\nIn this respect, the following case scenarios are possible:\n\n(1) Some issues and/or conditions may be of a general nature and thus apply to all Claimants uniformly. Such issues and/or conditions could be established at once with regard to ah Claimants;\n\n(2) Some issues and/or conditions may, while being generally applicable to all Claimants, present certain objective features that would require making certain distinctions among various groups of Claimants. Such issues and/or conditions could then be established through the putting into place of a sampling procedure;\n\n(3) Some issues and/or conditions may be so Claimant-specific that their establishment would require a case-by-case analysis, similarly to the specific and individual jurisdictional requirements (see \u00a7 227 above).\n\n670.\n\nConsequently, the next phase of the proceedings will be dedicated to determining the core issues regarding the merits of the case, and, in particular, establishing what conditions must be fulfilled for the granting of Claimants\u2019 claims. This phase would be implemented through the exchange of written submissions by the Parties, in which each Party will be invited to comment on whether, and if so to what extent, these conditions can be established with regard to all Claimants (scenario 1), or whether they require the putting into place of a specific procedure for their examination (scenario 2 and/or 3). The exchange of written submissions may be followed by a hearing, if so required by Claimants and/or Respondent or considered necessary by the Tribunal.\n\n*(c) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n671.\n\nIn the light of the above consideration, the Tribunal rules that the merit phase of the present case shall be split in two phases. The first phase will be a general phase aimed at determining the core issues regarding the merits of the case, and in particular establishing what conditions must be fulfilled for further resolving Claimants\u2019 claims and determining the best method to examine these issues and conditions. A second phase during which the Tribunal will rule on how to examine the relevant issues and conditions, will put in place an appropriate mechanism of examination and will proceed with such examination.\n\n**(2) Specific Procedural Aspects**\n-----------------------------------\n\n*(a) Admissibility of Substitute Annexes - Issue 3(a)*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n672.\n\nWhile the issue of the addition and withdrawal of Claimants has been dealt with above (see \u00a7\u00a7 592 *et seqfi* this section addresses the amendments to the Annexes which concern other information relevant to individual Claimants, such as contact data, bond information, etc.\n\n673.\n\nThus, in this connection, the specific issue to be determined by the Tribunal is the following:\n\n**To what extent, if any, were Claimants entitled to amend the information contained in the substitute annexes with regard to Claimants\u2019 personal information and bond information?**\n\n674.\n\nThe key legal provisions in dealing with the above issue are the following: Article 36 ICSID Convention, Rule 2 ICSID Institution Rules and Rules 24, 25 and 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules. The wording of these provisions is reproduced in \u00a7 596 *et seq.* above.\n\n675.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have violated the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rules by misusing the substitute annexes to their Request for Arbitration and contends that (i) Claimants violated Article 36(2) ICSID Convention by unilaterally altering the terms of their Request for Arbitration through the substitute annexes and (ii) Claimants\u2019 repeated revisions of the Annexes violated Article 36 ICSID Convention.212 Respondent further contends that the information compiled in Claimants\u2019 Annexes are unreliable and unmanageable, thereby preventing Respondent from duly defending its rights.\n\nR-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 612-641.\n\n676.\n\nClaimants contend that the use of the substitute annexes is fully consistent with the ICSID framework and in particular, authorized by Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules. In addition, Claimants submit that their Annexes and database are well-organized, thereby facilitating the searching and management of Claimant-related information.213\n\nC-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 509 *et seq.,* C-R-MJ \u00a7\u00a7 515 *et seq.*\n\n677.\n\nTo the extent that the Tribunal has found that the addition and/or withdrawal of Claimants was admissible (see \u00a7 640 above), changes to the information relating to the identity of added and withdrawn Claimants is admissible under Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules.214 Changes and corrections to the contact information of some Claimants and/or to other supporting information are further also admissible under Rule 25 ICSID Arbitration Rules. For both cases, the Tribunal grants hereby leave for the corrections. These corrections do not violate Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nRule 25 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides: \"An accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may, with the consent of the other party or by leave of the Tribunal, be corrected at any time before the award is rendered.\"\n\n678.\n\nIn addition, even if - when examining whether individual claims fulfil all necessary requirements - certain information contained in the Annexes and/or database appeared to be missing, erroneous and/or unreliable, this would not justify rejecting at this stage the admissibility of the Annexes. Indeed, it is Claimants who bear the burden to prove that all conditions for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and for the granting of the substantive claims are met. In case relevant information in the Annexes is missing, erroneous or unreliable, this would be taken into consideration by the Tribunal when deciding whether Claimants complied with their burden of proof with respect to the concerned claims and/or Claimants.\n\n679.\n\nWith regard to the manageability and reliability of the information contained in the Annexes, the Tribunal sees no reason why the Annexes and the information contained therein should - as a matter of principle - be deemed unmanageable or unreliable. At this stage of the proceedings it is sufficient to note that the Annexes appear to contain all the information required under Article 36 ICSID Convention and Rules 1 *et seq.* ICSID Institution Rules. Further, in conjunction with the online and the Excel database reproducing the information contained in the Annexes, such information is presented in a way sufficiently manageable for the examination of Claimant specific information. The Tribunal considers that this was satisfactorily demonstrated during the Hearing on Jurisdiction by Mr. Brent Kaczmarek.215\n\nSee Hearing Tr. Day 4 p. 1043/1 - 1051/15; see also Navigant I, \u00a7\u00a7 11-24 and Navigant II, sections III & IV.\n\n680.\n\n**Consequently,** the Tribunal holds that the Annexes submitted by Claimants are in principle admissible and the latest version of the Annexes as submitted by Claimants on 5 October 2010 is hereby accepted into the record.\n\n*(b) Other Procedural Aspects*\n------------------------------\n\n681.\n\nAny further procedural aspect not addressed in the present Decision, as well as the details of the next phase of the proceedings (see \u00a7 671 above) will be discussed at a procedural meeting by telephone or in person with the Parties to be organized shortly after the issuance of the present Decision.\n\n**IV.

However, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it is too early in the present proceedings to rule on costs, except with respect to the Claimants who are subject to discontinuance of the arbitration. In that regard, it may be recalled that, on 26 November 2010, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9 in which it announced that the question of the allocation of the arbitration costs concerning the Claimants who withdrew would be dealt with in the Tribunal\u2019s upcoming determination on jurisdiction together with the question of the withdrawal of a number of Claimants.\n\n687.\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a7 628-635 above, the Tribunal held that Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance shall each bear half of the arbitration costs (i.e., the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members and the charges for use of the Centre\u2019s facilities) and bear their own cost.\n\n688.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal until 15 June 2011 amount to US$ 1,331,960.45 (see Article 60(2) ICSID Convention; Regulation 14(1) ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations; Rule 28(1)(a) ICSID Arbitration Rules; Rule 14 Administrative and Financial Rules).\n\n689.\n\nThe charges for use of the Centre\u2019s facilities until 15 June 2011 amount to US$376,641.95 (see Article 59 ICSID Convention; Rule 28(1)(a) ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n690.\n\nThe arbitration cost as defined above, therefore, amount to US$ 1,708,602.4 until 15 June 2011.\n\n691.\n\nIt is common ground that out of approximately 180,000 Claimants about 120,000 Claimants are subject to discontinuance. Accordingly, two thirds of the arbitration costs are to be attributed to the proceedings between the Claimants who are subject to discontinuance and Respondent, being US$1,139,068.3. They are to be shared equally between Claimants subject to discontinuance and Respondent. As Claimants and Respondent have advanced equal amounts on account of the arbitration costs and those costs are paid out of the advances, neither side has a cost claim on the other on account of the costs of arbitration.\n\n692.\n\nSimilarly, the share of each Party\u2019s own cost that is to be deemed to be attributable to the proceedings between the Claimants who are subject to discontinuance and Respondent is two thirds.\n\n693.\n\nThe result of the foregoing is that the reserved portions of the costs between the remaining Claimants and Respondent are insofar as the present phase of the arbitration leading to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility are concerned with respect to\n\n- the arbitration costs: US$ 569,534.1,\n\n- Claimants\u2019 costs: US$ 9,103,200217 and\n\n- Respondent\u2019s costs: US$ 3,873,447.218\n\nI.e., one third of US$ 27,309,604\n\nI.e., one third of US$ 11,620,340.\n\n694.\n\nThe Tribunal would like to emphasize that its decision on the amounts mentioned in the preceding paragraph, including the reasonableness of the claimed Parties\u2019 costs and the allocation (if any), is reserved until a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n**V.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Recommendation concerns the arbitration proceedings commenced in 2006 by a group of individuals and corporations known presently as \"Abaclat and others\" who are holders of sovereign bonds issued by the Argentine Republic (the **\"Claimants\"**), against the Argentine Republic (the **\"Respondent\"**). Those arbitration proceedings are administered by International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (**\"ICSID\"**) pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\"**) and the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"**).\n\n2.\n\nBy letter from Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel at ICSID, dated November 18, 2011, I have been asked to provide a recommendation to ICSID on the Respondent\u2019s proposal, submitted on September 15, 2011, for the disqualification, pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, of Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (the **\"Proposal\"**).\n\n3.\n\nThe Proposal is based on the following four grounds:\n\n(i) the rejection, by decision communicated to the Parties on August 4, 2011, of the Respondent\u2019s Urgent Request for Provisional Measures dated July 21, 2011 (**\"Ground One**\");\n\n(ii) certain aspects of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated August 4, 2011 (the **\"Decision**\"), which are said to limit the Respondent\u2019s right of defense (**\"Ground Two**\");\n\n(iii) the alleged prejudgment of certain issues in the Decision (**\"Ground Three**\"); and\n\n(iv) the communication of the Decision to the Parties prior to the communication of the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab dated October 28, 2011 (**\"Ground Four\"**).\n\n4.\n\nBecause of the seriousness of the matters to which the Proposal relates, the reasons on which the present Recommendation is based are set out herein.\n\n**B. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. The Arbitration Proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nBy Request for Arbitration dated September 14, 2006, the Claimants commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent concerning the Respondent\u2019s alleged breach of its obligations under the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**Argentina-Italy BIT**\").\n\n6.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, who number some 60,000, most of them are natural persons of Italian nationality and juridical persons incorporated and existing under the laws of Italy.1 They are represented in these proceedings by *\"l\u2019Azzociazione per la Tutela degli Investitori in Titoli Argentini\"* (\"Task Force Argentina, or \"TFA\"),2 an entity created organized under Italian law.3\n\nDecision, para. 3.\n\nDecision, para. 4.\n\nDecision, para. 65.\n\n7.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal (the \"**Tribunal**\") was constituted on February 6, 2008, by (i) Professor van den Berg (appointed by the Claimants); (ii) Professor Georges Abi-Saab (appointed by the Respondent) and (iii) Dr. Robert Briner (appointed by ICSID pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention), President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was reconstituted, due to the sudden and unfortunate death of Dr. Briner, by the appointment of Professor Tercier on September 2, 2009. The Secretary to the Tribunal is Mr. Flores.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing several rounds of written submissions, a Hearing on Jurisdiction took place in Washington D.C. from April 7 to April 13, 2010.\n\n9.\n\nAt various stages of the arbitral proceedings, the Respondent alleged the existence of several irregularities in certain of the documents designed and used by TFA in order to initiate the arbitration on behalf of the Claimants (the \"**TFA Mandate Package\"**), including the alleged use of forged signatures and the signature of powers of attorney by persons other than the named signatory. In support of its allegations, the Respondent referred to two reports by handwriting experts that were annexed to its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, and a second expert report which it submitted prior to the Hearing on Jurisdiction, and which the Tribunal declined to admit but reserved the possibility of admitting it at a later stage in the proceedings.4\n\nProposal, paras. 4-6, citing Report of the Forensic Document Examination Division of the Argentine Federal Police Department (Toscano, Pereyra and Di Tommaso); Expert Report of H\u00e9ctor Jorge Petersen and H\u00e9ctor Jorge Petersen, Jr.; Reply Memorial, paras. 191-197; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 225; Procedural Order No. 4, March 18, 2010, para. 53.\n\n10.\n\nOn July 21, 2011, the Respondent submitted an Urgent Request for Provisional Measures (the **\"Urgent Request for Provisional Measures\"**) to the Tribunal. According to the Respondent, on July 13, 2011, \"it had received a notification in the context of the proceedings brought by the Italian Prosecution before the Courts of Bologna (Italy) in connection with the signatures of three Claimants contained in a Declaration of Consent submitted in this arbitration proceeding.\"5 In the context of those criminal proceedings, the Italian Prosecutor\u2019s Office had concluded that it had \"effectively [been] shown that the signatures affixed under [the names of two of the Claimants] have been forged.\"6 The Respondent requested that (a) a hearing be scheduled urgently so that the Tribunal could hear the testimony of the Claimants to whom the allegations of forged signatures related; (b) the Claimants be ordered to refrain from altering or destroying any document; and (c) the ICSID Secretary-General be urgently requested to issue a report on the method it applied to verify the authenticity of the documentation submitted together with the Request for Arbitration.7\n\nProposal, para. 8.\n\nProposal, para. 8, citing Filing Petition by the representative of the Italian Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Attorney Giampiero Nascimbeni, Annex I of the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures.\n\nProposal, para. 12, citing Urgent Request for Provisional Measures, Item III.\n\n11.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, by a majority composed of Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg, the Tribunal issued the Decision. The signature page of the Decision does not contain co-arbitrator Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s signature, but rather the words \"Dissenting Opinion Forthcoming\" appear in typescript in the relevant space.\n\n12.\n\nThe Decision was communicated to the Parties by letter sent on behalf of the Tribunal by Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Consultant, dated August 4, 2011 (the **\"Letter dated August 4, 2011**\").\n\n13.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab (the \"**Dissenting Opinion**\") was issued on October 28, 2011 and was circulated to the Parties by letter from ICSID dated October 30, 2011.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated November 1, 2011, Professor Abi-Saab tendered his resignation from the Tribunal.\n\n**2. The Proposal for Disqualification**\n----------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn September 15, 2011, the Respondent submitted to ICSID a Proposal for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and Arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg (the \"**Proposal**\"), in which it proposed that (a) the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") be asked to \"provide an opinion in connection with this [R]equest\"; (b) Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg \"be separated from this arbitration and be replaced\"; and (c) this proceeding be suspended until a decision on the Proposal be made.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated September 16, 2011, the Claimants objected to the Proposal.\n\n17.\n\nOn September 21, 2011, the Respondent sent a letter to ICSID to supplement its Proposal of September 15, 2011, further requesting a hearing to be scheduled with respect to the Proposal.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated September 21, 2011, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s letter of the same date, and requested \"a prompt schedule for submissions and the Chairman of the Administrative Council\u2019s decision within the 30 days contemplated by the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated October 5, 2011, ICSID informed the Parties that \"the proceeding has been suspended since September 15, 2011\" due to the Respondent\u2019s Proposal.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated October 6, 2011, the Claimants requested that ICSID reject the Respondent\u2019s Proposal within the 30-day period provided under the ICSID Rules, or, alternatively, that ICSID immediately issue a schedule for party submissions regarding the Proposal.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated October 13, 2011, ICSID communicated to the Parties the following schedule for submissions concerning the Proposal:\n\n*a. Claimants are invited to submit a reply to Respondent\u2019s disqualification proposal by Friday, October 28, 2011;*\n\n*Professor Pierre Tercier and Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg, are invited to furnish any explanations that they may wish to provide, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(3); within 10 days from receipt of Claimants\u2019 submission;*\n\n*Both parties are invited to simultaneously file, within two weeks from the date of any explanations furnished by Prof. Tercier and Dr. van den Berg, any further observations they wish to make in connection with the disqualification proposal.*\n\n*The parties are requested to submit this presentation only to the Secretary of the Tribunal on the due date. The Secretary of the Tribunal will circulate the submissions upon receipt of both parties\u2019 filings;*\n\n*d. To avoid any possible confusion, the Secretary of the Tribunal will confirm to the parties the exact due date for the filing of (c) above, once Prof. Pierre Tercier\u2019s and Dr. van den Berg\u2019s explanations (if any) are received.*\n\n22.\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the Claimants submitted their reply to the Proposal (the **\"Claimants\u2019 Reply**\").\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of October 24, 2011 (mistakenly dated October 20, 2011), ICSID invited Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg to submit any comments they might wish to provide within 10 days.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated October 28, 2011, ICSID informed the Parties (i) that Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules authorize the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide on the Proposal; and (ii) that the Chairman had decided to deny the Respondent's request for a hearing on the Proposal and to grant the Respondent's request for a recommendation from the Secretary-General of the PCA concerning the Proposal.\n\n25.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg transmitted a joint letter to ICSID, furnishing their comments on the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated November 2, 2011, ICSID invited the Parties to submit any further observations they might wish to make in connection with the Proposal, and enclosed a letter from Professor Georges Abi-Saab communicating his resignation from the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter to the PCA dated November 8, 2011, the Respondent referred to the Proposal and requested that any recommendation of the Secretary-General of the PCA \"be based on the opinion of a person to be designated by [the Secretary-General of the PCA], who is absolutely unquestionable and completely independent from the parties and the challenged arbitrators,\" and that \"such designation be communicated to all the parties to these proceedings.\"\n\n28.\n\nBy letter to ICSID and to the Parties dated November 11, 2011, the PCA stated that it had not received a formal communication from ICSID regarding the Proposal and that it would welcome comments from ICSID regarding the Respondent's letter dated November 8, 2011.\n\n29.\n\nOn November 16, 2011, the Claimants and the Respondent submitted to ICSID, in English and Spanish respectively, their further observations in relation to the Respondent's Proposal (respectively, the **\"Claimants\u2019 Observations\"** and the **\"Respondent\u2019s Observations**\").\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated November 17, 2011, ICSID informed the Parties that it would \"now seek a recommendation from the Secretary-General of the PCA\" on the Respondent's Proposal and conveyed to the Parties a list of documents to be provided to the PCA.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter to ICSID dated November 18, 2011, the Claimants noted that \"[ICSID's] transmission to the PCA omitted several documents relating to the Request\", and requested that ICSID \"promptly transmit the omitted materials to the PCA.\"\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated November 18, 2011, ICSID communicated to the Parties a revised list of documents to be provided to the PCA, and invited the Respondent to indicate when an English translation of the Respondent's Observations, would be ready.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated November 18, 2011, ICSID requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA make a recommendation to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council on the Proposal, and enclosed copies of the Proposal and related documents as listed in its letter to the Parties of the same date.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated November 21, 2011, the Claimants requested that ICSID (a) \"[d]irect [the Respondent] to cease and desist from any *ex parte* communications with the PCA or [ICSID]\"; (b) \"[p]rovide the Parties with copies of all prior correspondence and all further correspondence immediately upon transmission\"; and (c) \"[f]acilitate a prompt conclusion to this process by encouraging the PCA to conclude its review on a timely basis and by facilitating the issuance of a decision by the Chairman of the Administrative Council before the end of the year.\"\n\n35.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, the Respondent provided an English translation of the Respondent's Observations\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated November 29, 2011, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent\u2019s letter to the PCA dated November 8, 2011, and expressed their preference that the Secretary-General of the PCA make a recommendation on the Proposal within 30 days of the request from ICSID.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated November 30, 2011, the PCA requested that ICSID provide copies of those documents referred to in the Parties\u2019 submissions that were not attached to the letter from ICSID dated November 18, 2011.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter dated December 1, 2011, ICSID invited the Parties to submit, by December 2, 2011, any comments they wished to make on the PCA\u2019s request dated November 30, 2011.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated December 2, 2011, the Claimants stated that they did not object to such documents being provided to the PCA, provided that this would not delay the making of a recommendation by the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter to ICSID and to the Parties dated December 2, 2011, the PCA stated that the Secretary-General would use his best endeavors to make a recommendation by December 19, 2011.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter to the Parties dated December 9, 2011, ICSID stated that, since the Claimants had indicated that they did not object to the transmission of the documents requested by the PCA and that the Respondent had not submitted any comments in this connection, the requested documents would be transmitted to the PCA.\n\n42.\n\nBy e-mails dated December 9, 10, and 14, 2011, ICSID transmitted to the PCA the documents requested in the PCA\u2019s letter dated November 30, 2011. By letter dated December 9, 2011, ICSID transmitted to the PCA further correspondence at the request of the Parties.\n\n43.\n\nBy letters to ICSID dated December 14, 2011, and December 15, 2011, the Claimants and the Respondent, respectively, provided further comments on the transmission of documents to the PCA.\n\n**C. Observations on the Applicable Law**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe legal basis for the Proposal that Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg be disqualified is Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any obits members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\n\n45.\n\nIn the Proposal, the Respondent proposes disqualification based on the first sentence of Article 57, namely, the existence of facts \"indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" According to Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n46.\n\nNeither the moral character of Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg nor their competence in the field of international law has been questioned by the Respondent. The issue centers only on whether they may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment with respect to the Parties to the dispute. In this connection, the Respondent and the Claimants are in agreement on the proposition, which I accept, that the term \"independent judgment\" in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention encompasses both independence and impartiality.8\n\nProposal, para. 63; Claimants' Reply, pp. 4-5.\n\n47.\n\nRule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n*Disqualification of Arbitrators*\n\n*(1) A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n*(2) The Secretary-General shall forthwith:*\n\n*(a) transmit the proposal to the members of the Tribunal and, if it relates to a sole arbitrator or to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, to the Chairman of the Administrative Council; and*\n\n*(b) notify the other party of the proposal.*\n\n*(3) The arbitrator to whom the proposal relates may, without delay, furnish explanations to the Tribunal or the Chairman, as the case may be.*\n\n*(4) Unless the proposal relates to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned. If those members are equally divided, they shall, through the Secretary-General, promptly notify the Chairman of the proposal, of any explanation furnished by the arbitrator concerned and of their failure to reach a decision.*\n\n*(5) Whenever the Chairman has to decide on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator, he shall use his best efforts to take that decision within 30 days after he has received the proposal.*\n\n*(6) The proceeding shall be suspended until a decision has been taken on the proposal.*\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent has cited various sources outside of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules concerning the disqualification of arbitrators and concerning the issues on which the Proposal is based. However, in the absence of express agreement by the Parties on the applicability of such sources, the present recommendation is based upon the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.\n\n49.\n\nIt is clear that decisions on challenges previously brought in other cases under the ICSID Convention are not binding upon me. However, this does not preclude me from considering such decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that I find that they shed any useful light on the issues arising in this case.\n\n**1. Burden and Standard of Proof under Article 57**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nUnder Article 57, the burden is on the challenging party to establish the existence of the required fact or facts and to prove that such fact or facts indicate a \"manifest lack\" of the quality required of an arbitrator, that is, that such an arbitrator lacks the quality of being a person who can be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and impartiality of judgment. The standard of proof required is that the challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence, but also that the lack is \"manifest\" or highly probable, not just possible.\n\n51.\n\nIn the case of *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v. Pakistan,* the tribunal gave the following guidance on the standard that must be met under Article 57 of the Convention:\n\n*The standard of appraisal of a challenge set forth under Article 57 of the Convention may be seen to have two constituent elements: (a) there must be a fact or facts (b) which are of such a nature or character as to \u2018indicat[e] a manifest lack of the qualities required by' Article 14(1). The party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made. The first requisite that facts must be established by the party proposing disqualification, is in effect a prescription that mere speculation or inference cannot be a substitute for such facts. The second requisite of course essentially consists of an inference, but that inference must rest upon, or be anchored to, the facts established. An arbitrator cannot, under Article 57 of the Convention, be successfully challenged as a result of inferences which themselves rest merely on other inferences.*\n\n*It is important to stress that the inference which constitutes the second constituent element must itself be reasonable. There must, in other words, if the challenge is to succeed, be a clear and reasonable relationship between the constituent facts and the constituent inference they generate. The facts established or undisputed must, in the circumstances of the particular case, be plainly capable of giving rise to the inference claimed to be derived from such facts. The inference resulting from the facts must be that, manifestly, that is, clearly, the person challenged is not to be relied upon for independent judgment, or that a readily apparent and reasonable doubt as to that person's reliability for independent judgment has arisen from the facts established or not disputed. More succinctly, the critical inference must be reasonable in view of the facts from which it springs and should accord with the common experience of the pertinent community of arbitrators and lawyers.9*\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v. Pakistan,* Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator (Dec. 19, 2002), 8 ICSID Reports 398, 402.\n\n52.\n\nApplying that reasoning to the facts of the challenge, which was based on the professional relationship between the challenged arbitrator and counsel for one of the parties, the tribunal then held that:\n\n*It appears to us that the Claimant merely supposes the existence of what it must prove. A supposition... standing on the shoulders of another assumption... which itself rests on still another speculation... will not sustain the challenge in the instant case.*10\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v. Pakistan,* Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator (Dec. 19, 2002), 8 ICSID Reports 398, 405.\n\n53.\n\nI consider that Article 57 requires that the challenging party establish facts indicating a lack of the required qualities; in other words, that it both prove the existence of those facts and prove that such indication is \"manifest.\"\n\n**2. The Meaning of \"Independence\" under Article 14(1)**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe case of *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic11 (\"Suez I\")* concerned a proposal for the disqualification of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler based on the fact that she had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* which had rendered an award against Argentina two months previously.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007).\n\n55.\n\nConcerning Article 14(1), the majority of the tribunal in *Suez I* addressed the question of what was meant by the requirement of \"independence.\" It noted as follows:\n\n*Although Argentina did not point to this fact, the Spanish language version of the Convention Article 14(1) appears to be slightly different from that of the English language version. The Spanish version of Article 14(1) refers to a person who \"...inspira[r] plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio. (i.e. who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgment.) Since the treaty by its terms makes both language versions equally authentic, we will apply the two standards of independence and impartiality in making our decisions. Such an approach accords with that found in many arbitration rules which require arbitrators to be both independent and impartial.*\n\n*The concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp. Generally speaking independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator\u2019s decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties. Thus Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary defines \u2018impartiality\u2019 as \u2018freedom from favoritism, not biased in favor of one party more than another.\u2019 Thus it is possible in certain situations for a judge or arbitrator to be independent of the parties but not impartial.*12\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007), paras. 28-29.\n\n56.\n\nThe majority continued:\n\n*Independence and impartiality are states of mind. Neither the Respondent, the two members of this tribunal, or any [other] body is capable of probing the inner workings of any arbitrator\u2019s mind to determine with perfect accuracy whether that person is independent or impartial. Such state of mind can only be inferred from conduct either by the arbitrator in question or persons connected to him or her. It is for that reason that Article 57 requires a showing by a challenging party of any fact indicating a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.13*\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007), para. 30.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Suez I* also addressed the question whether in applying the standards of Article 14(1) of the Convention to challenges, one is to use a subjective standard based on the belief of the complaining party or an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party. The majority concluded that an objective standard was required, holding:\n\n*Implicit in Article 57 and its requirement for a challenger to allege a fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator by Article 14, is the requirement that such lack be proven by objective evidence and that the mere belief by the challenge[r] of the contest[ed] arbitrator\u2019s lack of independence or impartiality is not sufficient to disqualify the contested arbitrator. Previous ICSID decisions on challenges to arbitrators support our decision.*14\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007), para. 40.\n\n58.\n\nThe majority in *Suez I* cited the decision on the challenge to the president of the annulment committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* in which a similar approach was taken in stating that the challenging party shall rely on established facts and \"not on any mere speculation or inference\",15 and in holding as follows:\n\n*Indeed, the application of a subjective, self-judging standard instead of an objective [one] would enable any party in arbitration who becomes discontented with the process for any reason to end it at any time at its sole discretion simply by claiming that an arbitrator is not independent and impartial, a result that would undermine and indeed destroy the system of investor-State arbitration that was so carefully established by the states that have agreed to the Convention.*16\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Challenge to the President of the Committee, para. 25.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v.

Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Challenge to the President of the Committee, para. 25 [sic].\n\n59.\n\nOn the facts of the challenge in *Suez I,* the majority concluded that the proposal by the Respondent on the basis of the challenged arbitrator's participation in a tribunal that had rendered an award unfavorable to the respondent \"failed to prove any fact indicating a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\"17\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007), para. 43.\n\n60.\n\nIt may be conceivable that a ruling might in certain circumstances be of such a nature on its face as to demonstrate evidence of partiality or lack of independence. Such might be the case, for example, where there is a ruling which, on its face, shows objective evidence of bad faith on the part of the arbitrator. However, in general, dissatisfaction with a ruling is not a fact indicating a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n61.\n\nIn *Suez I,* the majority of the tribunal articulated this point as follows:\n\n*[I]t must be pointed out that a difference of opinion over an interpretation of a set of facts is not in and of itself evidence of lack of independence or impartiality. It is certainly common throughout the world for judges and arbitrators in carrying out their functions honestly to make determinations of fact or law with which one of the parties may disagree. The existence of such disagreement itself is by no means manifest evidence that such judge or arbitrator lacked independence or impartiality. Even if an appellate body should ultimately reverse such determination, that reversal in and of itself would by no means be evidence of a failure of impartiality or independence. A judge or arbitrator may be wrong on a point of law or wrong on a finding of fact but still be independent and impartial.*18\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (Oct. 22, 2007), para. 35.\n\n62.\n\nThis principle also follows from Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which sets out an exhaustive list of the grounds on which a party that is dissatisfied with a ruling of the Tribunal can seek redress by way of a request for annulment, and the procedure to be followed in that event. Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.*\n\n63.\n\nThe applicable legal principles can be summarized as follows. Under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, the burden of proof is on the challenging party to establish, first, the existence of the facts from which it is said that a manifest lack of the relevant qualities can be inferred, and, secondly, to establish that such an inference can reasonably be inferred in the circumstances. The standard required by Article 57 is an objective one; it is not based on the subjective perception of the party proposing disqualification. It is not sufficient to posit an inference of lack of independence and impartiality which itself rests on another inference or mere speculation. Such speculation is inconsistent with Article 57 because, as stated by the majority of the tribunal in *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine,* in terms with which I am in complete agreement, it \"requires the creation of the very inferences that the common definition of the term \u2018manifest\u2019 does not in its ordinary meaning permit.\"19\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Decision on Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz (Mar. 19, 2010), para. 44.\n\n64.\n\nMoreover, if the existence of an adverse ruling were sufficient to establish a lack of independence and impartiality, no ruling by an adjudicator would ever be possible. It is not the function of an arbitrator to reach conclusions which are mutually acceptable to the Parties or which are neutral in their effects. It follows from the foregoing that the mere fact of an adverse ruling against the party proposing disqualification does not establish, let alone suggest, a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n65.\n\nThe above propositions apply even if it is claimed that the adverse ruling in question is wrong in fact or in law or is susceptible of appeal. An arbitrator can be wrong in fact or in law, and still be independent and impartial.\n\n**D. Observations on the Timeliness of the Proposal**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Proposal for Disqualification is \"late\" and has been \"transparently interposed after Argentina\u2019s failed jurisdictional objections in an effort to disrupt the proceedings.\"20 The Claimants submit that under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, \"Argentina has waived its right to challenge the arbitrators by delaying the filing of its Request as long as it did.\"21 The Respondent argues that it submitted the Proposal \"as soon as it learned of the factual and legal bases, which could not occur but after the thorough analysis of each and every of the 713 paragraphs of the Decision adopted by the majority of the Tribunal.\"22\n\nClaimants' Reply, p.1.\n\nClaimants' Reply, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 9.\n\n67.\n\nThe issue thus arises whether the Respondent has waived its right to make a proposal for disqualification.\n\n68.\n\nUnder Rule 9(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the right to challenge an arbitrator must be exercised \"promptly\" but there is no time limit prescribed by the Arbitration Rules or the ICSID Convention. The Parties agree that the word \"promptly\" means that the party proposing disqualification must make such proposal as soon as it learns of the facts on which the proposal is based. I note that the majority issued the Decision on August 4, 2011. The Proposal for Disqualification was submitted 42 days later, on September 15, 2011. The Dissenting Opinion was issued on October 28, 2011.\n\n69.\n\nHaving regard to the grounds on which the Proposal is based, and allowing for the time which the Respondent says that it needed in order to learn of the facts giving rise to the challenge, I find no reason not to accept the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Proposal dated September 15, 2011 was made as soon as the Respondent \"learned\" of such facts, such time being the point at which the Respondent asserts that it completed its \"thorough analysis\"23 of the Decision.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 9.\n\n**E. Observations on the Grounds on which the Proposal is Based**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nI shall now set out my reasons in respect of each of the four grounds for the Proposal put forward by the Respondent.\n\n**1. Ground One: Rejection of the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn relation to Ground One of the Proposal, the Respondent contends that the arbitrators\u2019 rejection of the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures showed a lack of independent and impartial judgment.24 The issue therefore arises whether the majority\u2019s decision to reject the application for provisional measures constitutes or evidences a lack of independent and impartial judgment.\n\nProposal, paras. 3-18; Respondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 12-22.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent bases its Proposal for Disqualification on this issue upon the \"manifest arbitrariness\" of the Decision of the majority by reason of the defects that the Respondent perceives in that decision, namely, the \"abrupt rejection by the majority of the Tribunal of the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures, stating no reasons therefor, failing to consider the new evidence submitted with respect to the existence of fraud and essential mistake, and prejudging the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent.\"25 The Respondent contends that those defects lead \"to an objective loss of reliance upon the exercise of independent judgment\" of the challenged arbitrators.26 As evidence in relation to this ground for the Proposal, the Respondent refers to the Letter dated August 4, 2011,27 and to certain passages of the Decision.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 12.\n\nProposal, para. 13, citing Letter dated August 4, 2011.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Decision is \"clear evidence of partiality when [the majority of the Tribunal] does not admit and consider important and serious evidentiary issues.\"28 In this connection, the Respondent refers to paragraphs 501 and 502 of the Decision, in which it is stated that \"[t]here is at this stage no indication that such execution [of the documents embodying Claimants\u2019 consents] would have been achieved based on fraud, coercion or essential mistake vitiating Claimants\u2019 consent\" and therefore \"[t]he Declaration of Consent signed by the individual Claimants submitted in this proceeding is in principle valid.\"29 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal ought not to have made such a finding \"without considering the need to appropriately verify the validity of all the documentation submitted by Claimants.\"30\n\nProposal, para. 68.\n\nProposal, para. 14, citing Decision, paras. 501 (iv) & 502 (ii).\n\nProposal, para. 15.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent refers, further, to paragraph 466 of the Decision, in which it is stated that the issue of the existence and validity of individual consent \"will be addressed, to the extent necessary and appropriate, when dealing with issues concerning individual Claimants,\" in relation to which it contends that: (i) \"the majority of the Tribunal has already acknowledged that individual treatment is \u2018impossible\u2019 thus, the analysis of the existence and validity of consent of each Claimant has been rendered \u2018impossible\u2019\"; (ii) the next phase of the proceedings has already been established to determine the core issues regarding the merits of the case; and (ii) \"the majority of the Tribunal has already rejected in a final manner the jurisdictional objections made by [Respondent] based on the acceptance of the validity of Claimants\u2019 consent.\"31\n\nProposal, para. 16, citing Decision, paras. 296, 670, 464.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants have set out in detail the circumstances surrounding the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures and the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on that Request. They submit that the Tribunal\u2019s determination that there was no evidence of systematical impropriety as to the manner in which the Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration was obtained is \"fully supported by the record.\"32\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 14.\n\n76.\n\nWith respect to the rejection of the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures, Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg refer to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Letter dated August 4, 2011.33\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, p. 2.\n\n77.\n\nHaving regard to the importance of the Letter dated August 4, 2011, in relation to the Proposal, the text of that letter is reproduced in full here:\n\n*Dear Mesdames and Sirs,*\n\n*I write to you in the absence of Mr. Flores from the office. At the request of the President of the Tribunal, I send you herewith the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (the \"Decision\"), signed by the majority of the members of the Tribunal. The President asked me to inform you as follows.*\n\n*Having fully deliberated the issues but having not received the written text of the Dissenting Opinion to date, the majority of the members of the Tribunal does not see a justification to delay any longer the notification of the Decision to the Parties, also in light of Respondent\u2019s recent request mentioned below. Professor Georges Abi-Saab wishes to record his disagreement with the notification of the Decision today without his Dissenting Opinion. If and when the Dissenting Opinion is received and translated into Spanish, it will be communicated to the Parties.*\n\n*With respect to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Interim Measures of 21 July 2011 (the \"Request\"), Claimants\u2019 response of 29 July 2011 and Respondents\u2019 reply of 3 August 2011, the majority of the Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants have convincingly argued that there is a lack of urgency. In the same vein, the majority of the Tribunal is of the opinion that there is no convincing reason why Respondent\u2019s Request should be dealt with prior to the issuance of the Decision. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal rejects the Request, Professor Abi-Saab dissenting.*\n\n*The matters raised in the Request, however, may be discussed for scheduling and other purposes at the case management conference that will be organized at the earliest convenience of the Parties and the members of the Tribunal for the purposes of the further conduct of the proceedings.*\n\n*Sincerely yours,*\n\n*Anneliese Fleckenstein*\n\n*Consultant*\n\n78.\n\nAccording to the third paragraph of the Letter dated August 4, 2011, to which the Respondent itself refers in support of its argument on this ground, the majority rejected the request for provisional measures on the grounds that it was convinced by the Claimants\u2019 arguments.\n\n79.\n\nI recall that the standard of proof required by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is an objective one which is not based on the perception of the Party proposing the disqualification, and dissatisfaction with a ruling of the Tribunal is not a valid basis for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. On their face, the Respondent\u2019s submissions on Ground One are aimed at the reasoning and the decision of the Tribunal. The Respondent\u2019s objections are thus based on defects which it perceives in the ruling of the Tribunal on the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures. This cannot give rise to a valid basis for disqualification.\n\n80.\n\nAside from its arguments on the substance of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, the Respondent has not presented any evidence that the majority of the Tribunal was influenced by anything other than its analysis of the arguments which the Parties presented to it concerning the request for provisional measures. Nor has the Respondent pointed to any facts, other than the fact that the Tribunal issued this ruling, with which it disagrees, in support of its challenge on this ground.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent seeks to present such evidence by referring, first, to the short period of time of 15 days in which the majority of the Tribunal rejected the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures, one day after the Respondent\u2019s last submission in that regard,34 and secondly, by arguing that the majority of the Tribunal \"failed to consider the new evidence presented.\"35 In the context of the instant case, in which the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility had taken place in April 2010, and the Tribunal had indicated in a letter dated June 16, 2011, that the English text of the draft Decision had been ready for some time, and, moreover, in the context of an \"urgent\" request which by its nature requires prompt resolution, I do not see impropriety in the timing of the decision on the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures.\n\nProposal, para. 13.\n\nProposal, para. 14.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent presents its objections under Ground One as matters giving rise to \"objective loss of reliance upon the exercise of independent and impartial judgment by the majority of the members of the Tribunal who adopted the decisions that are questioned here, particularly in light of the limitations on Argentina\u2019s right of defence.\"36 However, I find that the arguments by the Respondent in relation to Ground One amount to an expression of dissatisfaction with the way in which the majority of the Tribunal decided to conduct the case.\n\nProposal, para. 18.\n\n83.\n\nAn arbitrator is not bound to make rulings which are mutually acceptable to both parties or which are neutral in their effects as against both of the parties. It is the arbitrator\u2019s function to make a decision between competing claims, based on his or her judgment. That function will necessarily entail rulings which are adverse to the party whose arguments are not accepted. It follows that a finding of an arbitrator\u2019s lack of independence or impartiality requires evidence other than the making of a decision which is considered to be adverse to one party or, indeed, wrong in law or insufficiently supported by reasons. To hold otherwise would be incompatible with any system of adjudication.\n\n84.\n\nThe \"facts\" on which the Respondent relies thus do not meet the standard required by Article 57 of the Convention. In other words, the Respondent\u2019s Proposal \"merely supposes the existence of what it must prove.\"37 It \"requires the creation of the very inferences that the common definition of the term \u2018manifest\u2019 does not in its ordinary meaning permit.\"38\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v. Pakistan,* Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator (Dec. 19, 2002), 8 ICSID Reports 398, 405.\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz (Mar. 19, 2010), para. 44.\n\n85.\n\nFor these reasons, the rejection of the urgent measures application does not give rise to any valid basis for disqualification of an arbitrator.\n\n**2. Ground Two: Alleged Limitations of the Respondent\u2019s Right of Defense**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe second basis of the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is the allegation that its \"right of defense\" has been limited by the Decision. The issue thus arises whether there has been a limitation of the Respondent\u2019s right of defense that could be deemed to meet the requirements of Article 57.\n\n87.\n\nThere are three aspects of the Respondent\u2019s claim under Ground Two. First, the Respondent points to the fact that the majority has decided to entertain the present mass claim, in which the Claimants initially numbered 180,000 and now number 60,000, and the manner in which it has determined that it will do so. Secondly, the Respondent objects to rulings by the majority on the relevance of certain issues and admissibility. The Respondent points out that there is some overlap between this objection and the issue of \"prejudgment\", which is considered below. Thirdly, the Respondent objects to the majority's finding that the Respondent had failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Claimants would not have consented to the arbitration had they known that they risked losing the right to litigate against third parties.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent's case is that it \"cannot be expected to rely upon the exercise of independent judgment of those who adopted such an egregious decision\"39 and that \"[s]uch arbitrary conduct on the part of the majority of the Tribunal cannot but contribute to the loss of confidence in its capacity to decide this dispute in an impartial fashion.\"40\n\nProposal, para. 39.\n\nProposal, para. 41.\n\n89.\n\nIn reply to the Respondent's objections towards the Decision, the Claimants submit that the Decision \"reflects a thorough and well-reasoned effort to account for the particular nature of the investments and alleged treaty violations at issue, and to balance the procedural and substantive rights of both parties.\"41 The Claimants submit that the Decision provides that while the Claimants' \"homogeneous\" claims might warrant general consideration as to certain issues, individual assessment would still be required as to others.42 They add that in the Decision, the majority of the Tribunal stated that it \"would next assess how best to implement such a framework, and would invite party submissions and possibly hold a hearing to address in particular which issues would require uniform, group, or individual treatment.\"43\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, para.16, citing Decision, paras. 490, 537, 543, 544 and 545.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, para.17, citing Decision, para. 669.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, para. 17, citing Decision, para. 670.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants submit, further, that following the issuance of the Decision, the Tribunal provided the Parties with an opportunity to comment on the procedures going forward, and the Respondent did not submit any comments in this regard.44 The Claimants argue that although the Dissent \"reaches divergent conclusions on the issue of Argentina's right of defense\", it \"does not provide any support for Argentina's claims of arbitrator partiality or lack of independent judgment.\"45 They argue, further, that \"a difference of opinion over an interpretation of a set of facts is not in and of itself evidence of lack of independence or impartiality,\" and an arbitrator may even \"be wrong on a point of law or wrong on a finding of fact but still be independent and impartial.\"46\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, para. 17; see also Claimants\u2019 Observations, p. 9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, p. 9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, p. 9.\n\n91.\n\nProfessor Tercier and Professor van den Berg refer to the fact that the mission of the Tribunal for the phase of the proceedings that resulted in the Decision concerned the resolution of the 11 issues set forth at paragraphs 127-130 of the Decision.47 They state that the Tribunal considered those 11 issues in the Decision, and other issues will be addressed in the next phases of the proceedings.48\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, p. 1.\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, pp. 1-2.\n\n92.\n\nI turn now to each of the three aspects of the Respondent's claim of limitation of its right of defense. Any such limitation, to come within Article 57 would have to amount to or evidence a *manifest* lack of independence. Article 57 imposes an objective standard and does not depend on the subjective belief of the challenging party; to hold otherwise would make the system of arbitration under ICSID unworkable. Disagreement with the majority's rulings is not a valid basis for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n93.\n\nIn relation to the first aspect, the \"mass claims aspect\", the Respondent contends that the majority's failure to require each claim to be dealt with individually at the jurisdiction stage and to allow the Respondent to defend each claim one by one indicates lack of independence and impartiality.\n\n94.\n\nIn my view, the Respondent's contention is not supported by the evidence. Those paragraphs cited by the Respondent in which the majority itself draws attention to limitations on the Respondent's procedural rights (paragraphs 536, 543) demonstrate that it was aware of such limitations and that it considered them justified in the circumstances and on the basis of the applicable law. At paragraphs 521-547, the Tribunal set out its legal reasoning in ruling on its competence to proceed with the collective claim. Indeed, several of the paragraphs cited by the Respondent (paragraphs 519, 536, 545) demonstrate that the majority was conscious of the need to balance the procedural rights of the Claimants and the Respondents and that it adopted an approach which it considered would do so. Significantly, at paragraph 545 of the Decision, the majority states: \"The measures that Argentina would need to take to face 60,000 proceedings would be a much bigger challenge to Argentina's effective defense rights than a mere limitation of its right to individual treatment of homogonous claims in the present proceedings.\"\n\n95.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing that neither the fact that the majority decided to uphold jurisdiction over the present collective claim nor the manner in which it decided to do so either suggest or establish a lack of independence or impartiality. Rather, the Respondent's complaint on this basis relates to its dissatisfaction with the substance of those rulings.\n\n96.\n\nIn relation to the second aspect, the \"jurisdiction/merits\" aspect, the Respondent's case is that it has been precluded from invoking specific defenses, both at the phase of the proceedings to which the Decision relates, and in the assessment of the merits and of any damages, to such an extent as to call into question the impartiality and independence of the majority. The Respondent refers to paragraphs 542 and 543 in support of its contention.\n\n97.\n\nThe context of paragraphs 542 and 543 of the Decision is the question at paragraph 541 \"whether Claimants have homogenous rights of compensation for a homogenous damage caused to them by potential homogenous breaches by Argentina of homogenous obligations provided for in the BIT\". The underlying question, set out at paragraph 540, is whether the Claimants' claims are sufficiently homogenous to justify the collective treatment of the 60,000 claims. In that context, at paragraph 542, the majority refers to its reasoning for considering certain claims against third parties to be irrelevant by a cross-reference to paragraphs 327-330 of the Decision. In the same context, at paragraph 543 of the Decision, the Tribunal finds that the potential damage is the same in nature. These rulings are said to breach the Respondent's procedural rights and to limit its right of defense in the remainder of the proceedings because they are said to preclude defenses raised by the Respondent in respect of the individual circumstances the Claimants.\n\n98.\n\nBearing those considerations in mind, I note that the Respondent's objections to paragraphs 542 and 543 of the Decision are based exclusively on the defects which it perceives in the reasoning and conclusions set out therein. As such, they are not directed at the qualities of the challenged arbitrators but at the correctness of the decision.\n\n99.\n\nI recall that under Article 57 of the Convention, the Respondent has the burden of establishing facts indicating a lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the Convention. An inference based on the supposition that a ruling must result from partiality by reason of its being perceived as legally or procedurally defective or adverse to the Respondent cannot suffice for this purpose. To find otherwise would require the application of a subjective, self-judging standard, rather than the objective one required under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, and the creation of the very inferences that the word \"manifest\" does not in its ordinary meaning permit. I do not consider that the objections raised in relation to paragraphs 542 and 543 of the Decision demonstrate any fact other than the Respondent's dissatisfaction with the reasoning set out therein.\n\n100.\n\nThe third and final aspect of the Respondent\u2019s objection under the ground of limitation of its right of defense relates to the finding at paragraph 460 that the Respondent had failed to demonstrate that the Claimants would not have consented to ICSID jurisdiction had they known that they risked losing potential claims against certain third parties.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent has not presented any evidence to suggest that the majority\u2019s finding at paragraph 460 is based on anything other than an impartial assessment of the evidence and arguments presented to the Tribunal. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal had \"already decided\" that the specific circumstances of each Claimant are irrelevant and thus prevented it from bringing arguments on this issue. However, that contention is not supported by any evidence. On the contrary, the finding set out at paragraph 460 relates to the Claimants\u2019 claims in their entirety, and the relevant conclusion at paragraph 465 is qualified by the words \"at this stage\". In any event, the Respondent\u2019s contention simply amounts to an expression of dissatisfaction with the content of the decision.\n\n102.\n\nAside from its dissatisfaction with the content of the Decision as set forth in detail above, the Respondent has not put forward any evidence that leads it to suppose that the majority lacked independence in reaching that decision, nor indeed has it put forward any arguments based on the qualities of the persons who made it, or the circumstances in which it was made. The Respondent argues that the decision was so \"egregious\" that it has lost confidence in the independence and impartiality of the majority. In this way, the Respondent seeks to infer that the majority reached the conclusions with which it disagrees because they lacked independence. Thus, in relation to the alleged limitation of its right of defense, the Respondent\u2019s Proposal \"merely supposes the existence of what it must prove.\"49 It \"requires the creation of the very inferences that the common definition of the term \u2018manifest\u2019 does not in its ordinary meaning permit.\"50\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v.

Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz (Mar. 19, 2010), para. 44.\n\n103.\n\nFor the above reasons, the alleged limit on the Respondent\u2019s right of defense does not give rise to any valid basis for disqualification of an arbitrator.\n\n**3. Ground Three: Prejudgment**\n--------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe third issue is whether the Proposal should be upheld on the basis that certain issues are \"prejudged\" by the Decision. The Respondent submits, in relation to Ground Three, that certain rulings of the majority in its Decision amount to a prejudgment of certain of the underlying facts pertaining to the merits, including the certain of the underlying facts, the nature of the Claimants\u2019 claims, and the validity of the instruments of consent submitted on the Claimants\u2019 behalf.51\n\nProposal, para. 42-55; Respondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 35-42.\n\n105.\n\nThe issues which are said to be prejudged by the Decision are (i) the characterization of the Respondent\u2019s actions in passing the legislation known as the Emergency Law of 2001 as a \"unilateral modification\" of its payment obligations, which is said to amount to a prejudgment on the merits of the dispute; (ii) certain issues pertaining to the expression of the Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration through the TFA Mandate Package; and (iii) the issue of whether the Claimants\u2019 claims are \"homogenous in nature\".\n\n106.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s submissions on this ground, the Claimants emphasize that in the Decision, \"[t]he treatment of factual issues is set forth \u2018to the extent it is not disputed between the Parties\u2019 and is \u2018not meant to be exhaustive, and simply aims to lay down the general context of the dispute, while focusing on aspects relevant to this jurisdictional phase.'\"52 Furthermore, \"[t]he Tribunal's \u2018task at the stage of determining whether it has jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in determining whether the facts alleged by the claimants, if established, are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.Whether Claimants' presentation of the facts is accurate will, if necessary, be examined during the merits stage of these proceedings.\"53 According to the Claimants, it follows from the foregoing that the Respondent's description of specific passages in the Decision as \"prejudgment\" is a mischaracterization.54\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, p. 8.\n\n107.\n\nIn their comments dated October 31, 2011, Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg state that the fact that they considered and decided on the 11 issues relating to jurisdiction and admissibility \"cannot be characterized as \u2018prejudgment'\" and does not relate to the exercise of independent judgment.55\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, p. 2.\n\n108.\n\nI turn now to each of the passages in the Tribunal's reasoning which are cited by the Respondent as specific instances of \"prejudgment\" indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the Convention. It is recalled that any such prejudging, to come within Article 57, would have to amount to or evidence a *manifest* lack of independence. This is to be determined by reference to an objective standard and does not depend on the subjective belief of the challenging party. It is recalled, further, that disagreement with the majority's rulings is not a valid basis for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(a) Alleged Instances of Prejudgment concerning the Emergency Law of 2005**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nParagraph 321 of the Decision states:\n\n*The Emergency Law had the effect of unilaterally modifying Argentina\u2019s payment obligations, whether arising from the concerned bonds or from other debts. Argentina does not contend that it had any contractual right of doing so, such as for example, a force majeure provision. Argentina has not invoked any contractual or legal provision excusing its non-performance of its contractual obligations towards Claimants. In fact, Argentina relies and justifies its non-performance based on its situation of insolvency, which has nothing to do with any specific contract.*\n\n110.\n\nParagraph 324 of the Decision states:\n\n*In other words, the present dispute does not derive from the mere fact that Argentina failed to perform its payment obligations under the bonds but from the fact that it intervened as a sovereign by virtue of its State power to modify its payment obligations towards its creditors in general, encompassing but not limited to the Claimants.*\n\n111.\n\nIn relation to paragraphs 321 and 324 of the Decision, the Respondent states that those paragraphs evidence the fact that \"[t]he challenged arbitrators have already decided that Argentina has unilaterally modified its contractual obligations by means of the Emergency Law, and further that Argentina has not invoked any contractual basis for doing so.\"56 The Respondent contends that \"[s]uch prejudgment on the merits, without having received or considered the evidence and the arguments on the merits, amounts to, under some extreme conceptions, already having condemned Argentina for the violation of [the Argentina-Italy BIT].\"57\n\nProposal, para. 43; See also Respondent\u2019s Observations, para. 35.\n\nProposal, paras. 43, 46.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is an \"established fact\" that is undisputed in these proceedings and in the public domain that Argentina \"defaulted on its sovereign debt payment obligations in December 2001 and that Argentina subsequently deconstructed the applicable legal framework and restructured its debt.\"58 According to the Claimants, \"[t]here simply is no question, and thus can be no prejudgment, as to the established fact that Argentina modified its payment obligations.\"59 The Claimants add that \"[w]hether such modification constitutes a violation of Argentina\u2019s [obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT] will be assessed and decided during the merits phase.\"60\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\n113.\n\nTo my mind, the question that arises in relation to these paragraphs is whether the majority of the Tribunal can, in these statements, properly be considered as having taken a position on the issue whether the Respondent\u2019s modification of its payment obligations was a violation of the Argentina-Italy BIT, as alleged in the Proposal,61 rather than on the question whether such modification was said by the Respondent to be effected pursuant to any \"contractual right.\"62 The question to which paragraphs 321 and 324 of the Decision relate is whether the Claimants\u2019 claims were treaty claims in nature.63 I find that, on the face of the Decision, the majority of the Tribunal was not taking a position on the issue of whether the Respondent\u2019s modification of its payment obligations was justified or not. In my view, therefore, the objections raised in the Proposal in relation to the characterization of the Respondent\u2019s modification of its payment obligations amount to a criticism of the legal effect of the relevant paragraphs for the Respondent in the next phase of the proceedings, which is said to be prejudicial to the Respondent. Such legal effect is in dispute between the Parties and does not fall to be determined in the present analysis; in any event, it is not connected with the independence and impartiality of the challenged arbitrators.\n\nProposal, para. 43.\n\nDecision, para. 321.\n\nDecision, paras. 316-326.\n\n**(b) Alleged Instances of Prejudgment concerning the Claimants\u2019 Consent to Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nParagraph 461 of the Decision states:\n\n*Of course, one could argue that some information of the TFA Mandate Package could have been better explained or should have been more comprehensive. However, one should also take into account that the present dispute is not a consumer dispute, although a number of the Claimants may have a consumer like profile. It is a dispute surrounding multi faceted financial investments. Thus, the degree and nature of the information provided did not need be of the same extent and nature than in the context of pure consumer transactions, and TFA was entitled to assume a certain level of sophistication and knowledge of the investors.*\n\n115.\n\nParagraph 463 of the Decision states:\n\n*In addition, even if the TFA Mandate Package did not contain sufficient information or did to some extent misrepresent certain information, such a flaw would have been cured by the subsequent events. Indeed, various associations started to assist Italian purchasers of Argentinean bonds by disseminating information on available legal means and even by supporting them in the revocation of the TFA Mandate Package, the tolling of the prescription period and/or the filing of legal claims against the banks. Thus, even if at the time of signature of the TFA Mandate Package, some of the Claimants did not have a full picture of what they were doing, they were able to get such a full picture afterwards through the various actions of associations, legal proceedings and news reports on the ongoing ICSID arbitration. Given that Claimants themselves do not invoke a lack of consent, it is sufficient that they were in a position to appreciate the scope of their commitment to ICSID arbitration, and it is irrelevant whether or not they eventually really understood such commitment.*\n\n116.\n\nParagraph 464 of the Decision states:\n\n*Thus, while the Tribunal does not take a position on TFA's representation scheme resembling a \"seduction operation,\" there is no indication that such operation was systematically fraudulent, coercive or otherwise caused Claimants to agree to ICSID arbitration based on an essential mistake.*\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the assertion, at paragraph 461 of the Decision, that the present dispute is not a consumer dispute has no basis in fact because \"all the evidence presented by the parties expressly indicates that the Claimants were precisely unsophisticated consumers.\"64 The Respondent also argues that the challenged arbitrators acknowledge their own contradictions in paragraph 463 of the Decision, which provides that \"various associations started to assist Italian purchasers of Argentinean bonds by disseminating information on available legal means.\"65\n\nProposal, at paras. 47-48.\n\nProposal, para. 48.\n\n118.\n\nIn relation to paragraph 463 of the Decision, the Respondent submits, further, that the Tribunal made \"a prejudgment that whether or not Claimants \u2018really\u2019 understood their commitment to ICSID arbitration is \u2018irrelevant.\u2019\"66\n\nProposal, para. 50.\n\n119.\n\nIn relation to paragraph 464 of the Decision, the Respondent submits that this conclusion is surprising in light of the submission of \"multiple evidence that seriously casts doubt on Claimants\u2019 consent.\"67 According to the Respondent, \"[s]uch conclusion, together with the assertion made in paragraph 466(ii) that this issue might not be examined (which evidences that in fact it has not been examined) and the finding in paragraph 486 (each individual Claimant \u2018is aware of and consented to the ICSID arbitration\u2019)\" is evidence of manifest prejudgment \"whose effect is to, objectively, cause a loss of confidence in the exercise of impartial and independent judgment.\"68\n\nProposal, para. 51.\n\nProposal, para. 51.\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that \"individual Claimant issues were beyond the scope of the first jurisdictional phase\" and thus \"the Tribunal properly preserved them for treatment at a later stage.\"69 The Claimants state that \"[i]n any event, the Tribunal expressly stated that its review of the Claimants\u2019 claims for jurisdictional purposes was governed by the applicable *prima facie* standard.\"70 According to the Claimants, \"[s]hould Argentina want to dispute the factual allegations, or should individualized Claimant assessments be deemed appropriate, there will be opportunities at a later stage.\"71 The Claimants maintain that the Respondent\u2019s presentation of the conclusions of the majority as \"prejudgments\" is a mischaracterization.72\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19, citing Decision, paras. 311, 315.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, p. 8.\n\n121.\n\nI consider that the objections raised by the Respondent in respect of paragraph 461 of the Decision are that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment does not accord with the evidence in the case and that it is inconsistent with the finding at paragraph 463. Similarly, the Respondent\u2019s objection in respect of paragraph 463 of the Decision amounts to disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the relevance of individual Claimants, and disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the legal effect of subsequent events in \"curing\" relevant flaws in the TFA Mandate Package. Finally, and again, the Respondent\u2019s objection to paragraph 464 of the Decision is leveled at the analysis of the evidence and the conclusion drawn from that analysis by the majority. Such analysis relates to the issues that are in dispute between the Parties in the present proceedings and it is not appropriate to seek to resolve such issues in the present recommendation. In any event, I find that the issues raised by the Respondent here do not relate to the independence and impartiality of the challenged arbitrators.\n\n**(c) Alleged Instances of Prejudgment concerning the Nature of the Claimants\u2019 Claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nAt paragraphs 541, 544 and 545 of the Decision, the majority of the Tribunal states that the Claimants\u2019 claims and investments were \"homogeneous.\"\n\n123.\n\nAt paragraph 543 of the Decision, the majority of the Tribunal states that \"[t]he legislation and regulations promulgated and implemented by Argentina, together with the implementation of its Exchange Offer 2005, affected all Claimants in the same way. Thus, the potential damage caused to Claimants is, by nature the same for all Claimants [...].\"\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the description of the Claimants\u2019 claims as \"homogenous\" at paragraphs 541, 544 and 545 of the Decision constitutes a prejudgment as \"no claim has been discussed in a proper and individual manner.\"73 According to the Respondent, at paragraph 543 of the Decision, the challenged arbitrators prejudged \"the manner in which the Exchange Offer affected each Claimant.\"74\n\nProposal, paras. 52-54.\n\nProposal, para. 55.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the ruling that the Claimants\u2019 claims are homogeneous prior to an individual assessment does not constitute a prejudgment.75 The Claimants note that the Tribunal\u2019s \"review of Claimants\u2019 claims for jurisdictional purposes was governed by the applicable *prima facie* standard\", and further submit that \"[t]o the extent that Claimants each invested in Argentine bonds and held them at the time of Argentina\u2019s default and subsequent actions, their claims arise from the same acts and circumstances, and raise the same alleged violations of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\"76\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 19.\n\n126.\n\nI consider that the Respondent\u2019s objections in relation to paragraphs 541, 543-545, and 665 of the Decision are concerned with the Respondent\u2019s dissatisfaction at the fact that the Tribunal declined to analyze each claim individually. Similarly, the Respondent\u2019s objection to paragraph 543 of the Decision is a criticism of the effect of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion. In my view, such criticisms amount to disagreement with the way that the majority determined was appropriate to proceed with the conduct of the proceedings, and its analysis of the evidence in support of its findings.\n\n127.\n\nIt can thus be seen that each of the Respondent\u2019s specific objections on this ground are based on its characterization of specific statements as \"prejudgment\", which in turn is based on the contention that they lack merit, or in other words, on the Respondent\u2019s evaluation of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, or of the underlying facts, or of the consequences in the next phase of the proceedings. Each of the specific instances of alleged prejudgments amounts, in effect, to a substantive criticism of the basis or of the effect of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions. Each of those objections is thus aimed at the substance of the Decision. This is not a valid basis for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent has not presented evidence of any objective fact that would suggest that the Tribunal\u2019s findings were based on anything other than its analysis of the available materials. On the contrary, the face of the record indicates that the majority did exercise its judgment in relation to the Parties' submissions and the available evidence.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent has not pointed to any fact other than the defects that it perceives in the majority's findings of fact and its rulings on the law, as set forth in the Decision. The Respondent has not provided any evidence of any such fact, nor has it pleaded any facts relating to the qualities of the challenged arbitrators. The Respondent seeks to draw an inference of lack of independence from the assertion that the Tribunal could only have reached such a ruling if it lacked independence. However, Article 57 requires proof of the existence of facts giving rise to the inference of lack of independence. A mere assertion or speculation is not sufficient.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg, in their comments in the context of the present disqualification proceedings, should have provided an explanation of why their decision entailed no prejudgment whatsoever.77 However, the burden of proof is on the party making the allegation of a failure to meet the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the Convention. In the absence of some objective fact, such as a connection or relationship with one party, indicating a predisposition towards that party, it is not for the challenged arbitrator to provide positive proof of his or her independence and impartiality.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 42.\n\n131.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent has not provided evidence of any \"prejudgment\" by the challenged arbitrators such as would indicate a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n**4. Ground Four: Issuance of the Majority Decision without the Dissent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe fourth and final ground on which the Proposal for Disqualification is based is the fact that the majority communicated the decision without the Dissenting Opinion.\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"[t]he decision to transmit the majority award only, without the dissenting opinion, relates to the issue of failure to exercise independent judgment... as such decision benefitted Claimants but prejudiced the Argentine Republic.\"78 The Respondent also argues that the Tribunal manifestly lacked independence because it did \"exactly what the Claimants asked it to do\" in their letter of July 21, 2011. Finally, the Respondent points to the role of dissenting opinions in due process, and argues that there has been a violation of due process in this case, on the grounds that the failure to wait for the dissenting opinion indicates that there was a lack of proper deliberation by the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 26.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent makes the distinction that the issue of whether the Tribunal had authority to issue a majority decision is not in issue: \"The Tribunal may adopt a majority decision and this power has not been questioned by Argentina. What the majority should not have done is transmit the determination to the parties without even waiting for the dissenting opinion of the other member of the Tribunal. This situation was expressly objected to by Arbitrator Abi-Saab.\"79\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 29.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the absence of a dissenting opinion does not indicate an absence of proper tribunal deliberation.80 In support of their argument, the Claimants note that the hearing on jurisdiction was held in April 2010 and thus the Tribunal had a period of 16 months in which to deliberate.81 They contend that the Tribunal's correspondence with the parties confirm that all members were involved in the deliberative process and the process was delayed due to Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s health concerns.82 They further contend that \"[t]he Dissent makes no mention of any purported issue with the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations.\"83\n\nClaimants' Reply, pp. 8-9.\n\nClaimants' Reply, pp. 8.\n\nClaimants' Reply, pp. 8-9.\n\nClaimants' Observations, p. 6.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that in any event, the timing of the communication of the Dissenting Opinion (i) nearly three months after the Decision, (ii) more than four months after the Tribunal indicated that a draft Decision had been ready for some time, and (iii) nearly 19 months since the conclusion of the hearing, lends further support to the majority\u2019s determination to issue the Decision when it did.84 The Claimants submit that, given the fact that they have been \"prejudiced by repeated delays throughout these proceedings\" and \"the Dissent could not alter the outcome\", \"there was no reason to further delay the Decision and the proceedings to wait for the Dissent.\"85 They add that the record demonstrates that the challenged arbitrators waited more than one month before issuing the Decision.86\n\nClaimants' Observations, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Observations, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Observations, p. 6.\n\n137.\n\nIn their comments dated October 31, 2011, Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg maintain that they decided to issue the Decision after the issues had been \"fully deliberated\" and mindful of the principle that arbitration should take place expeditiously.87 They add that they are not aware of any \"legal requirement that a decision must be issued simultaneously with a dissenting opinion\", and thus their determination does not implicate their independent judgment.88\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, p. 2.\n\nJoint letter of Professor Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg dated October 31, 2011, p. 2.\n\n138.\n\nThe issue that thus arises is whether the decision of the majority to communicate its Decision to the Parties without the Dissenting Opinion is a fact indicating a \"manifest\" lack of independence.\n\n139.\n\nI note that the Respondent has presented arguments on the function of dissenting opinions generally as an instrument of due process. Whatever view one might take with respect to such arguments, I consider that these are outside the scope of the present analysis since they pertain directly to the correctness of the majority\u2019s rulings (i) that it was competent to issue the Decision without the Dissenting Opinion and (ii) that it was appropriate to do so in the circumstances. Such arguments thus amount to a statement of dissatisfaction with those rulings. I recall that under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent is required to prove that its proposal is supported by objective fact, and that an allegation that a decision was wrong in law or susceptible of reversal does not suffice for that purpose.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent has sought to present evidence in order to discharge the burden of proof under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. However, almost all of the documents relied on by the Respondent as evidence, including the legal submissions and the evidence presented by the Parties; procedural orders issued by the Tribunal; the Decision; and the Dissenting Opinion, are submitted as support for the Respondent\u2019s legal analysis in relation to its disagreement with the rulings of decision of the challenged arbitrators to issue the Decision in the circumstances. There are two documents relied upon by the Respondent which in my view could be considered as exceptions in that regard.\n\n141.\n\nFirst the Respondent refers to a letter from the Claimants dated July 20, 2011. It states that the Tribunal did \"exactly what Claimants had asked them to\"89 in that letter, demonstrating a manifest lack of independent judgment. Secondly, the Respondent relies on the Letter dated August 4, 2011,90 as evidence of the fact that the majority communicated the Decision without the consent of the dissenting arbitrator and \"without even waiting for a draft of said opinion\".91 The Respondent states that this is evidence of arbitrary and \"absolutely inappropriate\"92 conduct by the majority.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 26.\n\nProposal, paras. 13, 19.\n\nProposal, para. 19.\n\nProposal, para. 20.\n\n142.\n\nI turn first to the Claimants' letter dated July 20, 2011.93 This is a letter addressed to the Tribunal and copied to the Respondent. It requests the Tribunal to proceed immediately to issue a decision, \"even if by only a majority.\" I will return to this letter below.94 First, in order to understand such request in its context, I have reviewed the correspondence exchanged prior to July 20, 2011, to which the Parties refer in their submissions.\n\nClaimants' letter dated July 20, 2011.\n\nSee below, para. 146.\n\n143.\n\nBy letter dated February 11, 2011, the President of the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The Tribunal hereby would like to inform the Parties that \u2013 since the hearing of April 2010 \u2013 it has made substantial progress in the decision making and drafting of its conclusions on jurisdiction. However, it is not yet in a position to render its findings and it is difficult to estimate any specific time for doing so. Nevertheless, the Tribunal would like to reassure the parties that all the members of the Tribunal are actively and constructively cooperating in view of rendering its conclusions as soon as possible.*\n\n144.\n\nBy letter dated May 25, 2011, the Claimants referred to the above letter dated February 11, 2011, and requested that the Tribunal \"proceed to a prompt conclusion of its deliberations and issuance of the decision on jurisdiction\". In support of that request, the Claimants pointed to the time that had elapsed in the proceedings to date and stated that many of the Claimants were past retirement age or had died in the interim.\n\n145.\n\nBy letter dated June 16, 2011, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal has deliberated several times [after the Hearing on Jurisdiction]. \u2026. The English text of the draft of the Award/Decision has been ready for some time. Recently, one of the arbitrators expressed his intention to dissent with respect to the resolution of the issues contained in the List of 11 Issues as addressed in the draft of the Award/Decision. Every effort will be made to issue the Award/Decision as soon as possible.*\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants' letter dated July 20, 2011, is a response to the above letter dated June 16, 2011. It begins by noting that \"more than a month has passed\" since the letter informing the Parties that the text of the Decision had been ready for some time. In addition to setting out the reasons why the Claimants considered that the Tribunal could and should issue a decision by majority while the dissent was in progress, the letter states that \"[b]oth Parties have emphasized the importance of a prompt decision.\" It then requests that the Tribunal \"issue its ruling immediately \u2013 even if by only a majority.\"\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent then submitted its Urgent Request for Provisional Measures on July 21, 2011.\n\n148.\n\nBy e-mail dated July 27, 2011, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties, in response to the Claimants' letter dated July 20, 2011, that \"the Tribunal is conscious of the importance of an expedited and efficient administration of the arbitration proceeding and of the parties' shared desire to promptly receive the Tribunal's findings on the eleven preliminary jurisdictional issues. The Tribunal intends to convey these findings imminently.\"\n\n149.\n\nI have not been directed to any objection by the Respondent to this message or to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated July 20, 2011. However, the Respondent did have the opportunity to present its views on how the Tribunal should proceed, and it did so. On August 3, 2011, in its final submission on the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal either (i) resolve immediately to decide on the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures prior to the adoption of its decision on jurisdiction or (ii) inform the Parties forthwith that its decision on the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures would not be adopted before its decision on jurisdiction.\n\n150.\n\nIt would be reasonable to suppose that, had the Respondent wished to raise an objection to the Tribunal proceeding to issue a Decision while a dissent was in progress, it would have done so at the latest following the e-mail dated July 27, 2011, which confirmed that a decision would be issued imminently, on the express basis that the Tribunal understood that the Parties\u2019 desire for prompt resolution was \"shared\". The Respondent did have the opportunity, after July 20, 2011, to present its comments on the way in which the Tribunal should proceed, but did not offer any comments on the question of whether a decision ought to be issued while a dissent was in progress. It was only in its Proposal, after the content of the majority decision was made known to the Parties, and, in its own words, after the Respondent had had the opportunity for \"thorough analysis\"95 of that Decision, that the Respondent raised an objection to the issuing of a majority decision without the dissent.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 9.\n\n151.\n\nI turn, secondly, to the Letter dated August 4, 2011, which is reproduced in full above.96 For convenience, the paragraph concerning the Dissenting Opinion is reproduced here:\n\n*Having fully deliberated the issues but having not received the written text of the Dissenting Opinion to date, the majority of the members of the Tribunal does not see a justification to delay any longer the notification of the Decision to the Parties, also in light of Respondent\u2019s recent request mentioned below. Professor Georges Abi-Saab wishes to record his disagreement with the notification of the Decision today without his Dissenting Opinion. If and when the Dissenting Opinion is received and translated into Spanish, it will be communicated to the Parties.*\n\nSee above, para. 77.\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent submits, with reference to the above passage, that impartiality \"requires a reasonable consideration of the different arguments - not only those of the parties but also those of the arbitrators. Such consideration was precluded by the challenged arbitrators\u2019 failure to await the dissenting arbitrator\u2019s opinion.\"97 It concludes that the conduct of the challenged arbitrators, as evidenced by the Letter dated August 4, 2011, \"manifestly precludes their impartiality.\"98 The Respondent argues, further, that it was arbitrary for the challenged arbitrators to point to the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures as a reason for issuing the Decision \"without waiting for a draft of the Dissenting Opinion.\"99\n\nProposal, para. 24.\n\nProposal, para. 24.\n\nProposal, para. 21.\n\n153.\n\nIn the Letter dated August 4, 2011, the challenged arbitrators state their reasons both for rejecting the Urgent Request for Provisional Measures and for issuing the Decision without waiting for the Dissenting Opinion. They noted that the issues had been \"fully deliberated\" and concluded that there was no justification in waiting any longer. In the absence of objective evidence that such conclusion was tainted by a predisposition towards the Claimants, rather than an objective assessment of the Parties\u2019 arguments in all the circumstances, I do not see any reason to find that the issues were not fully deliberated within the Tribunal. In the circumstances, I do not consider that the Letter dated August 4, 2011, indicates a lack of impartiality.\n\n154.\n\nIn sum, and leaving aside the arguments presented by the Respondent in terms of the requirements of due process, which are directed at the legal correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling and as such are not sufficient to establish a valid basis for disqualification under Article 57, I do not find that there is any evidence to support the suggestion that the majority demonstrated partiality by issuing the Decision without waiting for the Dissenting Opinion.\n\n155.\n\nIn conclusion, the communication of the Decision to the Parties prior to the communication of the Dissenting Opinion does not give rise to any valid basis for disqualification.\n\n**F. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n156.\n\nIt follows from the legal principles set out at paragraphs 63 to 65 of this Recommendation that a proposal for disqualification that is based *only* on an inference drawn from the substance of rulings which are said to be so unjust to the challenging party that they can only have resulted from a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the arbitrators in question, without evidence of any objective fact in support of such inference, but supported only by arguments directed at the supposed injustice of the rulings in question, does not meet the standard required by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n157.\n\nI consider that the Respondent\u2019s submissions in support of the Proposal are based on its legal arguments directed at the substance of the rulings of the challenged arbitrators. They are thus based on the Respondent\u2019s subjective perception of the challenged arbitrators. The Respondent has offered no objective evidence demonstrating that the challenged arbitrators had regard to anything other than their independent and impartial assessment of the Parties\u2019 arguments in making any of the rulings to which the four grounds of the Proposal relates, whether those four grounds are considered individually or as a whole, nor has it offered evidence of any other objective fact from which it would be reasonable to infer a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n158.\n\nIn the circumstances, I conclude that the Respondent has not discharged the burden of proving that either Professor Tercier or Professor van den Berg manifestly lacks any of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in relation to any of the four grounds on which the Proposal is based.\n\n**G. Recommendation**\n---------------------\n\n159.\n\nIt is for the foregoing reasons that I recommend that the proposal to disqualify Professor Tercier and Professor van den Berg be rejected."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2011-12-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nOn September 15, 2011, the Argentine Republic, Respondent in the above case, submitted a *Request for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg* (the Request).\n\n[2].\n\nThe Request was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Pursuant to Article 57, a party may propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1).\n\n[3].\n\nPursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, it falls upon the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide the Request.\n\n[4].\n\nBy letter of October 28, 2011, the parties were informed of my decision to seek a recommendation on the Request from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. By same letter, the parties were reminded that this request was exceptional, that it should not be construed as a basis for any future similar request, and that the final decision on the Request would remain with the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n[5].\n\nThe parties have been given a full opportunity to present their positions on this matter and the Centre provided the Permanent Court of Arbitration with copies of all communications submitted by the parties following the filing of the Request and of the explanations furnished by the arbitrators whose disqualification is proposed.\n\n[6].\n\nThe recommendation from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration was received by ICSID on December 19, 2011. A copy of the recommendation is attached.\n\n[7].\n\nI have carefully considered the Request, in light of the parties\u2019 written arguments, the arbitrators\u2019 explanations, and the recommendation from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Based on the materials submitted, I have reached the conclusion that the Argentine Republic\u2019s *Request for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg* of September 15, 2011 does not meet the standard set forth in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention for the disqualification of an arbitrator.\n\n[8].\n\nAccordingly the Argentine Republic\u2019s *Request for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg* is hereby rejected."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 11 (Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 11 (Provisional Measures)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**IN VIEW OF THE FOLLOWING**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 July 2011, Respondent filed an *'Urgent Request for Provisional Measures of the Argentine Republic* (hereinafter \u201cRequest\u201d), in which it requested as provisional measures that:\n\n*\u201ca) A hearing be scheduled urgently so that Orianna Pilastro and Antonio Pilastro may testify before the Tribunal, regarding the event described herein [reference omitted], in addition to any other claimant that the Tribunal may designate.

In the same vein, the majority of the Tribunal is of the opinion that there is no convincing reason why Respondent\u2019s Request should be dealt with prior to the issuance of the Decision. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal rejects the Request, Professor Abi-Saab dissenting.*\n\n*The matters raised in the Request, however, may be discussed for scheduling and other purposes at the case management conference that will be organized at the earliest convenience of the Parties and the members of the Tribunal for the purposes of the further conduct of the proceedings.*\n\n*[...]\"*\n\n5.\n\nIn their letter of 2 March 2012, Claimants\u2019 re-addressed the issue of the Request and fded following conclusions and counter-requests:\n\n*\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in their 15 September 2011 submission, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal issue an order as follows:*\n\n\u25a0 [...]\n\n*\u25a0 The Tribunal affirms its rejection of Respondent's July 2011 request for provisional measures, with prejudice, and awards Claimants all costs and fees incurred in responding to the provisional measures request.*\n\n*\u25a0 Respondent is ordered to provide Claimants access to Respondent\u2019s database and any other data compiled regarding individual Claimants tendering into the 2010 Exchange Offer.*\n\n*\u25a0 Respondent is ordered to provide an accounting of its involvement in criminal proceedings in Italy against individual Claimants, including Respondent\u2019s use of confidential Claimant documents in connection with such proceedings. Claimants whose confidential personal information has been used in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s confidentiality\u2019 order and EU personal data laws shall be compensated for anv costs, damages, and losses as a result of Respondent's illegal acts.*\n\n*\u25a0 The Tribunal affirms, and again orders Respondent to comply with, the Tribunal\u2019s orders regarding (i) confidentiality: (ii) impermissibility of selectively producing non-public documents: and (iii) procedures for the submission of documents.*\n\n6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letters of 20 January 2012, 10 February 2012 and 9 March 2012 do not contain any mention or reference to its Request.\n\n7.\n\nAt the meeting of 9 May 2012 (hereinafter the \u201cMeeting\"), and according to the Provisional Agenda of 24 April 2012, the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal addressed again Respondent\u2019s Request and heard the Parties\u2019 respective positions (see transcripts English version p. 148 1. 11 to p. 176 1. 17; transcripts Spanish version p. 150 1. 8 to p. 179 1. 18). Both Parties confirmed their previous positions:\n\n\u2022 Respondent confirmed that its request was still of interest and, therefore, maintained (see transcripts English version p. 150 1. 5-7 and p. 155 1. 7-8; transcripts Spanish version p. 151 1. 22 to p. 152 1. 2 and p. 157 1. 9-10), and in particular that *\"the Tribunal rule favorably on the Provisional Measures, on the request for the Provisional Measures [...], that the persons indicated therein be called to testify - in particular Ms. Pilastro\u2014that both Parties be invited to do so [...]\u201d*\n\n\u2022 Claimants confirmed its previous requests as follows (see Claimants\u2019 Power Point Presentation, p. 94; see also transcripts English version p. 175 1. 19 to p. 176 1. 17; transcripts Spanish version p. 178 1. 17 to p. 179 1. 18):\n\n*\" Summary of Request for Relief*\n\n*\u25a0 Reject (again) Respondent\u2019s provisional measures request*\n\n*\u25a0 Disregard and strike all Italian proceeding documents*\n\n*\u25a0 Order Respondent to account for its involvement in any Italian proceedings against Claimants, including Respondent\u2019s abuse of confidential documents*\n\n*\u25a0 Award Claimants costs and fees.*\n\n**CONSIDERING THAT**\n--------------------\n\n8.\n\nWhereas Respondent has in its letters of 20 January 2012, 10 February 2012 and 9 March 2012 (see above paras 5 and 6) not provided any further comment regarding its Request or Claimants\u2019 counter-requests, it has substantiated its Request during the Meeting as follows (transcripts English version p. 149 1. 8 - p. 156 1; 2; transcripts Spanish version p. 150 1. 22 to p. 158 1. 3):\n\n\u2022 The circumstances surrounding the signature of the relevant documents by Ms. Orianna Pilastro and Mr. Antonio Pilastro indicate that there was no true intention of the Pilastros to begin ICSID arbitration and that, in particular, Ms. Orianna Pilastro was fraudulently induced in signing documents for herself and on behalf of her brother and father; it would further appear that the signature on the revocation of the Mandate concerning Ms. Orianna Pilastro in December 2012 is not Ms. Orianna Pilastro\u2019s signature;\n\n\u2022 These circumstances are \u201cextremely serious\u201d and if fraud was confirmed, this case could not go forward; in particular, it would not be sufficient to simply remove the Claimants whose signatures are at stake, instead the whole proceedings would need to stop;\n\n\u2022 Therefore, there is a clear need to clarify these circumstances and for that purpose examine Ms. Orianna Pilastro.\n\nThese arguments concern the first part of Respondent\u2019s Request (see above para 1). and Respondent has not provided further comments regarding the second and third part of its Requests, i.e. its request to order Claimants not to alter or destroy documents (except that Respondent has confirmed being opposed to any destruction, see transcripts English version p. 200 1. 3-4; transcripts Spanish version p. 203 1.16-20) and to request ICSID Secretan--General to provide a special report.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 position is that further to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s ruling of 4 August 2011 (see above para 4), the Decision and Claimants\u2019 29 July 2011 letter (see above para 2), the matter deserves no further attention and denial of the requested relief remains appropriate (Claimants\u2019 letter of 15 September 2011, p. 16). In addition, Claimants contend that the Request does not articulate, let alone meet, applicable standards (i.e. urgency, irreparable harm, necessity to preserve rights, burden of proof), and is moot because the only evidence submitted relate to members of the Pilastro family, all of whom withdrew from the proceedings over 15 months ago (see para 649(v) of the Decision).\n\n10.\n\nIn particular, Claimants made the following arguments: *(i)* there would be no urgency and to the extent that any of the issues raised still exists, it may be addressed in the course of the individualized review process, *(ii)* there would be no irreparable harm, since Respondent would actually have no right to examine non-witnesses and there would, in any case, be no risk to documents, *(iii)* there would be no necessity to preserve rights, because Respondent\u2019s right to defence would not be jeopardized if the provisional measures were not granted, because individual Claimants consent documents - with respect to existing Claimants - may be subject to review and authentication during the upcoming individual review process, and *(iv)* Respondent would have failed to meet the burden of proof considering that it has not in any way substantiated or articulated its request and that the kind of measures requested by Respondent are extremely rarely granted. Further, Claimants contend that they demonstrated that each of the allegedly fraudulent Claimant family signatures was in fact nothing other than one family members signing on behalf of another, an ordinary and everyday occurrence in life (Claimants\u2019 letter of 15 September 2011, p. 16; Claimants\u2019 letter of 2 March 2012, p. 15; Power Point Presentation at Meeting of 9 May 2012, pp. 72-92; transcripts English version p. 158 1. 5 to p. 176 1. 17; transcripts Spanish version p. 1601. 11 to p. 179 1. 18).\n\n**CONSIDERING FURTHER THAT**\n----------------------------\n\n**(1) With regard to Respondent\u2019s Request for Examination of Orianna and Antonio Pilastro:**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\u201ca) A hearing be scheduled urgently so that Orianna Pilastro and Antonio Pilastro may testify before the Tribunal, regarding the event described herein [reference omitted], in addition to any other claimant that the Tribunal may designate.* \u201c (see above para 1)\n\n11.\n\nAlthough Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not provide for specific requirements for issuing a recommendation of provisional measures and leaves this largely within the margin of appreciation of the arbitral tribunal, a wide consensus has emerged in practice according to which a recommendation for provisional measures would usually require that following conditions be met: *(i)* urgency of the requested measures, *(ii)* the risk of irreparable harm or serious prejudice in case the measures are not granted, *(iii)* the necessity of the measures in order to preserve the right at risk.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 4 August 2012 sent to the Parties together with its Decision (see above para 4). the Arbitral Tribunal previously rejected Respondent\u2019s Request due to a lack of urgency.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the Meeting, Respondent has reiterated its Request.\n\n14.\n\nHowever, Respondent has not convincingly substantiated to what extent this Request would now fulfill the requirement of urgency and, thus, fails to meet the applicable standard.\n\n15.\n\nIn addition, whether the consent of some of the Claimants may have been obtained based on fraud is part of the questions which the Parties will be given the opportunity to address during the next phase.\n\n**(2) With regard to Respondent\u2019s Request for Protection of Documents:**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\u201cb) Claimants be ordered to refrain from altering or destroying any document, including but not limited to, the original powers of attorney and mandates that were allegedly granted to TFA and counsel by Claimants.*\u201d (see above para 1)\n\n16.\n\nNothing in the record suggests that Claimants have the intention to destroy or otherwise alter any document, in particular original powers of attorney and mandates.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, regarding those claimants which have allegedly withdrawn from the present proceedings, Claimants have stated that they would consider it most appropriate to delete the information in the Database and destroy documents relating to such claimants, and have actually requested the right to do so (transcripts English version p. 191 1. 5- 11; p. 194 1. 3-9; transcripts Spanish version p. 194 1. 3-9).\n\n18.\n\nRespondent has raised various concerns regarding the reliability of the Database and objected to Claimants' handling of the information contained therein (see e.g. R-R-MJ para 189 and CREMIEUX paras 45-55; R-PHB paras 89, 118, 499). In this respect, the Tribunal cannot rule out that the concerned information and documents may be of importance to Respondent\u2019s rights of defense.\n\n19.\n\nGiven the immediate commencement of the next phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal considers that the *'Urgent Request for Provisional Measures of the Argentine Republic'* fulfills the requirement of urgency at this stage of the proceedings concerning the protection of Claimants\u2019 documents, it being understood that the conditions on confidentiality, in particular as contained in the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3, continue to apply and that the information contained in the documents at stake falls under the applicable privacy obligation.\n\n20.\n\nFurthermore, in application with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3), the Tribunal can make use of its discretion in recommending measures other than those specified in the Respondent's Request for protection of documents. Therefore, even if urgency were not at stake, the Tribunal finds that it can recommend provisional measures for the preservation of Respondent\u2019s rights of defense.\n\n21.\n\nConsequently, in view of preserving Respondent's rights of defense and ensuring the integrity of the proceedings, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recommend that Claimants refrain from deleting and/or destroying any information and/or documents relating to Claimants having allegedly withdrawn from the proceedings, until further order from the Tribunal.\n\n**(3) With regard to Respondent\u2019s Request for a Special Report from ICSID:**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\u201cc) the ICSID\u2019s Secretary-General be urgently requested to issue a report on the method it applied to verify the authenticity of the documentation submitted together with the Request for Arbitration dated 14 September 2006. \u201c* (see above para 1)\n\n22.\n\nThe first question that arises is whether or not it is within the powers of the Tribunal to formally request the ICSID Secretary-General to establish a special report as the one requested. The second question is whether the issues touched upon by the report belong to the scope of competence of ICSID. These two questions appear to be intertwined.\n\n23.\n\nArticle 36(3) of the ICSID Convention provides: *\"The Secretary-General shall register the request* [for arbitration] *unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of the registration or refusal to register.\"*\n\n24.\n\nThe Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention of 18 March 1965 explains the Secretary-General's screening power as follows:\n\n*\u201c20. The Convention requires the Secretary-General to perform a variety of administrative functions as legal representative, registrar and principal officer of the Centre (Articles 7(1), 11, 16(3), 25(4), 28, 36, 49(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(2), 59, 60(1), 63(b) and 65). In addition, the Secretary-General is given the power to refuse registration of a request for conciliation proceedings or arbitration proceedings, and thereby to prevent the institution of such proceedings, if on the basis of the information furnished by the applicant he finds that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre (Article 28(3) and 36(3)). The Secretary-General is given this limited power to \"screen\" requests for conciliation or arbitration proceedings with a view to avoiding the embarrassment to a party (particularly a State) which might result from the institution of proceedings against it in a dispute which it had not consented to submit to the Centre, as well as the possibility that the machinery of the Centre would be set in motion in cases which for other reasons were obviously outside the jurisdiction of the Centre e.g., because either the applicant or the other party\u2019* was *not eligible to be a party in proceedings under the Convention.\u201d*\n\n25.\n\nThe screening process carried out by the Secretary-General under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention is, therefore, of a purely administrative nature, and it is conducted principally for the purposes of avoiding unnecessary use of the Centre\u2019s resources. Further, this screening process concerns only the request for arbitration and is, therefore, conducted at an early stage.\n\n26.\n\nThe powers of ICSID are in this respect very limited and. except where the circumstances lead the ICSID Secretary -General to refuse registration of a case, the verification by ICSID of the request for arbitration could under no circumstances lead to a decision affecting in any way a future decision on jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, the screening tasks of the Secretary -General and the task of the arbitral tribunal to examine the jurisdictional conditions are two separate and independent tasks. Neither one is accountable to the other as to how its own task is conducted.\n\n27.\n\nFurthermore, questions relating to the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence are to be resolved by the Tribunal after a request for arbitration has been registered. This basic principle follows, *inter alia,* from Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[a]ny *objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal.\"*\n\n28.\n\nA verification of the authenticity\u2019 of the documentation submitted together with a request of arbitration is therefore a matter within the powers of an Arbitral Tribunal and does not form part of the administrative functions that the Secretary-General is required to fulfill.\n\n29.\n\n**Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the ICSID Framework does not provide for any basis either (i) enabling the Tribunal to request such a report from the ICSID Secretary-General; or (ii) entrusting the ICSID Secretary-General with the power to issue such report.**\n\n**(4) With regard to Claimants\u2019 Requests Relating to Confidentiality:**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\u201c\u25a0 Respondent is ordered to provide an accounting of its involvement in criminal proceedings in Italy against individual Claimants, including Respondent's use of confidential Claimant documents in connection with such proceedings. Claimants whose confidential personal information has been used in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s confidentiality order and EU personal data laws shall be compensated for any costs, damages, and losses as a result of Respondent\u2019s illegal acts.*\n\n*\u25a0 The Tribunal affirms, and again orders Respondent to comply with, the Tribunal\u2019s orders regarding (i) confidentiality; (ii) impermissibility of selectively producing non-public documents; and (iii) procedures for the submission of documents.*\u201c(see above para 5 and 7)\n\nand\n\n*\"- Reject Respondent\u2019s selectively submitted evidence from the Italian proceeding as inadmissible.* \u201c(see above paras 2 and 7)\n\n30.\n\nIn connection with Claimants\u2019 Request, as well as with regard to proceedings initiated before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York (hereinafter the \u201cBarboni case\u201d), a question has arisen concerning the interpretation of Procedural Order No. 3 on Confidentiality, and in particular whether the prohibition contemplated in Procedural Order No. 3 to disclose information relating to individual Claimants to unauthorized parties extends also to information concerning Claimants who have withdrawn from, and are, therefore, not anymore Parties to the present proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3 on Confidentiality of 27 January 2010, two points are to be made:\n\n(i) It is clear that Procedural Order No. 3 and the obligation of confidentiality contemplated thereunder remains in force until the end of the proceedings. Consequently, both Parties remain bound thereby.\n\n(ii) The issues at present raise the question of the scope of the duty of confidentiality contemplated in Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n32.\n\n**With regard to whether or not the information requested in the Barboni case is covered by the duty of confidentiality contemplated by Procedural Order No. 3,** para 132 thereof provides that Respondent shall use the information contained in the Database (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) solely for purposes of conducting this arbitration. *A contrario,* this means that Respondent is not entitled to use the Confidential Information for other purposes. The restriction is clear and applies systematically to all the information in the Database, therefore, also to information relating to Claimants currently listed therein as well as Claimants, who may since then have already withdrawn from the proceedings. The mere fact that a Claimant was at some point listed in the Database makes any information relating to this Claimant protected and subject to the protection provided by Procedural Order No. 3. Consequently, Respondent is not entitled to disclose any information contained in the Database and relating to former Claimants.\n\n33.\n\n**With regard to the impermissibility of documents relating to different proceedings,** the Tribunal considered that *\"it cannot simply apply its own standard to other arbitration proceedings and assume confidentiality\"* (para 139 of Procedural Order No. 3) and that *\"in order to decide on the admissibility of these documents, it is necessary to balance Respondent\u2019s right of defence,* [...]*, with (i) Claimants\u2019 right to equality of arms and (ii) the general interest of ensuring the integrity of the procedure and in particular the finding of the truth\"* (para 143 of Procedural Order No. 3). These considerations and principles remain generally applicable also to documents of a different nature than the documents, which were the object of the decision of the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n34.\n\nIn application of the considerations and principles set out in Procedural Order No. 3, whenever a Party requests to introduce documents which relate to different arbitration or litigation proceedings, the Tribunal will decide on the admissibility of these documents based on balancing of the Parties' right of defence and their right to equality' of arms, while taking into account the general interest of ensuring the integrity of the procedure and in particular the finding of the truth.\n\n35.\n\n**With regard to the documents relating to the criminal proceedings involving Ms. Orianna Pilastro,** the relevant documents include: (i) the transcript of a declaration made by Ms. Orianna Pilastro before the Italian Police (Annex II to Respondent\u2019s Request), (ii) the transcript of a declaration made by Mr. Antonio Pilastro (Annex III to Respondent\u2019s Request), and (iii) a petition to class the case (Annex I to Respondent\u2019s Request). These documents were issued within the context of an investigation concerning the authenticity of the signature of the Pilastras affixed on relevant documents of the TFA Mandate Package and the revocation of the TFA Mandate. However, no further information is available at this stage regarding the circumstances under which these proceedings were initiated.\n\n36.\n\nThese documents were submitted to the Tribunal by Respondent in order to further support its argument that the way in which TFA collected the consent of the Claimants was fraudulent and that these consents are, therefore, invalid. As such, these documents are in Respondent\u2019s eyes an important part of their right of defence.\n\n37.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal notes the potential use of such documents with regard to the finding of the truth. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that these documents are to be admitted into the record, without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s power to freely appreciate the evidentiary weight and value to be attributed to such documents in view of all the relevant circumstances.\n\n38.\n\n**With regard to Claimants\u2019 request to order Respondent to account for its involvement in the Italian criminal proceedings,** in particular those concerning the Pilastros, it has not been established that the information leading to the initiation of the criminal proceedings had been provided by Respondent (transcripts English version p. 165 1. 13 to p. 166 1. 8; transcripts Spanish version p. 1681. 4 to p. 169 1. 1). In any case, the criminal proceedings have already been closed. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2019 request.\n\n**(5) With Regard to Claimants\u2019 Request on Costs:**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*\"- Award Claimants costs and fees incurred in responding to Respondent\u2019s request.\u201d (see* above paras 5 and 7)\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of Claimants\u2019 request. This request will be taken into consideration when deciding on the overall costs of the proceedings.\n\n**(6) With Regard to Claimants\u2019 Request to Provide Claimants access to Respondent\u2019s Database and other data:**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\" \u25a0 Respondent is ordered to provide Claimants access to Respondent\u2019s database and any other data compiled regarding individual Claimants tendering into the 2010 Exchange Offer.\u201d* (see above para 5)\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note that this request, which was raised in Claimants\u2019 letter of 2 March 2012, has not been repeated or otherwise mentioned by Claimants during the Meeting. The Tribunal, therefore, considers this request to be moot.\n\n**THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL HEREBY DECIDES AND RECOMMENDS AS FOLLOWS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**With regard to Respondent's requests:**\n\n**1. Respondent's request that a hearing be scheduled urgently so that Ms. Orianna Pilastro and Mr. Antonio Pilastro may testify before the Tribunal in addition to any other claimant that the Tribunal may designate, is rejected;**\n\n**2.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, a number of individuals and corporations claiming to hold sovereign bonds issued by the Argentine Republic (\"**Claimants**\") submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") against the Argentine Republic (\"**Argentina**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn February 7, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on February 6, 2008. Its members were Dr. Robert Briner, a Swiss national, appointed as President pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, Professor Georges Abi-Saab, an Egyptian national, appointed by Argentina, and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, appointed by the Claimants. Following the resignation of Dr. Briner due to ill health, the Tribunal was reconstituted on September 2, 2009, with Professor Pierre Tercier, also a Swiss national, being appointed as President of the Tribunal by agreement of the parties.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing written submissions, a hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington D.C. from April 7 to 13, 2010. On August 4, 2011, the Tribunal, by a majority composed of Professors Tercier and van den Berg, issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. On October 28, 2011, Professor Abi-Saab issued a Dissenting Opinion on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 15, 2011, Argentina submitted a Proposal to Disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The proceeding was suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n6.\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab tendered his resignation from the Tribunal by letter dated November 1, 2011.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council rejected the Proposal to Disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg, pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. The proceeding was resumed on that same date in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n8.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Professors Tercier and van den Berg consented to Professor Abi-Saab's resignation, as envisaged in ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn January 19, 2012, the Tribunal was reconstituted, its members being Professor Tercier, Professor van den Berg, and Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, a Spanish national, appointed by Argentina to replace Professor Abi-Saab.\n\n10.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, the Tribunal held a procedural hearing in Washington D.C.\n\n11.\n\nBetween May 9, 2012 and November 4, 2013, the Tribunal has issued 13 Procedural Orders and 3 set of Directions concerning the conduct of these proceedings.1\n\nProcedural Order No. 10 (June 18, 2012), Procedural Order No. 11 (June 27, 2012), Procedural Order No. 12 (July 7, 2012), Procedural Order No. 13 (September 27, 2012), Procedural Order No. 14 (November 1, 2012), Procedural Order No. 15 (November 20, 2012), Procedural Order No. 16 (January 11, 2013), Procedural Order No. 17 (February 08, 2013), Procedural Order No. 18 (March 25, 2013), Procedural Order No. 19 (April 8, 2013), Procedural Order No. 20 (April 24, 2013), Procedural Order No. 21 (May 2, 2013), Procedural Order No. 22 (July 30, 2013), Directions from the Tribunal to the Parties of September 26, October 21, and November 4, 2013.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 7, 2012, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 12 concerning the conduct of the proceedings and the procedural calendar. In this Procedural Order, the Tribunal divided the steps leading to the hearing into two main phases: Phases 2 and 3. It further divided Phase 2 into three sub-phases: Phases 2A and 2B, which would run in parallel, and would later merge into Phase 2C.\n\n13.\n\nIn Phase 2A, the Claimants and the Respondent would file a Memorial and CounterMemorial setting forth their respective cases on liability and quantum. The Respondent could also address issues of jurisdiction and admissibility but only to the extent that they had not been addressed and decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n14.\n\nPhase 2B would concern a verification of the Claimants' database by one or more independent experts to be appointed by the Tribunal (the \"**Database Verification Process**\").\n\n15.\n\nProcedural Order No. 12 granted the parties an opportunity to participate in the Database Verification Process, and, to this end, to retain their own experts. Phase 2B was to be completed by a report of the Independent Expert(s). Originally, this report was to be issued upon the filing of Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Phase 2. Phase 2B also envisaged a document production phase that would follow the issuance of the expert(s) report.\n\n16.\n\nPhases 2A and 2B would merge into Phase 2C after the conclusion of the document production. In Phase 2C, the Claimants and the Respondent were to submit a Reply and Rejoinder, respectively, which would address (i) issues of liability and quantum, (ii) jurisdiction and admissibility, should the Respondent raise these in its Counter-Memorial on Phase 2B, and (iii) any comments arising from the Database Verification Process. If the Respondent raised issues of jurisdiction and admissibility in its Counter-Memorial, the Claimants could file a Rejoinder on these issues. This exchange of written pleadings would be followed by a hearing on Phase 2.\n\n17.\n\nThe above steps were reflected in a schedule included in Procedural Order No. 12.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phase | Date | Party | Description |\n| 2A | 15 Sept 12 (2 months) | Claimants | Claimants file their Memorial on Phase 2 |\n| 15 Nov 12 (2 months) | Respondent | Respondent files its Memorial on Phase 2 |\n| 2B | 15 Nov 12 | External Expert(s) | Report on the verification of Claimants' database in compliance with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 501(iii) of the Decision by one or more experts appointed by the Tribunal after consultation of the Parties |\n| 30 Nov 12 (2 weeks) | Requesting Party | Both Parties file their Request for Document Production |\n| 14 Dec 12 (2 weeks) | Producing/ Objecting Party | Both Parties produce non-contentious documents and file their objections concerning contentious document requests |\n| 28 Dec 12 (2 weeks) | Requesting Party | Both Parties file answers to objections concerning contentious document requests |\n|  | 11 Jan 13 (2 weeks) | Objecting Party | Both Parties reply to answer to the objections concerning contentious document requests |\n|  | 1 Feb 13 (3 weeks) | Tribunal | Decision on Document Production Requests to be issued |\n| 2C | 1 Apr 13 (2 months) | Claimants | Claimants file their Reply on Respondent's Memorial on Phase 2 |\n|  | 3 Jun 13 (2 months) | Respondent | Respondent files its Rejoinder on Claimants' Reply Memorial on Phase 2 |\n|  | 3 July 13 (1 month) | Claimants | Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction |\n|  | July/Sept/Oct TBC | ALL | Hearing on Phase 2 |\n|  | TBD | Claimant & Respondent | Post-Hearing Briefs |\n|  |  | Tribunal | Decision on Phase 2 |\n\n18.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, the Tribunal, by majority, issued Procedural Order No. 13 addressing issues of confidentiality and the further conduct of the proceedings. In particular, Procedural Order No. 13 granted the Claimants (i) the right to address issues of individual jurisdiction in their Phase 2 Memorial and (ii) approval to amend the contents of the Database, under specified conditions. Procedural Order No. 13 also extended the dates for submission of the Claimants' Memorial and the Respondent's Counter-Memorial. Procedural Order No. 13 was accompanied by a Statement of Dissent issued by Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez agreed with the extension granted, but considered that (i) the Claimants should not be allowed to include issues of individual jurisdiction in their Phase 2 Memorial and file a Rejoinder on jurisdiction and (ii) the entire schedule fixed in Procedural Order No. 12 should be revised to factor the Database Verification Process in the sequence of pleadings.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Phase 2 Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits in English on October 1, 2012. A translation into Spanish was filed on October 8, 2012.\n\n20.\n\nOn November 1, 2012, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 14, extending the deadline for Argentina's submission of its Counter-Memorial by one week, the same additional time the Claimants had taken to submit the Spanish version of its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits.\n\n21.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, the Tribunal, by majority, issued Procedural Order No. 15, (i) appointing Dr. Norbert W\u00fchler, a German national, as the independent database verification expert envisaged in Procedural Order No. 12; (ii) asking Dr. W\u00fchler to prepare a *Work Proposal* to be presented to the parties and the Tribunal; and (iii) defining the scope of the expert's mandate, the terms of his retainer and the procedure applicable to his role. Procedural Order No. 15 further modified the schedule for phases 2B and 2C.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phase | Date | Party | Description |\n| 2A | 30 Sept 12 (2 months) |

and September 2, 2013, respectively.\n\n23.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez appended a Dissenting Opinion to Procedural Order No. 15, opposing Dr. W\u00fchler as a sole expert, and reiterating his disagreement with the schedule of submissions.\n\n24.\n\nArgentina filed its Phase 2A Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits on December 26, 2012.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 January 2013, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 16, addressing issues concerning the languages of the proceeding and postponing the deadline for each party to file a request for document production until January 16, 2013.\n\n26.\n\nOn February 8, 2013, the majority of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17, confirming the appointment of Dr. W\u00fchler as the Tribunal's Database Verification

Order No. 17, objecting to the procedural calendar, the appointment of Dr. W\u00fchler, and generally the Database Verification Process.\n\n28.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 18 concerning production of documents.\n\n29.\n\nOn April 8, 2013, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 19 concerning the conduct of the database verification process. Attached to Procedural Order No. 19 was a letter from Professor Tercier noting the parties' increasing failure to comply with the established timetable, and advising that the Tribunal would henceforth be stricter on time limits and requests for extension of time.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, the Majority of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 extending the deadline for the independent expert's draft Database Verification Report until May 31, 2013. Dr. W\u00fchler had requested this extension due to delays caused by interruptions in access to the Database. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented from Procedural Order No. 20 on the basis of his stated opposition to the Database Verification Process.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 2, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21 concerning the management of the Claimants' Database and the procedural calendar, setting new dates as follows:\n\ni. Submission of the Draft Verification Report by Dr. W\u00fchler: May 31, 2013.  \nii. Comments by both parties: July 1, 2013.  \niii. Issuance of Final Verification Report: July 15, 2013.  \niv. All other deadlines are suspended.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented from Procedural Order No. 21 on the basis of his stated opposition to the Database Verification Process.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of July 22, 2013, the Tribunal gave each party the opportunity to comment on the other party's comments of July 15, 2013. The Tribunal established the following additional steps concerning the Database Verification:\n\ni. Each party to respond to the other party's July 15, 2013 comments on the Draft Verification Report: Deadline July 31, 2013.  \nii. Issuance of Final Verification Report: Deadline August 31, 2013.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented from this letter on the basis of his stated opposition to the Database Verification Process.\n\n33.\n\nOn July 30, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 regarding the management of the Claimants' Database. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez appended an Individual Statement of Dissent to Procedural Order No. 22.\n\n34.\n\nThe Final Database Verification Report was issued by the Expert on August 31, 2013 and transmitted to the parties on September 5, 2013.\n\n35.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, the Tribunal issued Directions to the parties, stating that it would proceed as set out in Procedural Orders No. 15 and 17, while re-adjusting the relevant deadlines. The Tribunal then set a modified schedule.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phase | Date | Party | Description |\n| 2C | 7 November 2013 (9 weeks) | Claimants | Claimants file their Reply on Respondent's Memorial on Phase 2 (CL ReplyMP2) (CL ReplyMP2) |\n| + 9 weeks as of receipt of Spanish CL ReplyMP2 | Respondent | Respondent files its Rejoinder on Claimants' Reply Memorial on Phase 2 (RSP REjMP2) |\n| + 4 weeks as of receipt of English RSP REjMP2 **(TBC)** | Claimants | Claimants file their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction regarding new arguments or documents, if any |\n| June 2014 (TBC) | ALL | Hearing on Phase 2 |\n| TBD | Claimants and Respondent | Post-Hearing Briefs |\n| TBD | Tribunal | Decision on Phase 2 |\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal also advised the parties that the three arbitrators would be available for a hearing during June 2014, and invited the parties to confirm the dates during that period on which they would be available for the hearing.\n\n37.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented from the Tribunal's Directions as to the above timetable on the basis that it gave the Claimants the last opportunity to respond by filing a Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction contrary, in his view, to Rule 31 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of October 3, 2013, Argentina requested an 11-month extension to file its Rejoinder Memorial, requesting the same time that the Claimants had for the filing of its Reply, and objected to the hearing dates proposed by the Tribunal, claiming Argentina had prior commitments in other ICSID cases. By letter of October 9, 2013, the Claimants objected to Argentina's request and confirmed their agreement with the hearing dates proposed by the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nIn its Directions of October 21, 2013, the majority of the Tribunal decided to hold the hearing in the last two weeks of June, and stated:\n\n*The Arbitral Tribunal has taken note of Respondent's schedule in the first half of 2013. It should be recalled that the hearing has been postponed various times (PO17* [sic] *of 7 July 2012: Jul/Sep/Oct 2013; PO 15 of 20 November 2012: Oct/Nov 2013; PO17 of 8 February 2013: 18-30 November 2013; PO21 of 2 May 2013: calendar suspended). In order to ensure the progress of this arbitration, the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal has decided to hold the hearing as suggested, i.e., in the last two weeks of June 2014.*\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented, indicating that Argentina should be granted an extension to file its Rejoinder Memorial, that the calendar should be adjusted, and accordingly that the hearing dates set by the Tribunal should be changed.\n\n40.\n\nOn October 24, 2013, Argentina reiterated its request for an 11-month extension to file its Rejoinder.\n\n41.\n\nIn its Directions of November 4, 2013, the Tribunal granted a 15-day extension requested by the Claimants, and set a modified schedule.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phase | Date | Party | Description |\n| 2C | 19 November 2013 (75 days) | Claimants | Claimants file their Reply on Respondent's Memorial on Phase 2 (CL ReplyMP2) (CL ReplyMP2) |\n| + 75 days as of receipt of Spanish CL ReplyMP2 | Respondent | Respondent files its Rejoinder on Claimants' Reply Memorial on Phase 2 (RSP REjMP2) |\n| + 4 weeks as of receipt of English RSP REjMP2 **(TBC)** | Claimants | Claimants file their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction regarding new arguments or documents, if any |\n| June 2014 (TBC) | ALL | Hearing on Phase 2 (Hearing P2) |\n| TBD | Claimants and Respondent | Post-Hearing Briefs |\n| TBD | Tribunal | Decision on Phase 2 |\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez approved the extension of time for filing the Reply requested by the Claimants on the condition that a similar extension be granted to the Respondent, but rejected the schedule because it allowed the Claimants to submit a further Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nBy letter of November 20, 2013, Argentina repeated its objections, requesting an extension to file its Rejoinder on October 4, 2014.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of November 28, 2013, the Tribunal rejected Argentina's requests for an extension to file its Rejoinder Memorial on Phase 2, and stated:\n\n\"*The Arbitral Tribunal does not find it justified or appropriate to rely on the number of days between the filing of Respondent's Counter-Memorial and the filing of Claimants' Reply Memorial to grant Respondent an exactly same amount of days for the filing of its Rejoinder Memorial. Both Parties have been occupied with various aspects of these proceedings, including most recently the Verification Process and the Database update issues, which are both relevant for the next steps of the proceedings, so that it would be inappropriate to assume that Claimants enjoyed 314 days to prepare their Reply Memorial. The Arbitral Tribunal believes that the period of 10.5 weeks as of receipt of Claimants' Reply Memorial is sufficient for Respondent to prepare its Rejoinder Memorial. The Tribunal notes that the Parties are aware since the issuance of Order No. 15 of 20 November 2012 (containing the timetable including the Verification Process) that the deadlines fixed for the filing of Claimants' Reply Memorial in Phase 2 and Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial in Phase 2 are equally calculated as of the date of the filing of the Final Verification Report (i.e., in Block 2C: '(2 months)'; see also Timetable to PO17: in Block 2C: '(8 weeks)'.*\"\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez dissented from this decision.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of November 29, 2013, Argentina reiterated its objections to the fixed schedule. By email of December 13, 2013, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on Argentina's November 29 letter. The Claimants submitted comments on December 17, 2013.\n\n45.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Argentina proposed the disqualification of Professors Tercier and van den Berg, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (\"**Proposal**\"). On that same date, the Centre informed the parties that the proceedings were suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural calendar for the parties' submissions on the Proposal.\n\n46.\n\nIn compliance with that procedural calendar, the Claimants replied to the Proposal on December 27, 2013. Professors Tercier and van den Berg furnished a joint explanation on December 30, 2013, as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Both Parties submitted additional comments on the Proposal on January 13, 2014.\n\n**B. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY PROFESSORS TERCIER AND VAN DEN BERG AND THE ARBITRATORS' EXPLANATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina's Proposal for Disqualification**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nArgentina's arguments on the proposal to disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg were set forth in its submissions of December 19, 2013 and January 13, 2014. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n48.\n\nArgentina argues that Professors Tercier and van den Berg manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Argentina claims that the procedural decisions on the briefing calendar demonstrates an \"absolute lack of equality in the treatment accorded to the parties to the detriment of the right of defense of the Argentine Republic which clearly prevents the challenged arbitrators from being relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"2\n\nProposal for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and Arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg of December 19, 2013 (\"**Proposal**\") \u00b62. Observations on the Proposed Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and Arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg of January 13, 2014 (\"**Respondent's Second Submission**\") \u00b62.\n\n49.\n\nArgentina argues that the periods allowed by the Tribunal for each party to prepare its defense in this case are disproportionate and result in a total lack of fairness in the treatment accorded to the parties. Argentina bases this Proposal on the decision issued by the Majority of the Tribunal on November 28, 2013 (the \"**Decision**\") and the facts surrounding it. The November 28, 2013 Decision confirmed the deadlines for the next submissions in the case. Argentina argues that this Decision means the Claimants had 314 days to prepare their Reply Memorial on Phase 2 (calculated from the date they received the English translation of the Argentine Republic's Counter-Memorial on Phase 2), while Argentina would have 75 days to prepare its Rejoinder Memorial on Phase 2 (calculated from the date it received the Spanish translation of Claimants' Reply on Phase 2).3\n\nProposal \u00b65. Respondent's Second Submission \u00b6\u00b65 and 19.\n\n50.\n\nArgentina submits that it asked three times for the same time-limit as the Claimants, but received an answer from the Tribunal rejecting the request only after its third request.4 Moreover, Argentina states that on one of these occasions, the Majority of the Tribunal granted the Claimants' a 15-day extension to file their Reply Memorial on Phase 2 while ignoring the Respondent's extension request. Argentina submits that this is a clear violation of the principle of equal treatment by the Majority of the Tribunal.5\n\nProposal \u00b6\u00b67-9.\n\nProposal \u00b68.\n\n51.\n\nArgentina states that the Majority of the Tribunal has disregarded Argentina's repeated opposition to the case procedural calendar since it was established by Procedural Order No. 15 of November 20, 2012.6 Argentina also states that the Majority of the Tribunal ignored Argentina's numerous hearings and deadlines in other arbitrations when it fixed and confirmed this schedule.7 Argentina submits that it has been asking the Tribunal to set deadlines for the submission of main pleadings that ensured equal treatment to the parties since December 14, 2012.8\n\nProposal \u00b614.\n\nProposal \u00b612.\n\nProposal \u00b615.\n\n52.\n\nArgentina argues that the Database Verification Process did not interfere substantially with the Claimants' overall ability to prepare their Reply Memorial on Phase 2. Argentina states that both parties were allowed only one month to review the draft Report submitted by the Independent Expert on May 31, 2013 and that the parties submitted their comments between July 15-31, 2013. Accordingly, Argentina submits that the time spent by the parties on the Database Verification Process between Argentina's Counter-Memorial and Claimants' Reply does not justify the difference in time allocated to each party to file their second round of pleadings.9\n\nProposal \u00b613. Respondent's Second Submission \u00b69.\n\n53.\n\nArgentina states that the Proposal to Disqualify is timely as it was triggered by the communications from the Majority of the Tribunal of November 28 and December 13, 2013.10\n\nRespondent's Second Submission \u00b644.\n\n54.\n\nArgentina concludes that the manner in which Professors Tercier and van den Berg have conducted the proceedings in this case breaches the principle of equal treatment and has caused Argentina to lose confidence in their capacity to exercise independent and impartial judgment.11\n\nProposal \u00b6\u00b618-19. Respondent's Second Submission \u00b623.\n\n**2. Claimants' Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments on the proposal to disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg were set forth in their submissions of December 27, 2013 and January 13, 2014. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants state that Professors Tercier and van den Berg's impartiality and ability to decide this case fairly has already been affirmed in this proceeding in response to Argentina's challenge in September 2011. They state that nothing has changed in the interim, and nothing in Argentina's Proposal demonstrates otherwise.12\n\nObservations by the Claimants to the Respondent's Proposals for Disqualification of December 27, 2013 (\"**Claimants' Observations**\") page 1.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants argue that a disagreement with a Tribunal ruling is not a valid basis for arbitrator disqualification under the ICSID Convention.13 The Claimants state that Argentina has raised no objections to the character or conduct of the challenged arbitrators and that it has based the present challenge \"solely on its disagreement with the Tribunal's procedural ruling with respect to Argentina's request for an extension of time.\"14\n\nClaimants' Observations page 2.

Claimants' Additional Observations page 1.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Argentina's claim that the refusal to grant its extension constitutes a breach of the principle of equal treatment is meritless. They state that the eight months following the filing of Argentina's Counter-Memorial were dedicated to two matters outside the briefing schedule: a months-long discovery phase and a months-long phase to perform an independent review and verification of the Claimants' Database. Accordingly, \"contrary to Argentina's claims that its right to defense has not been respected, much of the procedure implemented by the Tribunal has been dedicated precisely to ensuring that right.\"15\n\nClaimants' Observations pages 8-9.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Database Verification Process was a lengthy process in which both parties prepared multiple, comprehensive submissions with respect to the scope of the expert's work and the conclusions that he ultimately reached.16 Accordingly, the Claimants disagree with Argentina's assertion that the Claimants had eleven months to prepare their Reply Memorial on Phase 2.17\n\nClaimants' Observations page 9.\n\nClaimants' Observations page 10.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has given both parties multiple opportunities to present their arguments with respect to Argentina's extension request, duly considered the parties' positions, and fully explained its reasons for rejecting Argentina's request on November 28, 2013.18\n\nClaimants' Observations page 10-11\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants submit that this Proposal was not filed \"promptly\" as required by the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that Argentina waived its right to challenge the arbitrators. The Claimants note that the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 on November 20, 2012, thirteen months prior to the submission of Argentina's Proposal, and that Argentina \"failed to assert any request for disqualification, or any intention to file, when the purported issue arose more than a year ago.\" They add that \"Argentina had ample opportunity to file a disqualification request,\" and point to \"Argentina\u2019s tactical abuse of ICSID procedures to its advantage [...] by trying to award itself additional time for the Rejoinder, in direct contravention of the Tribunal's ruling.\"19\n\nClaimants' Observations page 13. Claimants' Additional Observations page 2.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that Argentina's Proposal is \"groundless on its face\" and must not be permitted to extend the procedural calendar.20\n\nClaimants' Observations page 5. Claimants' Additional Observations page 2.\n\n**3. Arbitrators' Explanations**\n--------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nProfessors Tercier and van den Berg provided a joint explanation stating that they had complied with their duty to exercise independent judgment as required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that \"none of the grounds and circumstances invoked by the Respondent in its Request relate to the exercise of [their] independent judgment.\"21\n\nProfessor Tercier's and Professor van den Berg's Joint Explanations.\n\n**C. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Request for Recommendation\n-----------------------------\n\n64.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Convention states that the decision on any proposal to disqualify the majority of arbitrators shall be taken by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n65.\n\nArgentina has asked the Chairman to request a recommendation from a third party before deciding the Proposal.22 The Claimants have opposed this request.23\n\nProposal \u00b647. Respondent's Second Submission \u00b642-43.\n\nClaimants' Observations page 14. Claimants' Additional Observations page 4.\n\n66.\n\nThe Chairman has requested recommendations on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator on rare occasions in the past, in light of the specific circumstances of the case at issue. In each such case, the parties were informed that the final decision would be taken by the Chairman, as prescribed by the Convention. The circumstances in this Proposal do not justify such a request. Accordingly, the Chairman has decided the Proposal on the basis of the submissions presented by the parties and the explanations provided by the challenged arbitrators, in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**2. Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n67.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n\"*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\"\n\n68.\n\nAs the ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis.24\n\nSee *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (December 13, 2013) \u00b673 (\"**Burlington**\").\n\n69.\n\nIn this case, Argentina filed the Proposal on December 19, 2013. It arose from a November 28, 2013 Tribunal ruling on Argentina's request for an extension of time and facts surrounding that request. Such a time period falls within an acceptable range and hence, this disqualification proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**3. Merits**\n-------------\n\n70.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n71.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"25 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.26\n\n*Burlington*, *supra* note 24 \u00b668, footnote 83; *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20) \u00b661, footnote 43 (\"**Blue Bank**\"); *Repsol, S.A. and Repsol Butano, S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/38), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrators Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a and Claus von Wobeser (December 13, 2013) \u00b673, footnote 58 (\"**Repsol**\").\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, Second Edition (2009), page 1202 \u00b6\u00b6134-154.\n\n72.\n\nThe disqualification proposed in this case alleges that Professors Tercier and van den Berg manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1).\n\n73.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"*\n\n74.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment).27 Given that both versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.28\n\nThe French version refers to \"*ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.*\"\n\nThe Parties agree on this point: Proposal \u00b625; Claimants' Observations page 5. So does ICSID jurisprudence: Burlington *supra* note 24 \u00b665, Blue Bank *supra* note 25 \u00b658, Repsol *supra* note 25 \u00b670.\n\n75.\n\nImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case *.*\"29\n\nBurlington *supra* note 24 \u00b666, Blue Bank *supra* note 25 \u00b659, Repsol *supra* note 25 \u00b671.\n\n76.\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.30\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n77.\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.31\n\nBurlington *supra* note 24 \u00b667, Blue Bank *supra* note 25 \u00b660, Repsol *supra* note 25 \u00b672.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent has referred to other sets of standards and guidelines in its arguments. While these rules or guidelines may serve as useful references, the Chairman is bound by the standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n79.\n\nThis has been a lengthy arbitration and it is a complex proceeding. The Tribunal has addressed numerous requests from both parties and has issued an extensive number of procedural orders and directions to the parties. Each of the Tribunal's rulings has been rendered following thorough argument by each of the parties and due deliberation among the members of the Tribunal. Some of these rulings have granted the requests of the parties, while others have denied such requests.\n\n80.\n\nThe mere existence of an adverse ruling is insufficient to prove a manifest lack of impartiality or independence, as required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention. If it were otherwise, proceedings could continuously be interrupted by the unsuccessful party, prolonging the arbitral process.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent's disqualification proposal in this case was triggered by a procedural ruling. This ruling, which included the reasons on which it was based, was adopted after argument by both parties and due deliberation by the Tribunal. The Respondent is clearly dissatisfied with the ruling in question. However, the ruling in itself and the surrounding facts described in the Proposal do not prove a manifest lack of impartiality on the arbitrators who rendered it.\n\n82.\n\nIn the Chairman's view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the November 28, 2013 ruling, and surrounding facts, would not conclude that they evidence a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.\n\n**D. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n83.\n\nHaving considered all of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Chairman rejects the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg."}, {"Title": "Consent Award under ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2)", "Type": "Decision on parties\u2019 agreement", "Date": "2016-12-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Declaration appended to the Award by Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez", "Type": "Declaration", "Date": "2016-12-29T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Declaration appended to the Award by Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe subject-matter of the present Declaration consists in an explanation and a reservation. The explanation of vote concerns my acceptance of the Parties\u2019 request to the Tribunal to discontinue the case in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43 (2). The reservation relates to the Award. I signed the Award because I voted in favour of its operative part but I am entering into a reservation with respect to the section of its motives entitled \"Procedural History\" because the reporting of facts contained therein is incomplete.\n\n***1. The explanation***\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 43 entitled \"Settlement and Discontinuance\" provides two procedural ways for discontinuing a case before the award is rendered by the arbitral tribunal concerned depending upon of whether or not the parties have requested to embody their own settlement in an award of the tribunal. If such a request is not made by the parties the tribunal is under the obligation of issuing an order noting the discontinuance of the case as provided for in Rule 43(1). That is all.\n\n2.\n\nBut, if the parties\u2019 request the tribunal to embody their settlement in an award as a form of discontinuance, the tribunal is under no obligation pursuant to Rule 43(2) to comply with the request. As provided in this provision, the \"Tribunal *may* record the settlement in the form of its award\" and, therefore, it may decide in a given case not to accede to the request because jurisdictional, propriety or other kind of considerations, even if the parties have complied with the conditions of submitting their request in writing and filed the full text of their settlement duly signed. In the latter hypothesis, the requested discontinuance would need to be declared by other means, namely by noting it in a tribunal\u2019s order, because the right of the parties acting together to discontinue their case - before the award thereon be rendered - is under ICSID Arbitration Rule 43 an unquestionable procedural right of the parties.\n\n3.\n\nIn their request of 7 October 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal *inter alia* that as a result of negotiations, on 21 April 2016, the Parties signed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which they (i) fully settled their dispute, (ii) agreed to terminate the Arbitration, as well as any other pending proceedings, and (iii) agreed to jointly request that the Tribunal incorporate their agreement in the form of a public Consent Award. Together with their request, the Parties provided the Tribunal with the full signed text of their Settlement Agreement and a proposed draft of a Consent Award.\n\n4.\n\nThe Parties asked therefore the Tribunal to put an end to the present arbitration by adopting the form of discontinuance set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2), form that, as mentioned above, the Tribunal may or may not grant in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. One of those circumstances is that the Parties\u2019 request of 7 October 2016 stated the following important legal caveat:\n\n*\"For the avoidance of doubt the Settlement Agreement and the Consent Award and their terms and provisions are made and agreed without any admission by the Parties of ICSID jurisdiction and international liability and it is not, and shall not, be represented and/or construed by the Parties as an admission of international liability or wrongdoing on the part of either Party.\"*\n\n5.\n\nThis legal caveat - incorporated now in paragraph (pp) of the present Tribunal\u2019s Consent Award - has been determinative in the decision of this arbitrator to accede to the Parties\u2019 writing request of discontinuing the case in accordance with Arbitration Rule 43(2). Without that legal caveat I would have had to decline the said writing request on jurisdictional as well as propriety grounds of my own.\n\n6.\n\nIn effect, as to jurisdiction it is in the public domain (see my 2013 Dissenting Opinion in the ICSID *Ambiente Ufficio* case) that I share the conclusion of the Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Abi-Saab, issued at the first phase of the present case in which - contrary to the majority 2011 Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility- Professor Abi-Saab concluded at the absence of Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to entertaining the present case. Concerning propriety, as a member of the Tribunal at the merits phase of the case I have participated fully in the deliberation held by the Tribunal reaching then, in conscience, legal conclusions on both the pending jurisdictional *ratione personae* issues and core issues regarding the merits of the case (see majority 2011 Decision, paragraph 670) on the basis of the law applicable to the dispute, the pleading of the Parties and the elements of proof provided by either of them. Without the above legal caveat I would have had to uphold the proposition that the Tribunal will simple note the discontinuance in an order, namely in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(1).\n\n7.\n\nBut, the above jurisdictional and propriety considerations of mine are not an obstacle at all for me to accede to the joint request of discontinuing the case in accordance with Arbitration Rule 43(2) from the very moment that both Parties declare - in the commented caveat - that their Settlement Agreement and draft Consent Award and their terms and provisions are made and agreed without any admission by them of ICSID jurisdiction and international liability on the part of either Party, and it is not, and shall not, be represented or construed otherwise. In other words, I accede to the Parties\u2019 request concerning the form of discontinuance of the present case because, as explained by the Parties themselves in the legal caveat, their Settlement Agreement and draft Consent Award is based upon considerations *alien* to the law applicable to the dispute as instituted.\n\n**2.** ***The reservation***\n----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nAs indicated above, I signed the present Consent Award of the Tribunal because I voted in favour of its operative part and, therefore, the Present Award has been adopted as a whole unanimously by the Tribunal. Concerning the reasons upon which the Award is based, I endorsed also the section entitled \"Settlement\" but I entered, as already mentioned, into a reservation with respect to the section entitled \"Procedural History\" because in my opinion the reporting of the facts contained therein is not as complete as it should be.\n\n9.\n\nIn this context, I will begin recalling that ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2) mentions three instruments, namely the Parties\u2019 settlement, their writing request and the Tribunal\u2019s award. The Tribunal cannot revise in any respect the Settlement or the Writing Request of the Parties. But, the Tribunal is the master of the text of the Award because it is its own Award. As stated in the last words of Rule 43(2): \"... the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of *its award\"* (italics supplied). It follows that, if the Tribunal accedes to the Writing Request of the Parties it may review or complete the text of any draft Consent Award which might have been provided by the Parties, as occurred in the present case. The Parties seems to have a similar view because they qualify their draft Consent Award as a \"proposal\".\n\n10.\n\nI failed however to convince my co-arbitrators to complete the elements of fact missed in the section of the present Consent Award entitled \"Procedural History\". Those elements of fact are nevertheless part and parcel of the reality of the arbitral proceeding of the *Abaclat Case* whose integrity and transparency as a whole should, in my opinion, be preserved and recorded in the present Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n11.\n\nThe existing temporal gap in the said \"Procedural History\" of the present Consent Award concerns an ample period of time which goes from November 12, 2014 (see paragraph (hh) of the present Consent Award) to the receiving by the Tribunal, on 21 March 2016, a Parties\u2019 joint letter, dated March 2016, requesting the suspension of the arbitral proceeding for a duration of 120 days, suspension which was granted in the light of the Agreement in Principle executed by TFA and Argentina on 31 January 2016. By letters of 26 August 2016 of the Claimants and 22 September 2016 of the Argentine Republic the Tribunal was informed that they have settled their dispute and that they would request the discontinuance of the proceeding. Thereafter, on 7 October 2016, the Parties informed in due form jointly the Tribunal that they have signed on 21 April 2016 a Settlement Agreement settling the whole of the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal and requesting the discontinuance of the present *Abaclat* Case as described above in paragraph 3 of this Declaration.\n\n12.\n\nThat factual temporal gap in the said \"Procedural History\" corresponds mostly to the part of the proceeding  concerning the \"preparation\" by the Tribunal itself pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 46 of the Award on the dispute between the Parties, notion that encompasses the three classic stages of drawing up an award: \"study of documentation\", \"deliberation\" and \"drafting of a draft Award\". In the present case such a temporal period started as usual at the Hearing closing the oral procedure on the Merits on 24 June 2014 (see paragraph (cc) of the present Award) and ended on 7 October 2016 when the Parties requested the Tribunal to discontinue the *Abaclat* Case as indicated above. Thus, the span of time at the disposal of the Tribunal in the present case to render its Award on the *Abaclat* dispute went from 24 June 2014 to 7 October 2016 (minus the 120 days in which the proceeding was suspended).\n\n13.\n\nIn the months following the closing of the Hearing, the Tribunal commenced its work as it is usual in the internal arbitral practice of ICSID, namely by studying the records of the Hearing and Parties\u2019 post- hearing briefs and other documents filed by them, following by the holding of the deliberation of the Tribunal. Once the deliberation was concluded, the Tribunal began, as it is also usual in the said ICSID practice, the task of preparing the draft Award but it was incapable to rendering the Award before March 2016 when the Parties requested the suspension of the proceeding or before 7 October 2016 when they moved jointly the disclosure of the *Abaclat* Case. This is not usual in ICSID arbitral proceedings. It reflects an evident failure, namely the failure of the Tribunal in accomplishing the task of rendering its arbitral Award on the *Abaclat* dispute within a reasonable period of time under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Otherwise, it would be legally impossible to suspend the proceeding in March 2016 and, later on, to discontinue the case in October 2016 because the Parties\u2019 procedural rights under ICSID Arbitration Rule 43 operate, obviously, only *before the award, on the dispute is rendered.*\n\n14.\n\nThe silence in the present Award of references to factual sequential events concerning the Tribunal's work adds to the said failure, because of my conviction on the need that arbitral praxis implements basic principles which are in turn manifestations of the fundamental principle of the good administration of international arbitral justice and, particularly, the corollary that justice delayed is justice denied.\n\n15.\n\nI am second to none in upholding the right of the Parties to settle their disputes by direct consultations, negotiations or conciliation, as well as to their right of conducting those consultations, negotiations or conciliation in parallel to eventual instituted judicial, arbitration or conciliation by a third proceedings. As the ICJ has recalled in several occasions, the judicial, arbitral or conciliation by thirds of the settlement of disputes is not more than a substitute to the failure of the parties to settle the dispute concerned by mutual agreement.\n\n16.\n\nBut, this does not mean at all that *the proceedings of* each of those different means of settlement be susceptible of being mixed up with each other without denaturalizing themselves. If that happens, the utility for the parties of having recourse to international judicial, arbitral and conciliation institutions would become less evident. Each of those alternative means might lose its present status of *autonomous means* governed by particular rules and therefore, impairing the confidence of parties in the settlement of international disputes by thirds."}, {"Title": "Additional Declaration by Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez", "Type": "Declaration", "Date": "2016-12-29T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Additional Declaration by Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nDr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez does not share the views of his co-arbitrators on his Declaration."}, {"Title": "Additional Declaration by Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg", "Type": "Declaration", "Date": "2016-12-29T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Additional Declaration by Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArbitrators Pierre Tercier and Albert Jan van den Berg consider that Dr. Santiago Torres Bernardez\u2019 attached Declaration contains information which is largely irrelevant to this Consent Award, relies on a unilateral and partly inaccurate presentation of facts and is in breach of the principle of secrecy of the deliberations."}], "Content": "Consent Award under ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI.
