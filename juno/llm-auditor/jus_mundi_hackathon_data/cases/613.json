Brower (Award)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI respectfully dissent from the Award on Jurisdiction (\"Award\") because I believe it misconstrues the Argentina-Germany BIT (\"Treaty\") with respect to the effect of the Treaty's Most Favored Nation (\"MFN\") clause on that Treaty's clause requiring that Claimant take its claim to the host State's courts for 18 months prior to resorting to arbitration (\"18-month domestic courts clause\" or \"18-month clause\").1\n\nAs I am in agreement, however, with the Award's dismissal of the remainder of Respondent's jurisdictional objections, I do not address them.\n\n**II. THE FLAWS IN THE AWARD'S ANALYSIS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nI cannot accept the leap the Award makes between its general references to the requirement that a State consent in order to be bound by its international obligations, including resort to arbitration, and the Award's *ex cathedra* pronouncement of an interpretive presumption requiring that consent to international arbitration via an MFN clause \"requires affirmative evidence.\"2 I address this analytical flaw at some length because, despite the Award's protestations to the contrary, it effectively endorses the otherwise discredited holding in *Plama* that \"the intention to incorporate dispute settlement provisions [into MFN clauses] must be clearly and unambiguously expressed.\"3\n\nAward \u00b6 175. The Award does not specify what \"affirmative evidence\" means, but holds that \"it is not possible to presume that consent has been given by a state.\" Award \u00b6 175. The Award later employs the phrase \"demonstrated expression\" of consent, apparently equivalent to \"affirmative evidence.\" Award \u00b6 176. The most plausible way of interpreting the Award's position is that such consent cannot be established by interpretation in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\" or \"Vienna Convention\"), but that instead a higher level of proof is required. *See* Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331. As shown *infra*, the Award has not cited a single relevant authority in support of this standard.\n\n*See* *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction (8 Feb. 2005) \u00b6 204, *available at* http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC521\\_En&c aseId=C24. The so-called \" *Plama* principle\" has been criticized by various tribunals. *See, e.g.*, *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction (16 May 2006) \u00b6 64, *available at* http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC514\\_En&caseId=C18 (\"The *Plama* tribunal also stated, in its reasons, that an arbitration agreement must be clear and unambiguous, especially where it is incorporated by reference to another text. This Tribunal does not share this statement. As stated above, it believes that dispute resolution provisions are subject to interpretation like any other provisions of a treaty, neither more restrictive nor more liberal.\") (emphasis in original). Even in *Berschader,* which is usually included in the \" *Plama* line of cases\" (over the spirited dissent of one of the panel members), the Award criticized **Plama** 's *ex cathedra* interpretive presumption. *Berschader v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. 080/2004, Award (21 Apr. 2006) \u00b6 177, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/BerschaderFinalAward.pdf (\"The **Plama** tribunal states that an arbitration clause in a BIT is an agreement to arbitrate, and such agreements should be clear and unambiguous. If this means that, generally speaking, arbitration agreements should be construed in a manner which is different in principle from that applied to the construction of other agreements, this Tribunal finds it doubtful whether such a general principle can be said to exist.\"); *see also* *Renta 4 S.V.S.A., et al. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections (20 Mar. 2009) \u00b6\u00b6 95-101, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/Renta.pdf.\n\n**A. The Award's Requirement Of \"Affirmative Evidence\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAccording to the Award, the presumption it establishes \"should not be taken as a \u2018strict' or \u2018restrictive' approach\" because it reflects \"the rule according to which state consent is the incontrovertible requisite for any kind of international settlement procedure.\"4 With all due respect, the Award's requirement of \"affirmative evidence\" is precisely what the Award contends it is not: an interpretation of the requirement of consent that is restrictive, in violation of the very interpretive principles the Award purports to accept.5 To state that \"the uniform applicability of the Vienna Convention's customary law interpretive principles to all treaty clauses is beyond doubt\"6 while contending that \"[e]stablishing consent [by a State to international arbitration]... requires affirmative evidence\"7 is to withdraw with one hand what the other has put forward. The Award does not cite to a single source of public international law that embraces the principle that \"affirmative evidence\" is required in interpreting dispute resolution or other investment treaty clauses.8 Nowhere does the Award even seek to reconcile its notion of \"affirmative evidence\" with the VCLT's recognition (in its Article 32(a)) that any Treaty term may be, for example, \"ambiguous\" and therefore subject to supplementary means of interpretation in order to \"determine [its] meaning.\" Nor does the Award explain the international legal grounds on which its stated \"respect\" for a legal requirement must entail a higher standard of proof with respect to that requirement.9\n\nAward \u00b6 175.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Award \u00b6\u00b6 170-71 (quoting with approval the *Amco Asia* Tribunal's holding that: \"[L]ike any other convention, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly or liberally*. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties; such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\" *Amco Asia Corp. v. Indonesia*, Award on Jurisdiction (25 Sept. 1983), 1 ICSID Reports 389 (1983), *reprinted in* 22 I.L.M. 351, 359 (1983)); *see also* *Mondev Int'l Ltd. v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award (11 Oct. 2002) \u00b6 43 (Sir Ninian Stephen, Prof. James Crawford, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel), *available at* http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/14442.pdf (\"In the Tribunal's view, there is no principle either of extensive or restrictive interpretation of jurisdictional provisions in treaties. In the end the question is what the relevant provisions mean, interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of interpretation of treaties. These are set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which for this purpose can be taken to reflect the position under customary international law.\"); *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States)*, Preliminary Objections, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, 1996 ICJ Rep. at 857 (12 Dec.) (\"The Court has no judicial policy of being either liberal or strict in deciding the scope of compromissory clauses: they are judicial decisions like any other.\").\n\nAward \u00b6 172.\n\nAward \u00b6 175.\n\nThe Award's focus on \"affirmative evidence\" appears to be in tension with the Award's observation in note 310 that: \"Even in the case of customary international law, it can be argued that consent, or at least the consent of a majority of the world's states, underlies all of the norms reflected in customary international law. Without such consent... those norms would not have evolved into customary law in the first place.\" This statement is accurate insofar as \"consent\" underlies the individual State acts that, given their sufficiently broad and lasting recurrence (State practice), combined with evidence of the acting States' view that their actions are based on existing obligations (**opinio juris**), give rise to customary international law. Ordinarily, however, an individual State need not \"consent\" to the establishment of customary international law itself; that \"consent\" is inferred via the combination of State practice and **opinio juris**. *See generally* MALCOLM M. SHAW, INTERNATIONAL LAW 70-72 (5th ed., 2003). Thus, established rules of customary international law can bind States that never granted, explicitly or otherwise, consent to individual acts of the type that gave rise to the principles in question. Those States' consent to be bound is presumed. As the Award points out in note 310, a non-consenting State is obliged then to give \"affirmative evidence\" of its non-consent via the \"persistent objector doctrine.\"\n\nThe Tribunal in *Tokios Tokeles* made specific reference to the discretion of State Parties in setting the limits of their consent: \"We emphasize here that Contracting Parties are free to define consent to jurisdiction in terms that are broad or narrow; they may employ a control-test or reserve the right to deny treaty protection to claimants who otherwise would have recourse under the BIT. Once that consent is defined, however, tribunals should give effect to it....\" *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction (29 Apr. 2004) \u00b6 39, *available at* http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC639\\_En&c aseId=C220. The Award does not explain how its interpretive presumption of \"affirmative evidence\" can be reconciled with the ability of State Parties to choose the terms in which they consent to jurisdiction and tribunals' concomitant obligation to give effect to the terms of that consent in accordance with widely accepted rules of treaty interpretation. *See also infra* n.34.\n\n4.\n\nTellingly, the Award's analysis of \"consent\" addresses neither of the two treaties that vest this Tribunal with jurisdiction, *i.e.*, the Argentina-Germany BIT and the ICSID Convention. Even the most cursory review of them reveals that neither contains a requirement of \"affirmative evidence\" establishing consent\u2014in fact, the Treaty does not include a single reference to the term \"consent,\" let alone to a requirement that consent be established by \"affirmative evidence.\"10 The ICSID Convention is similarly devoid of any support for the Award's \"affirmative evidence\" standard. The Convention's Preamble states in relevant part that \"no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration\"; and refers to \"mutual consent\" to arbitrate as constituting a \"binding agreement which requires... that any arbitral award be complied with\". In addition, regarding the establishment of ICSID jurisdiction, Article 25 of the Convention requires \"consent in writing\" that cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, while Article 26 introduces a term in State Parties' subsequent statements of \"consent\" to arbitrate, namely that such consent be to the exclusion of any other remedy. Finally, the Report of the World Bank's Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention, under a sub-heading titled \"Consent,\" refers merely to \"consent\" (and not to \"affirmative evidence\" thereof) as being \"the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"11 In sum, nothing in the ICSID Convention or in the applicable BIT lends credence to the notion that the Tribunal's jurisdiction must be based on \"affirmative evidence\" of consent.\n\nOf course the absence of the term \"consent\" from the Treaty does not obviate the need for such consent. In fact, the Treaty bears on its face the hallmarks of properly granted consent, including, *inter alia*, signatures of duly authorized representatives of the State Parties; explicit reference to the State Parties having \"agreed\" to all the terms of the Treaty; and explicit statements to the effect that the terms of the Treaty are \"binding\" on both State Parties. Neither Party in this arbitration has questioned the validity of the Treaty, or the Treaty's binding effect on the State Parties. The same cannot be said, however, of a standard such as \"affirmative evidence\" that would need to be explicitly memorialized in the Treaty or in another source that this Tribunal is bound to respect.\n\nAddressing the manner in which consent can be given, the Report includes a non-exhaustive list of examples of validly granted consent:   \nConsent may be given, for example, in a clause included in an investment agreement, providing for the submission to the Centre of future disputes arising out of that agreement, or in a *compromis* regarding a dispute which has already arisen. Nor does the Convention require that the consent of both parties be expressed in a single instrument. Thus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.   \nNothing in the Report's treatment of consent sustains the Award's \"affirmative evidence\" standard. *See* *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between* *States and Nationals of Other States*, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (18 Mar. 1965) \u00b6 23, *available at* www. http://icsid.worldbank.org/.\n\n5.\n\nFurthermore, the Award's requirement of \"affirmative evidence\" of consent contravenes the overall structure as well as the specific provisions of the VCLT. As the Award notes, the Convention codifies \"with the acceptance of an overwhelming number of the world's states... the now customary law rules on the interpretation of treaties,\"12 including the Treaty at issue here. Despite the lip service it pays to the Vienna Convention, the Award fails to consider or apply the Convention's provisions in its analysis. No Article of the Vienna Convention refers to \"affirmative evidence\" of consent,13 rendering pointless the Award's observation that the VCLT \"employs the word \u2018consent' no fewer than 62 times.\"14 Attempting to derive an additional and stringent condition *ex nihilo*, as the Award does, contravenes the mechanism established by the VCLT for the establishment of consent.\n\nAward \u00b6 169.\n\nTellingly, the Vienna Convention's drafters modified the word \"consent\" in other ways, *e.g.*, by using \"free consent\" in the Preamble or \"unanimous consent\" in Article 8. VCLT Art. 17(2) provides: \"The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty which permits a choice between differing provisions is effective only if it is *made clear* to which of the provisions the consent relates.\" (emphasis added). That provision is plainly irrelevant to the question of whether consent must be established by \"affirmative evidence,\" however, in that or any other circumstance.\n\nAward \u00b6 173. There is no necessary correlation between the number of times a legal requirement is repeated in relevant legal instruments or sources and the level of proof needed to meet that requirement.\n\n6.\n\nThe Award's approach likewise violates Article 42(1) of the VCLT, according to which \"[t]he validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention.\" In other words, the existence (or absence) of consent must be determined based on an investigation of the formal indicia of such consent as outlined in the relevant articles of the Convention, and not on the arbitrary requirement that such consent be established by \"affirmative evidence.\"\n\n7.\n\nSimilarly, the Award's attempt to tie its requirement of \"affirmative evidence\" of consent to the interpretation of the *scope* of consent is unsupported by the provisions of the ICSID Convention, the Vienna Convention, or any other generally accepted authority.15 For example, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention explicitly empowers tribunals to interpret the scope of consent given by the parties before them for purposes of asserting jurisdiction over counterclaims.16 Article 46 says nothing about \"affirmative evidence\" of consent. Besides, since the scope of consent must result from the interpretation of the plain language of the treaty,17 its determination is governed by Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Neither of those Articles refers to \"affirmative evidence\" of consent. Nor can such a requirement be derived, as the Award implies, from the requirement of Article 31 that the interpretation of a treaty be performed in \"good faith.\"18 The good faith requirement is meant to encapsulate well-established principles such as *effet utile*, honesty, fairness and reasonableness in interpreting a treaty, protection of legitimate expectations, avoidance of abuse of rights,19 and, as the ILC noted in its Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, the fundamental principle of *pacta sunt servanda*.20 These familiar rules, however, can hardly be invoked as an interpretive *carte blanche* that a tribunal can use to promote a novel and textually unsupported legal standard.\n\nThe Award fails to distinguish between the establishment and the scope of consent, although the evaluation of the former usually relies on formal indicia of validity (signature, ratification, etc.) while the latter is a matter of textual interpretation. The Award is content merely to note that \"[w]hat is true of the very existence of consent to have recourse to a specific international dispute resolution mechanism is also true as far as the scope of this consent is concerned.\" Award \u00b6 175. The Award's branding of this note as a \"red herring\" in its note 325 underscores its misunderstanding of the point, elaborated in the text accompanying the present note, that if \"affirmative evidence\" be required to establish consent to arbitration, equally it must be required in establishing the scope of consent for which latter proposition the VCLT likewise provides no support.\n\nICSID Convention Art. 46 reads in its entirety:  \n Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Inceysa Vallisoletana SL v. El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award (2 Aug. 2006) \u00b6\u00b6 200-07, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/Inceysa\\_Vallisoletana\\_en\\_001.pdf (interpreting the plain terms of the definition of investment in the Spain-El Salvador BIT and holding that \"this Arbitral Tribunal considers that the consent granted by Spain and El Salvador in the BIT is limited to investments made in accordance with the laws of the host State of the investment\").\n\nAward \u00b6 173.\n\nMARK E. VILLIGER, COMMENTARY ON THE 1969 VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES 425-26 (2009). The Award's express concurrence with this passage in its note 317 is noted.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1966), Art. 23 cmt.1.\n\n8.\n\nThe Award's reference, without further elaboration, to a \" *jurisprudence constante* \"21 in support of its position is equally unconvincing. Upon closer scrutiny, none of the six ICJ cases cited as part of that \" *jurisprudence* \" adopts or endorses the standard of \"affirmative evidence\" of consent, or, as the Award rephrases it there, \"the demonstrated expression of the states' will.\" For example, the cited part of the *Ambatielos* judgment mirrors the ruling the Award quotes from *Status of Eastern Carelia*22 by ruling that \"[t]he Court is not departing from the principle, which is well-established in international law and accepted by its own jurisprudence as well as that of the Permanent Court of International Justice, to the effect that a State may not be compelled to submit its disputes to arbitration without its consent....\"23 Similarly, in *Monetary Gold*, the ICJ opined simply that \"[t]o adjudicate upon the international responsibility of [a State] without her consent would run counter to a well-established principle of international law embodied in the Court's Statute, namely, that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a State with its consent.\"24 Notably, in the same paragraph the Court recorded that neither Party had argued that the State in question had provided its consent \"either expressly or *by implication* \"25\u2014suggesting that the Court could have accepted consent provided in either of these two forms. In any event, it is clear that none of the above cases referred, either explicitly or implicitly, to a requirement of either \"affirmative evidence\" of consent or \"the demonstrated expression of the states' will.\"\n\nAward \u00b6 176. To the extent the Award could show that the cases cited reflect a rule of international law, that rule would be relevant to the interpretation of the Treaty under VCLT Art. 31(3)(c) (requiring that in interpreting a treaty \"[t]here shall be taken into account, together with the context:... any relevant rules of international law applicable to the relations between the parties\"); *see also* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1966), Arts. 27 and 28, cmt.16.\n\n*See* Award \u00b6 174 (\"[i]t is well established in international law that no State can, without its consent, be compelled to submit its disputes... either to mediation or to arbitration, or to any other kind of pacific settlement.\") (citation omitted).\n\n*Ambatielos case (United Kingdom v.

Restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed.\"29 Similarly, in *Aerial Incident of 27 July 1955*, the ICJ held that Bulgaria's acceptance of the PCIJ's jurisdiction necessarily had lapsed with the expiry of the PCIJ Statute in 1946, and therefore was not revived by Bulgaria's later becoming a Member State of the United Nations and therewith Party to the ICJ Statute, Article 36, paragraph 5 of which automatically converted acceptances of PCIJ jurisdiction to acceptances of ICJ jurisdiction \"for the period which they still have to run.\"30 Since Bulgaria's acceptance of PCIJ jurisdiction was not \"still in force\" at the time it became Party to the ICJ Statute, the Court ruled that to exercise jurisdiction over it \"would be to disregard... the principle according to which the jurisdiction of the Court is conditional upon the consent of the respondent, and to regard as sufficient a consent which is merely presumed.\"31 Finally, in *East Timor* the ICJ held that it could not evaluate the lawfulness of the acts of a State that had not consented to the Court's jurisdiction: \"Whatever the nature of the obligations invoked, the court could not rule on the lawfulness of the conduct of a State when its judgment would imply an evaluation of the lawfulness of the conduct of another State which is not a party to the case.\"32\n\n*Case of the S.S.

The French Government was claiming that Turkish courts could not exercise jurisdiction over a French national in charge of a French ship that made port in Constantinople after colliding with a Turkish vessel in the high seas absent a showing that the exercise of such jurisdiction was compatible with international law. *Case of the S.S.

Rep. 127, 135-36 (27 July), *available at* http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/35/2325.pdf (quoting Article 36, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice which states as follows: \"Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and which are still in force shall be deemed, as between the parties to the present Statute, to be acceptances of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice for the period which they still have to run and in accordance with their terms.\"); *see also infra* the discussion on *Anglo-Iranian Oil* in \u00b6 16.\n\n*Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of July 27, 1955*, 1959 I.C.J.

Rep. 90, 102 (30 June), *available at* http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/84/6949.pdf.\n\n11.\n\nGiven their underlying facts and legal reasoning, it is unclear how the Award can construe *Lotus*, *Aerial Incident of July 27, 1955*, and *East Timor* as being applicable to the case at hand, let alone supportive of the Award's novel legal standard of \"affirmative evidence\" or \"demonstrated expression\" of consent. Argentina has accepted the validity and the binding character of the BIT at issue,33 so it is decidedly not in the same position as a State that has not consented at all to its purported international obligations, like Indonesia in *East Timor*. Nor is Argentina's position similar to that of a State whose consent to jurisdiction has lapsed and cannot be reinstated by judicial fiat, like Bulgaria in *Aerial Incident*. Under international jurisprudence, including the cases cited in the Award and discussed *supra*, a State cannot be presumed to have consented to an international obligation unless it has actually done so. Starting from this relatively uncontroversial point, however, the Award seems to be suggesting that even after the State has granted its consent to be bound by certain obligations, as Argentina has done by signing and ratifying the BIT at bar, it cannot be \"presumed\" to have consented with respect to one of those obligations unless there is \"affirmative evidence\" or a \"demonstrated expression\" that it has done so. This syllogistic leap finds no basis in the cases, in logic, or in any source of international law.34\n\n*See* Award \u00b6 258 (\"[O]ne must bear in mind that the Contracting State Parties adopted all of the provisions of the Treaty together as a whole. In one fell swoop they nodded their assent not only to the BIT's objects and purposes, as expressed in the Preamble, but also to the various treatment standards set forth in Articles 1 to 9 (including the MFN clauses) as well as the international dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 10.\").\n\nIn fact, both investor-State jurisprudence and ICJ practice include instances of broad or implicit construction of consent for purposes of jurisdiction as well as arbitral procedure. These authorities cannot be reconciled with the Award's presumption that consent be based on \"affirmative evidence\" or a \"demonstrated expression.\" *See, e.g.*, *Ceskoslovenska Ochodni Banka A.S. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 May 1999) \u00b6\u00b6 49-59, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/CSOB-Jurisdiction1999\\_000.pdf (finding that Slovakia had consented to ICSID arbitration by including in a commercial contract reference to a BIT allegedly not yet in force); *Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Minority Schools)*, Judgment, 1928 PCIJ (ser.

Besides, States remain at liberty to define in broad or narrow terms their grant of consent in the applicable instrument(s). *See supra* n.9. The Award's concurrence with this note in its note 321 is noted.\n\n**B. Satisfaction Of The Dispute Resolution Clause As \"Condition Precedent\" To Jurisdiction Over The MFN Clause**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Award fails to link explicitly its adopted standard of \"affirmative evidence\" of consent to its analysis of the effect of the MFN clause on the BIT's 18-month domestic courts clause.35 Still, in my view, the Award's MFN analysis remains problematic as it stands. With respect to the text of the Treaty, I agree of course that the employment of the term \"shall\" in the BIT's dispute resolution clause, including with respect to litigation in domestic courts for 18 months, denotes an obligation, not an option. I note, however, that the term \"shall\" appears equally in each paragraph of Article 3, the MFN clause, according to which \"[n]either Contracting Party *shall* accord investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party... treatment less favourable....\" (emphasis added). Consequently, the existence of mandatory language alone does not define the relationship between the two clauses.\n\nFor purposes of its analysis, the Award has defined the Argentina-Germany BIT as the \"Basic Treaty\" and the Argentina-Chile BIT as the \"Comparator Treaty\". Award \u00b6 244. This Opinion uses those terms in the same sense.\n\n13.\n\nThe Award, nonetheless, defines their relationship as follows:\n\n[T]he BIT clearly empowers investors to claim and receive compensation for MFN violations. The immediately foregoing analysis... has indicated that fulfilment of the 18-month domestic courts submission provision constitutes a condition precedent to the host State's consent to submit a particular dispute to investor-state arbitration... Taken together, these two conclusions suggest that a claimant wishing to raise an MFN claim under the German-Argentine BIT -whether on procedural or substantive grounds - lacks standing to do so until it has fulfilled the domestic courts proviso. To put it more concretely, since the Claimant has not yet satisfied the necessary condition precedent to Argentina's consent to international arbitration, its MFN arguments are not yet properly before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is therefore presently without jurisdiction to rule on any MFN-based claims unless the MFN clauses themselves supply the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction.36\n\nIn other words, according to the Award, \"shall\" in Article 10 of the BIT somehow trumps \"shall\" in Article 3 of the same treaty. The Award's disavowal of such a \"trumping\" in its note 355 is unpersuasive. The Award's basic threshold problem is that it regards the BIT's 18-month provision as a jurisdictional hurdle rather than an issue of admissibility. The Award should have adopted the very cogent reasoning of the recent *Hochtief* Award, which concluded at the end of an exhaustive analysis of the identical issue under the identical Argentina-Germany BIT as follows: \"It regards the 18-month period as a condition relating to the manner in which the right to have recourse to arbitration must be exercised - as a provision going to the *admissibility* of the claim rather than the *jurisdiction* of the Tribunal.\"37\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.\n\n*Hochtief AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 Oct. 2011) \u00b6 96, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/Hochtief\\_v\\_Argentina\\_Jurisdiction\\_24Oct2011\\_En.pdf (majority opinion) (emphasis added).\n\n14.\n\nBefore addressing the question whether \"the MFN clauses themselves supply the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction,\" however, it is necessary to make three observations regarding the cited \"foregoing analysis.\"38 First, I do not see the relevance of the Award's discussion of \"cooling-off\" or \"good faith negotiation\" periods, since that requirement is not at issue here, nor can it properly be analogized to an 18-month domestic court provision.39 Tribunals have allowed claimants to circumvent a \"cooling-off\" period, even if the latter is cast in mandatory terms in the applicable treaty, based on the determination that any attempt at settlement would have been futile.40 A prominent example of such an approach is the Award on Jurisdiction in *Ethyl Corp. v. Canada*, where the Tribunal dispensed claimant from the six-month \"cooling-off\" period required under Articles 1118 and 1120 of the NAFTA although claimant had filed for arbitration *five days* after the enactment of the allegedly injurious legislation.41\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 200-01.\n\nThe Award's concurrence with this sentence recorded in its note 341 is noted. Treaty clauses providing for, or even requiring, amicable consultations between the parties prior to engaging in dispute resolution have been considered as matters of procedure and not jurisdiction. *See, e.g.*, *Biwater v. Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008) *\u00b6* 343, ***available at***  http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC1589\\_En& caseId=C67 (holding that the clause establishing a consultation period was \"procedural and directory in nature, rather than jurisdictional and mandatory\" because \"[i]ts underlying purpose is to facilitate opportunities for amicable settlement... not to impede or obstruct arbitration proceedings, where such settlement is not possible\"); *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award (3 Sept. 2001) \u00b6 187, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/LauderAward.pdf (\"[T]he Arbitral Tribunal considers that this requirement of a six-month waiting period... of the Treaty is not a jurisdictional provision, i.e. a limit set to the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to decide the merits of the dispute, but a procedural rule....\"). The *Lauder* Tribunal held further that staying the arbitral proceedings to satisfy the waiting period in the BIT would \"amount to an unnecessary, overly formalistic approach which would not serve to protect any legitimate interests of the Parties.\" *Id.* \u00b6 190. *But see* *Enron Corp. and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 Jan. 2004) \u00b6 88, ***available at***  http://www.asil.org/ilib/Enron.pdf (stating in *dicta* that the amicable consultations requirement is jurisdictional in nature). Given the divided investor-State jurisprudence on this question, the author of this Opinion is not prepared to accept either the Award's analogy of time-limited consultation clauses to 18-month clauses, which in any event is useless for purposes of this case, or the Award's sweeping generalization that \"[a]ll BIT-based dispute resolution provisions... are by their very nature jurisdictional.\" Award \u00b6 193.\n\nThe author of this Opinion is reluctant to accept the analysis of amicable consultation clauses as jurisdictional requirements in *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 June 2010) \u00b6 310 ff., **available at**  http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC1530\\_En& caseId=C300, and *Murphy Exploration and Prod.

Neither of those cases showed convincingly that such clauses are indeed jurisdictional, or, more critically, addressed the question whether the parties were even remotely likely to reach amicable settlement with respect to the claims that were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Thus, their respective rulings on this issue appear formalistic and inefficient. *See Murphy Exploration*, Partial Dissenting Opinion of Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n (19 Nov. 2010), *available at* http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC1813\\_En& caseId=C267 (opining that the Tribunal committed factual error in finding that the consultation period had not been satisfied and observing that \"forcing [Claimant], after more than two years and a half in arbitration, to envisage now a negotiating stage of uncertain future given the history of the relationship of the Parties... does not marry well with the concept of a reasonably fast and efficient access to the arbitral instances provided for in the BIT and seriously impairs [Claimant's] right to access arbitral justice....\").\n\nThe *Ethyl* Tribunal found that: \"The Tribunal has been given no reason to believe that any \u2018consultation or negotiation' pursuant to Article 1118... was even possible. It is argued, therefore, that no purpose would be served by any further suspension of Claimant's right to proceed.\" *Ethyl Corp. v. Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction (24 June 1998) \u00b6 84, *available at* http://www.naftaclaims.com/Disputes/Canada/EthylCorp/EthylCorpAwardOnJurisdiction.pdf.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, the Award dismisses too hastily the argument that it would have been futile for Claimant to attempt to fulfill the BIT's 18-month domestic courts provision by resorting to Argentine courts. According to the Award, \"[w]hile the Claimant submitted an expert opinion suggesting that it would have been \u2018impossible' for the Argentine courts to deliver a final judgment on the Claimant's claims within 18 months, the Respondent rebutted this opinion by citing examples of cases which the Argentine Courts have indeed resolved in 18 months or less.\"42 Note that the Claimant submitted credible evidence in the form of an expert opinion on Argentine law showing that it would have been impossible for the Argentine courts to deliver a final judgment on Claimant's claims within the Treaty-prescribed 18 months.43 Argentina, however, submitted no expert evidence to the contrary. Instead it submitted examples of disputes solved by domestic tribunals within 18 months, including an \"Amparo\" and other \"expeditious\" actions.44 The mere fact of attempted rebuttal cannot carry the day. The Award fails even to attempt an evaluation of the evidence before it on this issue.45\n\nAward \u00b6 191.\n\n*See* Expert Opinion of Javier Errecondo dated 4 June 2008 (submitted with Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction); Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 65-80.\n\n*See* Argentine Republic's Reply Memorial on the Centre's Jurisdiction and Tribunal's Competence, 5 May 2008, Exhs. A RA 20 (\"Judgments of the Argentine Supreme Court\") and A RA 22 (\"Final Judgments\").\n\nFor example, Claimant had argued that: \"The fact that such proceedings can be resolved within 18 months has no relevance to whether an Argentine Court could determine, in what apparently would be a case of first impression, the rights of a foreign shareholder for a violation of a treaty and the amount of compensation therefore [sic]. The issue is whether [Claimant] could submit its claims against Argentina for breaches of the Treaty and obtain an acceptable quantification of damages for those breaches within an 18-month period, not whether it or any other entity could have contested the constitutionality of the provisions.\" *See* Claimant's Rejoinder on the Objections of the Argentine Republic to the Centre's Jurisdiction and the Tribunal's Competence, 9 June 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\n16.\n\nThird, the Award improperly relies on *Anglo-Iranian Oil* to support its conclusion that the BIT's 18-month domestic courts provision is a \"condition precedent\" to Argentina's consent to be bound by the MFN clause. The Award analogizes the 18-month clause to \"Iran's acceptance of the ICJ's jurisdiction over disputes arising under the two [UK treaties which] was a condition precedent to the UK's standing to raise its MFN claims before the Court.\"46 This analogy is false in that the legal issue in **Anglo-Iranian** was fundamentally different from this case. **Anglo-Iranian** addressed a scenario in which Iran had not consented to adjudicate in a certain forum obligations undertaken prior to a specific date\u2014including the treaties the United Kingdom wished to rely on for purposes of its MFN claim. Iran's consent thus being absent, the Court lacked any power to \"re-construct\" that consent via the MFN clause in the Basic Treaties. This holding is consistent with more recent rulings in investor-State cases that have refused to extend MFN protection in the absence of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*,47 but it is plainly inapposite to the question of the effect of MFN on the Basic Treaty's 18-month domestic courts clause when the State's consent to the obligations contained in both the Basic Treaty and the Comparator Treaty remains valid.\n\nAward \u00b6 203.\n\n*See* *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003) \u00b6 74, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/Tecnicas\\_001.pdf (ruling that the Contracting Parties' consent to arbitration was premised on the condition, contained in a temporal limitation clause, that such arbitration commence within three years from the time of the claimant's injury; consequently, claimant could not circumvent the temporal limitation by operation of the MFN clause).\n\n**C. The Award's Interpretation Of The MFN Clause**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nSimilar to its \"affirmative evidence\" and \"demonstrated expression\" analysis, the Award's view on the manner in which the MFN clause affects the 18-month domestic courts requirement is misplaced. In the course of its discussion, the Award misconstrues: i) the meaning of the word \"treatment\"; ii) the position taken by the overwhelming majority of investor-State tribunals on whether an MFN clause can operate to bypass an 18-month clause; iii) the significance of the State Parties' treaty practice; iv) the MFN clause's requirement that the relevant \"treatment\" be \"in the territory\" of the host State; v) the consequences of the explicitly stated exceptions to MFN treatment in the BIT; and vi) the question whether the 18-month clause constitutes \"less favorable treatment\". I address sequentially these flaws in the Award's reasoning, each of which in my view is fatal to the Award's overall ruling.\n\ni. **The Meaning Of \"Treatment\"**\n---------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Award begins its evaluation of the scope of the MFN clause appropriately by examining the plain language of the MFN clause, and specifically the meaning of the word \"treatment.\" The basis on which it conducts its examination, however, is puzzling, since it relies exclusively on the meaning of \"treatment\" in a single extraneous document, the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment.48 Before addressing the content of the Guidelines, it is important to note that the Award has offered no analysis under the Vienna Convention, which governs the interpretation of the Treaty, of the reasons that led it to ascribe such great significance to materials so marginally related to the Treaty at issue. It is plain that the Award has omitted several mandatory steps of that analysis, which must commence with the inquiry as to the \"ordinary meaning\" of the treaty's terms \"in their context and in the light of [the treaty's] object and purpose.\"49 The Vienna Convention does allow the use of \"supplementary\" materials such as the Guidelines \"to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31\" or if the Article 31 inquiry \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\" or \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"50 The Award, however, has not applied any of these provisions.51 In this connection, the Award does not address adequately the fact that at least nine prior awards, either through detailed analysis or by necessary implication, have concluded that \"treatment\" is broad enough to include dispute settlement and allow circumvention of the 18-month clause.52\n\nWorld Bank, Guidelines on the *Treatment* of Foreign Direct Investment (1992), *reprinted in* 31 I.L.M. 1363 (1992) (\"World Bank Guidelines\" or \"Guidelines\"), *available at* http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/WorldBank.pdf (emphasis added).\n\n*See* VCLT Art. 31; *see also* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1966), Arts. 27-28 (from which VCLT Articles 31 and 32 emerged virtually unchanged), cmt. 8 (\"Once it is established... that the starting point of interpretation is the meaning of the text, logic indicates the \u2018ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose' should be the first element to be mentioned. Similarly, logic suggests that the elements comprised in the \u2018context' should be the next to be mentioned since they form part of or are intimately related to the text. Again, it is only logic which suggests that... a subsequent agreement regarding the interpretation, subsequent practice establishing the understanding of the parties regarding the interpretation and relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties - should follow and not precede the elements in the previous paragraphs.\").\n\n*See* VCLT Art. 32\n\nThe analysis of the Treaty's \"object and purpose\" near the end of the Award's analysis of the MFN clause (*see* Award \u00b6\u00b6 254-60) illustrates starkly the Award's failure to comply with the interpretive framework of the Vienna Convention.\n\n*See infra* n.67.\n\n19.\n\nRegarding the Guidelines themselves, I cannot accept the Award's construction of \"treatment\" in the BIT based on the interpretation of a document that, by its own terms, expressly eschews any intention to define, let alone substitute for, the terms of the Treaty.53 Relying on the classical rule of interpretation known as the \"principle of contemporaneity,\" the Award rests its entire textual analysis exclusively on the Guidelines, which date to 1992, because allegedly they are the source most \"contemporaneous\" with the Treaty, which was signed in 1991.54 The Award then proceeds to argue that the Guidelines provide \"some evidence\" that in 1991-92 the term \"treatment\" did not include dispute settlement, solely because the section titled \"Treatment\" within the Guidelines does not refer to dispute settlement, which appears in a different section of the Guidelines.55 For all its emphasis on document titles, however, the Award fails to answer this first-order question: Since the overall title of the document is \"Guidelines for the *Treatment* of Foreign Direct Investment,\" why then would not the term \"Treatment\" apply equally to the section on \"Settlement of Disputes\" contained in that document?56\n\nThe Guidelines' preamble states that \"these guidelines *are not* ultimate standards but an important step in the *evolution* of generally acceptable international standards which complement, but *do not substitute for*, bilateral investment treaties.\" World Bank Guidelines, Preamble (emphasis added).\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 220, 222-24.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 223-24.\n\nThe Award's only response to this point is to say in its note 393 that \"[t]his suggestion is puzzling\" since \"[a] document's title cannot function as more than a summary of its general topic, let alone an exhaustive statement of its entire contents.\"\n\n20.\n\nMore importantly, the Award's reasoning betrays a profound misunderstanding of the protections that the Guidelines list as elements of \"treatment\". As the Award notes, the Guidelines' discussion of \"treatment\" covers, *inter alia*, \"fair and equitable treatment; treatment as favorable as that accorded to national investors in similar circumstances; full protection and security; treatment that does not discriminate among foreign investors on the grounds of nationality;... and finally the prevention and control of corrupt business practices and the promotion of accountability and transparency in dealings with foreign investors.\"57 According to the Award, none of these species of \"treatment\" \" *even touches upon* the international (as distinguished from domestic) settlement of disputes.\"58 It has been the rule for *decades* before the Guidelines came into existence that fair and equitable treatment includes proper and timely access to dispute settlement, as well as observance of judicial and administrative due process.59 Relatedly, there is no doubt that under customary international law as well as modern investor-State jurisprudence denial of justice is closely linked to, if not a part of, the fair and equitable treatment requirement.60 Thus, I am unable to comprehend the Award's utter failure to recognize the well-established and intimate relationship between an investor's \"treatment\" by the host State and dispute settlement, whether in the context of the Guidelines or as a matter of international law.61 It is difficult to imagine a more fundamental aspect of an investor's \"treatment\" by a host Government than that investor's ability to exercise and defend its legal rights by prompt access to dispute settlement mechanisms, and fair and efficient administration of justice.62\n\nAward \u00b6 223 (citations omitted).\n\nAward \u00b6 223 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Award's \"agree[ment]\" with this sentence and the following one in its note 391 is noted. That note's distinction between domestic and international proceedings, however, is not accepted by the author of this Opinion as being relevant. *See* Draft Convention on Responsibility of States for Damage Done in Their Territory to the Person or Property of Foreigners (1929) (also known as the \"1929 Harvard Draft Convention\") (identifying as elements of the minimum standard of treatment, **inter alia**, responsibility for denial of justice, including delay or obstruction of access to courts and gross deficiency in the administration of the judicial or remedial process); *The* *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award (11 Oct. 2002) \u00b6 127, *available at* http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/14442.pdf (\"In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned [US court] decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment.\"); *see also* *Loewen*, Award \u00b6 137 (\"[In this case] the whole trial and its resultant verdict were clearly improper and discreditable and cannot be squared with minimum standards of international law and fair and equitable treatment.\").\n\nTo the extent the Award means to raise the familiar argument that \"treatment\" applies to \"primary rules\" such as substantive protections, and not to \"secondary rules\" such as remedies, the *Renta 4* Tribunal has addressed and rejected that argument convincingly:  \n It may be that some international lawyers reflexively adopt the dichotomy of primary/secondary obligations made familiar by the International Law Commission. This might explain the temptation to consider \"treatment\" a matter of primary or substantive rules and thus distinct from \"secondary\" rules - such as remedies - in the event of a breach.   \nThere is no authority for the proposition that MFN is limited to \"primary\" rules. The established proper criterion is rather *ejusdem generis*.  \n*Renta 4* \u00b6\u00b6 99-100. Certain tribunals have opined that dispute settlement actually is a substantive protection covered by the MFN clause. *See, e.g.*, *Gas Natural SDG, S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision on Jurisdiction (17 June 2005) \u00b6 31, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/GasNaturalSDG-DecisiononPreliminaryQuestionsonJurisdiction.pdf (\"The Tribunal holds that provision for international investor-state arbitration in bilateral investment treaties is a significant substantive incentive and protection for foreign investors.\").\n\nThe Award's approval of this \"uncontroversial observation\" in its note 378 is noted. *See also Siemens*, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 102 (ruling that a \"distinctive feature\" of BITs is \"special dispute settlement mechanisms not normally open to investors. Access to these mechanisms is part of the protection offered under the Treaty. It is part of the treatment of foreign investors and investments....\"); *Suez,* Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 57 (\"From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the stated purposes of the Argentina-Spain BIT, dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BIT and is an integral part of the investment protection regime that two sovereign states, Argentina and Spain, have agreed upon.\"); *Gas Natural*, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 49 (\"We remain persuaded that assurance of independent international arbitration is an important -perhaps the most important - element in investor protection.\"); *Hochtief*, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 68, 72 (\"The Tribunal considers that the provisions of Article 10, which on any interpretation confer upon investors the possibility of recourse to arbitration in addition to the right to have recourse to national courts, are a form of protection that is enjoyed within the scope of \u2018the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment'... Article 10 is a benefit conferred on investors and designed to protect their interests and the interests of a State Party in its capacity as a host State party to a dispute with an investor: it is a protective right that sits alongside the guarantees against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, expropriation, and so on... Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the MFN provision is in principle applicable to the pursuit of dispute settlement procedures.\").\n\n21.\n\nAdditionally, if \"treatment\" can encompass dispute settlement when it is used in a BIT as part of legal standards such as \"fair and equitable treatment,\" it should include dispute settlement when it is used, in the same BIT, as part of the MFN provision requiring that the investor receive \"treatment no less favorable\" than investors of third countries. It is a well-established canon of treaty interpretation that the use of the same term within the same instrument denotes the same ordinary meaning, absent evidence to the contrary.63\n\nIn this respect it is telling that the Guidelines consider \"most favored nation\" and \"fair and equitable\" as different protections pertaining to the same \"treatment.\" World Bank Guidelines at 3-5. Notably, the Respondent in this case has not argued, based on Art. 31(4) of the VCLT or any other evidence, that a \"special,\" more restrictive meaning should be given to the term \"treatment\" for purposes of applying the MFN clause as opposed to the \"fair and equitable treatment\" clause. The burden of showing the applicability of a \"special\" meaning of a term lies with the party pleading such a meaning. *See Legal Status of Eastern Greenland (Denmark v. Norway)*, 1933 PCIJ (ser. A/B) No. 53 at 49 (5 Apr.), *available at* http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie\\_AB/AB\\_53/01\\_Groenland\\_Oriental\\_Arret.pdf (holding that \"[i]f it is alleged by one of the Parties that some unusual or exceptional meaning is to be attributed to [a treaty term], it lies on that Party to establish its contention\").\n\n22.\n\nThe Award, furthermore, does not address the fact that BIT Article 3(2) accords Claimant MFN treatment with respect not only to \"investments\" but also to \"activities in connection with investments in [the host State's] territory\". Ad Article 3(a) of the Treaty provides that the term \"activity\" in Article 3(2) includes \"the management, use, enjoyment, and disposal of an investment.\" Taken in their ordinary meaning, the \"management, use, enjoyment, and disposal of an investment\" necessarily entail the defense and exercise of legal rights via dispute settlement mechanisms,64 bolstering the argument that the Award's narrow view of \"treatment\" is unsustainable under the terms of the Treaty.\n\n*See* *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation*, SCC Arbitration No. V 079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction (Oct. 2007) \u00b6 130, *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/RosInvestjurisdiction\\_decision\\_2007\\_10\\_001.pdf (holding, in the context of the UK-Russia BIT, that \"the submission to arbitration forms a highly relevant part of the corresponding protection for the investor by granting him, in case of interference with his \u2018use' and \u2018enjoyment', procedural options of obvious and great significance compared to the sole option of challenging such interference before the domestic courts of the host state\").\n\nii. **Nine Of The Eleven Public Awards To Date Have Held That The 18-Month Provisions In Argentina's BITs Are Overcome Via Their MFN Clauses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn addition, the Award's attempt to describe an absence of \"common state practice\" with respect to the scope of MFN \"treatment\" is irrelevant for purposes of answering the question before us, namely how the BIT's MFN provision affects the Treaty's 18-month domestic courts requirement. According to the Award, \"[a] brief look at the ways in which various investor-state tribunals and states have since resolved the question proves that neither the arbitral community nor more importantly... common state practice has yet reached a consensus....\"65 The Award proceeds to state that \"at least nine\" tribunals \"have found that a particular BIT's MFN clause\" includes dispute settlement, \"while another ten have reached the opposite result... This relatively even split shows that there is as yet no established *opinio juris*.\"66\n\nAward \u00b6 268.\n\nAward \u00b6 268.\n\n24.\n\nThis conclusion lumps together cases concerning such diverse applications of the MFN clause that the Award's attempt at presenting a \"divided field\" is meaningless. The Award's description of this point in its paragraph 269 as \"a distinction without a difference\" is unpersuasive. The fact that some awards are critical of others does not do away with the palpable differences in their underlying facts and legal arguments. Here, to the contrary, we are confronted with the specific issue of whether the MFN clause is broad enough to permit Claimant to eschew resorting to the Argentine courts for 18 months. In this respect, the weight of authority overwhelmingly favors one answer: of the eleven known investor-State tribunals that have considered this particular question, all of them interpreting Argentine BITs, nine have ruled in the affirmative.67\n\n*Maffezini v.

Argentina*,68 whose reasoning thus is not only contrary to the *opinio juris*, but also flawed in important respects. For example, the *Wintershall* Tribunal held that the claimant in that case sought to rely on the MFN clause to gain access to a \"different system of arbitration\" because, while the Basic Treaty provided for ICSID arbitration, the Comparator Treaty provided for both ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration.69 The Tribunal's reasoning, however, failed to take into account that the claimant in **Wintershall** never attempted to gain access to UNCITRAL arbitration\u2014as the *Wintershall* Award explicitly acknowledged: \"Claimants assert that the BIT gives them the option to submit the investment dispute with Argentina *to ICSID arbitration* without prior referral to the domestic courts of Argentina....\"70 Besides, the Basic Treaty also contained a choice between ICSID and UNCITRAL, albeit one that was premised on the existence of agreement between the parties to the arbitration and on the State Parties being parties to the ICSID Convention.71 That difference between the Basic and Comparator Treaties hardly justifies the **Wintershall** Tribunal's conclusion that claimant sought to avail itself of a \"different system of arbitration.\" Such significant errors cannot help but call into question any analysis based on them.72\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v.

Had the Award continued to abide by that principle, on its own analysis the result would *not* have been, as the Award concludes, that Article 10 was \"for no good reason at all,\"77 since the Argentina-Germany BIT was the fourth of Argentina's very first five BITs to be concluded, all five of which included the 18-month provision.78\n\n*See RosInvestCo*, Award on Jurisdiction \u00b6 42 (\"[T]he main focus of... [the Tribunal's] attention has to be not the policies which either one or the other Contracting Party brought to the negotiating table (and which might of course have been widely different from one another) but what they agreed on, as embodied in the terms of their treaty.\").\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 263-64.\n\nAward \u00b6 263. The Award's criticism of this sentence and paragraph 28 at its notes 445 and 449 is premised on conclusions of the Award which this Opinion rejects.\n\n*See* Award, Appendix 1. Dates of entry into force, set forth in Appendix 2 to the Award, are of little use, since, as the Appendix demonstrates, entry into force is rarely contemporaneous with signature.\n\n28.\n\nMoreover, the Award's syllogism assumes improperly that MFN clauses obligate claimants to rely on their protections, leading to automatic ineffectiveness of 18-month clauses in subsequent Argentine BITs; each claimant, however, is master of its own plea, and can comply with a BIT's 18-month clause if it so chooses. Thus, the circumvention of the 18-month clause by operation of the MFN clause in this case hardly deprives the 18-month clauses of effectiveness in subsequent Argentine BITs.79\n\nThe Award in its note 445 brands this point \"disingenuous.\" It overlooks: (1) the fact that this Opinion agrees with other awards that a choice among alternative dispute settlement procedures is more favorable than no choice; and (2) the fact that \"shall\" in the 18-month provision is predicated on a party invoking it, which neither did.\n\n29.\n\nThe Award's argument as to the import of the exchange of diplomatic notes on the Argentina-Panama BIT after the *Siemens* Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, quite apart from its sudden abandonment of the \"classical rule\" of contemporaneity, is far from relevant. According to the Award, in the wake of the **Siemens** Award, Argentina and Panama exchanged notes with respect to the BIT between them, clarifying that the MFN clause in that treaty does not apply to dispute settlement, and that this was always their intention.80 The Award finds it significant that the Argentina-Panama BIT does not contain an 18-month clause, and that \"[i]ts dispute resolution provisions are instead similar to those of the Chile-Argentina BIT relied upon by the Claimant.\"81 Even if the stated intentions of Panama and Argentina with respect to the MFN clause could somehow be transposed successfully onto the BIT between Chile and Argentina, which they cannot, one is quite unable to see the significance of the purported scope of the MFN clause in either the Panama-Argentina BIT or the Chile-Argentina BIT, when the issue in this case is the scope of the MFN clause in the Germany-Argentina BIT. The Award's view that the post-**Siemens** exchange of notes between Panama and Argentina constitutes \"supplementary means\" of interpreting the Basic Treaty appears confused in important respects82 and is ultimately wrong.\n\nAward \u00b6 272. Ironically, the Award quotes the *National Grid* decision as factual support for the exchange of notes between Panama and Argentina. The Tribunal in that case, however, dismissed those same notes for purposes of interpreting the Argentina-UK BIT in the following categorical terms: \"The Tribunal has not been furnished with any evidence that at any point in time an interpretation of such nature was considered by either party to the [Argentina-UK] Treaty. Neither has the Tribunal received any evidence that the Argentine Republic adopted similar interpretations of the MFN clause incorporated in the more than 50 bilateral investment treaties concluded with other States parties.\" *National Grid,* Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 85.\n\nAward \u00b6 272.\n\nOne possible explanation for this confusion is that the Award assumes that the provisions of the Comparator Treaty relate to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, which they certainly do not. *See* International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses* (1978), Art. 8 (\"The right of the beneficiary State to mostfavoured-nation treatment arises only from the most-favoured-nation clause... in force between the granting State and the beneficiary State.\"); *see also id.* Art. 8, cmt. 1 (the MFN clause \"is the source of the beneficiary State's rights\"); **id.** Art. 8, cmt. 3 (\"the right of the beneficiary State to a certain advantageous treatment does not derive from the treaty concluded between the granting State and the third State\"); **id.** Art. 8, cmt. 7 (\"The root of the right of the beneficiary State is obviously the treaty containing the clause. The extent of the favours to which the beneficiary of that clause may lay claim will be determined by the actual favours extended by the granting State to the third State.\").\n\n30.\n\nSimilarly, apart from its lack of \"contemporaneity,\" I am mystified by the Award's statement that \"the only known clarifications issued by other states since the advent of the *Maffezini* decision have gone in the direction of confirming that the contracting state parties did not intend for their MFN clauses... to reach international dispute resolution.\"83 The Award's evidence for this statement consists of a single citation to a footnote in the negotiating history of CAFTA, which simply cannot be accepted as an adequate sample of the \"known clarifications [on the scope of MFN] issued by other states since the advent of... **Maffezini** \". What's more, the Award's statement contradicts the fact that, in 2002, *i.e.*, two years after the issuance of the **Maffezini** decision, the United Kingdom entered into a BIT with Bosnia-Herzegovina that explicitly applies that BIT's MFN clause to that treaty's dispute settlement provisions.84\n\nAward \u00b6 273.\n\n*See Bilateral Investment Treaties*, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, *available at* http://www.unctadxi.org/templates/docsearch\\_\\_\\_\\_779.aspx. The Award's note 466 stating that this neither \"constitute[d] a change in or clarification of the UK's policy\" nor can it \"imply an evolution in the general understanding shared by the majority of states\" is of no effect. Clearly a State continuing its MFN practice in BITs following *Maffezini* implies acceptance of its results. This Opinion obviously rejects the Award's notion that there is a \"majority of states\" favoring this Award's conclusions.\n\n31.\n\nThe Award embraces an even more sweeping proposition: \"It is striking,\" the Award observes, that \"Argentina, Panama, Colombia, the DR-CAFTA countries (including the US), the EU Commission, and Switzerland (the latter three together representing a majority of the world's highly developed and capital exporting countries) all converge in signaling that the specified MFN clauses do not, and *were never intended to*, reach the international dispute resolution provisions of the respectively mentioned investment agreements.\"85\n\nAward \u00b6 276 (emphasis added). The Award has swept along the United States as one of the \"capital exporting countries\" that allegedly share the Award's theory of the scope of MFN. **See** Award \u00b6 277. According to 2010 data, the United States is by far the world's highest capital exporter as measured by Foreign Direct Investment, with more such investment than France and the United Kingdom combined. **See** https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2199rank.html. As the Award implicitly concedes, however, at its note 465, no clarity exists currently as to United States policy on the MFN issue.\n\n32.\n\nThe evidence for the Award's diagnosis of a \"common understanding\" with respect to the scope of MFN clauses consists of the CAFTA footnote referenced above, the 2006 BIT between Switzerland and Colombia, and a 2006 Issue Paper by the European Commission containing a recommendation as to the scope of MFN treatment in \"future EU BITs.\"86 Since, as the Award accepts, the policy of the United States, the only major capital-exporting member of CAFTA, is inconclusive,87 the CAFTA footnote does not support the Award's point. It also seems trivial to observe that a non-binding, general recommendation in a European Commission Issue Paper hardly translates into established EU-wide treaty policy,88 just as a single Swiss-Colombia BIT cannot be considered as serious evidence of those countries having \"clarified\" their investment treaty practice in reaction to *Maffezini* more than on that \"one occasion.\"89 More significantly, all of these materials post-date the Treaty at issue by several years, and none of these materials purports to apply retroactively. Yet, still disregarding the principle of \"contemporaneity\" on which it has based much of its analysis, the Award suggests that these minimal and inconclusive sources are sufficient to infer not only the state of affairs in 2006 and beyond, but also what was *always intended* by \"the majority of the world's... capital exporting countries\" with respect to the scope of MFN. This conclusion simply lacks any foundation.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 273-76.\n\n*See supra* n.85.\n\nIn fact, nothing in the European Commission's recently published Proposed Regulation on Transitional Arrangements for Bilateral Investment Agreements suggests the official establishment of an EU-wide policy on MFN similar to that recounted in the Award. *See* Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries (7 July 2010), *available at* http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2010/july/tradoc\\_146308.pdf. Even if such a policy were established today, it would have been irrelevant for purposes of interpreting the BIT, which dates to 1991. The fact, as the Award states, in its note 464, that \"no EU document has yet been issued endorsing the *Maffezini* approach or suggesting its incorporation into EU policy\" is, accordingly, a *non-sequitur*.\n\nAward \u00b6 274. The Award fails to recognize that its finding of a \"clarification\" in 2006 does not preclude that prior to 2006, which includes the relevant period for purposes of interpreting the Germany-Argentina BIT, Switzerland and Colombia *did* extend MFN protection to dispute settlement. In any case, there is credible evidence that the Award\u2019s understanding of Swiss investment policy is simply wrong - and ultimately irrelevant to the interpretation of the BIT, as it is based on *ex post* evidence. *See* Anne K. Hoffmann, *Bilateral Investment Treaty Overview - Switzerland* (2008) \u00a7 B.1, *available at* www.investmentclaims.com (\"The Swiss authorities maintain that there is no particular policy concerning the BITs concluded by Switzerland. It continues to negotiate BITs, thereby further enlarging its already extensive treaty network. Most favoured nation (\u2018MFN\u2019) as well as umbrella clauses are constant features of Swiss BITs and will continue to be.\").\n\niv. **What \"Treatment\" Must Be \"In The Territory\" Of Argentina?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Award also misapplies the MFN clause's requirement that the \"treatment\" of which the investor complains take place \"in the territory\" of the host State. After setting aside appropriately the question whether the MFN clause applies to dispute settlement, the Award proceeds on the assumption that the relevant \"treatment\" is \"international arbitration,\" and devotes several paragraphs to the exploration of arguments that place such arbitration outside the realm of the host State.90 However, Article 3 of the BIT provides a cause of action when the \"treatment\" of the foreign investor is \"less favorable than the treatment accorded [by the host State to]... investments of nationals or companies of any third country.\" In this case, the \"less favorable\" treatment that gives rise to the MFN violation is the requirement to resort to local courts for 18 months. As the Award accepts, \"[t]he host state's obligation extends... [to] providing the covered investor with \u2018treatment' in respect of... domestic dispute resolution treatment... to third-state investors.\"91 It is precisely in recognition of this fact that the Tribunal in *Hochtief* recently has ruled under the identical Argentina-Germany BIT that: \"[T]he relevant treatment is the reliance by [Argentina], not having invoked Article 10(2), upon Article 10(3) and the refusal of Argentina to submit to immediate arbitration as the Claimant wishes. That conduct cannot be said to be conduct outside the territory of [Argentina] for the purposes of Article 3 of the BIT.\"92 The Award has once again committed conceptual error by considering the \"more favorable\" treatment in the Comparator Treaty as the basis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.93 Thus, the Award's entire discussion on the MFN clause's requirement that \"treatment\" occur \"in the territory\" is utterly irrelevant for purposes of this case.94\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 226-32. While discussing the meaning of \"in its territory\" the Award engages in piecemeal application of the Vienna Convention without acknowledging its primacy as interpretive guide.\n\nAward \u00b6 228.\n\n*Hochtief*, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 111.\n\n*Cf. supra* n.82. Thus it is not, as the Award states in its note 396, a question of this writer's lapsed \"affinity for the Roman law maxim *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*.\"\n\nThe Award adds that \"the absence of the expression \u2018all matters'... [in the Treaty] is consistent with the conclusions which the Tribunal has already reached on the basis of its analysis of the terms \u2018treatment' and \u2018in its territory'....\" Award \u00b6 236. The author of this Opinion, to the contrary, finds that the absence of such language does not affect this analysis, a conclusion the Award agrees was reached by the *Siemens*, *National Grid*, and *RosInvest* Tribunals. Award nn.413-14 and accompanying text.\n\nv. **The Exceptions To The MFN Clause Involve Extraterritorial Dispute Resolution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Award's two arguments regarding the enumerated exceptions to the BIT's MFN clauses are also misplaced. The first one relies on the mistaken assumption that the relevant \"treatment\" for MFN purposes is international arbitration.95 Specifically, the Award argues that \"the MFN treatment exceptions mentioned in the German-Argentine BIT - like those found in most BITs - refer exclusively to types of treatment normally occurring within the territory of the host state.\" According to the Award, since the MFN clause also applies only within the territory of the host State, extraterritorial treatment such as international arbitration need not be part of the enumerated exceptions.96 As explained above, the \"treatment\" that gives rise to the MFN violation *, i.e.*, the requirement to resort to local courts, satisfies the territorial requirement; thus, the Award's argument actually supports the conclusion that such \"treatment\" is covered by the MFN clause here.\n\nAward \u00b6 238.\n\nAward \u00b6 238.\n\n35.\n\nThe Award's second argument is that \"all of the typical exceptions to MFN treatment observed in international investment treaties... deal exclusively with the contracting states' direct treatment of foreign investments, never with the international resolution of investor-state disputes arising out of that treatment.\"97 Again, the Award misattributes application of the MFN clause to international arbitration rather than the 18-month domestic litigation provisions. Thus any \"sleight of hand\" mentioned in the Award's note 417 is the Award's own. Moreover, assuming the focus were on international arbitration outside of Argentina, the Award neglects to mention that most if not all species of allegedly \"direct\" treatment enumerated as exceptions to MFN treatment in the BIT entail specific mechanisms of dispute settlement, usually outside the territory of the host State. For example, \"preferential treatment\" under a customs union such as MERCOSUR, of which Argentina is a full member, includes access to a dedicated international dispute settlement mechanism.98 Similarly, both \"regional economic integration\" agreements such as those underlying the European Union, and taxation-related treaties such as the UK/Argentina Double Taxation Convention, contain international dispute settlement provisions.99 It is appropriate to infer, by operation of the well-established canon *inclusio unius* *est exclusio alterius*, that dispute settlement in all its variances is encompassed by the Treaty's MFN clause.\n\nAward \u00b6 239.\n\n*See* Treaty Establishing a Common Market between the Argentine Republic, the Federal Republic of Brazil, the Republic of Paraguay and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, Protocol of Ouro Preto (17 Dec. 1994), Chapter VI, arts. 43-44, *available at* http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/mrcsr/ourop/ourop\\_e.asp (providing that disputes between the State Parties shall be settled in accordance with the Brasilia Protocol for the Settlement of Disputes, which provides, *inter alia*, for international arbitration).\n\n*See* Consolidated Version of Treaty on European Union Art. 35, appended to Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and related Acts, Off. J. C 340 (10 Nov. 1997), *available at* http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0145010077 (providing that \"[t]he Court of Justice of the European Communities shall have jurisdiction, subject to the conditions laid down in this Article, to give preliminary rulings on the validity and interpretation of framework decisions, and decisions on the interpretation of conventions established under this Title and on the validity and interpretation of the measures implementing them\"); UK/Argentina Double Taxation Convention (3 Jan. 1996), ratified 1 Aug. 1997, Art. 26, *available at* http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/international/argentina-dtc.pdf (\"Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, *irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic* *law of those States*, address his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident, or... to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national.\") (emphasis added). This latter Convention, providing as it does for a resident investor-taxpayer to \"address his case to the competent authority\" of his host State, refutes the statement in note 417 of the Award that \"all of the examples cited by the Dissenting Opinion involve state-to-state international dispute resolution, not investor versus state.\"\n\nvi. **What \"Treatment\" Is \"Less Favorable?\"**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nFinally, the Award's discussion as to whether the requirement to resort to the Argentine courts for 18 months is \"less favorable\" amounts to mere theorizing. The Award does not explain why requiring Claimant to comply with the 18-month clause is not \"less favorable\" than providing Claimant with the option to circumvent that clause. As the Tribunal in *Renta 4* opined, \"[h]aving options may be thought to be more \u2018favoured' for MFN purposes than not having them.\"100 Likewise, the Tribunal stated in the recent *Hochtief* Award that \"it is always more favourable to have the choice as to which to employ than it is not to have that choice.\"101 The Award's discussion on the costs of domestic litigation versus arbitration102 is irrelevant for purposes of deciding this question.103 Since offering an investor a choice is inherently more favorable than offering it no choice, regardless of which alternative the investor chooses, there is no occasion for any \"invidious... finding... that host State adjudication of treaty rights [is] necessarily inferior to international arbitration.\"104\n\n*Renta 4* \u00b6 92.\n\n*Hochtief*, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 100.\n\nAward \u00b6 245.\n\nEven if the determination of whether the 18-month clause constitutes \"less favorable treatment\" required consideration of case-specific evidence, as the Award seems to suggest, its arguments on the issue are feeble. Similar to its futility analysis (*see supra* \u00b6 15 and n.43) the Award fails completely to take into account expert evidence in the record, uncontradicted by any expert evidence submitted by Argentina, showing the highly burdensome and ultimately fruitless ordeal Claimant would have to undergo in the Argentine courts before ending up precisely where it currently finds itself: in international arbitration proceedings. The evidence submitted by Claimant here shows that requiring it to resort to the Argentine courts for 18 months is an exercise in waste and futility\u2014which, despite evidence of delay and cost cited by the Award (Award \u00b6 246 and n.430) \u2014 cannot be said of international arbitration.\n\nAward n.426.\n\n37.\n\nIn this connection, and given the high standard of proof for the delict of denial of justice or related claims, it is difficult to take seriously the Award's proposed solution of Claimant trying to recoup significant amounts of time and money by bringing additional treaty claims based on its treatment by the Argentine courts.105 Nor am I able to understand the Award's passing comment that Claimant would not have to show denial of justice but \"whether the Claimant, in order to vindicate its legal rights, was discriminatorily (on the grounds of its nationality) forced to bear costs in excess of those imposed upon investors from third countries.\"106 If the Claimant, a foreign investor with a claim that has no domestic equivalent, subjected itself willingly to a process prescribed under the BIT, foregoing MFN protection in the process, on what grounds would it then claim \"discriminatory\" treatment \"on the grounds of its nationality\"?\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 247-50. In this regard, notes 431-34 are especially noteworthy\u2014for two reasons. First, the Award constructs a hypothetical scenario under which Claimant would recover under the MFN clause for actual delay and costs caused by the Argentine courts. Such a scenario, however, is mere fanciful conjecture that misunderstands the manner in which MFN protections operate. At the outset, an advocate for the host State would point out that Claimant waived the objection with respect to the 18-month clause being \"less favorable\" treatment by not raising it prior to appearing before local courts. Moreover, a complaint about \"less favorable treatment\" within the court system is different from arguing that the requirement to resort to the court system itself constitutes \"less favorable treatment.\" All foreign investors that end up in the Argentine courts, for example, likely face the same obstacles, while Argentine litigants by definition cannot bring the same types of claims as foreign investors. Consequently, Claimant could not prove \"less favorable treatment\" based on nationality, and its MFN claim would simply be rejected on the merits. Second, as part of applying MFN to domestic court \"treatment\" the Award finds the MFN clause's territorial requirement satisfied, in direct contradiction to its actual holding. Other than the Award's reference to an actual incurrence of costs by the Claimant, which does not affect the manner in which MFN is applied, the Award does not and cannot explain the difference between its analysis of \"in its territory\" in \u00b6\u00b6 225-31 of the Award and the hypothetical scenario mentioned in notes 431-34. The Award finds that this concern is \"unfounded\" in its note 435. It misses the point, namely that the foreign investor, having been treated equally with other foreign investors, could not prove discrimination.\n\nAward n.434.\n\n38.\n\nIn all, the Award's discussion of the manner in which the BIT's MFN clause affects the Treaty's 18-month clause is not simply unconvincing; it is profoundly wrong. Regrettably, the type and quality of arguments raised by the Award leave no room for agreement with my Tribunal colleagues. In the absence of such agreement, I can only hope my observations above will serve to dispel for others the Award's substantial confusion, and correct the numerous errors that permeate the Award's understanding of the MFN mechanism in investment treaties.\n\n**III. THE STANCE OF PROFESSOR BELLO JANEIRO**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nI must also address the fact that my co-arbitrator, Professor Bello Janeiro, in joining with the Tribunal's President to form the majority in this case, has departed from his position in **Siemens**. It will be recalled that in its Decision on Jurisdiction the **Siemens** Tribunal, of which Professor Bello Janeiro was a member by appointment of Argentina, ruled \"unanimously\" that under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention the term \"treatment\" in the identical Argentina-Germany Treaty as is at issue in the present case encompasses dispute settlement; therefore Claimant could rely on the Treaty's MFN clause to circumvent the Treaty's requirement that it resort to the courts of Argentina for 18 months before being entitled to commence arbitration.107 In the present case, however, in forming a majority with the Tribunal President for dismissal he rejects that conclusion.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 18 and n.52.\n\n40.\n\nProfessor Bello Janeiro consciously expressed himself as joining substantively in the unanimous *****Siemens***** Decision on Jurisdiction. His signature is subscribed thereon together with those of the *****Siemens***** Tribunal President and myself with no expression of any dissent on his part. Professor Bello Janeiro is not of the school that believes that an arbitrator should never express a dissenting view, irrespective of his or her true conclusions. Indeed, in the *****Siemens***** case he subscribed a Separate Opinion on 30 January 2007 dissenting from two holdings of the \"unanimously decide[d]\" Award on the Merits he had signed 11 January 2007 together with the *****Siemens***** Tribunal President and myself.108 To his credit, in his Concurring Opinion Professor Bello Janeiro dispels any uncertainty regarding his earlier views, confirming that he in fact has changed his mind since *****Siemens*****.109\n\n*See Siemens*, Separate Opinion of Professor Bello Janeiro (30 Jan. 2007), *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/Siemens-Argentina-Opinion.pdf.\n\nProfessor Bello Janeiro's asserted reliance in changing his mind on the examples he cites of Professors Albert Jan van den Berg and Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler is, however, clearly misplaced. The fact of the former joining in awards arriving at totally contrary conclusions was not a product of a change of mind, but rather of his declared practice of *nemine dissente* in investor-State disputes. *Compare Enron*, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 Jan. 2004) (holding, **inter alia**, that Argentina could not rely on the necessity defense to avoid liability for acts relating to its 2001 crisis) *with LG&E v.

She has accepted that an MFN clause is broad enough to encompass dispute resolution, while she also has declined to allow use of the MFN clause in a specific case to expand the tribunal's arbitral jurisdiction. *Compare Suez,* Decision on Jurisdiction (16 May 2006) *with* *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (9 Oct. 2009), *available at* http://italaw.com/documents/AustrianAirlinesv.Slovakia.pdf. Although I have expressed disagreement with the merits of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's position in the latter case, her view reflects careful consideration of MFN doctrine and jurisprudence and is entitled to respect. *See Austrian Airlines*, Separate Opinion of Charles N. Brower.\n\n41.\n\nProfessor Bello Janeiro summarizes the reasons for his revised opinion as follows: \"1) judicial practice has become more varied and more awards have been rendered that disagree with the position maintained in the ***Siemens*** arbitration; 2) several States, including Argentina, have since refined the focus of the *Maffezini* / ***Siemens*** awards, leading me to rethink my original conclusion and Argentina's consent to this type of application of the MFN clause; and 3) the ***Siemens*** tribunal did not conduct an analysis of several of the points now covered extensively and very carefully by this award....\"110 The result is that he embraces *Wintershall* and *ICS*111 and spurns *Hochtief* and its eight predecessors.\n\nOpinion of Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro 8.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the \"direct experience in the Hague International Court of Justice\" cited by Professor Bello Janeiro in respect of \"Arbitrator Torres-Bernardez,\" who sat in the *Wintershall* and *ICS* cases, was as Registrar of the Court 1980-86 and subsequently as Judge *ad hoc* in certain cases.\n\n42.\n\nAs I have already indicated, however, (1) the \"case law\" as to 18-month clauses in Argentinean BITs has been that nine out of eleven such cases have ruled that the MFN clause in the Argentinean BIT did enable the claimants to access provisions in other treaties for immediate access to international arbitration, thus avoiding any need to spend 18 months in the courts of Argentina;112 (2) subsequent pronouncements in other contexts by States, including Argentina, are irrelevant for purposes of interpreting the Treaty here in issue;113 and (3) the Award\u2019s discussion of \"several of the points now covered extensively and very carefully\" therein which Argentina had not raised in *Siemens* is profoundly wrong. Professor Bello Janeiro adds nothing to the weak reeds on which the present Award rests.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 23-26\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 27-32.\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n43.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I dissent from the Award on Jurisdiction."}, {"Title": "Opinion of Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro (Award)", "Type": "Concurring Opinion", "Date": "2012-08-16T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Opinion of Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro (Award)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Introductory considerations**\n-------------------------------\n\nI wish to state at the outset that I fully subscribe to the decision proposed by the President of the Tribunal. I find the award to be well founded, since the question of most-favored nation (MFN) treatment is dealt with much more judiciously than in prior cases, in particular *Maffezini1* and *Siemens* (Decision on Jurisdiction). The latter decision was directly based on the former and involved excessive procedural complications.\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, Decision of January 25, 2000, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, ICSID Rep. 212 (2001).\n\nI am of course aware of the arguments put forward both in the *Maffezini* case, with which I am familiar and which I have studied closely because it related particularly to Galicia, where I was born and where I live,2 and in the *Siemens* case.3 I participated in the latter decision, including of course the Decision on Jurisdiction, and endorsed the opinion of the other members of the tribunal specifically in order to ensure the smooth internal functioning of the tribunal. My disagreement related only to aspects with greater actual relevance, repercussion, and substantive content. I had disagreed with many other essential aspects but without success, for the obvious reason that I was in the minority in that arbitration which - I repeat - was marred by excessive procedural complications. If I could, I would of course reveal them in greater detail but I cannot now describe them in order not to distract attention from this arbitration and for reasons of confidentiality. Ultimately, these actually required a revision of the award. In addition, my failure to dissociate myself from the formal aspects of the jurisdiction decision can easily be explained by the fact that in practice there was no point in expressing any dissent because the other tribunal members were in full agreement. I explained my reasoning on that occasion but my explanation of January 30 was not duly taken into consideration at the time.4\n\nI followed this case very closely because I found it interesting. In particular, it was the first instance in which the tribunal ruled against a member country of the then OECD (my country, Spain) in a claim brought not by a multinational, as is often the case, but by an individual of Argentine nationality who invested in the Autonomous Community of Galicia, where I live, work and reside. It was the first case in which the Treaty for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Spain and Argentina was applied. In addition, the Kingdom of Spain was the first European Union country to be ruled against, in a case involving a claim by an Argentine citizen resulting from the creation of a joint venture with Sodiga, the development corporation of the Government of Galicia, for the purpose of constructing a chemical plant in Galicia. Sodiga had used money deposited by the businessman Maffezini to cover project losses and it was decided that Sodiga's actions constituted unfair and inequitable treatment and that, since it was a public entity, the Spanish Government was responsible for those actions - a responsibility which it indeed assumed.\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic* (Decision on jurisdiction, August 3, 2004), ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, 12 ICSID Rep. 174.\n\nAt the time, I expressed to the other members of the tribunal my view that the ICSID Convention and Rules do not set any time limit for arbitrators to express an opinion, regardless of whether they dissent from the majority. In my case, I explained that I was not saying anything new, since \"this opinion has been expressed repeatedly and, indeed, reflected my views at the outset. This opinion should therefore be attached to the award since rule 47, paragraph 3 states that any member may attach his individual opinion to the award. This clearly shows that the text is always attached after the complete award has been signed by the majority or the entire membership, whether or not the opinion dissents from the majority and whether or not it is a statement of dissent. In addition, rule 48, paragraph 2 specifies that the award shall be deemed to have been rendered on the date on which the copies certified by the Secretary-General were dispatched.\" This had not yet occurred at the time when my other tribunal colleagues received my individual opinion. The award may include individual opinions and dissenting statements and I had to insist that my individual opinion should be attached to the award and given to the Secretary-General (but not by me directly, so as not to further complicate the issue). I explained the formal problems that might prevent an accurate statement of my wishes, which alter the meaning of my signature of the text as a whole. However, as the other tribunal members are well aware (I have copies of communications between us), this reflects my wishes more accurately. I then stated that \"my signature of the entire text is a general expression of consent but not to all the details. Now that I have just received the latest communications by e-mail, as have the other members of the tribunal, I find myself obliged to explain this because I am increasingly confused and wish to express my wishes on the subject in detail, which is why I see no problem including this text.\" Admittedly this was at a later stage but it was in any case before the completion of the administrative formalities and it explains my views in greater detail, which I requested at the time should be transmitted to the Secretary-General with the award, so that I would not have to do this myself.\n\nIn any case, with regard to the practical possibility for an arbitrator on an ICSID tribunal to change, clarify or alter in any way his opinion or his position, he clearly has in principle complete freedom to do so, particularly after considering developments in the case and subsequent decisions rejecting the extension or maximum expansion of the ambit of the MFN clause to cover dispute resolution.5\n\nSee, in particular, the decisions in *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (Decision on Jurisdiction, November 15, 2004), ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, 14 ICSID Rep. 306; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (Decision on Jurisdiction, February 8, 2005), ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, 13 ICSID Rep. 272; *Telenor Mobile Communications A.A. v. Republic of Hungary* (Award of September 13, 2006), ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15; *Vladimir Berschader & Moise Berscharder v. Russian Federation* (Award of April 21, 2006), SCC Case No. 080/2004; *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft* (Award of December 8, 2008), ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14; *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic* (Award of October 9, 2009), UNCITRAL. See also *Renta 4 S.V.S.A et al. v. Russian Federation* (Award on preliminary objections, March 20, 2009) SCC Case No. 024/2007.\n\nThis freedom of arbitrators to modify their position was, for instance, exercised by Mr. Albert Van den Berg, who in one case in which Argentina was involved accepted the argument of necessity (*LG&E v. Argentina6*) but in another (*Enron v. Argentina7*) did not, although in the second instance he did not express a dissenting opinion.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/1\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/01/3.\n\nIn this regard, another very interesting case specifically involved rejection of the expansion or extension of the MFN clause to dispute resolution. Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, an arbitrator in *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic8*, subsequently wrote an article9 advocating application of the MFN clause to dispute resolution. However, in a more recent instance, in which she presided over a tribunal, she took the opposite view and did not accept the tribunal's jurisdiction based on reference to the clause. She did so specifically after considering the clear and demonstrated preference of the two parties for the bilateral treaty.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 (Decision on jurisdiction, 3 August 2006).\n\n*Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse?* The 2006 Freshfields Lecture. *Arbitration* *International*, vol. 23, No. 3, LCIA, 2002, pp. 357-378.\n\nThis is exactly what we do systematically in *Daimler* with regard to the bilateral treaty between Germany and Argentina. This was not done in the tribunal's decision in *Siemens*. After an in-depth re-examination and re-evaluation of the evidence of the true intention of the parties as regards dispute resolution, I am increasingly in favor of the position adopted by Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler in the Austrian Airlines case (*Austrian* *Airlines v. Slovakia*, UNCITRAL Ad Hoc Arbitration, final award, October 9, 2009).\n\nThese various factors finally led me to clarify my opinion, substantially nuancing it, since I had already been very favorably impressed and initially influenced by the arguments adduced by the *Wintershall* tribunal.\n\nConsequently, my change of heart between the decision in the arbitral award concerning the claim by *Siemens* against Argentina and the current case can be explained by the important aspects summarized below, naturally without prejudice to any other more substantiated opinion, but can be fully justified by the obvious fact that each arbitration is different.\n\nIn any case, more generally speaking, I should like especially to emphasize the following observations, which reflect the fact that there are no precedents as regards either transnational arbitrations or international commercial arbitrations. Each arbitrator is free to change, clarify, explain, or nuance his legal analysis of the issues under discussion and the problems encountered. This is true, of course, even if the issue is interpretation of the same legal instrument, as it is in this dispute concerning the bilateral treaty between Germany and Argentina concluded in 1991.\n\nIn the time that has elapsed since the *Siemens* decision, international State practice and transnational arbitration case law reveal at least two things. In the first place, various countries, including the United States, Argentina, and Switzerland, have advanced the view that the clause cannot be expanded or extended to the dispute resolution system. They deliberately adopted this position precisely in order to react and protect themselves against the differing interpretations given in awards or decisions directly based on the award in *Maffezini* (2001). *Siemens* (Decision on Jurisdiction) is the first illustration or consequence of these awards or decisions.\n\nWithin and outside ICSID, case law (see, for instance, the above-mentioned *Renta 4* case) shows that the tribunals do not have a common position on this issue. At present decisions are roughly evenly split between the *Maffezini* position and the *Plama* position.\n\nI shall attempt below to provide further clarification regarding some of the substantive elements that I believe are decisive (I) and shall then deal more briefly with the procedural options that I believe should be highlighted because of their particular importance (II).\n\n**I. Substantive elements**\n---------------------------\n\nThese all involve interpretation of the bilateral treaty on investment protection as it relates to the possible extension of the reach of the MFN clause(s) in that agreement.\n\n1.\n\nThe **Wintershall** Decision on Jurisdiction merits special consideration because it concerns the same treaty. It sheds light on a fundamental question: the correct interpretation of the will of the parties to the treaty. It is a fundamental principle of public international law that this will cannot be interpreted subjectively at the whim of the arbitrators but must be based on the text of the treaty itself, especially when this text is very clear. Judge Torres-Bernardes, who has direct experience at The Hague International Court, as we know, demonstrated this very clearly in **Wintershall**.\n\nIn our case, the will of the parties (Germany and Argentina) must also be interpreted on the basis of the international law in force at the time when the treaty was concluded, which was 1991 (\"contemporaneity\" principle). It was clear that at that time, ten years before the *Maffezini* award, two different issues were still completely separate: on the one hand, the \"treatment\" of foreign investments and, on the other, dispute resolution and the mechanisms selected for that purpose. Under the *ejusdem generis* principle, the MFN clause can apply only to matters of the same kind, which is not the case if the clause is extended to dispute resolution.\n\nSince the time when the bilateral treaty was concluded between these two countries, widely differing opinions are found in international practice and international case law. There can thus be no change in the interpretation based on the law applicable in 1991, as most States still have a restrictive vision of the scope of the clause. And all sovereign countries (including, of course, Germany and Argentina) still want arbitrators to respect their will as expressed in treaties.\n\n2.\n\nParagraph 194 of the award states that all dispute resolution provisions based on bilateral treaties are, by their very nature, jurisdictional. This is one of the most important points on which Judge Charles Brower disagrees. In particular, it is the point covered by Article 10 of the bilateral treaty in question, whose terminology is analyzed in the award. Here again *Wintershall* is very important.\n\nI wish once again to emphasize that this issue is directly linked to respect for the consent expressed by the States Parties to the bilateral treaty and reflects the requirements of public international law concerning choice of dispute resolution methods. As noted again in the most recent rulings of the International Court of Justice in *Djibouti v.* *France10* and *Georgia v. Russia*, *11* this choice can never be imposed on a sovereign State against its wishes.\n\n*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment of June 4, 2008, paragraph 62\n\n*Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation),* Preliminary Objection, Judgment of April 1, 2011, paragraphs 133 to 135.\n\nConsidering, in particular, the unanimous position adopted by the *Wintershall* tribunal *12*, I wish to stress that I endorse the position adopted in the present decision to the effect that:\n\n\"All BIT-based dispute resolution provisions, on the other hand, are by their very nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign agreement of two States - not the mere administrative creation of arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state parties' consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts confer jurisdiction upon domestic courts. That this is so is particularly evident in the case of the German-Argentine BIT, which describes its dispute resolution process in mandatory and necessarily sequential language.\"\n\nIn *Wintershall*, the tribunal stated: \"That an investor could choose at will to omit the second step [the 18-month domestic courts requirement is simply not provided for nor even envisaged by the Argentina-Germany BIT - because (Argentina's) the Host State's \"consent\" (standing offer) is premised on there first being submitted to the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Host State the entire dispute for resolution in local courts.\"\n\n3.\n\nMy position in this regard has in no way been changed by the differing arguments set out in the recent Decision on Jurisdiction in *Hochtief v. Argentina13* concerning the same issue. On the other hand, I should like to draw attention to the very wise position stated by the arbitrator J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., in his Separate and Dissenting Opinion, which is very similar to my position regarding our decision.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction, October 24, 2011, and Separate and Dissenting Opinion of J. Christopher Thomas.\n\nAdopting an approach based not only on public international law but also on the general principles of arbitration (commercial and between States and foreign investors), J. Christopher Thomas emphasizes that the conditions established in a bilateral treaty are part of the arbitration offer determined by the agreement of the States parties to the BIT. He also rightly emphasizes the need to respect the agreement of the host State as expressed in the BIT. He then recalls that \"The 18-month period is plainly a product of compromise between the States Parties\" (para. 7) and that \"...the existence of the agreement to arbitrate is determined by examining the two consents\" (para. 18).\n\nIn support of this observation, J. Christopher Thomas cites the opinion of another eminent expert, Campbell McLachlan, Q.C., that \"Given the absence of a meeting of minds between investor and host State, consent has to be constructed from the standing consent given by the State by treaty.\"14 In accordance with the fundamental principles of international law on the subject, the two experts (J. Christopher Thomas and Campbell McLachlan) thus explicitly refer to State consent as the cornerstone of the choice of a specific dispute resolution method, as the arbitrators in *Wintershall* did unanimously.\n\nCampbell McLachlan, Q.C., Laurence Shore and Mathew Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles*, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 257.\n\nIn addition, also in his separate opinion on the *Hochtief A.G.* decision, the arbitrator J. Christopher Thomas notes that \"In the pre-*Maffezini* days, it was clear that the offer and the acceptance must match,\" as indicated by Professor Christoph Schreuer in his commentary on the Washington Convention.15 Finally, the same arbitrator concludes with words that I can fully endorse: \"In my view, the need for matching consents, once clear under the ICSID Convention, remains the case\" (para. 21).\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Cambridge University Press, 2001, para. 356, p. 238.\n\nIn view of all these substantive elements, I have rethought the position which I accepted in 2004 (*Siemens*) somewhat reluctantly but because there would in practice have been no point in objecting in view of the unanimity existing between the other two members of the tribunal. At that time, I did not have sufficient hindsight to fully evaluate the grounds for and the consequences of adopting a position in *Maffezini* that did not reflect public international law on the subject of dispute resolution consent.\n\n4.\n\nI would add that also in the area of public international law, one should not seek to bolster the opposing view by making Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties basically mean the opposite of what they say. Unfortunately, this is what the majority of the members of the tribunal did in the recent decision in *Hochtief A.G.* The detailed interpretation rule in that Convention does not give the interpreter complete freedom to freely construct the will of the States but requires us to follow the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty. In the case of Article X of the bilateral treaty between Germany and Argentina, the terms used are clear and reflect unambiguously the consent of the Parties.\n\nThe tribunal chaired by Jan Paulsson rightly stated in *Renta 4* :\n\n\"Speculations relied upon as the basis of purposive readings of a text run the risk of encroachment upon fundamental policy determinations. The same is true when \u2018confirmation' of a hypothetical intention is said to be found in considerations external to the text. The duty of the Tribunal is to discover and not to create meaning.\"16\n\n*Renta 4 S.V.S.A. v. The Russian Federation*, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction (March 20, 2009) [hereinafter \" *Renta 4* \"], para. 93. The tribunal specifically explained that speculation or readings based on speculation regarding a text create a risk of encroachment on fundamental policy determinations. The same is true when \"confirmation\" of a hypothetical intension is said to be found in considerations external to the text. It is then concluded that the duty of the tribunal is to discover and not to create new meaning for the context of a text under consideration.\n\nIn particular, it should be remembered that *in claris non fit interpretatio*, when terms are clear and meaning is obvious, those who interpret and apply the law do not need additional means of interpretation and should not prefer a meaning other than the literal meaning of the words. As we know, this Latin axiom originated in the second and third centuries before Christ, at which time the Roman schools of law (Sabinian and Proculean) were predominant. It was subsequently adapted and incorporated in the various legal orders on the basis of one of the adaptations in the Digest, with the same conclusion maintained in similar legal aphorisms such as \" *Verba simpliciter prolata* *debent intelligi secundum suam propiam significationem* \" and \" *Cum in verbis nulla* *ambiguitas est, non debet admitti voluntatis quaestio*.\"\n\nThe International Court of Justice already gave an excellent opinion along these lines in 1950, when an attempt was being made to understand exactly what were the rights and obligations of the Member States signing the new Charter of the United Nations. Considering the substantive conditions for the admission of a State to the Organization, the Court noted:\n\n\"If the relevant words [of a treaty] in their natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is the end of the matter\"17.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion in *Competence of the General Assembly for the* *admission of a State to the United Nations*, ICJ Reports 1950, pp. 4 and 5. If the relevant words [of a treaty] in their natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is the end of the matter or the purpose and ultimate conclusion of their content.\n\n5.\n\nFinally, the  inclusion in Article 2 (d) of the words \"in its territory\" is very important and shows that the scope of the clause is limited. Assuming that the MFN clause in Articles 3 and 4 of the Germany/Argentina treaty could also extend to dispute resolution, it would be able to do so only in Argentine territory, which is the opposite of what would happen if an international arbitral tribunal were competent, as Judge Charles Brower now claims once again. This means that if the broad interpretation of the scope of the clause were correct (which, as amply demonstrated above, I do not believe), the consent given by the States to the bilateral treaty would still limit the scope of the treatment (including for dispute resolution) to the territory of the host country. This being so, only national tribunals located in Argentine national territory could then attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\nArticle 10 on dispute resolution provides for the possibility of recourse to an international arbitral tribunal. This shows that it is incompatible with the territorial limitation of the MFN clause (limited to treatment in the territory of the host State) and strengthens the presumption that dispute resolution was not in 1991 and *a fortiori* is still not now part of the treatment referred to in Articles 3 and 4.\n\n**II. Procedural options**\n--------------------------\n\nNow that it has been proved that our tribunal does not have jurisdiction because the claimant did not meet the requirement of first submitting its case to the Argentine judicial courts within a period of 18 months, it seems appropriate to give the claimant the possibility of instituting judicial proceedings before the Argentine courts for a period not exceeding 18 months, in accordance with Article 10 (3) (b) of the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and Argentina.\n\nIf the Argentine courts have not resolved the case after 18 months, the claimant is then free to request international arbitration and entitled to recuperate the costs of that request and the opportunity costs associated with the delay in the full resolution of its claims. It may then add to its other petitions an additional request concerning its treatment in the Argentine courts. In the event of a favorable ruling, it may be compensated, with interest, in the same way as it would be for any other violation of the treaty. In other words, any violation due to less favorable or discriminatory treatment would be compensated in accordance with the general international law principle of full redress.\n\nAs regards costs and expenses, I believe that because this would be more elegant and fair, it would be reasonable also to adopt the simple solution whereby each side bears its own costs. These would thus be evenly shared between the two parties since Argentina is also responsible for the length of the proceedings because of its surprising decision to add jurisdictional objections to the merits of the case.\n\n**General conclusion**\n----------------------\n\nClearly the most important part of the award is the one referring to the ambit of the MFN clause. Special attention is paid to the interpretation of the wishes of the parties to the bilateral treaty, Germany and Argentina, and to what those wishes were in 1991, when the bilateral treaty was concluded. The award is based on the law applicable at that time, as revealed particularly by the 1992 World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment. These Guidelines confirm that at that time the \"treatment\" of investments (to which the MFN clause refers) and dispute resolution were two quite separate matters for which, as in the treaty, there were two different types of clauses.\n\nIn any case, for the reasons discussed above, I believe that both the *Wintershall* award and this *Daimler* award rightly base their decisions on lack of evidence of Argentina\u2019s consent to submit to the jurisdiction of international arbitral tribunals on the basis of this type of use of the MFN clause. This specifically supports my current view for several reasons, of which the three most important are: 1) judicial practice has become more varied and more awards have been rendered that disagree with the position maintained in the **Siemens** arbitration; 2) several States, including Argentina, have since refined the focus of the *Maffezini/Siemens* awards, leading me to rethink my original conclusion and Argentina\u2019s consent to this type of application of the MFN clause; and 3) the **Siemens** tribunal did not conduct an analysis of several of the points now covered extensively and very carefully by this award (for example, evidence of understanding of the common use of the word \"treatment\", Argentine practice, limitation of the MFN clause, the logical fallacy of the *expressio unius* argument).\n\nAll these factors can reasonably more than justify my support for the opinion expressed in this award, which I naturally have great pleasure in submitting for further consideration."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Defined Terms** |\n| Argentine Subsidiaries | DCS, DCCF and DCLA collectively |\n| Argentine Subsidiary | DCS (the parent company of DCCF and DCLA) |\n| Basic Treaty | German-Argentine BIT |\n| BITs | Bilateral investment treaties |\n| Comparator Treaty | Chilean-Argentine BIT |\n| Convertibility Law | Argentine Law 23,928 of 1 April 1991 |\n| DAG | Daimler AG |\n| DCAG | DaimlerChrysler AG |\n| DCCF | DaimlerChrysler Compa\u00f1ia Financiera S.A. |\n| DCFS | DaimlerChrysler Financial Services AG |\n| DCLA | DaimlerChrysler Leasing S.A. |\n| DCS | DaimlerChrysler Services, Argentina S.A. |\n| DFS | Daimler Financial Services AG |\n| Domestic courts proviso | Article 10(2) of the German-Argentine BIT | |\n| Emergency Law | Argentine Law 25,561 of January 2002 |\n| German-Argentine BIT | Treaty Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (1991) |\n| ICJ | International Court of Justice |\n| ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Parent Company | DCAG, subsequently DAG |\n| PCIJ | Permanent Court of International Justice |\n| MFN | Most-favored nation |\n| Vienna Convention | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) |\n| 18-month proviso | Article 10(2) of the German-Argentine BIT | |\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Award sets forth the Tribunal's findings concerning the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the matter of *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v.

PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 August 2004, as supplemented by two letters of 5 August and 21 October 2004, DaimlerChrysler Services AG, a company incorporated under the laws of Germany, with its principal offices in Berlin, filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\" or \"ICSID\") a request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic.\n\n3.\n\nOn 4 August 2004, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, and transmitted a copy of the Request and its accompanying documents to the Attorney General of Argentina and to the Ambassador of Argentina in Washington D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn 14 January 2005, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request and in accordance with Institution Rule 7 notified the parties of the registration, inviting them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nOn 18 March 2005, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal should be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, according to which one arbitrator was to be appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn 4 April 2005, the Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a U.S. national, as an arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nOn 13 April 2005, the Respondent appointed Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro, a Spanish national, as an arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nBy letters of 11 and 17 October 2005, the parties informed the Centre of their agreement that the President of the Tribunal should be appointed by the two party-appointed arbitrators.\n\n9.\n\nGiven that more than ninety days had elapsed since the date of registration without any Tribunal being constituted, on 30 June 2006 the Claimant invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4, and requested the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint the President of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 August 2006, the Centre proposed Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a French national, to serve as President of the Tribunal. By letters of September 8, 2006, the parties agreed to the appointment of Professor Dupuy as President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 September 2006, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. The Tribunal was composed of Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy (French), President; Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro (Spanish); and Judge Charles N. Brower (U.S.). On the same day, the parties were informed that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the Tribunal held a first session with the parties at the World Bank headquarters in Paris.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 August 2007, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n14.\n\nOn 4 January 2008, the Respondent filed a Memorial raising some objections to jurisdiction (\"Memorial on Jurisdiction\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 16 January 2008, following the Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceeding on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 March 2008, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. On the same day, the Claimant notified the Centre of the Claimant's change of name from DaimlerChrysler Services AG to Daimler Financial Services AG.\n\n17.\n\nOn 5 May 2008, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 June 2008, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 December 2008, the parties were informed that due to Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson's extended leave of absence the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID had, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, appointed Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nFrom October 2007 to March 2009, the parties filed a series of requests for the production of documents. The Tribunal gave the parties opportunities to comment on these requests and issued its decisions concerning the requests in the form of a series of Procedural Orders.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 February 2009, the Claimant referred to its letter of 17 March 2008 and requested that the Centre change its name from DaimlerChrysler Services AG to Daimler Financial Services AG.\n\n22.\n\nOn 4 March 2009, the Centre notified the parties that the Claimant's name would be changed to Daimler Financial Services AG, as requested by the Claimant.\n\n23.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, at the request of the parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 joining the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent to the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4), and establishing the procedural calendar for the submissions on the merits of the dispute.\n\n24.\n\nOn 17 April 2009, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n25.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits.\n\n26.\n\nOn 27 October 2009, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n27.\n\nFrom 30 November through 7 December 2009, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and merits at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Present at the hearing were Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, President; Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro, arbitrator; and Judge Charles N. Brower arbitrator; Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Case Counsel, ICSID and Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID. For the Claimant, Mres. Paul Doyle, Philip Robben, Michael H. MacMahon, Nafees Nuruddin, Keith Vena, and Ms. Cathleen Condren, Julia A. Garza Ben\u00edtez, of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP. For the Respondent, Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; Dr. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Sub-Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Director Nacional de Asuntos y Controversias Internacionales - Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; Mr. Mauricio Rosales Markaida, Director de Coordinaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica y Administrativa - Procuration del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; Mr. Ignacio Torterola, Enlace Procuration del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n/CIADI; and from the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Asuntos y Controversias Internacionales, Drs.

THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n33.\n\nDaimler Financial Services AG (variably \"DFS\", \"DCFS\", or \"the Claimant\") is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, with a principal place of business at Eichhornstrasse 3, D - 10785 Berlin, Germany.1 DFS is and was at all relevant times throughout the history of this case wholly-owned by Daimler AG (\"DAG\" or \"the Parent Company\") or its predecessor DaimlerChrysler AG (\"DCAG\" or \"the Parent Company\"), with a principal place of business at Epplestrasse 225, D - 70567 Stuttgart, Germany.2\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, para 1.\n\nIbid. At the time of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant and its Parent Company were known, respectively, as DaimlerChrysler Services AG and DaimlerChrysler AG. The reference to Chrysler was dropped subsequent to the break-up of the Daimler and Chrysler corporations in 2007, and the Claimant's corporate name was eventually changed to Daimler Financial Services. The case name in the present proceedings has been adjusted accordingly. Nonetheless, portions of the parties' pleadings make reference to the old names, and the Tribunal, where necessary, has followed the lead of the parties in referring to the Claimant variably as DFS and DCFS. The details of the corporate break-up between Daimler and Chrysler have no bearing upon the jurisdictional questions now before the Tribunal.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent is the Argentine Republic, represented in these proceedings by its Public Prosecutor's Office, *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n*, with its principal business address at Posadas 1641, C1112 Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant bases its claim upon provisions of the Treaty Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (\"the German-Argentine BIT\", \"the Treaty\", or \"the BIT\"). This Treaty was signed by the Contracting State Parties on 9 April 1991 and entered into force on 8 November 1993.3\n\nExhibit B to Claimant's Request for Arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nThe facts alleged to underpin the claim, insofar as they are relevant to this Tribunal's jurisdiction, are as follows. In the early 1990s, Argentina undertook a series of legal and policy reforms designed to stabilize its economy, which had previously been plagued by episodes of rampant inflation and dramatic vacillations in economic growth. Among the reforms enacted by the Government at that time were several that were intended to encourage foreign investment, including, according to the Claimant's description of the claim, the following:\n\na) Law 23,928 of 1 April 1991 (\"the Convertibility Law\")4, which *inter alia* :\n\ni) Made the Argentine peso convertible with the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis, thereby \"pegging\" the value of the peso to the dollar; and\n\nii) Amended Section 619 of the Argentine Civil Code to provide that a debtor obliged to deliver foreign currency would fulfill that obligation by payment in foreign currency on the maturity date, rather than payment in local currency according to the applicable exchange rate on the maturity date.\n\nb) Law 21,382, as implemented by Decree 1853/19935, together permitting foreign investors to:\n\ni) Invest in Argentina without registration or prior government approval, including through merger, acquisition, or joint venture arrangements, on the same terms as Argentine investors; and\n\nii) Repatriate capital and remit earnings abroad at any time.\n\nc) A series of bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\") concluded with numerous countries -including the above-mentioned German-Argentine BIT - which guaranteed foreign investors important protections against, *inter alia*, capital movement restrictions, expropriations, unfair treatment, and arbitrary or discriminatory treatment.6\n\nd) The ratification of the ICSID Convention,7 which in concert with the newly enacted BITs provided foreign investors with direct access to a neutral international arbitration forum in the event of an investment-related dispute between a foreign investor and the Government of Argentina.\n\nExhibit G to Claimant's Request for Arbitration.\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, paras 39-40.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 24-27 and corresponding footnotes; Claimant's Exhibit 80, Core Bundle 16.\n\nSigned by Argentina on 21 May 1991, entered into force 18 November 1994.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant further points to various written and oral representations made by Argentine government officials underscoring that the new regulatory regime established by these reforms could be relied upon and would remain permanently in effect.8 Key among these, in the Claimant's view, was a 1993 publication prepared in English and aggressively distributed by Argentina's newly created Undersecretariat of Investment, entitled \"Argentina, A Growing Country, A Compendium for Foreign Investors\".9 As described by the Claimant, this Compendium:\n\n\"stated that the Convertibility Law, which was the \u2018cornerstone' of the economic reform, \u2018*virtually removed currency risk*.' It further explicitly represented to prospective investors that, under Argentina's laws, \u2018*[c]ontracts can be denominated and legally enforced in foreign currencies*.'\"10\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, Exhibit I; Claimant's Memorial, paras 61-65.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras 34-36.\n\nIbid at para 35 (emphasis in original).\n\n38.\n\nBeginning in 1995, in reliance upon the legal protections afforded by this new regulatory framework, the Claimant resolved to make a series of investments in the commercial financing business in Argentina. To effectuate this, the Claimant purchased a 99.9971% interest in a local Argentine company then owned by Mercedes-Benz Argentina. Subsequent to the purchase, this local company eventually became known as DaimlerChrysler Services, Argentina S.A. (\"DCS Argentina\" or \"the Argentine Subsidiary\"). The Claimant describes the business of DCS Argentina and its subsidiaries DCCF and DCLA (collectively \"the Argentine Subsidiaries\") as one of \"extend[ing] loans and leases to Argentine dealers and purchasers of automotive goods manufactured primarily in Argentina by Mercedes Benz Argentina, as well as other nonautomotive capital goods\".11\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, para 7.\n\n39.\n\nFollowing this initial acquisition, the Claimant made additional capital contributions into the Argentine Subsidiary at various points.12 Throughout the history of the investment, the Claimant funded the operations of the Argentine Subsidiary primarily with foreign financing denominated in U.S. dollars.13 The Claimant asserts that this type of funding was both common practice within the industry internationally and necessary to its particular investment in Argentina, due to the unavailability of sufficient and economically viable domestic financing sources.14 The liabilities column of the Claimant's balance sheet thus largely consisted of U.S. dollar denominated obligations. To offset this, the Claimant's Argentine Subsidiary also wrote all of its lease and loan contracts with its domestic Argentine customers in U.S. dollars, as was permitted under the then-existing legal regime.15 The Claimant emphasizes that the promised stability of that legal regime was therefore essential to its decision to invest in Argentina. In the Claimant's words:\n\n\"because DCFS needed to ensure that the Argentine Subsidiaries would have U.S. dollars on hand to repay the foreign U.S. dollar loans, a corresponding legally protected right to denominate and enforce the domestic lease and loan contracts in U.S. dollars was fundamental to undertaking the investment. DCFS would never have entered the market without the legally guaranteed ability to require repayment of the domestic lease and loan contracts in U.S. dollars.\"16\n\nIbid at paras 52, 57.\n\nIbid at para 75.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras 58-59.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at para 60.\n\nIbid.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the business of its Argentine Subsidiaries steadily grew and prospered between 1995 and 2001.17 By 2001, however, as is by now well known, the Argentine economy had again begun to experience grave difficulties.18 A full-fledged currency crisis ensued, provoking political, social, and economic consequences so devastating that the Government of Argentina has termed them a \"collapse of the state.\"19 The Government responded by enacting numerous measures in an attempt to stem the crisis. Some of these measures, promulgated in 2001 and 2002, significantly altered the regulatory environment governing the investment, and it is those measures which now form the basis of this claim.\n\nIbid at para 98.\n\nThe Tribunal need not, for purposes of its jurisdictional findings, probe the precise counters of the crisis or its causes.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, Part VI.B.\n\n41.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant alleges that the following measures, as applied to its investment, violated its rights as a foreign investor under the German-Argentine BIT:\n\na) The Government's December 2001 limitations on cash withdrawals from bank accounts, restrictions on access to foreign exchange, and prohibitions on transferring cash abroad;20\n\nb) Law 25,561 of January 2002 (\"the Emergency Law\"),21 which *inter alia* : i) Abrogated many provisions of the 1991 Convertibility Law, including the convertibility of the peso into US dollars;22 ii) Authorized the National Executive \"to create a new currency system and to restructure the obligations of certain debtors\";23 and\n\niii) Provided that \"certain dollar-denominated obligations in domestic transactions conducted with financial entities... would be \u2018pesified\u2019 and could be settled by payments in Argentine Pesos at the exchange rate of AR $1 to U.S. $1\";24\n\nc) Executive Decree 214/2002, which made permanent the \"mandatory pesification or compulsory conversion of all U.S. dollar debt governed by domestic law into Argentine pesos\";25\n\nd) Laws 25,563 and 25,589, which together modified earlier Law 24,522, thereby suspending \"important provisions of the bankruptcy law that had previously provided protection for creditors such as DCS Argentina\";26 and\n\ne) The Government\u2019s repeated failures to:\n\ni) Carve out necessary exceptions to pesification;27\n\nii) Provide compensatory bonds to non-regulated financial entities such as DCS Argentina on the same terms as those provided to regulated financial entities in similar circumstances;28 and\n\niii) Otherwise adequately compensate DCS Argentina, whose liabilities remained denominated in foreign currency but whose assets were forcibly converted to devalued pesos.29\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Arbitraiton, para 72.\n\nIbid at paras 64-71 and Exhibit J.\n\nIbid at para 66.\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para 121.\n\nIbid at para 125.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, paras 73-74; Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para 132.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at paras 130-131.\n\nIbid at paras 164-172.\n\nIbid at paras 173-191.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the combined impact of Argentina's contested measures caused \"unique and devastating\" losses to its investment,30 bringing its once profitable Argentine Subsidiary to the brink of bankruptcy.31 In the Claimant's view, these measures violated several provisions of the German-Argentine BIT, including: the fair and equitable treatment provision, the protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, the most-favored nation provisions, the protection against expropriation without adequate compensation, the umbrella clause, and the guarantee of free transfers of capital.32 The Claimant requests compensation for its alleged losses as a result of these purported violations.\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, para 76.\n\nIbid at paras 79-81.\n\nIbid at paras 91-102.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that it makes no findings at present with respect to the veracity of the above-listed assertions or any of the defenses raised by Argentina thereto. That analysis is reserved for the merits of the case. Rather, the basic contours of the claim are noted here solely for the purposes of determining the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n44.\n\nBefore proceeding to an analysis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, one further factual detail bears mentioning. The Claimant's Request for Arbitration was filed in August of 2004 and officially registered by the ICSID Secretariat on 14 January 2005. It is common cause, however, that the Claimant (DFS Berlin) had transferred the entirety of its shares in the affected Argentine Subsidiary to its Parent Company (DCAG Stuttgart) with effect from 1 April 2002.33 This transfer was done pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) between the Claimant and its Parent Company, dated 12 June 2002. The transaction was approved by the Argentine Central Bank on 19 June 2003. The Agreement set the initial purchase price at negative EUR 250 million and provided that the final price would be adjusted in order to take into account any expenditures which either the buyer or seller might undertake on behalf of the Argentine Subsidiary up until the date of the sale closing. The negative purchase price - which was meant to represent the fair market value of the Argentine Subsidiary in an arm's length transaction between disinterested parties34 - reflected the large outstanding liabilities of the Argentine Subsidiary relative to its assets subsequent to the pesification of its domestic loan portfolios. The impact of this share transfer upon the Tribunal's jurisdiction will be evaluated below.35\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 70.\n\nIbid at Article 5(2).\n\nSee Part V of this award below.\n\n**III. APPLICABLE LAW**\n-----------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn the course of discussing particular objections to jurisdiction, both parties have referred at various points to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and to the sources of law enumerated in Article 10(5) of the German-Argentine BIT. To the extent that these submissions are relevant, they will be addressed below together with the specific jurisdictional objections to which they refer. The Tribunal nevertheless finds it convenient to set out, as a preliminary matter, its conception of the applicable law for purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings.\n\n46.\n\nThis claim arises under the German-Argentine BIT, in conjunction with the ICSID Convention. As both the BIT and the ICSID Convention are international treaties concluded between sovereign States, both are subject to the usual customary law rules governing treaty interpretation under public international law, as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"). The Tribunal will apply these rules in discerning whether all of the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT have been met.\n\n47.\n\nThe ICSID Convention sets forth its jurisdictional requirements in Chapter II. The relevant provision, for present purposes, is Article 25, which states:\n\n(1) \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \u2018National of another Contracting State' means:\n\n(a) [\u2026]\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration... \"\n\n48.\n\nIt is common cause that the Respondent is a Contracting State Party to the ICSID Convention36 and that the Claimant is a national of the Federal Republic of Germany,37 the latter State also being a Party to the ICSID Convention. It is further common cause that the Claimant has consented in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre. The sole questions for the Tribunal to determine under the ICSID Convention are therefore: a) whether the Claimant has raised a \"legal dispute\" between itself and the Respondent; b) whether the dispute arises \"directly out of an investment\"; and c) whether the Respondent has also consented in writing, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the German-Argentine BIT, to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of ICSID and consequently the competence of this Tribunal. These questions, in turn, depend upon the specific legal obligations undertaken by the Respondent in the German-Argentine BIT and upon that BIT's definition of \"investment\". The Tribunal will therefore apply the relevant provisions of the BIT in assessing its jurisdiction in light of the Claimant's claims and in responding to each of the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nAbove note 7.\n\nAbove note 1.\n\n49.\n\nArticle 10(5) of the BIT specifies as follows the law to be applied by an arbitral tribunal in the context of a dispute between an investor and one of the BIT's Contracting State Parties:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall arrive at its decisions on the basis of this Treaty and, if applicable, other agreements made between the parties, the internal law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made - including the rules of international private law - and general principles of international law.\"38\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all citations to the German-Argentine BIT refer to the agreed English translation of the BIT as prepared by the disputing parties. In the context of the present quote, the Tribunal notes that the disputing parties' agreed translation is not entirely accurate. The phrase \"other agreements made between the parties\" actually refers to other treaties in force between the Contracting State Parties (Spanish: \"otros tratadoes vigentes entre les Partes\"; German: \"anderer zwischen den Vertragsparteien geltender \u00dcbereink\u00fcnfte\").\n\n50.\n\nAs to the internal law of Argentina, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant's claim is based in large part upon changes to the domestic regulatory framework governing the investment. The law of Argentina may therefore become relevant, directly or indirectly, to an evaluation of the merits of the claim. For purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, however, the proper law to be applied is the German-Argentine BIT itself, in concert with the ICSID Convention, as interpreted in the light of the general principles of international law.\n\n51.\n\nAs will become clear below, Argentina has also raised the 2002 Share Purchase Agreement between the Claimant and its Parent Company as an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The law to be applied to the interpretation of this Share Purchase Agreement is a distinct matter and will be addressed separately below.39\n\nSee below, paras 134-139.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, as both parties have in their submissions cited extensively to the awards of various other international investor-State and State-to-State tribunals, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to comment upon the weight to be attributed to such decisions. The Tribunal agrees with the parties in noting that there is no system of precedent in investor-State arbitration,40 nor indeed could there be, given the large and diverse set of treaties presently applicable to various investor-State claims. Each case must be decided on the basis of the applicable treaty texts and in the light of the relevant facts. On the other hand, the Tribunal acknowledges that it is a fundamental principle of the rule of law that \"\u2018like cases should be decided alike,' unless a strong reason exists to distinguish the current case from previous ones.\"41 This latter consideration will weigh more or less heavily depending upon: a) how \"like\" the prior and present cases are, having regard to all relevant considerations; b) the degree to which a clear *jurisprudence constante* has emerged in respect of a particular legal issue; and c) the Tribunal's independent estimation of the persuasiveness of prior tribunals' reasoning.\n\nBoth parties have urged the Tribunal to embrace the solutions adopted by particular previous tribunals and to disregard the solutions adopted by others.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and *AWG Group v. The Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL) (jointly decided), Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), para 189.\n\n53.\n\nIn analyzing the questions raised by the parties in this proceeding, the present Tribunal will therefore have regard for the decisions of prior tribunals in accordance with these criteria.\n\n**IV. THREE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. First Objection: The Claim Refers to Contractual Matters over which the Tribunal Has No Jurisdiction in Light of the Contracts' Forum Selection Clauses**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn both its original memorial on objections to jurisdiction and its reply memorial on jurisdiction, Argentina formulated this objection under two separate headings. The first formulation reads: \"the claim refers to contractual matters over which the ICSID has no jurisdiction\".42 The second states: \"the Tribunal lacks competence because all disputes relating to the instruments invoked by Claimant must be submitted to the Argentine courts, pursuant to the provisions of said instruments and the agreements between the parties.\"43 Argentina's arguments on these two points are virtually indistinguishable, as both relate to whether ICSID is the proper forum for the Claimant's claims. The Tribunal will therefore deal with them together.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, part IV.B; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, part II.B.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, part IV.C; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, part II.C.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina's submissions concerning these objections are essentially four-fold. First, it asserts that the claims are based upon losses allegedly suffered by the Claimant under its various leasing agreements with its customers, which - according to their explicit forum selection clauses - are subject to dispute resolution not before ICSID but before the domestic Argentine courts.44 Secondly, Argentina argues that the Claimant's contractual claims may not be brought within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by means of the BIT's umbrella clause.45 Relying upon several previous investor-State cases, Argentina asserts that the umbrella clause cannot transform ordinary contract claims into treaty claims, because the contracts' jurisdictional clauses constitute a *lex specialis*, which must prevail over the more general treaty provision.46\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 86-87, 93, 108-110; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 90-97.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 88-89.\n\nIbid at paras 97-104.\n\n56.\n\nThirdly, apparently in the alternative, even if the BIT's umbrella clause could theoretically be understood to encompass contractual claims, the Respondent asserts that this cannot be the case here. It points out that it is the Claimant's Argentine Subsidiaries, and not the Claimant itself, who are parties to the leasing contracts.47 The suggestion seems to be that since only the direct parties to a contract may rely upon its provisions, and since only German (and not Argentine) investors may bring claims under the BIT, the German Claimant's contract-based claims on behalf of its Argentine Subsidiaries must be excluded from the purview of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.48\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, para 86.\n\nThe question as to whether the Claimant may bring \"indirect\" claims on behalf of its Argentine subsidiary is addressed separately in the next part of the award.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, Argentina asserts that there can be no jurisdiction for claims brought under the BIT's umbrella clause because Argentina has made no specific undertakings to the Claimant.49 It asserts that only specific investment agreements between the Host State and the concerned investor may potentially be covered by the Treaty's umbrella clause50 and stresses that no such specific investment agreement exists in the present case.51 Argentina points out that the Claimant's financial and leasing contracts with its customers cannot be classified as specific investment agreements between Argentina and the Claimant.52\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 76-77, and 85.\n\nIbid at para 78.\n\nIbid at paras 78 and 80.\n\nIbid at para 85.\n\n***2. Position of the Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nFollowing Argentina's lead, the Claimant has also bifurcated its submissions on this objection into two headings. Under the first heading, it asserts that its claims are \"based upon Argentina's violations of the German-Argentine BIT and are subject to ICSID jurisdiction\".53 The Claimant stresses that it does not raise any breach of contract claims as between itself and its customers under the lease contracts.54 Rather, it seeks damages from Argentina caused by Argentina's sovereign interference with its contract rights, which, according to the Claimant, violated several BIT provisions.55\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Point II.\n\nIbid at para 113. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant, in its submissions, does not always distinguish between its own contractual rights and those of its Argentine Subsidiary. The relevance of such a distinction for purposes of this claim is addressed in part IV.B. of the Award below.\n\nIbid at paras 110, 112-114.\n\n59.\n\nWith respect to the umbrella clause, the Claimant suggests Argentina has confused DFS' treaty-based claims under this clause with the unrelated question of \"purely contractual\" matters.56 In its counter-memorial on jurisdiction, the Claimant posits its umbrella clause claim as follows:\n\n\"Argentina, in officially written and disseminated documents upon which DFS relied in making its investment, undertook an obligation to investors to permit contracts to be written and enforced in U.S. dollars, and backed that promise with a regulatory and legal regime that entrenched contract rights and the rule of law that it promised it would be \u2018irreversible'. DFS invested, and maintained its investment, in reliance on those written representations and that legal regime. After freely assuming and proclaiming these obligations, Argentina, by a sovereign act, overrode the very laws that it had represented were permanent and \u2018irreversible', and unilaterally and fundamentally changed the terms of the Argentine subsidiaries' contracts, ultimately destroying, in significant measure, DFS' investment.\"57\n\nThe Claimant thus asserts that its umbrella clause claim stems not from the leasing contracts themselves but from Argentina's sovereign abrogation of DFS' rights under those contracts.58 The Claimant also disputes Argentina's interpretation of the various investor-State cases cited in its memorials and asserts that they are in any event inapposite or contrary to Argentina's position.59\n\nIbid at para 111.\n\nIbid at para 112.\n\nThis argument is further elaborated in the Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Point II.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 116-122.\n\n60.\n\nUnder a second heading, the Claimant asserts that \"the dispute resolution provisions contained in the lease and loan contracts between the Argentine Companies and their domestic customers are irrelevant to the issue of this Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide DFS' treaty-based claims against Argentina.\"60 The Claimant points out that there was never any contract between Argentina and itself, either with respect to the leasing contracts or otherwise.61 As such, there is no basis for Argentina's assertion that the Claimant was contractually obligated to submit its claims against Argentina to the domestic courts of Argentina. More fundamentally, the Claimant emphasizes that the question before the Tribunal is whether Argentina violated its Treaty commitments by using its sovereign power to abrogate certain of DFS' rights altogether.62 As this question arises under the Treaty, the Claimant argues, the dispute resolution provisions contained in the commercial contracts between DFS\u2019 Argentine Subsidiaries and their customers are entirely irrelevant.63\n\nIbid at Point III; see also Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Point III.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 115, 125.\n\nIbid at para 126.\n\nIbid.\n\n***3. Considerations of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nArgentina\u2019s objections under this heading appear to be based upon a fundamental misconception of the Claimant\u2019s case. The forum selection clauses contained within DCS Argentina\u2019s lease and loan contracts with its customers pertain only to disputes arising between the Claimant\u2019s Argentine Subsidiary and its customers in relation to those contracts.64 Neither DCS Argentina nor its customers are parties to this proceeding. Moreover, the Claimant does not assert before this Tribunal any claims arising out of alleged breaches of the contracts between DCS Argentina and its customers. Thus, the forum selection clauses of the lease and loan contracts can have no bearing upon this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThe same is true of the lease and loan contracts between DCS Argentina\u2019s own subsidiaries and their respective customers.\n\n62.\n\nWhat the Claimant does allege is that the Republic of Argentina used its sovereign powers to substantially diminish the value of the Claimant\u2019s rights to returns from its investment.65 The Claimant asserts that Argentina\u2019s sovereign interference with the contract rights held by DCS Argentina and its subsidiaries violated not the contracts (to which Argentina is in any event not a party) but rather several provisions of the German-Argentine BIT, including its provisions on expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, and arbitrary or discriminatory treatment.66 The Claimant\u2019s allegations, if proven, would amount to violations of Argentina\u2019s international obligations under the BIT. This brings the claims within the purview of the ICSID Convention\u2019s requirement that the Claimant must raise a \"legal dispute\" between itself and the Respondent. It also brings the claims at least *prima facie* within the purview of the investor-State dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Article 10 of the BIT, which applies to \"disputes which arise between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment under the Treaty..\"67 Since the Claimant\u2019s claims clearly arise out of the Treaty and not the contracts, Argentina's objections concerning the contracts' forum selection clauses must be rejected.\n\nThe question as to whether the Claimant, as shareholder, may make claims for damages suffered by reason of the abrogation of contractual rights held by its Argentine Subsidiary is addressed in the next part of this Award.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, paras 91-102.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n63.\n\nAs to the parties' arguments with respect to the Treaty's umbrella clause (Article 7(2) of the BIT),68 the Tribunal notes that there exists in this case no investment agreement or other specific contractual agreement between the Claimant and the Respondent in respect of the investment. This absence of a contract between the disputing parties distinguishes the present case from other investor-State cases in which tribunals have had to grapple with whether the presence of a forum selection clause within a specific investment or concession agreement could \"oust\" the jurisdiction of a BIT-based arbitral tribunal with respect to claims concerning violations of the contractual agreement.69 That question simply does not arise here.\n\nArticle 7(2) of the German-Argentine BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall fulfill any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nSee e.g. *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction (6 Aug 2003) [hereinafter \" *SGS v. Pakistan* \"]; *Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italsttade S.p.A. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction (12 Nov 2004) [hereinafter \" *Salini* \"]; and *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Decision on Jurisdiction (6 August 2004).\n\n64.\n\nIn the present matter, the Claimant does not attempt to equate a violation of its Argentine Subsidiaries' customer contracts with a violation of the Treaty's umbrella clause. Instead, the Claimant alleges that Argentina, in making certain representations regarding the stability of its legal and regulatory framework, assumed additional obligations toward the Claimant's investment under Article 7(2) of the BIT.70 The precise scope of Argentina's obligations under Article 7(2) and whether Argentina violated those obligations on the facts are questions for the merits of the case. They need not be decided for purposes of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction. What matters for present purposes is that the umbrella clause claim, as with the Claimant's other claims, arises directly under the Treaty.71 Argentina's jurisdictional objections based upon the BIT's umbrella clause therefore also fall to be rejected.\n\nSee above note 68.\n\nAs noted by the *Siemens* tribunal:  \n \"At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by [the Claimant] are correct. This is a matter for the merits. The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the Claimant's allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them.\"  \n*Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/07, Decision on Jurisdiction (3 Aug 2004) [hereinafter \" *Siemens* \"], para 180.\n\n**B. Second Objection: the Claimant, as Shareholder, Lacks** ***Ius Standi*** **to bring an indirect claim for damages allegedly suffered by the Argentine Subsidiaries**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nArgentina asserts that the Claimant lacks *ius standi* to bring any claims arising out of the damage allegedly suffered by its Argentine Subsidiaries.72 Argentina points out that a company and its shareholders are legally distinct entities and asserts that the latter cannot - absent an explicit legal authorization - exercise any rights on behalf of the former.73 Thus, in the Respondent's view, the Claimant as a mere shareholder in DCS Argentina cannot claim damages on its behalf.74 In support of this conclusion, Argentina argues that none of the four sources of applicable law mentioned in Article 10(5) of the BIT - namely the Treaty, other treaties in force between the State Parties, the law of the Host State, and the general principles of international law - allows for \"indirect\" actions by shareholders.75\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 119, 121-122.\n\nIbid at para 120.\n\nIbid at para 121.\n\nIbid at paras 123-124. Article 10(5) of the German-Argentine BIT is set forth above in para 50 of this award.\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to the Treaty itself, Argentina alleges that the BIT only authorizes indirect claims by shareholders in the limited circumstances set forth in Article 4, as supplemented by Article 3 of the Protocol.76 Article 4 of the BIT deals with expropriation and nationalization of investments, while Article 3 of the Protocol states:\n\n\"A claim to compensation shall also exist when, as a result of measures named in Article 4 regarding the company in which the investment is made, it suffers a serious economic harm.\"77\n\nArgentina asserts that this protection would apply only if the company in which the investment was made had been expropriated or nationalized. In Argentina's view, since the Claimant has failed to allege that its Argentine Subsidiary was actually expropriated, nationalized or seized, this Protocol provision does not apply.78 It further asserts that since the BIT does not authorize indirect claims in any situation outside of Article 4, all of the Claimant's other claims must necessarily fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.79\n\nRespondent's memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 125-126.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all English language quotations from the German-Argentine BIT reproduced in this award are taken from the disputing parties' agreed English translation of the Spanish and German original texts.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 132-134.\n\nIbid at para 127.\n\n67.\n\nArgentina next argues that derivative or indirect actions are not permitted under Argentine law.80 It asserts that the Claimant's Argentine Subsidiary, given its status as a local Argentine company, is governed by the Argentine Commercial Companies Law (No. 19550).81 Under this law, only the Argentine Subsidiary - through its management - may exercise defense of the company's rights. The law limits shareholders to two discrete types of remedies: 1) corporate actions (claiming damages allegedly caused to the company by its managers) and 2) individual actions (for alleged direct damage to the shareholder's property).82 Argentina notes that the Claimant has not attempted to exercise either of these two types of shareholder rights and concludes that its claims are therefore inadmissible under Argentine law.83\n\nIbid at para 134.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at paras 137-140.\n\nIbid at para 141.\n\n68.\n\nConcerning international law, Argentina raises three separate points in its memorial on jurisdiction. First, it asserts that general international law does not allow for indirect actions by shareholders.84 Instead, Argentina submits, claimants \"can only claim for direct damages to their specific rights\" as shareholders.85 The Respondent quotes extensively from the ICJ decision in **Barcelona Traction**,86 which held that \"a distinction must be drawn between a direct infringement of the shareholder's rights, and difficulties or financial losses to which he may be exposed as the result of the situation of the company.\"87 Argentina asserts that this formulation of shareholders' rights under international law is applicable to the present case, notwithstanding the fact that **Barcelona Traction** dealt with a case of diplomatic protection whereas the present proceedings arise under the ICSID Convention and BIT.88 It argues that the ICJ's conclusions were not specific to the case of diplomatic protection.89 In Argentina's view:\n\n\"the difference between diplomatic protection and the protection afforded by the ICSID Convention is related to who files the action: the State of which the affected party is a national in the first case, and the affected party directly in the second case. However, this is not related to what rights can be claimed.\"90\n\nIbid at para 142.\n\nIbid at para 144.\n\nIbid at para 147.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 3, at p. 37, para 47.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 149.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n69.\n\nArgentina's second contention under the \"international law\" heading is that \"the ICSID Convention does not allow indirect or derivative claims\".91 The Respondent points to the Convention's drafting history as summarized by Professor Schreuer, who remarked, in connection with Article 25(2)(b), that a \"suggested solution to give access to dispute settlement not to the locally incorporated company but directly to its foreign owners was discarded.\"92 Argentina notes that Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention instead provides for the possibility that a company having the nationality of the Host State but subject to foreign control may be treated as a national of another Contracting State by agreement of the Parties.93 It asserts, however, that no such agreement exists in this case.94\n\nIbid at IV.D.4.b).\n\nIbid at para 151, citing CHRISTOPH H. SCHREUER, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY (Cambridge University Press, 2001) p. 291 (internal references omitted). The Tribunal notes, however, that the Respondent appears to have taken this quote out of context. In fact, Professor Schreuer states that this suggestion was discarded only because \"this would not be feasible where shares are widely scattered and their owners are insufficiently organized.\" Professor Schreuer was nonetheless unequivocal in stating that Article 25(2)(b) was included because a majority of the delegates who participated in the drafting of the Convention \"found that it would be unwise to exclude locally incorporated but foreign controlled companies\". CHRISTOPH H. SCHREUER, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY, 2d Ed (Cambridge Univeristy Press, 2009), with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch, and Anthony Sinclair [hereinafter \"SCHREUER - 2009\"], p. 297 (internal references omitted).\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 152.\n\nIbid.\n\n70.\n\nThirdly, Argentina submits that in \"conventional international law, indirect claims are exceptional and must be expressly provided for, which is not the case here.\"95 It points to the NAFTA, the US-Chile Bilateral Free Trade Agreement, and the US 2004 Model BIT, all of which expressly provide for indirect actions.96 Argentina stresses that the German-Argentine BIT, by contrast, contains no such special provision.97 Argentina expands upon this line of argument in its reply memorial on jurisdiction, adding also a discussion of the U.S. federal law on derivative suits by shareholders.98 It does so in order to underscore the important policy reasons underlying what it identifies as a general presumption against the admissibility of indirect actions.99\n\nIbid at para 153.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at para 154.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 106-118.\n\nIbid at paras 119-128.\n\n71.\n\nHaving thus addressed what it considers to be the applicable bodies of law under Article 10(5) of the BIT, Argentina then adds a further argument. It asserts that the Chile-Argentina BIT, which the Claimant has invoked for other purposes by means of the German-Argentine BIT's most-favored-nation clause, also does not allow for indirect claims.100 Argentina cites the Chilean BIT's failure to include a provision similar to that of the German BIT's Protocol Article 3 as evidence that the former treaty did not intend to allow indirect claims even in the limited circumstances envisaged by the latter treaty.101 The Respondent therefore argues that the Claimant's lack of *ius standi* cannot be cured by reference to the Chile-Argentina BIT.102\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part IV.D.5.\n\nIbid at para 155.\n\nIbid at para 158.\n\n72.\n\nFinally, in its reply memorial on jurisdiction, Argentina adds yet another dimension to its arguments concerning *ius standi* by raising a factual challenge. It submits that the Claimant has not sufficiently proven its alleged investor status nor what precisely constitutes its alleged qualifying investment under the BIT.103 After surveying the information contained in the Claimant's balance sheets for the years 1994-2005, Argentina points out that the shareholdings in the affected Argentine Subsidiary changed hands and the companies holding those shares changed names several times during that period.104 Argentina particularly notes that the Claimant entered into a purchase and sale agreement on 12 June 2002, by which the Claimant sold the entirety of its shares in the Argentine Subsidiary to its parent company, DaimlerChrysler A.G.105 Then, in 2005, Argentina alleges, the parent company transferred the entire shareholding in the Argentine Subsidiary to DaimlerChrysler Argentina - a separate Argentine subsidiary of the parent company.106\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, para 98.\n\nIbid at para 99.\n\nIbid at para 100.\n\nIbid at para 101. Argentina did not document its source for this assertion. Section V of the Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, however, indicates that the Argentine subsidiary allegedly harmed by Argentina's sovereign measures (DCSA S.A.) and the Argentine subsidiary to which the parent company transferred that subsidiary's shares in 2005 (DC Arg. S.A.) are two separate companies.\n\n73.\n\nArgentina's reply memorial on jurisdiction does not well explain its motivation for raising these points. The Respondent appears to draw two conclusions from this set of facts. First, Argentina seems to suggest that these share transfers demonstrate that the Claimant's shareholding in the affected Argentine Subsidiary is at most an indirect investment. Since indirect claims are, in Argentina's view, precluded under the BIT, the Claimant lacks *ius standi*.107 Second, Argentina remarks cryptically that even if the Claimant did have a protected investment in Argentina, its claim \"refers to investments that do not belong thereto (at least not directly as the BIT applicable to this case requires).\"108\n\nThis seems to be the implication of paras 102-103 of the Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nIbid at para 105.\n\n74.\n\nThere are two possible ways of reading this latter assertion. Either it reiterates the Respondent's objection to the indirect nature of the investment (as suggested by the parenthetical), or it raises a separate objection to the effect that the Claimant lacks *ius standi* because it does not itself own the claims which it is now asserting before the Tribunal (by reason of the share transfers pointed out above). Unfortunately, the Respondent's intended meaning does not appear clearly from its reply memorial. The assertion that the Claimant does not actually own the claims before the Tribunal does emerge clearly, however, in the Respondent's rejoinder on the merits.109 This has led the disputing parties to address the question of ownership during the hearings and in their post-hearing submissions. As such, the Tribunal will address this objection separately below.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras 67-69.\n\n***2. Position of the Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant counters that it has standing under well-established law to assert claims for harm done to its Argentine Subsidiaries.110 It begins by noting that it was the sole shareholder of DCS Argentina and through that company it indirectly owned 100% of the subsidiaries DCCF and DCLA.111 The Claimant asserts that this ownership position gives it standing to bring claims for harms done to those companies.112\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, point IV.\n\nIbid at para 127. The Tribunal notes, however, that according to the documents filed by the Claimants, DFS owned 99% of each of the three Argentine Subsidiaries, with the other 1% belonging to a Mr. Macarenhas. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 70.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 127.\n\n76.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant submits that Argentina has raised this same objection concerning indirect ownership \"in some 22 other international investment arbitrations, each time without success\".113 It also highlights seven other investment cases not involving Argentina in which it asserts that investment tribunals have allowed indirect claims.114 The Claimant cites these decisions as evidence that both the ICSID Convention and the German-Argentine BIT, as well as virtually all other BITs, give corporate shareholders the status of investors, \"regardless of whether they are majority or minority shareholders.\"115\n\nIbid at para 129, citing: *Lanco International Inc. v.

First, it submits that the clear language of the BIT permits indirect claims.116 It argues that the BIT's broad definition of investment encompasses indirect claims and the BIT nowhere requires direct ownership of the assets in question.117 It points particularly to the **Siemens** tribunal's analysis. That tribunal found that the German-Argentine BIT's references to \"investor\" and \"investment\" make no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments and therefore do not exclude indirect investments.118 The Claimant also disputes Argentina's assertions concerning Article 3 of the Protocol ad Article 4 of the BIT. Again quoting **Siemens**, the Claimant states \"there is \u2018no merit in the allegation that the provision for indirect claims in Article 4 and the corresponding provision of the Protocol are an indication that such claims are not permitted under other provisions of the Treaty.'\"119\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Point IV.A.\n\nIbid at para 134.\n\nIbid at para 133; see also *Siemens*, above note 71 at para 137.\n\nIbid at para 136, quoting *Siemens*, above note 71 at para 140.\n\n78.\n\nWith respect to Argentina's reliance upon **Barcelona Traction**, the Claimant submits that this reliance is entirely misplaced.120 It argues that the reasoning of **Barcelona Traction** applies only to cases involving diplomatic protection and not to cases under BITs, wherein investors enjoy a direct treaty-based right to arbitrate claims with Host States.121\n\nIbid at para 141.\n\nIbid.\n\n79.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant submits that the Treaty\u2019s protections extend to the substance of its investment, not merely the free enjoyment of the shares.122 It underscores the Treaty\u2019s provisions protecting the management, use, and enjoyment of the company comprising the investment as evidence that the Treaty\u2019s protections are \"not confined to the exercise of rights inherent in the position of the investor as a shareholder\".123 On this logic, the Claimant asserts: \"rights under a contract held by a local company in which a company of a foreign investor of the other Contracting Party has invested constitute an investment protected by the BIT.\"124 The Claimant again cites the decisions of several previous investor-State tribunals in support of this argument.125\n\nIbid at Point IV.B.\n\nIbid at para 142.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at paras 143-144.\n\n80.\n\nThirdly, the Claimant denies that Argentine law is relevant to a determination of whether it may bring indirect claims under the BIT.126 In the Claimant\u2019s view, Article 10(5) of the BIT (the BIT\u2019s \"applicable law\" provision) applies solely to the merits of the dispute.127 For purposes of determining jurisdiction, on the other hand, \"only Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the terms of the Treaty are relevant.\"128 This is so, the Claimant submits, because the claims concern breaches of the Treaty, not breaches under Argentine law.129 The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must therefore be established by reference to the provisions of the Treaty, irrespective of whether Argentine law would authorize a derivative suit by shareholders in similar circumstances.130 Moreover, the Claimant contends, Argentine domestic law is irrelevant because the Treaty takes precedence over Argentina\u2019s internal law to the extent that there is any conflict between the two.131 The Claimant asserts that this is so both under Articles 27 and 31 of the Argentine Constitution and under Article 27(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.132\n\nIbid at Point I V.C.\n\nIbid at para 148.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at para 149.\n\nIbid.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, in a footnote, the Claimant disagrees with Argentina's submissions as to the Chile-Argentina BIT's preclusion of indirect claims. It argues that even if Argentina's assertions concerning that BIT were correct (which the Claimant disputes):\n\n\"a claim for more favorable treatment under a provision of the Chile-Argentina BIT does not entail being subject to all provisions of that BIT, including those that may be less advantageous, and the Chile-Argentina BIT is therefore irrelevant to the issue.\"133\n\nIbid at note 158.\n\n***3. Considerations of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that the Claimant's claims, as posited, give rise to a \"legal dispute\" as required by the ICSID Convention.134 Argentina's second jurisdictional objection essentially raises the question as to whether this dispute arises out of an \"investment\" in the sense defined by the German-Argentine BIT. Article 1(1) of the BIT defines investment as follows:\n\n\"The term \u2018investment\u2019 shall include any kind of investment in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made in accordance with this Treaty, in particular, but not limited to,\n\na) moveable and immoveable property and any other property rights such as mortgages and liens;\n\nb) shares or stock in a company or any other form of participation in a company;\n\nc) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance hailing an economic value;\n\nd) intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility model patents, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, trade or business secrets, technical processes, knowhow, or goodwill;\n\ne) business concessions under public law, including concessions to search for or exploit natural resources\".135\n\nSee para 63 above.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n83.\n\nSubparagraph b) of this definition makes clear that the Claimant's 99% shareholding in DCS Argentina indeed constitutes a protected investment under the Treaty. Argentina argues that this limits the Claimant's protections under the Treaty to the free exercise of its rights as a shareholder, which, it submits, have not been impinged by the Government's disputed actions. This assertion, however, completely overlooks the fact that shareholdings are only one element in an otherwise broad and non-exhaustive definition that protects \"any kind of investment.\" The Claimant's additional capital infusions into the Argentine Subsidiary, for example, would constitute \"claims to money which has been used to create an economic value\". Likewise, its right to returns136 from the repayment (with interest) of the lease and loan contracts falls squarely within the concept of \"claims to any performance hailing an economic value\" under subparagraph c) of the BIT's definition of investment.\n\nAlso broadly defined by Article 1(2) of the BIT to include \"amounts yielded by an investment and includes profits, dividends, interests, license fees, and other remunerations\".\n\n84.\n\nThat the BIT's protection extends beyond the mere free enjoyment of the Claimant's shares in the Argentine Subsidiary is confirmed by the Protocol, which states:\n\n\"(1) Ad Article 1\n\na) [...]\n\nb) Income from the investment and, in the case of its reinvestment, income from such reinvestment, shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.\"\n\nc) \u2018Any other form of participation' within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) shall in particular include such investments which do not convey any voting or control rights to the holder of the investment.\n\nd) The claims to money referred to in Article 1(1)(c) encompass claims arising from loans related to participation in a company and which in their purpose and scope have the character of participation in a company. The foregoing shall not include loans from third parties such as bank loans under commercial conditions.\"\n\nSubparagraph b) specifies that not merely the shareholdings themselves but also the income to be generated by the investment (whether through shares or otherwise) is protected by the BIT. Subparagraph c) extends this protection to types of participation which do not include voting or control rights, while subparagraph d) further extends it to forms of participation which do not even constitute a shareholding. Investors falling within the latter category would enjoy no rights as shareholders at all, and yet their participation in \"any kind of investment\" is protected under the BIT. The breadth of these Protocol provisions thus confirms that the BIT's protections are not limited to shareholders' rights *qua* shareholders. The fact that the BIT nowhere distinguishes between \"direct\" investments or claims and \"indirect\"/\"derivative\" investments or claims further supports this conclusion.137\n\nOn this point, see the analysis by the **Siemens** tribunal, which considered a nearly identical objection by Argentina in relation to the same German-Argentine BIT. **Siemens**, above note 71 at paras 136-144.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments concerning article 4 of the BIT and article 3 of the Protocol are misguided and do not lead to a different result. Article 3 of the Protocol (ad article 4 of the BIT) provides that \"[a] claim to compensation shall also exist when, as a result of measures named in Article 4 regarding the company in which the investment is made, it suffers a serious economic harm.\"138 The only portion of article 4 referring to \"measures\" is found in article 4(2), which states, in relevant part:\n\n\"Investments by nationals or companies of a Contracting Party may not be expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation.\"139\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent submits that article 4 thus authorizes compensation only in cases of \"direct\" expropriations (*e.g*. the actual expropriation of the shares themselves), whereas article 3 of the Protocol \"also\" and exceptionally authorizes \"indirect\" claims by the foreign shareholder for serious economic harm to the local company where that harm is caused by the types of directly expropriatory measures referred to in article 4.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, notes that neither article 4 of the BIT nor article 3 of the Protocol makes any reference whatsoever to \"direct\" versus \"indirect\" measures or harms. There is simply no reason to infer that article 4 applies to \"direct\" expropriation claims while article 3 of the Protocol applies to \"indirect\" claims. On its face, article 4 guarantees investors compensation in case of expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation. Article 3 of the Protocol then adds that investors will \"also\" be entitled to compensation if the government's expropriatory-like measures cause a \"serious economic harm\" to the investment. A natural and ordinary reading of the Protocol provision, then, suggests that the Contracting State Parties wished to additionally specify the level of harm necessary to establish a claim to compensation in case of governmental measures that fall short of full and outright expropriation. But the Tribunal need not explore the precise scope of these compensation obligations here. It is sufficient to note that these provisions in no way limit the scope of the term \"investment\" as discussed above. They can therefore have no bearing upon the Claimant's standing to bring the present claims.\n\n88.\n\nAs to the Respondent's assertion that Argentine law does not authorize derivative actions by shareholders in circumstances such as the present ones, the Tribunal has already stated that its competence in this matter is determined by the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the German-Argentine BIT.140 The Tribunal has concluded that the Claimant has raised treaty-based legal claims in respect of a protected investment as defined under the BIT. The Argentine law concerning the admissibility of derivative shareholder actions is simply irrelevant to the analysis.\n\nSee part III of the award above.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds Argentina's assertions concerning *ius standi* under international law unpersuasive. As to the ICSID Convention, it is true that article 25(2)(b) of that Convention allows disputing parties to agree to treat a locally incorporated subsidiary as a qualifying foreign investor for purposes of the Convention and that there is no evidence to suggest that the parties in the instant case entered into any such agreement. However, DCS Argentina is not a party to the claim and the Claimant has made no attempt to join its former subsidiary to the proceedings before this Tribunal. Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention therefore has no application. Article 25(2)(a) of the Convention, on the other hand, does apply, and the Tribunal has already noted that the Claimant satisfies the necessary nationality requirement under that provision.141\n\nSee above para 49.\n\n90.\n\nArgentina's arguments regarding the ***Barcelona Traction*** decision and what Argentina terms \"conventional international law\" are equally unpersuasive. As noted both by the Claimant and by numerous other investor-State tribunals, the ***Barcelona Traction*** decision dealt with an attempt by one State to exercise diplomatic protection in favor of its nationals who had invested in a company incorporated in a second State with respect to disputed measures taken against the company by a third State.142 This is a significantly different factual scenario from the present one. Moreover, in reaching its decision to disallow the claim in ***Barcelona Traction***, the ICJ itself noted that international treaties could provide shareholders with a direct right of action against foreign governments for certain claims.143 The present instance is precisely such a case. As noted by the **CMS** tribunal and affirmed by the ad hoc Committee in the **CMS** annulment decision:\n\n\"nothing in general international law prohibits the conclusion of treaties allowing \u2018claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned... even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders.' Such treaties and in particular the ICSID Convention must be applied as *lex specialis*.\"144\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, above note 87 at paras 30-31.\n\nIbid at paras 61-63.\n\n*CMS - Annulment,* above note 113 at para 69 (quoting *CMS - Jurisdiction,* above note 113 at para 48).\n\n91.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with this conclusion. Indeed, some two-dozen previous investor-State tribunals have confirmed that the ICSID Convention, in concert with the definition of \"investment\" offered by numerous BITs, allows shareholders to bring claims for harms to their investments in locally incorporated companies.145 The Respondent has not been able to point to a single case in which this objection to an investor-State tribunal's jurisdiction has been upheld. While the Tribunal is not bound to follow the example of prior tribunals, it can find no justification either in the text of the German-Argentine BIT or in general international law to depart from the overwhelming *jurisprudence constante* that has emerged around this particular legal question.146\n\nSee above notes 113 and 114.\n\nIndeed, none of the considerations mentioned above in para 53 of this Award would justify the Tribunal in adopting a different resolution of the question in this case.\n\n92.\n\nNor does the Respondent's reliance upon the recent U.S. treaty practice provide such a justification. The Respondent has provided no evidence to suggest that the U.S. decision to specifically authorize \"indirect\" claims in its recent investment agreements was prompted by a desire to depart from what Argentina terms a \"conventional international law\" rule to the contrary. It is equally plausible that the U.S. introduced this change in order to explicitly endorse as correct the findings of the numerous investor-State arbitral tribunals referenced above. In any event, the Respondent has not proven nor even suggested anything in the treaty practices of Argentina or Germany - the relevant Contracting States for present purposes - that would support its position.\n\n93.\n\nFinally, Argentina's reliance upon the Chile-Argentina BIT is equally misguided and must be rejected. The Tribunal expresses no opinion as to whether that BIT does or does not authorize shareholders to bring claims for harms suffered by their locally incorporated investments. What matters, in terms of the present Tribunal's jurisdiction, is that the German-Argentine BIT allows such claims, and nothing in the BIT requires qualifying German investors to be subject to the potentially more restrictive jurisdictional provisions of any third treaty. The Chilean-Argentine BIT is therefore inapposite to the question at hand.\n\n**C. Third Objection: The claim refers to the adoption of general measures which exceed the jurisdiction of the Centre**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nArgentina asserts that all of the Claimant's claims relate to general measures adopted by the Argentine Government in response to a national emergency,147 and in particular, to the Government's decision to abandon the currency exchange system.148 Citing the PCIJ decision in *Serbian Loans*, Argentina insists that the regulation of its currency is a matter falling within its exclusive sovereignty under international law.149 It argues that since the BIT's preamble indicates its purpose is to increase the welfare of both countries,150 the Treaty \"cannot be interpreted to prevent any of the party States from adopting measures aimed at safeguarding the Nation's welfare.\"151\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 160.\n\nIbid at paras 164 & 165.\n\nIbid at paras 162 & 164\n\nAccording to the agreed English translation, the relevant phrase of the BIT's preamble reads: \"Recognizing that the encouragement and contractual protection of such investments are apt to stimulate private business initiative and to increase the prosperity of both States...\".\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 163.\n\n95.\n\nIn addition, Argentina submits that the Tribunal does not have competence to review general economic measures unless the Claimant can show not merely that it suffered adverse *factual* effects as a result of the measures but that one of its *legal* rights was prejudiced.152 Argentina asserts that the Claimant has not shown any adverse legal effect for two reasons. First, it submits that the Claimant does not itself possess any legal rights that could have been affected by the Government's measures, because all of its claims relate to contractual rights held by separate legal entities.153 This argument repeats Argentina's second objection above and therefore will not be dealt with again here. Second, Argentina reiterates that it never made any specific commitments towards the Claimant.154 The Respondent acknowledges the *CMS* tribunal\u2019s finding that general measures \"adopted in violation of specific commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\" could fall within the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.155 However, it asserts, this principle is not applicable in the present case, where the Claimant has not proven any \"specific commitments undertaken to it, negotiated with it, and particularly, specifically and exclusively promised to it.\"156 This argument was raised by Argentina under its first jurisdictional objection.157 The Tribunal has already noted that the tenability of the Claimant\u2019s umbrella clause claims is a question for the merits.158 That analysis will therefore not be repeated here.\n\nIbid at para 166.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at para 168.\n\nIbid at para 167, quoting *CMS - Jurisdiction,* above note 113 at para 27.\n\nIbid.\n\nSee para 58 of the Award above.\n\nAbove, para 65.\n\n96.\n\nIn its reply memorial on jurisdiction, Argentina adds two further arguments. It asserts that the Claimant\u2019s position cannot be accepted, because allowing investment tribunals to review the Government\u2019s sovereign monetary policy would effectively nullify the existence of that sovereign power, as it would render it impossible for Argentina to exercise the power without incurring international responsibility.159 Lastly it argues that the fact that the Claimant does not agree with the general measures taken by Argentina in response to the crisis or does not otherwise appreciate the remedies made available to its subsidiaries under the new laws is not sufficient to bring the claims within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.160\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 135.\n\nIbid at paras 136-137.\n\n***2. Position of the Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant responds that it has clearly raised a legal dispute.161 It notes that it has explicitly alleged Argentina\u2019s violation of its legal rights under the BIT.162 These allegations, it contends, meet the ICSID Convention\u2019s Article 25 requirement of a \"legal dispute\" as that phrase is understood in international law.163 Citing several international courts and tribunals and the writings of academic commentators, the Claimant explains that the claims \"must raise legal issues in relation with a concrete situation and the determination of the issue must have some practical and concrete consequences.\"164 It asserts that its claims arising under the BIT meet this definition.165\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 152.\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paras 212-213.\n\nIbid at para 214.\n\nIbid at para 215.\n\n98.\n\nAs to the contention that general economic measures cannot fall within the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals, the Claimant responds, \"ICSID tribunals confronting claims related to Argentina's emergency legislation have uniformly found the requisite \u2018legal dispute.'\"166 The Claimant asserts that some 16 ICSID and UNCITRAL tribunals have confronted the same objection from Argentina, and:\n\n\"[i]n each case, the tribunal found that, although Argentina, as a sovereign State, was able to enact any measure that it saw fit, the tribunal had jurisdiction to determine whether those measures violated binding commitments made by Argentina to its investors and that the dispute thus arose specifically and \u2018directly' out of the investment rather than out of measures of general applicability.\"167\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute Argentina's sovereign right to regulate its currency and economy.168 However, the Claimant asserts, if in so doing Argentina violates its treaty obligations, it must pay compensation.169\n\nIbid at para 217.\n\nIbid at para 222.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 155.\n\nIbid.\n\n99.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disputes Argentina's contention that ICSID jurisdiction may arise only where Argentina has violated a specific commitment made to a specific investor, negotiated individually with that investor.170 It asserts that the very nature of BITs is to provide specific protections to a broad class of investors.171 This purpose, it submits, would be thwarted if only investors in possession of an individually negotiated commitment from the Host State could invoke the protection of BITs.172\n\nIbid at para 156.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n***3. Considerations of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the Respondent's right to regulate its economy as it sees fit. This right adheres in the sovereign Government of Argentina both in times of economic crisis and otherwise. But the Respondent's general sovereignty is not at issue in these proceedings. What is at issue is the Respondent's obligation to observe its treaty commitments under the German-Argentine BIT. The Claimant has not alleged that Argentina may not exercise its powers to regulate its economy nor that such regulation may never negatively affect the Claimant. Rather, it has alleged that where Argentina elects to exercise its powers in a manner that contravenes one of Argentina's voluntarily assumed international obligations to German investors under the German-Argentine BIT, and where such contravention specifically harms the Claimant's investment, Argentina must compensate the Claimant for the violation.\n\n101.\n\nAs stated by the *AES* tribunal in response to a nearly identical objection by Argentina:\n\n\"What is at stake in the present case, as it was in the *CMS* one, are not the measures of a general economic nature taken by Argentina in 2001 and 2002 but their specific negative impact on the investments made by [the Claimant]. As a sovereign State, the Argentine Republic had a right to adopt its economic policies; but this does not mean that the foreign investors under a system of guarantee and protection could be deprived of their respective rights under the instruments providing them with these guarantees and protection. Without anticipating, at this stage, on the consideration of the issue, whether this delicate balance between the respective rights of the Host State and those of the investor were respected in substance, the present Tribunal states that it has jurisdiction for considering [sic] this issue.\"173\n\n*AES*, above note 113 at para 57 (emphasis added).\n\n102.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with this analysis. As readily conceded by the Claimant, the Tribunal is not authorized to pass judgment in an abstract way upon the measures adopted by Argentina in 2001 and 2002 in response to its economic crisis. Its jurisdiction is limited to deciding the specific impact of those measures upon the Claimant's investment under the German-Argentine BIT.\n\n103.\n\nTo return to the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has already found that the Claimant meets the Convention's nationality requirement, that it has raised a treaty-based \"legal dispute\" with the Respondent under the ICSID Convention and the German-Argentine BIT, and that the Claimant's investment is a protected \"investment\" as that term is defined by the BIT.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant has pleaded that its investment suffered specific damages as a direct consequence of the Respondent's disputed measures. In particular, the Claimant has alleged that the value of its lease and loan contracts - which the Tribunal has already found to be a protected stream of income falling within the BIT's definition of \"investment - was substantially reduced by the Government's revocation of the legal regime governing dollar-denominated contracts. The Claimant has moreover alleged that this alteration of the legal regime violated some of Argentina's obligations under the BIT and brought its entire investment to the brink of financial collapse, thereby giving rise to a duty of compensation. It is therefore clear that the Claimant's claims, as pleaded, satisfy the ICSID Convention's requirement of a legal dispute \"arising directly out of an investment.\" For all of these reasons, the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection is also rejected.\n\n**V. FOURTH OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION: DFS IS NOT THE PROPER CLAIMANT BECAUSE IT NO LONGER OWNS THE CLAIM**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Admissibility of the objection**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***1. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent's reply memorial on jurisdiction alludes to the factual underpinnings for this objection.174 Namely, according to the Claimant's Exhibit CX 70, the Claimant (DFS Berlin) sold its shares in the allegedly harmed Argentine Subsidiary (DCS Argentina) to its parent company (DaimlerChrylser AG Stuttgart), by a share purchase agreement dated June 12, 2002 (\"the Share Purchase Agreement\" or \"SPA\").175 It is not until the Respondent's rejoinder memorial on the merits, however, that the essence of Argentina's objection to jurisdiction in consequence of this Share Purchase Agreement becomes clear. In that memorial, Argentina notes that the request for arbitration was filed on 2 August 2004 and objects that by virtue of the sale, DFS no longer owned a protected investment under the BIT as of that date.176 \"As a consequence,\" Argentina states, \"the present case is inadmissible since at the moment of expressing its consent to this arbitration Daimler Financial Services AG was not the owner and/or controlling company of the subsidiaries [which are the] object of the claim.\"177 Argentina reiterated this objection during the oral hearings and in its post-hearing written submissions.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, para 100. These facts are summarized at para 45 above.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that at the time of the share purchase agreement, the Claimant was called DaimlerChrysler Services, AG. Sometime later, however, pursuant to the break-up between the Daimler and Chrysler companies, the Claimant changed its name to Daimler Financial Services (DFS). This is how the Claimant has referred to itself throughout these proceedings.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras 67-68.\n\nIbid at para 69.\n\n106.\n\nArgentina points to the ICJ\u2019s decision in the *Serbia Genocide* case as evidence that the Tribunal retains the authority to decide upon its own jurisdiction, if necessary *proprio motu*, even at this late stage of the proceedings, since there have not yet been any jurisdictional findings by the Tribunal constituting *res judicata*.178 The suggestion seems to be that Argentina\u2019s late raising of the objection should not render the objection inadmissible.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Legal Submissions, pp. 6-7, citing *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzigovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)*, ICJ, Judgment of 26 Feb 2007, paras 118, 127.\n\n***2. Position of the Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAt the hearings, the Claimant objected that Argentina raised this point too late and took the position that it is therefore inadmissible. In its post-hearing submissions, the Claimant emphasizes that Argentina first broached the point in its rejoinder memorial on the merits, only one month before the hearings.179 Therefore, the Claimant asserts, Argentina must be deemed to have waived the objection in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1),180 which states:\n\n\"Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder - unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions of Fact, paras 1211-1212.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Legal Submissions, para 68.\n\n***3. Considerations of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) aims at promoting arbitral efficiency by requiring disputing parties to raise jurisdictional objections in a timely fashion, and the present Tribunal does not doubt of its authority to dismiss an untimely objection in appropriate circumstances. The goal of efficiency must be balanced, however, against the Tribunal\u2019s duty not to exceed its competence, as evidenced by ICSID Rule 41(2), which permits the Tribunal \"on its own initiative [to] consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\" The Tribunal must in addition observe its duty to ensure that both parties receive a full and fair opportunity to present their cases. These are all matters for the Tribunal\u2019s discretion.\n\n109.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that it would not be appropriate to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s objection on timeliness grounds. First, both parties here bear some responsibility for the tardy discussion of the objection. The factual bases for the objection were disclosed to the Respondent at an early stage of the proceedings, and certainly before the completion of the written jurisdictional pleadings. The Respondent\u2019s failure to sufficiently articulate the objection within the time frame set by Rule 41(1) is therefore regrettable.181 On the other hand, the Claimant\u2019s initial presentation of its claim was worded in such a manner as to lead a reasonable reader to believe that the Claimant still owned the Argentine Subsidiary at the time of the filing of the claim.182 Moreover, while the Claimant disclosed the fact of the share transfer in its memorial on the merits, it did so fleetingly in a section of its argument dedicated to quantum issues, not jurisdictional matters. The Tribunal can therefore appreciate how the Respondent might have failed to immediately realize the potential jurisdictional implications of the disclosure, which comprised a single paragraph within the Claimant\u2019s 229-page memorial. This is particularly the case as the objection raises issues that appear to be novel within ICSID jurisdictional practice, as will become clear below. Indeed, for this reason the Tribunal eventually requested and received from both parties an additional round of briefing devoted solely to the question of the effect of the SPA upon the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThe Claimant first disclosed the sale in its 7 August 2007 Memorial on the Merits, at para 160. It submitted a copy of the disputed Share Purchase Agreement (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CX 70) on the same date. This was nearly a year before the 5 May 2008 filing of Argentina\u2019s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and more than two years before Argentina\u2019s 27 October 2009 Rejoinder on the Merits, in which Argentina first clarified its objection concerning the SPA.\n\nSee e.g. Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration at para 20, stating \"this is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment in Argentina by DCS in its wholly-owned subsidiary, DCS Argentina...\".\n\n110.\n\nSecond, the parties here resolved - of their own initiative - to join the jurisdictional and merits proceedings in this case. Thus, while the Respondent\u2019s allusions to the SPA in its written jurisdictional pleadings were oblique at best, it nonetheless clarified the grounds for its objection before the close of the jurisdictional proceedings. Third, from the standpoint of fairness, both parties received ample opportunity to address the objection not only at the oral hearings but also in their post-hearing submissions and in a subsequent round of written briefs. There can therefore be no unfairness to the Claimant from considering the objection at this point.\n\n**B. Substance of the objection**\n---------------------------------\n\n***1. The Tribunal's request for further submissions concerning the SPA***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nDuring the oral hearings the Tribunal requested, from both parties, post-hearing written submissions concerning the law applicable to determining the correct meaning and impact of the disputed Share Purchase Agreement. Regrettably, neither Party provided a clear response to this request. The Tribunal therefore wrote to the parties on 20 August 2010 and again requested further clarification of their respective positions. In that letter, the Tribunal provided a list of specific questions to assist the parties in addressing the Tribunal's concerns. The essential thrust of the letter was as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that the referenced Share Purchase Agreement pre-dates the present ICSID claim, which was registered on 3 August 2004. The Tribunal further notes that the Parties did not, in their post-hearing briefs, respond to the question posed by the Tribunal at the oral hearing concerning the law applicable to the meaning of the Share Purchase Agreement and the corresponding relevance of that Agreement in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdiction (Transcript of Oral Hearings, Day 7, p. 2023, lines 16-22 - p.2024, lines 1-19).\n\nThe question as to whether the ICSID claim was transferred to the Claimant's Parent Company along with the shares may turn upon the intention of the contracting parties to the Share Purchase Agreement. The Tribunal invites the Parties, within 25 days, to file any supplementary submissions, including supporting legal authorities, they may wish to lodge concerning the following questions:\n\n1. The law applicable to the interpretation of the Share Purchase Agreement, whether German law or international law.\n\n2. The proper interpretation of the Share Purchase Agreement under the applicable law in relation to the ICSID claim, including whether, and if so how, the Agreement governs the ownership of the ICSID claim and/or the legal entitlement to any recovery from the ICSID claim.\"\n\n112.\n\nBoth parties duly filed full written responses to the Tribunal's questions, along with supporting witness statements and expert legal opinions. They also provided brief responses to one another's arguments. These submissions have greatly assisted in clarifying the questions before the Tribunal. The key contentions of the parties relating to the SPA objection, as they eventually emerged through these various submissions, are set forth below.\n\n***2. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nArgentina stresses that the Claimant, before filing the present claim, transferred the entirety of its shares in the Argentine Subsidiary to its Parent Company and that it did so without reserving for itself any right to retain any BIT-based legal claims pertaining to the investment subsequent to the transfer.183 In support of its assertion that the Claimant did not reserve its right to bring any ICSID claims, Argentina quotes the relevant portion of the 2002 Share Purchase Agreement:\n\nthe Buyer [aka the Parent Company] hereby purchases from the Seller [aka the Claimant] all the Seller's present shares in the Company. and all rights to future shares which result from any increase to capital until the Closing Date (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the Sold Shares\"), including all the rights to dividends, all the voting rights, and any other rights pertaining to the Sold Shares for all the Company's profits which have not been appropriated to shareholders of the Company until the date of signing of this Agreement.\"184\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Summary of Arguments, para 2.\n\nExhibit CX 70, \"Share Purchase and Assignment Agreement\", Article 1(1) (parenthetical in original) (emphasis added by the Tribunal) (quoted by Argentina in its Post-Hearing Submissions of Fact, p. 69).\n\n114.\n\nArgentina's position is that the phrase \"any other rights pertaining to the Sold Shares\" *prima facie* includes the right to bring an ICSID claim for damages allegedly done to the shareholding. In support of this position Argentina makes two alternative arguments, one under international law and the other under Argentine law. Its primary argument is that international law should apply in determining the effects of the SPA upon the Claimant's standing to file an international arbitration claim.185 The Tribunal should therefore apply the ICSID Convention, the Argentina-Germany BIT, and the relevant rules of international law.186\n\nRespondent's post-hearing SPA submission of 28 Sep 2010, part I, para 1. Unless otherwise noted, all paragraph numbers referring to this submission refer to the paragraph numbers appearing in parts I-V of the submission and not to the paragraphs appearing in the introduction to the submission (which are separately numbered).\n\nIbid at paras 2-3, 20-21.\n\n115.\n\nAs to the latter source of law, the Respondent cites three ICJ cases for the proposition that general international law requires a claimant to hold a legally protected right or interest at the time of filing the claim.187 Here, it submits, the Claimant no longer held a legally protected right or interest when it filed the claim because it had already transferred the investment to its Parent Company. With respect to the ICSID Convention, Argentina submits that the critical date for determining **jus standi** is the date on which the arbitral proceedings are commenced.188 It notes that although other ICSID tribunals have held that the transfer of an investment to a third party did not affect their jurisdiction, these tribunals dealt with scenarios in which the transfer was made after the initiation of the arbitral proceedings.189 Here, the transfer occurred before. For these reasons, the Respondent submits, the Claimant lacks **jus standi** under both the ICSID Convention and general international law.\n\nIbid at paras 5-9 (citing the ICJ's *Barcelona Traction*, *Nottebohm*, and *South West Africa* cases).\n\nIbid at para 23 (citing SCHREUER - 2009, above note 92 at p. 92, section 36).\n\nIbid at paras 24-26 (citing *CSOB v. Slovakia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 May 1999), para 31; and *Vivendi II* - Jurisdiction, above note 113, paras 60-63). The text of Article 10(5) of the BIT is set forth in para 50 of this award.\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent's alternative argument is that Argentine law applies in determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction subsequent to the share transfer. It reaches this conclusion in two ways. First, it argues, the international law relevant to the question includes article 10(5) of the BIT, which refers *inter alia* to Argentine law, thereby confirming that Argentine law applies.190 Second, it submits, if the Tribunal finds that the effects of the SPA upon its jurisdiction are to be determined by a source of law other than international law, then German law applies to the interpretation of the SPA per the SPA's explicit choice of law clause.191 That clause, found in article 8(4) of the SPA, states:\n\n\"So far as legally permitted, this Agreement shall be subject exclusively to the laws of Germany barring the application of the international private law of both Germany and Argentina.\"192\n\nRespondent's post-hearing SPA submission of 28 Sep 2010, at paras 18-19.\n\nIbid at paras 10-11.\n\nArticle 10(4) of the SPA, Claimant's Exhibit CX-70.\n\n117.\n\nCiting the expert opinion of Professor Wurmnest, a German specialist in private international law, the Respondent maintains that \"German law makes a distinction between the agreement to transfer the shares in consideration for the payment of an amount of money [aka the sale obligations under the SPA], and the actual assignment of the shares, rights and/or claims -including ICSID claims.\"193 On this basis the Respondent submits that German law applies to the interpretation of the SPA in determining the obligations of the SPA contracting parties *inter se* but that Argentine law - including its rules on private international law and in turn its substantive law - applies to the determination of whether or not the ICSID claim was actually assigned to the Parent Company.194 Pointing to the expert opinions of Argentine law professors Nissen and Kielmanovich, who stress that Argentine law prohibits domestic derivative actions by former shareholders except in very limited circumstances not present in this case,195 the Respondent then reaches the following conclusion:\n\n\"[C]onsidering that, from the very beginning, Claimant has claimed in its capacity as shareholder of the Subsidiaries that were purportedly affected by the measures challenged in the instant case, and that, under Argentine law, the transfer of shares entails the assignment of all claims related to the ownership of such interest, DFS has no standing to bring a claim before ICSID.\"196\n\nRespondent's post-hearing SPA submission of 28 Sep 2010, at para 12, citing expert opinion of Prof. Wurmnest.\n\nIbid at paras 13-16, 22.\n\nIbid at paras 29-30.\n\nIbid at para 31.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent raises several additional points in support of its position. First, it asserts that the defect in the Tribunal's jurisdiction caused by the share transfer is fatal and cannot be cured. It emphasizes that the Claimant has no standing under international law to bring a claim on behalf of its Parent Company and points out that it has not in fact attempted to do so here.197 It adds that joining the Parent Company to the proceedings at this stage is impossible, as this would require the consent of the Government of Argentina, which consent it emphatically refuses.\n\nIbid at paras 23, 27.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, the Respondent disputes the testimony of the Claimant's witnesses to the effect that the contracting parties to the SPA did not intend to transfer the ICSID claim. According to the Respondent:\n\n**\u2022** the plain language of the SPA shows that the claim was in fact transferred, whatever the parties' *ex post facto* assertions, because the claim is included in the SPA's use of the phrase \"any other rights pertaining to the sold shares\"198;\n\n**\u2022** email exchanges between Daimler officials which form part of the record and which were brought to the Tribunal's attention at the hearings indicate that the possibility of an ICSID claim was not even considered by DFS until sometime in 2004 (thus, since the SPA was concluded in 2002, the contracting parties to the SPA cannot have intended for the ICSID claim to be excluded from the scope of the transfer);199 and\n\n**\u2022** neither the DFS board's resolution approving the share transfer nor the minutes of the meeting at which it was approved mention anything about reserving the right to an ICSID claim.200\n\nRespondent's Observations on the New Evidence Presented by Daimler Together with its Responses to the Tribunal's Additional Post-Hearing Questions, 3 December 2010, at para 24.\n\nIbid at paras 25-28.\n\nIbid at para 29.\n\n120.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts that the evidence submitted by the Claimant in corroboration of its witnesses' testimony (set forth in the Claimant's contentions below) is of no probative value and should be disregarded by the Tribunal, because that evidence was not contemporaneous to the conclusion of the SPA, was prepared solely for the purposes of this arbitration, and does not derive from independent sources.201\n\nIbid at para 2. These claims are further elaborated in, inter alia, paras 16-21 and 41-43. The Respondent also complains of certain formal defects in the Claimant's evidence (ibid at paras 13-16), which the Tribunal finds unnecessary to address in light of its below decision.\n\n121.\n\nFinally, the Respondent disputes that any ambiguity in the meaning of the SPA (as to whether or not the ICSID claim was intended to be transferred) can be cured by the execution of an *ex post facto* interpretive agreement between the SPA contracting parties. This is so, the Respondent argues, because the ICSID claim was undoubtedly transferred upon the transfer of the shares by operation of law - both international and Argentine law - irrespective of the contracting parties' intent.202\n\nRespondent's Observations on the New Evidence Presented by Daimler Together with its Responses to the Tribunal's Additional Post-Hearing Questions, 3 December 2010, at para 24.\n\n***3. Position of the Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimant denies that its rights in the ICSID claim were transferred to the Parent Company under the Share Purchase Agreement.203 It asserts that the Share Purchase Agreement's reference to \"any other rights pertaining to the sold shares\" is modified by the subsequent phrase \"for all the Company's profits which have not been appropriated to shareholders.\"204 The Claimant therefore alleges that the phrase \"any other rights\", under a plain language reading, encompasses only those rights referring to the Argentine Subsidiary's non-allocated (and presumably already existing) profits, which would not include any potential recoveries pursuant to an investment treaty claim. In the Claimant's view, \"[t]here is nothing in the Share Purchase Agreement to indicate that the right to investment treaty claim [sic] was transferred and it was not necessary to specifically reserve those right [sic].\"205 The Claimant buttresses this basic position with arguments from both German law and international law.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submissions of Fact, para 1199.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n123.\n\nAs to the former, the Claimant states that German law is the law applicable to the interpretation of the SPA. This is so, it argues, because the SPA contracting parties explicitly selected German law to govern the contract (article 8(4) of the SPA) and also because \"under the BIT and general international law which applies to ICSID jurisdictional questions, questions specifically pertaining to a corporation, including its capacity, corporate authority and governance are all determined by the law of the state of incorporation or its legal seat, which, in this case is Germany.\"206 The Claimant points out that German law, international law, and Argentine law all recognize and give effect to the choice of law selected by the parties to a contract.207 It further stresses that Argentine legal advice obtained by Daimler at the time of conclusion of the SPA confirmed that German law could govern the contract.208 Moreover, the Claimant argues, \"[t]he Argentine Government expressly accepted the application of German law to the interpretation of the Share Purchase Agreement.\"209 The Claimant notes that Argentina, when reviewing the proposed transfer for the purpose of registering the transfer of title to the shares, requested the Claimant to submit legal opinions confirming the legality of the SPA under German law and EC competition law. In approving the transfer, the Argentine Central Bank referenced the German legal opinions provided by Daimler and stated that \"[t]he agreement, insofar as it is permitted by Law, will be exclusively subject to German law, preventing the application of both German and Argentine international private law.\"210\n\nClaimant\u2019s post-hearing SPA submission, para 3.\n\nIbid at paras 8-16\n\nIbid at para 17.\n\nIbid at para 20.\n\nIbid.\n\n124.\n\nAs to the contention - raised by Argentina\u2019s expert, Professor Wurmnest - that German law distinguishes between the law applicable to the interpretation of the contract and the law applicable to the transfer and assignment of the shares, the Claimant and its witnesses appear to accept that this is correct. The Claimant explains that, because the transferred company was an Argentine company and, as a financial entity, subject to regulation by the Argentine Central Bank, its share titles were subject to registration with the Argentine authorities.211 The phrase \"so far as legally permitted\" in the choice of law provision in Article 8(4) of the SPA, it submits, was inserted solely \"to allow for the approval of the transfer of the shares by the Argentine Central Bank and perfection of the transfer by notification and registration under Argentine law.\"212 In short, the Claimant contends that Argentine law applies to the formalities of the title transfer and registration, while German law governs the interpretation of the SPA itself.\n\nIbid at para 19.\n\nIbid at para 19.\n\n125.\n\nGerman law, the Claimant submits, establishes that the right to assert the ICSID claim was not transferred. First, German law would require such a transfer to be explicitly stated in the SPA in order to be valid, and no such explicit transfer was recorded here.213 Second, German law gives effect to the \"wirkliche Wille\" or \"true intention\" of the parties, and it was not the intent of the Claimant or its Parent Company to transfer the ICSID claim under the SPA.214 This is evidenced, the Claimant submits, both by the terms of the SPA itself and by the subsequent conduct of its contracting parties, including in particular the following facts:215\n\ni. The negative purchase price paid for the local Argentine Subsidiary allocated all losses allegedly arising out of the ICSID claim to DFS, not to its Parent Company.\n\nii. The SPA contracting parties did not adjust the negative purchase price in any way for the estimated value of the ICSID claim.\n\niii. Financial statements submitted by DFS show that all losses associated with the ICSID claim were not only intended to be born by DFS but were actually born by DFS.\n\niv. DFS requested and received authorization to pursue the ICSID claim from its own board and not from the board of the Parent Company.\n\nv. Bookkeeping entries submitted by DFS show that DFS, and not the Parent Company, has born the costs of the present arbitration.\n\nvi. The Parent Company has not attempted to participate in the present arbitration in any way and has not filed its own ICSID claim.\n\nvii. The Claimant and the Parent Company have submitted an \"Interpretive Agreement and Undertaking\" confirming that the SPA contracting parties did not intend to, nor did they, transfer the ICSID claim to the Parent Company, and this Interpretive Agreement is valid and binding under German law in light of article 8(3) of the SPA.216\n\nIbid at paras 36-42.\n\nStatement of Wolfgang Bauder, Senior Counsel of Daimler AG, at para 5(c).\n\nIbid at paras 25-36, 40-41, and Claimant's post-hearing SPA submission at paras 90-118.\n\nArticle 8(3) of the SPA states: \"All amendments and supplements to this Agreement including this clause must be in writing in order to be legally effective. \". The Claimant stressed the validity of the subsequent Interpretive Agreement in its Post-hearing SPA submission at paras 70-73.\n\n126.\n\nAs to international law, the Claimant asserts that \"neither the ICSID Convention nor the Treaty require [sic] that the foreign investor retain continuous ownership of the investment for jurisdictional purposes.\"217 The Claimant makes several interrelated points with respect to the ICSID Convention. First, it asserts, the ICSID Convention does not require continuous ownership of the investment, nor that the investor continue to own the investment at the time of the request for arbitration or at any other defined time.218 Instead, the ICSID Convention's only jurisdictional requirement is that there is a legal dispute arising out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.219 This, the Claimant asserts, it has duly shown.220\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Legal Submissions, Part III.A.(d).\n\nIbid at paras 59, 61, 65, & 66.\n\nIbid at paras 59, 64.\n\nIbid at paras 69-84.\n\n127.\n\nNext, the Claimant stresses that Article 25 of the Convention defines the protected party by its status as a \"national\" of the other Contracting State, not by its status as a current \"investor\".221 It asserts that the Convention's only temporal requirement lies in article 25(2), which specifies that the nationality of the investor is to be determined as of the date of the request for arbitration.222 It therefore maintains:\n\nDaimler Financial's claim fully complies with any ICSID or other authority standing for the proposition that jurisdiction is determined on the date of the request for arbitration, because on that date, it was a foreign national, with a legal dispute that arose out of an investment.223\n\nIbid at para 60\n\nIbid at para 62.\n\nIbid at para 64.\n\n128.\n\nEven if this were not the case, the Claimant asserts, it is enough that the Claimant is the investor who suffered the actual harm at the time of the measures complained of. This is because \"it is not share ownership *per se* which gives standing; it is the share ownership at the time the damage was done to the investment that accords standing.\"224 The Claimant cites the decisions in *EnCana v. Ecuador*, *Mondev v. United States*, and *El Paso v. Argentina* as evidence that the arbitral jurisprudence has not recognized any criterion of continuous ownership in investor-State arbitration.225\n\nClaimant's post-hearing SPA submission at para 34.\n\nIbid at paras 60-63.\n\n129.\n\nAs to the BIT, the Claimant submits that the Contracting State Parties to the BIT could have required the investor to own the investment at the time of the registration of the claim. In the Claimant's view, the fact that they did not do so in either the BIT or the Protocol - despite narrowing the concept of qualifying investors and investments in other ways - shows that the Contracting State Parties did not intend to require continuous ownership.226\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Legal Submissions at paras 66-67.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant submits that declining jurisdiction on the basis that the shares were transferred to the Parent Company would also be inconsistent with the objects and purposes of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. It submits:\n\n\"Such a requirement [continuous ownership of the investment] would foreclose an investor from divesting itself of an investment which is failing due to the treaty breaches of the host State, forcing it to choose between suffering continuing harm or giving up its ICSID claim. It would also permit the State to expropriate an investment with impunity because the foreign investor could not bring a claim since it no longer owns the investment, despite the fact that it suffered the harm and has a legal dispute with the State. Such a requirement would frustrate the very purpose of the applicable treaty and deter foreign investment.\"227\n\nIbid at para 63.\n\n131.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant asserts, even if the parties had intended to transfer the ICSID claim (which it denies), the only thing that legally could have been transferred would have been the right to assert damages associated with the investment after the effective date of the transfer of shares.228 This is because under international law, \"the claims of an investor under a BIT arising from damage to its investment at the time it held the investment are not bound to the shares of the vehicle that the investor used to make its investment. Rather, such claims are personal to the investor and cannot be transferred merely by the transfer of the shares the investor\n\n**owns.\"**229\n\nIbid at para 33.\n\nIbid at para 45. See also paras 57-64.\n\n132.\n\nFinally, the Claimant maintains that the notion of a transfer of the claim makes little sense on the facts, since both DFS and its Parent Company each already possessed an independent right to bring the present ICSID claim against Argentina as a result of the measures complained of - DFS in its capacity as the direct investor, and the Parent Company in its capacity as the indirect investor (given its 100% shareholding in DFS).230 It cites several ICSID cases in support of the proposition that the existence of multiple potential qualifying investors within a corporate chain does not deprive a tribunal of its jurisdiction over any given qualifying investor\u2019s claim.231 Rather, the Claimant submits, any concerns as to possible multiple recoveries against a Respondent arising out of the same set of facts can be dealt with at the damages phase.232 The Claimant asserts that such concerns are in any event inapposite here, as \"Daimler AG has given an undertaking that should the Tribunal accept jurisdiction over the claims in this proceeding and accept the right of Daimler Financial to assert those claims, Daimler AG will not assert a claim for the damages which has been asserted by Daimler Financial AG in this proceeding.\"233\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing SPA Submission at para 75.\n\nIbid at paras 77-83, 88.\n\nIbid at paras 84-86.\n\nIbid at para 89.\n\n***4. Considerations of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nIt is convenient to begin by summarizing the points on which the disputing parties agree:\n\n**\u2022** German law applies to the interpretation of the SPA and the question of intent. Both parties and their relevant experts and witnesses agree that the choice of law clause contained in article 8(4) of the SPA is a valid expression of the consent of the contracting parties to the SPA. Therefore, German law governs the proper interpretation of the SPA, including the question as to whether or not the contracting parties intended, by transferring the shares, to transfer the ICSID claim.\n\n**\u2022** Argentine law governs the domestic formalities relating to the transfer of the shares. Because the transferred shares were issued by a domestically incorporated and domestically regulated Argentine company, the parties and their experts and witnesses agree that Argentine law governs the transfer of title to the shares and the approval of the sale and registration of the title transfer by the Argentine Central Bank. Both parties also agree that the Argentine Central Bank did in fact approve the sale and that the necessary formalities for transferring the title to the shares were observed. The requirements of Argentine law in these respects were therefore fully met.\n\n**\u2022** International law applies in determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction and in determining the effect of the SPA upon the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Both parties agree that the ICSID Convention, the BIT, and the relevant rules of general international law apply to this determination.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the parties in the above-listed points of agreement.\n\n134.\n\nThe parties' submissions also indicate numerous points of disagreement, the most significant being as follows:\n\n**\u2022** Which specific provisions of the ICSID Convention and BIT apply in determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n**\u2022** Whether or not Argentine law has any relevance to that determination;\n\n**\u2022** In what capacity the Claimant brings its claims, whether as a shareholder or otherwise;\n\n**\u2022** Whether or not the intent of the SPA contracting parties is relevant in determining the effect of the SPA upon the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n**\u2022** Whether the right to bring the ICSID claim was actually transferred along with the shares by operation of law, irrespective of the SPA contracting parties' intent;\n\n**\u2022** Whether there exists a continuous ownership criterion under the ICSID Convention, and if so until what relevant date; and of course\n\n**\u2022** Whether or not the Tribunal ultimately has jurisdiction over the claims.\n\n135.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed all of the disputing parties' contentions, the submissions of their witnesses and experts, and all of the relevant legal authorities and evidence, the Tribunal concludes that the transfer of the shares occasioned by the SPA does not deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction over the Claimant's ICSID claims. This is so whether one analyzes the question as one under international law (the law principally applicable to ICSID claims) or under German law (the law applicable to the SPA). As will become clear below, Argentine law is irrelevant to the analysis.\n\n**a) Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n136.\n\nWhile the disputing parties agree that international law applies in determining this Tribunal's jurisdiction, they disagree as to which specific provisions of the ICSID Convention and BIT govern the resolution of the present objection. The Tribunal has, however, already decided this point above.234 That is, article 25 of the ICSID Convention applies, along with the relevant jurisdictional provisions of the BIT - including the BIT's definitions of \"investment\", \"national\", \"company\", \"returns\", etc along with article 10(2)'s pre-requisites to jurisdiction - all as interpreted in light of the relevant principles of general international law. As noted above, the Claimant has shown that it satisfies all of the requirements of article 25 of the ICSID Convention and that it meets the BIT's definitional requirements as a \"national\" or \"company\" of the Federal Republic of Germany having made a qualifying \"investment\" in Argentina. Also as noted above, Argentine law is irrelevant in determining whether the Claimant has met these treaty-based requirements. The Respondent's assertion that article 42 of the ICSID Convention and article 10(5) of the BIT compel the Tribunal to analyze the question under Argentine law must therefore be rejected.\n\nSee above, Part III.\n\n137.\n\nArgentina's alternative argument that German law, as the law governing the SPA, also requires the Tribunal to apply Argentine law in determining the ownership of the ICSID claim is likewise misguided. It appears to be based upon a misconstrual of the testimony of its expert, Professor Wurmnest, a German specialist in private international law. Professor Wurmnest indeed stressed that German law distinguishes between the law applicable to the interpretation of a share purchase contract and the law applicable to the formal transfer and assignment of the shares sold. On this basis he concluded that German law applies to the interpretation of the SPA while Argentine law governs the formalities of the assignment such as the registration of the title transfer. As to the ownership of the ICSID claim, however, Professor Wurmnest concluded that this must be determined not under Argentine law but under international law. This much is clear from the following excerpts of Professor Wurmnest's carefully considered opinion:\n\n\"Under the German conflict-of-law rules, the law governing the transfer of title to shares is the law applicable to the corporation whose shares are assigned (*lex societatis*). Assuming that Argentine law follows a similar approach. The proper law of the corporation is Argentine law because the Argentine subsidiaries are incorporated in Argentina.235 [. ] From a German perspective, the *lex societatis* governs the assignability of the shares as well as the formal and substantive requirements for an effective transfer of title to the shares. Moreover, the *lex societatis* determines which membership, management or financial rights a shareholder enjoys vis-\u00e0-vis the corporation.236\n\nThe law applicable to the assignment of the ICSID claim has to be analysed from a different perspective.\"237 [...] \"With regard to the law governing the formal and substantive requirements to be met in order for DFS to effectively transfer the ICSID claim to Daimler, the German conflict-of-law rules, as has been stated earlier, call in principle for the application of the law governing the assigned claim.\"238 [\u2026] \"Assuming that Argentine conflict-of-law rules follow a similar approach, the issue whether the ICSID claim has been effectively transferred to Daimler is governed by the law applicable to the ICSID claim.\"239 \" The ICSID claim arises from the Bilateral Investment Treaty concluded between Germany and Argentina itself. Thus, the preconditions for an effective assignment are in principle governed by international law. The same result follows if all legal aspects of the assignment of the ICSID claim are considered to be governed directly by international law without reference to a conflict-of-laws analysis.\"240\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wurmnest, at para 18.\n\nIbid at para 20.\n\nIbid at para 21 (emphasis added).\n\nIbid at para 22.\n\nIbid at para 23.\n\nIbid at para 24 (emphasis added).\n\n138.\n\nIn short, Argentina's own expert witness agrees with the Claimant and its deponents, all of whom affirm that Argentine law was relevant solely to the formalities of perfecting the share transfer, and it is common cause that these formalities were duly observed. Professor Wurmnest was careful to offer no opinion on the separate question he identified - namely, whether the \"preconditions for an effective assignment\" of the ICSID claim were actually met under international law.241 It is upon the answer to this latter question that the Tribunal's jurisdiction hinges.\n\nSee ibid at para 9, stating: \"This Opinion will limit itself to issues of conflict-of-laws under German law. It will not touch upon issues pertaining to international law or Argentine law.\"\n\n**b) Was the ICSID claim effectively assigned under international law (and does international law have a \"continuous ownership requirement\")?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the opinions of Argentina's experts Nissen and Kielmanovich unfortunately provide no assistance in plumbing the requirements for an effective assignment of an ICSID claim under international law. Professor Kielmanovich, an expert in Argentine civil procedure and family law, opens his opinion by stating: \"I have been requested to provide a legal opinion on the effects of the Share Purchase Agreement... under Argentine Law with regard to the Claimant\u2019s right to file a claim.\"242 Professor Nissen, a specialist in Argentine corporate law, similarly opens by noting: \"I was asked to issue a legal opinion regarding the rights that, under the Argentine legal system, derived from the holding of a share in an Argentine company, and regarding the effects of a transfer of shares of the same kind as the one established in the Share Purchase Agreement. under Argentine law.\"243 Both experts eventually conclude that under Argentine law, DFS could no longer bring a claim in its capacity as shareholder for damages done to the Argentine Subsidiary once it had transferred the entirety of its shareholding in the Subsidiary to DCAG.244\n\nKielmanovich Statement on SPA at para 1 (emphasis added).\n\nNissen Statement on SPA at para 2 (emphasis added).\n\nSee Kielmanovich Statement on SPA at para 5, stating: \" [i]f DFS brought a claim in its capacity as shareholder of the two Argentine subsidiaries and it currently (in fact, since 2002) is not a shareholder thereof, it would lack procedural standing to make its claim\"; and Nissen Statement on SPA at para 22(3), stating:  \n \"Pursuant to Argentine law, in order to file a claim for alleged damages directly suffered by the corporation, a person who alleges having suffered said damages in his or her capacity as shareholder for the same cause that affected the corporation and who, after filing the claim, ceased to be a shareholder as a result of relinquishing his or her shares do not have any legal standing.\"\n\n140.\n\nThis conclusion may well be correct. But as the Argentine law on derivative shareholder actions does not govern the right to bring an ICSID claim under a bilateral investment treaty, it is of no relevance to the question at hand. Moreover, both experts make clear in their reports that their conclusions rest upon the assumption - apparently fed to them by the Respondent - that DFS\u2019s present claim is brought in its capacity as a shareholder.245 The Tribunal has, however, already considered and rejected this assertion above, noting that: a) DFS explicitly grounds its standing on its capacity as an investor, not as a shareholder; b) not all of DFS\u2019 claims arise exclusively from its shareholding in the Argentine Subsidiaries; c) the BIT authorizes qualifying investors to bring claims for damages suffered even independent of any shareholding; and d) in any event, the ICSID Convention and the BIT establish a different regime from the one prevailing under customary international law by specifically authorizing investors to claim compensation for certain damages done to their shareholdings.246 For the same reasons, the Respondent's renewed arguments to the effect that general international law also prohibits derivative actions by shareholders (citing *Barcelona Traction*) are once again inapposite and fall to be rejected.247\n\nProfessor Kielmanovich, in fact, explicitly acknowledges the possibility that DFS might still retain other claims deriving from other sources of law. He notes that if DFS is attempting to bring a claim before ICSID not in its capacity as a shareholder but rather by virtue of \"those rights that remained in its equity once the assignment was completed\", then the feasibility of the claim would \" depend on the relevant jurisdiction and admissibility rules; that is, the rules allowing the submission of disputes to international arbitration proceedings by relying on the Argentina-Germany BIT and the ICSID Convention. In this report, I do not pose an opinion on the scope and interpretation of these international law instruments.\"\n\nSee the Tribunal's discussion in part IV.B.3. above.\n\nIbid.\n\n141.\n\nTurning then to the requirements for the effective assignment of an ICSID claim under international law, the parties have focused much attention on the so-called \"continuous ownership criterion.\" Both the Claimant and the Respondent cite to investor-State cases in which a claimant had sold its investment to a third party after initiating the arbitration. These cases have uniformly held that the subsequent sale of an investment does not deprive an investor-State tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear the claim. Some of the decisions have suggested that this is so because the \"critical date\" under international law is the date upon which the arbitration is commenced.248 The Respondent argues that this implies that where an investment is sold before the commencement of the arbitration, the tribunal will necessarily lack jurisdiction. However, as pointed out by the Claimant, none of the tribunals cited by Argentina actually addressed that question, and certain *obiter dicta* in the decisions suggest that at least some tribunals would have been prepared to accept jurisdiction even if the sale had occurred prior to the arbitration's commencement. For example, the *EnCana* tribunal held:\n\n\"Provided loss or damage is caused to an investor by a breach of the Treaty, the cause of action is complete at that point; retention of the subsidiary (assuming it is within the investor's power to retain it) serves no purpose as a jurisdictional requirement, though it may be relevant to questions of quantum.\"249\n\nSee e.g. CHRISTOPH H. SCHREUER, THE ICSID CONVENTION, A COMMENTARY (2009), at p. 92, section 36, stating:  \n \"Apart from specific rules about critical dates, the date of the commencement of the proceedings is decisive. It is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined by reference to the date on which judicial proceedings are instituted. This means that on that date all jurisdictional requirements must be met. It also means that events taking place after that date will not affect jurisdiction.\"\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Ecuador*, Award, LCIA Case No. UN3481, ILC 91 (3 February 2006), para 131.\n\n142.\n\nOther tribunals have noted there may be good reasons not to impose a continuous ownership requirement. For example, in cases of expropriation, an investor will by definition no longer own the investment at the time of lodging the arbitration claim. Yet this should not preclude the investor from obtaining the compensation due under the BIT.250 Moreover, to impose a continuous ownership requirement may defeat the ends of justice in cases where the sale of the investment was forced - e.g. under domestic bankruptcy laws, where the bankruptcy itself may have been caused by some act of the respondent state in violation of the BIT.\n\nSee *Mondev Int'l Ltd v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award (11 October 2001) at para 91, finding that the international protection of investment should not \"be overshadowed by technical questions of the application of local property laws and the classification of local property interests affected by foreclosure or other action subsequent to the failure of the investment.\"\n\n143.\n\nTo this Tribunal's knowledge, only the **Loewen** tribunal has actually declined jurisdiction on a parallel (though not identical) ground. In that case, a NAFTA tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction on the basis that the investor failed to maintain a continuous nationality after a crossborder bankruptcy proceeding forced the investor to undergo a corporate re-organization which changed the investor's nationality from Canadian to U.S.251 But the **Loewen** tribunal's imposition of this continuous nationality requirement has been criticized from many quarters.252 As one commentator noted:\n\n\"Indeed, in 2000 the International Law Commission's rapporteur on diplomatic protection concluded that there was no rule of customary international law with respect to continuous nationality because opinions and practice as to the range of dates on which a claimant must have the requisite nationality had varied so much.\"253\n\n*The* *Loewen Group Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award (26 June 2003), at paras 225-238.\n\nSee e.g. EMMANUEL GAILLARD, LA JURISPRUDENCE DU CIRDI 788 (2004); Maurice Mendelson, *The Runaway Train: The \"Continuous Nationality\" Rule from the Panavezys-Saldutiskis Railway case to Loewen*, *in* INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND ARBITRATION: LEADING CASES FROM THE ICSID, NAFTA, BILTATERAL TREATIES AND CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW (Todd Weiler ed., 2005); Noah Rubins, Loewen v.

Bjorkland, \"The Emerging Civilization of Investment Arbitration\", 113 PENN STATE L. REV 169 (2009) at p. 1280 (citing International Law Commission, Report to the International Law Commission on Diplomatic Protection, A/CN.4/506/Add.1 (April 20, 2000)).\n\n144.\n\nOf course, there is no problem with continuous nationality in the present case, since both DFS and its Parent Company have remained German corporations throughout the history of the present proceedings. But similar arguments can be made against the imposition of the continuous ownership requirement proposed by the Respondent here. As the large and thriving global market for distressed debt attests, most jurisdictions allow for legal claims to be either sold along with or reserved separately from the underlying assets from which they are derived. The reason is that such severability greatly facilitates and speeds the productive re-employment of assets in other ventures. The Respondent has pointed to no rule of general or customary international law which would prohibit a similar result from obtaining for ICSID claims. Indeed, the rationale for recognizing the severability of a damages claim from the underlying asset may be even stronger in the case of ICSID claims, since a strong argument can be made that the ICSID Convention and many BITs accord standing only to the original investor and not to any subsequent would-be purchasers of the underlying investment.254\n\nThis follows from the nationality requirement of the ICSID Convention and most BITs, as well as from the fact that most BITs afford standing to bring ICSID claims only to \"nationals\" or \"companies\" of the other State Party which made an investment in the Respondent State prior to the advent of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the dispute.\n\n145.\n\nThe better view would seem to be that ICSID claims are at least in principle separable from their underlying investments. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Claimant\u2019s ICSID claims (or at least those connected with the shareholding) were necessarily and automatically transferred along with the shares by operation of law. Rather, the Tribunal finds that it should accord standing to any qualifying investor under the relevant treaty texts who suffered damages as a result of the allegedly offending governmental measures at the time that those measures were taken - provided that the investor did not otherwise relinquish its right to bring an ICSID claim.\n\n146.\n\nThe next question to address is then whether the right to bring an ICSID claim was in fact relinquished by the Claimant in favor of its Parent Company on the facts of the present case. As noted above, the disputing parties disagree as to whether the SPA\u2019s use of the phrase \"any other rights pertaining to the Sold Shares for all of the Company\u2019s profits\" indicates that the right to bring an ICSID claim was intended to be transferred along with the shares. This is a question of interpretation, and in interpretational matters, international law typically defers to the intentions of the authors of the instrument in question.255 As stated by the tribunal in *Sapphire v. National Iranian Oil Company*, \"[i]t is a fundamental principle of law, which is constantly proclaimed by international courts, that contractual undertakings must be respected. The rule *pacta sunt servanda* is the basis of every contractual relationship.\"256 It is for this reason that international law also respects the choice of law clauses stipulated by parties to international contracts. On the facts, the Claimant and its Parent Company chose German law to govern the interpretation of their Share Purchase Agreement, and both the Claimant and the Respondent in the present proceedings have accepted the validity of this designation. The Tribunal will therefore apply German law in considering the meaning to be ascribed to the disputed phrase under the SPA.\n\nExceptions may exist in certain circumstances, for example where the parties\u2019 intentions violate a peremptory norm of international law, but no such exceptions arise on the present facts.\n\n*Sapphire v. National Iranian Oil Co.*, Arbitral Award (15 March 1963), I.L.R. 1967, 136 at 181.\n\n**c) Was the ICSID claim effectively assigned under German law?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant has submitted extensive arguments concerning the proper interpretation of the SPA under German law. In particular, Dr. Wolfgang Bauder, Senior Counsel of Daimler AG - who is a German lawyer with more than 25 years of experience and was the individual responsible for drafting the SPA - has testified:\n\n\"Under German law, a right or claim owned by a shareholder against third parties is not inherent in the share ownership, and cannot be and is not transferred by operation of law. Instead, it must be explicitly delineated as being transferred in the agreement. Consistent with German law in this regard, the Share Purchase Agreement did not explicitly list or delineate any potential claim held by Daimler Financial against the Argentine Republic as one of the rights transferred and assigned by the parties.\"257\n\nThis position is commensurate with the above findings of the Tribunal under international law, and the Respondent has not attempted to rebut Dr. Bauder's characterization of German law on this point.\n\nStatement of Wolfgang Bauder on SPA at para 5(b).\n\n148.\n\nAs to whether or not the ICSID claim was encompassed by the phrase \"any other rights pertaining to the Sold Shares,\" Dr. Bauder's statement stresses the following principles of German law on the interpretation of contracts:\n\ni) \u00a7 157 of the German Civil Code specifies that \"[c]ontracts are to be interpreted as required by good faith, taking customary practice into consideration.\"258\n\nii) \u00a7 133 of the German Civil Code \"gives particular weight to ascertaining the will of the parties\" and \"provides that the \u2018true intention' or \u2018true will' (the \u2018wirkliche Wille') of the parties should prevail over the literal meaning of a declaration.\"259\n\niii) While \"both the subjective intent - \u2018innere Wille' - and objective factors - \u2018bekundete Wille' - must be considered,\"260 \"[t]he focus in German law is so strongly on the parties' subjective intent that the legal maxim *falsa demostratio non nocet* (\u2018an erroneous designation does not vitiate') is at times applied by the German courts. If the subjective intent of the parties differs from the express agreement, the court will give effect to the subjective intent.\"261\n\nDr. Bauder then devotes five pages of his testimony to explaining how the factual evidence submitted by the Claimant and recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph 126 above proves that neither DFS nor DCAG intended to transfer the ICSID claim to the Parent Company.\n\nIbid at para 16 (Dr. Bauder's translation).\n\nIbid at para 15.\n\nIbid at para 16.\n\nIbid at para 17.\n\n149.\n\nThis interpretation is likewise endorsed by G\u00f6sta Dobler, Senior Counsel of DFS, who executed the SPA at the time of its conclusion on behalf of the Claimant.262 It is further affirmed by Thomas Gruber, Director of Accounting and Financial Reporting for DFS, who - in explaining how the contracting parties arrived at the SPA's negative purchase price for the shares -categorically states: \"I am certain that the calculation of the negative purchase price did not include any sums attributable to the value of any potential legal claims, including the claims asserted in this arbitration.\"263 And lest there be any doubt, the SPA contracting parties have now taken the extra step of reaffirming their intent by concluding an Interpretive Agreement and Understanding which \"confirms that the Contracting Parties did not intend to, nor did they, transfer the claims at issue in this proceeding.\"264 The Claimant submits that German law authorizes this sort of subsequent interpretive confirmation between contracting parties265 and notes that \"[a]rticle 8(3) of the Share Purchase Agreement contemplates the possibility of such a supplemental agreement and specifically authorizes it, provided it is in writing.\"266\n\nStatement of G\u00f6sta Dobler on SPA at para 6.\n\nStatement of Thomas Gruber on SPA at para 9.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing SPA Submission at para 114.\n\nIbid at para 70.\n\nIbid at para 71.\n\n150.\n\nAgain, the Respondent does not call into question the Claimant's characterization of German law on any of these points, and the Tribunal's own analysis of the relevant provisions of the German Civil Code has unearthed no major flaws in the Claimant's analysis. Nor has the Respondent attempted to directly rebut the Claimant's factual evidence or the testimony of its witnesses. Instead, the Respondent questions the probative value of the Claimant's evidence and urges the Tribunal to discount it on the grounds that it does not derive from neutral sources and was prepared solely for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that of the items of evidence submitted by the Claimant in corroboration of its assertion that the SPA contracting parties did not intend to transfer the ICSID claim to DCAG, items i) and ii) listed in paragraph 126 above were contemporaneous to the conclusion of the SPA while items iii) through v) were prepared in the normal course of business operations. These items therefore do have probative value and the Tribunal finds them to be highly persuasive indicators of the SPA contracting parties' intent. In particular, by instituting the present arbitration, the Claimant has signaled that it expects the value of its claim to be positive and in fact rather substantial.267 It would be counter-intuitive for the Parent Company to \"pay\" a \u20ac250 million negative price to the Claimant for the transferred shares while acquiring a valuable claim in exchange.\n\nThe Claimant's damages estimates under various different theories of liability range anywhere from $US 45.7 million to \u20ac272.7 million in 2002 currency, not including relevant interest up to the present date.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant's sixth item of evidence concerns the Parent Company's abstention from participation in the present arbitration proceedings. This decision, obviously taken in advance of the Claimant's filing of the ICSID claim, would also make no sense if indeed the SPA contracting parties had intended to transfer the claim to the Parent Company. Finally, with respect to item vii) of the Claimant's evidence, it is undeniable that the Interpretive Declaration was executed by the SPA contracting parties in response to developments in this arbitration. However, given that the Declaration is nonetheless authoritative and binding upon DFS and its Parent Company under applicable German legal principles, the Tribunal would be ill-advised to disregard it entirely. At the very least, it constitutes a relevant circumstantial confirmation of the SPA contracting parties' original intentions.\n\n153.\n\nThere remains one final evidentiary matter to address. Argentina has pointed to certain email exchanges between DFS and DCAG tending to indicate that the two companies did not even become aware of the possibility of filing an ICSID claim until sometime in 2004 - that is, two years after the conclusion of the SPA. In the Tribunal's view, this can only serve to confirm that the SPA contracting parties did not intend to include the ICSID claim among the rights to be transferred. One obviously cannot intend to transfer a right whose existence is unknown. The Tribunal has already found that the claim was not transferred by operation of law, whether German law or international law. And even if the Tribunal could accept Argentina's assertion that the ICSID claim *prima facie* falls within the scope of the phrase \"any other rights pertaining to the Sold Shares\", the large negative purchase price set for the shares would have to be read as an implied reservation of the ICSID claim in favor of DFS. In short, all of the available evidence points to the conclusion that DFS did not relinquish its right to bring the ICSID claim upon execution of the SPA.\n\n**d) Conclusions**\n------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe foregoing analysis shows that DFS enjoys standing as a qualifying investor to bring the present ICSID claim for damages sustained during the time when it owned the investment notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of its shareholding in the Argentine Subsidiary to DCAG. As suggested by the *EnCana* tribunal, in the event that the evidence indicates that DFS has already been compensated for its losses in some fashion, the Tribunal can address this at the quantum stage of the proceedings. The fact that DCAG, as the Parent Company and 100% owner of DFS, will be the ultimate beneficiary of any recovery by DFS is not relevant to the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear DFS\u2019 present claim.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is likewise unaffected by the fact that certain investor-State jurisprudence suggests that DCAG may - as the indirect owner of the Argentine Subsidiary at the time of the allegedly offending governmental measures - also enjoy an independent right to bring its own claim for the same damages. The present Tribunal is not called upon to decide whether the German-Argentine BIT authorizes claims by indirect investors and it expresses no opinion on the matter. It notes, however, that in the event that some future tribunal should find itself faced with a parallel claim by DCAG, that tribunal would have ample legal tools at its disposal to prevent any double recovery against the Respondent arising out of the same set of facts and circumstances as the present claim.\n\n156.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s fourth objection to jurisdiction falls to be rejected.\n\n**VI. FIFTH OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION: THE MOST-FAVORED NATION CLAUSE DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THE CLAIMANT TO BYPASS THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLES 10(2) AND 10(3) OF THE TREATY**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nNot surprisingly, this objection has given rise to the most heated debate between the disputing parties. Both parties have filed voluminous submissions concerning the Treaty\u2019s MFN clauses and their relation to: a) the dispute settlement provisions of the German-Argentine BIT (\"the Basic Treaty\"), and b) the dispute settlement provisions of other treaties - in particular the Chilean-Argentine BIT (\"the Comparator Treaty\") invoked by the Claimant. In support of their respective positions, both parties have extensively discussed numerous investor-State arbitral awards, scholarly commentary, and the decisions of other international courts and tribunals. A complete recitation of all of the parties' arguments is, however, unnecessary and would overly burden this award. The Tribunal instead finds it convenient to enumerate in outline form only the parties' principal submissions. The Tribunal will refer to certain of the cited legal opinions in its below considerations to the extent that it finds these relevant to its analysis.\n\n**A. Position of the Respondent**\n---------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nArgentina denies that the Basic Treaty's MFN clauses allow this Tribunal to base its jurisdiction upon the Claimant's satisfaction of the pre-arbitral requirements of article X of the Comparator Treaty rather than those of Article 10 of the Basic Treaty.268 Its principal submissions in support of this position are as follows:\n\na) The Basic Treaty requires the Claimant, before resorting to an arbitral tribunal, to submit the dispute to the competent Argentine courts for a period of 18-months, which the Claimant has not done.269 Moreover:\n\ni) This requirement constitutes a necessary condition of Argentina's consent to arbitration;270 and\n\nii) The requirement is not excessively formalistic.271\n\nb) The MFN clauses of the German-Argentine BIT cannot be applied to the BIT's provisions on dispute resolution because to do so would:\n\ni) Conflict with the language of the MFN clauses themselves;272\n\nii) Run counter to the demonstrated practice of the Argentine Republic;273\n\niii) Violate the *ejusdem generis* principle;274 and\n\niv) Violate the principle of effectiveness (*effet utile*).275\n\nc) \"Case law\" confirms that MFN clauses do not apply to the Basic Treaty's dispute resolution provisions.276 In particular:\n\ni) The decisions in *Salini v. Jordan*, *Plama v. Bulgaria*, *Telenor v. Hungary*, and *Wintershall v. Argentina* support Argentina's position;277\n\nii) Cases such as *Maffezini* and *Gas Natural* differ from the one under consideration and should be distinguished accordingly,278 or in the alternative, they should not be followed.279\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part IV.A.\n\nIbid at paras 7-13.\n\nIbid at paras 8.9, & 11; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 70-75.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 12; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 54-69.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 5-17.\n\nIbid at paras 18-28.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, part IV.A.2.a); Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 4750.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, part IV.A.2.b); Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras 5152.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, part IV.A.3.\n\nIbid.

Position of the Claimant**\n-------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that no prior recourse to the domestic Argentine courts was necessary, because this requirement has been superseded by operation of the Basic Treaty's MFN clauses.280 In support of this position, the Claimant submits the following arguments:\n\na) The language of the Treaty shows that the Contracting State Parties intended for the MFN provisions to apply to dispute resolution.281 In particular:\n\ni) The Treaty's context, including its title and Preamble, support a broad reading of the MFN clauses.282\n\nii) The ordinary meaning of the Treaty's terms support a broad application of the MFN clauses.283\n\niii) The Contracting State Parties did not limit the definition of \"activities in connection with investments\" so as to exclude dispute resolution.284\n\niv) The additional MFN provision in Article 4 of the Treaty does not limit the broad scope of the MFN provision in Article 3.285\n\nb) Access to international dispute resolution is an essential treaty protection and is encompassed by a treaty's MFN provisions unless explicitly excluded.286\n\nc) Access to international dispute resolution following a 6-month negotiating period is more favorable than the requirement to submit the dispute to the domestic courts for 18-months before proceeding to arbitration.287\n\nd) The cases cited by Argentina are inapposite because they dealt with factual situations distinguishable from the present one.288\n\ni) On the contrary, investment tribunals have \"uniformly\" upheld the application of MFN provisions to domestic dispute settlement requirements of arbitration clauses.289\n\ne) The *ejusdem generis*290 and *effet utile*291 principles both support the application of the MFN clause to the Treaty's dispute resolution provisions.\n\nf) Argentina's treaty practice shows it has no overarching policy to require domestic dispute resolution and therefore the Basic Treaty's MFN provisions should be read to allow the domestic courts requirement to be superseded.292\n\ng) The Basic Treaty' s 18-month domestic courts provision is a matter of procedure, the strict application of which is unnecessary and would be excessively formalistic.293 In particular:\n\ni) The provision is in essence a waiting period and is not a true exhaustion of domestic remedies requirement;294\n\nii) Mere waiting periods have been repeatedly waived by other tribunals;295\n\niii) Despite Argentina\u2019s assertions to the contrary, it is \"virtually impossible that the dispute would be resolved in or outside Argentina within 18 months to the satisfaction of both parties.\"296\n\nh) Requiring the Claimant to satisfy the 18-month domestic courts provision would run contrary to the Treaty\u2019s purpose of promoting favorable conditions for investment297 and would be futile and lead to a situation which is manifestly absurd,298 because:\n\ni) It would subject the Claimant to costs and delays not faced by other investors;299\n\nii) It would lead to major, nonsensical inefficiencies in the dispute resolution process;300 and\n\niii) In any event, enforcing the provision on the facts of this case would be unjust on account of Argentina\u2019s efforts to impede domestic resolution.301\n\nClaimant's Memorial, part III.E.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Point 1.A.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Point I.A.1.\n\nIbid at Point I.A.2.\n\nIbid at Point I.A.3.\n\nIbid at Point I.A.4.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Point I.B.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para 235.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Point I.C.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Point I.C.

Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***1. Tribunal's Interpretive Approach under Public International Law***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal is keenly aware that the interpretation and application of MFN clauses has proven to be one of the most controversial issues not only between the disputing parties in this case but also within the world of international investment law more generally.302 For this reason, the Tribunal considers it prudent to preface its analysis by setting out the general interpretive approach it will apply in considering the parties\u2019 respective submissions.303\n\nFor an overview of the divided case law, see Julie A. Maupin, \"MFN-based Jurisdiction in Investor-State Arbitration: Is There Any Hope for a Consistent Approach?,\" *Journal of International Economic Law* 14(1), 157-190 (March 2011).\n\nIt will be noted that portions of the analysis contained in this section overlap with the recently issued decision in *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited (United Kingdom) v. the Argentine Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-9 (UNCITRAL Rules), Award on Jurisdiction (10 February 2012) [hereinafter *ICS v. Argentina* ]. This is because the two tribunals shared the same President, who presided over the drafting of the two awards during the same time period and elected not to burden the parties with duplicative drafting costs in respect of certain general points of law common to both cases.\n\n**a) Interpretive principles flowing from the bilateral nature of BITs**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe investment treaty at the heart of this case is a bilateral investment treaty. In considering its interpretation, it is essential to recall that BITs are reciprocal bilateral treaties negotiated between two sovereign State parties. The general purpose of BITs is of course primarily to protect and promote foreign investment; but it is to do so within the framework acceptable to both of the State parties. These two aspects must always be held in tension. They are the *yin* and *yang* of bilateral investment treaties and cannot be separated without doing violence to the will of the states that conclude such treaties. It is in this context that the exact wording of dispute resolution clauses plays a key role, as such clauses are one of the privileged places where the imbalances between the interests of both parties are often precisely defined as a result of the treaty's negotiation process.\n\n162.\n\nIt would be an error to start from the assumption that the bilateral and synallagmatic dimension of such treaties is of a mere rhetorical nature. In the present era of globalization and rapid economic change at the world level, a growing number of investments are indeed bidirectional, flowing not only from highly developed to developing countries but also in the opposite direction.304 Moreover, the very essence of treaties is precisely to protect the respective sovereign international policy decisions of the State parties by means of the formality inherent in the legal nature of such instruments.\n\nFor instance, in the **Maffezini** case, the investor was an Argentine citizen and the Host State was Spain, not the contrary. **Maffezini**, above note 114.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal must also bear in mind the important differences between ordinary contracts and treaties. While both are based upon the will of the parties, the latter are concluded between sovereign States. In this respect, the ever-increasing number of claims based upon an alleged violation of the rules and principles of public international law as incorporated in the provisions of BITs (\"treaty claims\" as opposed to \"contract claims\") has changed the overall physiognomy of the international arbitration of investment disputes. Where a treaty claim is invoked, arbitral tribunals are called upon to interpret not merely the asymmetric contractual relationship between a sovereign state and a private foreign investor, but to adjudicate whether a sovereign state has actually respected or violated the international obligations which it accepted with regard to the investments made by nationals of the other sovereign state party to the same treaty. Jan Paulsson very suggestively qualified this as \"arbitration without privity.\"305\n\nJ. Paulsson, \" Arbitration Without Privity,\" (1995) ICSID Review - Foreign Investment Law Journal 232. See also A. El-Kosheri, \"ICSID Arbitration and Developing Countries\", (1998) ICSID Review -Foreign Investment Law Journal 107.\n\n164.\n\nNow as international treaties, BITs constitute an exercise of sovereignty by which States strike a delicate balance among their various internal policy considerations.306 For this reason, the Tribunal must take care not to allow any presuppositions concerning the types of international law mechanisms (including dispute resolution clauses) that may best protect and promote investment to carry it beyond the bounds of the framework agreed upon by the contracting state parties. It is for States to decide how best to protect and promote investment. The texts of the treaties they conclude are the definitive guide as to how they have chosen to do so.\n\nThe International Court, as far back as the PCIJ\u2019s *Wimbledon* decision, has consistently emphasized that international treaties are exercises - and not abdications - of State sovereignty, and for this reason, the will of the contracting State parties must be respected:  \n \"The Court declines to see in the conclusion of any Treaty by which a State undertakes to perform or refrain from performing a particular act an abandonment of its sovereignty. No doubt any convention creating an obligation of this kind places a restriction upon the exercise of the sovereign rights of the State, in the sense that it requires them to be exercised in a certain way. But the right of entering into international engagements is an attribute of State sovereignty.\"  \n*Case of the S.S. \"Wimbledon\", Judgment of 17 August 1923*, Permanent Court of International Justice, Ser. A, no. 1, p. 16, 25.\n\n165.\n\nAs explained by Professor Charles de Visscher, one of the most eminent judges at the ICJ, when summarizing the jurisprudence of the Court:\n\n\"The judge is not asked to penetrate the intimate designs of the contracting parties; he is expected to discover by the means at his disposal that part of their intentions that external signs reveal. Now the words freely chosen by the parties are par excellence or at least primarily the instrument of this externalization. This, in turn, is a security factor. The security that the treaty affords the contracting parties is measured by its capacity to withstand pressures that might be brought to promote changes. Of this fundamental contractual guarantee the text, the common work of the parties, is the essential instrument.\"307 [\u2026]\n\nWhat the Court does not allow is that in the course of interpretation the text should be prematurely eclipsed by a teleological scrutiny that might distort its meaning. Such precipitate reasoning may result in sacrificing respect for the text to subjective considerations. \"308\n\nCHARLES DE VISSCHER, THEORY AND REALITY IN PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW (revised ed.), translated from the French by P.E. Corbett, (New Jersey, Princeton, 1968), p. 395.\n\nIbid at p. 396. It should be noted that the teleological method of interpretation was also soundly rejected by the International Law Commission in its drafting work concerning the law of treaties, which eventually culminated in the text of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. See ILC Commentary on Draft Article 27 of the law of treaties, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1966, Vol. II, Reports of the Commission to the General Assembly [hereinafter \"ILC Commentary on Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties\"], at pp. 220ff.\n\n166.\n\nThis reasoning carries equal force in the context of international arbitration - whether *ad hoc* or institutionally-based - between investors and States. International treaties must be presumed to create objective obligations among contracting State parties. The basic interpretive approach applied to such treaties should therefore remain consistent across adjudicative fora. The *Renta4* tribunal recently came to a conclusion similar to Professor De Visscher's, stating in the context of a BIT-based investor-State arbitration:\n\n\"To choose one of the contending policy theses as the reason to read a BIT in a particular way may be presumptuous. The stakes are high and the policy decisions appertain to the State-parties to the treaties. Speculations relied upon as the basis of purposive readings of a text run the risk of encroachment upon fundamental policy determinations. The same is true when \u2018confirmation' of a hypothetical intention is said to be found in considerations external to the text. The duty of the Tribunal is to discover and not to create meaning.\"309\n\n*Renta4 S.V.S.A. v The Russian Federation*, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction (20 Mar 2009) [hereinafter \" *Renta4* \"], para 93 (emphasis added).\n\n167.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with this approach. It will therefore endeavor to ascertain the interpretation of the German-Argentine BIT that is at once most consistent with the Treaty's stated objects and purposes and most respectful of the specific framework adopted by the Contracting State Parties as their chosen means for furthering those objects and purposes. Only by satisfying both criteria can the Tribunal properly fulfil its interpretive mandate.\n\n**b) Consent as the cornerstone of all treaty commitments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nStepping back from the specific case of bilateral treaties, all international treaties -whether bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral - are essentially expressions of the contracting states' consent to be bound by particular legal norms. They encapsulate voluntarily accepted restraints upon the universally recognized principle of state sovereignty. Consent is therefore the cornerstone of all international treaty commitments, at least insofar as those commitments exceed the minimum requirements of customary international law.310 The primacy of the principle of consent runs through all types of treaty commitments entered into by states. There is no distinction between substantive treatment provisions, MFN clauses, dispute resolution clauses, or otherwise. All are equally valid and equally binding to the full extent of the contracting State parties' consent.\n\nEven in the case of customary international law, it can be argued that consent, or at least the consent of a majority of the world's states, underlies all of the norms reflected in customary international law. Without such consent (as demonstrated by the combination of a sufficiently broad, lasting and consistent state practice and supported by *opinio juris*), those norms would not have evolved into customary law in the first place. The Dissenting Opinion correctly points out that the consent underlying customary international law is of an implied and not express nature. It stresses that \"established rules of customary international law can bind States that never granted, explicitly or otherwise, consent to individual acts of the type that gave rise to the principles in question.\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at note 8). Yet the existence of the persistent objector doctrine - which allows states not in agreement with an evolving customary norm to avoid becoming legally bound by it - demonstrates that consent is nevertheless fundamental to customary international law. The only major exception to the foundational nature of state consent within public international law arises in the context of peremptory norms, among which a state's submission to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal cannot be counted.\n\n169.\n\nSince all international treaty commitments arise from the same source (consent) all must logically be interpreted according to the same basic interpretive principles without distinction as to the type of treaty or type of commitment. This is precisely why the International Law Commission was able to codify into a single convention - with the acceptance of an overwhelming number of the world's states - the now customary law rules on the interpretation of treaties reflected in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.311\n\nWhether or not these articles reflected customary international law at the time of their drafting is of course open to debate. Even so, most scholars would concede that they have by now attained customary law status.\n\n170.\n\nIn this vein, several investor-State tribunals have rightly pointed out that dispute resolution clauses of BITs should be interpreted no differently than any other treaty clause.312 This has been the prevailing position in investment arbitration at least since the first *Amco Asia* matter, wherein the tribunal held:\n\n\"[L]ike any other convention, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly or liberally*. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties; such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\"313\n\nSee eg *InterAguas*, above note 113 at para 59 (\"the Tribunal finds no reason for interpreting the most-favored-nation treatment clause any differently from any other clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT\") and para 64 (\"dispute resolution provisions are subject to interpretation like any other provisions of a treaty, neither more restrictive nor more liberal\"). An identically composed tribunal made nearly identical statements in a joint award concerning two closely related matters in *AWG*, above note 113 at paras 59-60. Further examples of such statements can be found in: *Siemens*, above note 71 at para 81; and *Renta4*, above note 309, Separate Opinion of Charles N. Brower at paras 7-9.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation v. Indonesia* (*Jurisdiction*), 1 ICSID Reports 389 (1983), Award of 25 Sept. 1983 (B. Goldman, I. Foighel and E. Rubin, arbs), *reprinted in* 22 I.L.M. 351, 359 [1983] (emphasis in original) [hereinafter \" *Amco I* \"].\n\n171.\n\nMore recently, the prominent tribunal in *Mondev v United States* echoed this *ex ante* neutral approach, observing:\n\n\"there is no principle either of extensive or restrictive interpretation of jurisdictional provisions in treaties. In the end the question is what the relevant provisions mean, interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of interpretation of treaties\".314\n\nJudge and President Higgins came to a similar conclusion when considering a slightly different question in her separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case, stating:\n\n\"[i]t is clear from the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court and of the International Court that there is no rule that requires a restrictive interpretation of compromissory clauses. But equally, there is no evidence that the various exercises of jurisdiction by the two Courts really indicate a jurisdictional presumption in favour of the plaintiff. [\u2026] The Court has no judicial policy of being either liberal or strict in deciding the scope of compromissory clauses: they are judicial decisions like any other.\"315\n\n*Mondev*, above note 250 at para 43 (citing *Amco I*, ibid, at p. 394 of ICSID Reports); and *Ethyl Corporation v. Canada*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Award on Jurisdiction (24 June 1998) [hereinafter *Ethyl*], at para. 55.\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports 1996*, p. 857, para 35. It is important to note, however, that Judge Higgins was not specifically addressing whether compromissory clauses should be read more narrowly than other treaty clauses. Rather, she was arguing that the Court should make its jurisdictional findings in the same manner as its findings on the merits - namely, on a definitive (as opposed to provisional) basis.\n\n172.\n\nIndeed, as a matter of public international law, the uniform applicability of the Vienna Convention's customary law interpretive principles to all treaty clauses is beyond doubt. This truism, however, in no way diminishes the underlying requirement of state consent. In interpreting dispute resolution provisions in BITs - just as with any other treaty provision - the ultimate goal is to determine what the contracting parties actually consented to. Thus, the fact that dispute resolution clauses should be construed neither liberally nor restrictively does not authorize international tribunals to interpret such clauses in a manner which exceeds the consent of the contracting parties as expressed in the text. To go beyond those bounds would be to act *ultra vires*.\n\n173.\n\nThe Vienna Convention itself unequivocally emphasizes the foundational role of State consent in the law of treaties. The Convention employs the word \"consent\" no fewer than 62 times, including in the titles to six articles.316 Within the Convention's interpretive prescriptions, it is well-known that article 31(1) begins by instructing interpreters to interpret a treaty \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" While the article does not explicitly mention consent, the reference to \"good faith\" nevertheless reinforces the duty of tribunals to limit themselves to interpretations falling within the bounds of the framework mutually agreed to by the contracting state parties. As stated by the International Law Commission in its commentary to the draft version of Article 31, the requirement of interpretation in good faith \"flows directly from the rule *pacta sunt servanda*.\"317\n\nArticles 11-15, 17.\n\nILC Commentary on Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, above note 308 at p. 221. The Dissenting Opinion adds, and the Tribunal agrees, that the good faith principle is also \"meant to encapsulate well-established principles such as *effet utile*, honesty, fairness and reasonableness in interpreting a treaty, protection of legitimate expectations [those of the Contracting State Parties, that is, and] avoidance of abuse of rights\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 7).\n\n174.\n\nGeneral respect for State consent is also manifested by the fundamental principle of public international law according to which international courts and tribunals can only exercise jurisdiction over a State on the basis of its consent. As noted by the Permanent Court of International Justice in one of its first judgments, \"[i]t is well established in international law that no State can, without its consent, be compelled to submit its disputes... either to mediation or to arbitration, or to any other kind of pacific settlement\".318\n\n*Status of Eastern Carelia Case*, Advisory Opinion, (1923) P.C.I.J. Series B. No. 5, p. 27.\n\n175.\n\nThis basic rule was often recalled by the International Court of Justice, as in particular in the *Ambatielos* case319 as well as in the *Monetary Gold* case.320 Against this background, it is not possible to presume that consent has been given by a state. Rather, the existence of consent must be established. This may be accomplished either through an express declaration of consent to an international tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or on the basis of acts \"conclusively establishing\" such consent.321 What is not permissible is to presume a state\u2019s consent by reason of the state\u2019s failure to proactively disavow the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Non-consent is the default rule; consent is the exception. Establishing consent therefore requires affirmative evidence. But the impossibility of basing a state\u2019s consent on a mere presumption should not be taken as a \"strict\" or \"restrictive\" approach in terms of interpretation of dispute resolution clauses. It is simply the result of respect for the rule according to which state consent is the incontrovertible requisite for any kind of international settlement procedure. This was already established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the famous *Lotus* case of 1927322 and further recalled by the ICJ in the case of the *Aerial Incident of July 27, 1955*323 as well as in the *East Timor* case of 1995.324 What is true of the very existence of consent to have recourse to a specific international dispute resolution mechanism is also true as far as the scope of this consent is concerned.325\n\n*Ambatielos case (merits : obligation to arbitrate)*, Judgment of May 19th, 1953 : I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 10, 19 [hereinafter \" *Ambatielos I* \"].\n\n*Case of the monetary gold removed from Rome in 1943*, Preliminary Question, Judgment of June 15th, 1954, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 19, 32.\n\nSee *Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Minority Schools)*, Judgment, 1928 PCIJ (ser. A) No. 15 (26 April), p. 24, stating: \"[T]here seems to be no doubt that the consent of a State to the submission of a dispute to the Court may not only result from an express declaration, but may also be inferred from acts conclusively establishing it.\" (Emphasis added.) Note 34 of the Dissenting Opinion cites this passage with approval. The Tribunal notes that the **Noble Energy** decision, also cited in note 34 of the Dissenting Opinion, is not to the contrary, finding as it did that \" consent is manifest from a number of elements which the Tribunal will review. \". **Noble Energy**, *Inc. and Machala Power Cia Ltd. v. Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction (5 May 2008), para 194 (emphasis added).\n\n*Case of the S.S. Lotus*, P.C.I.J. Series A. No. 10 (7 Sep 1927), p. 18.\n\n*Case concerning the Aerial Incident of July 27th, 1955 (Israel v. Bulgaria)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment of May 26th, 1959: I.C.J. Reports 1959, p. 127, at 142.\n\n*East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 90, at 102, para 29.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion attempts to draw a neat dividing line between the establishment of consent to be bound by a specific dispute resolution mechanism and the scope of that consent, suggesting that the former can be founded on purely \"formal indicia\" such as the fact of signature and ratification of a treaty, while the latter is a matter of textual interpretation (Dissenting Opinion at n. 15). This distinction is a red herring. If the interpretive analysis reveals that the scope of Argentina\u2019s consent to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal does not extend to the matter at hand, it is difficult to understand in what sense the State\u2019s consent to submit to that jurisdiction will have nevertheless been \"established\" on the basis of the State\u2019s mere signature and ratification of the Treaty. The relevant question is not whether the Treaty was ratified - which it was - but what precisely the States consented to in ratifying the Treaty. See e.g. *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 177, at paras 65ff (finding it necessary to determine the \"extent of the consent given by the Parties to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction\").\n\n176.\n\nOn the basis of the ICJ\u2019s *jurisprudence constante* mentioned above, it must be clear that states may elect whatever means of settlement of disputes relating to international investment they so choose. They may also perfectly well decide in the framework of a BIT to extend the bearing of a most-favored nation (MFN) clause to the international settlement of their disputes relating to investments.326 But this choice cannot be presumed or artificially constructed by the arbitrator; it can only result from the demonstrated expression of the states' will.\n\nThis appears to have been done by the United Kingdom in some of its BITs. See eg Article 3(3) of the Agreement Between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 2 Oct 2002, which stipulates: \"For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above [MFN treatment] shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.\"\n\n177.\n\nIn addressing the different issues raised by the disputing parties in the present case, the main task of the Tribunal is therefore to identify the true will of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina as it was stated in the 1991 Treaty which they agreed upon for the \"promotion and reciprocal protection of investments\". In particular, the Tribunal must determine whether the State Parties, in concluding the German-Argentine BIT, intended to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal in circumstances wherein the investor has satisfied the procedural requirements for international dispute resolution under a Comparator Treaty but has not fully complied with the investor-State dispute resolution process laid down in the Basic Treaty.\n\n178.\n\nFollowing the order of arguments made respectively by Argentina and by the Claimant, the Tribunal will in turn address the formulation and content of Article 10, which deals with the international settlement of investor-State disputes, and of Articles 3 and 4, which set out the most-favored nation clauses binding upon the two State Parties. The meaning and effect of each of these articles will be examined in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention. That is, the interpretation of each article will be conducted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".327 The Tribunal will also look to supplementary means of interpretation as appropriate in accordance with Article 32 in order to \"confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31: (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"328\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 31(1).\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 32\n\n***2. Analysis of the Dispute Resolution Clause in the German-Argentine BIT***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Mandatory and sequential nature of the Treaty's investor-State dispute resolution provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nArticle 10 of the BIT regulates the settlement of disputes between foreign investors and Host States arising under the Treaty. Article 10 provides:\n\n(1) \"Disputes which arise between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment under the Treaty, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If a dispute *referred to in paragraph 1* cannot be settled within six months from the date either of the parties to the dispute formally announced it, it shall be referred upon the request of either party to the dispute to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n(3) Under either of the circumstances referred to below, the dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal:\n\n(a) at the request of a party to the dispute if, within a period of 18 months of initiation of the judicial proceeding *in accordance with paragraph 2*, the tribunal has not rendered a final decision or if such a decision has been rendered but the dispute between the parties continues;\n\n(b) if both parties have so agreed.\n\n(4) Unless otherwise agreed between the parties to the dispute, *in the instances outlined in paragraph 3* of this Article, disputes between the parties shall either be presented for arbitration in connection with the March 18, 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States or to an ad hoc tribunal established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\nIf within three months of a party to the dispute instituting an arbitration proceeding no agreement has been arrived at, and providing both Contracting Parties are party to the March 18, 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, the dispute shall be subject to an arbitration proceeding under the said convention. Otherwise, the dispute shall be referred to the ad hoc tribunal mentioned above.\n\n(5) The arbitral tribunal shall arrive at its decisions on the basis of this Treaty and, if applicable, other agreements made between the parties, the internal law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made -including the rules of international private law - and general principles of international law.\n\n(6) The arbitral decision shall be binding and shall be enforced in accordance with national law.\"329\n\nDisputing Parties' agreed English translation of the German-Argentine BIT (emphasis added).\n\n180.\n\nThree observations are immediately evident from this recitation. First, the article phrases its dispute resolution process in mandatory terms. The repeated use of the word \"shall\", which faithfully reflects similar mandatory language used in both the Spanish and German original versions of the text, indicates that the process laid down in Article 10 is of an obligatory and not an optional character.\n\n181.\n\nAmong other obligations, the disputing parties shall attempt amicable settlement, failing which the dispute shall be submitted to the domestic courts for at least 18 months. If the matter proceeds to international arbitration, it shall be submitted to either an ICSID or UNICTRAL tribunal. If there is no agreement between the two disputing parties, it shall be submitted to an ICSID tribunal if both States are parties to the Convention; otherwise it shall be submitted to an *ad hoc* UNCITRAL tribunal. This language makes clear that the disputing parties' dispute resolution options are tightly circumscribed under the Treaty. The parties shall - not may, but shall - comply with the provisions as set down. As noted by the *Wintershall* tribunal, \"[t]he word \u2018shall' in treaty terminology means that what is provided for is *legally binding.\"330*\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 Dec 2008) [hereinafter \" *Wintershall* \"] *,* para 119 (emphasis in original).\n\n182.\n\nSecond, by ordering the basic steps of the dispute resolution process into four discrete paragraphs (paras 1-4) and imbuing each step with a mandatory character, Article 10 makes clear that the Contracting State Parties intended for the steps to follow one another in sequential fashion. Article 10 does not provide a menu of dispute settlement options available to disputing parties on an *a la carte* basis. Rather, it provides a specific sequential process whose order must be strictly observed. This is confirmed by the fact that each subsequent step refers explicitly back to the prior step. Thus, paragraph 2 applies only to \"a dispute referred to in paragraph 1\"; paragraph 3(a) comes into play only after fulfilment of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 2, and paragraph 4 operates only \"in the instances outlined in paragraph 3\" of the article. The intention of the Contracting Parties to make each step in the dispute settlement process contingent upon the fulfilment of the prior step could not be clearer.331\n\nSee ibid at paras 121-122.\n\n183.\n\nThirdly, the \"if-then\" structure of paragraph 3 underscores that this mandatory and sequential process applies also in the case of international arbitration. That is, a dispute may be submitted to international arbitration only if : a) it has already been submitted to the domestic courts for 18-months and no final decision has been rendered or the dispute otherwise continues after that time, or b) the disputing parties so agree. The paragraph lists these two circumstances and only these two circumstances. There is no mention of possible alternate scenarios under which international arbitration against the Host States may be commenced. The paragraph does not employ expansive phrases such as \"*inter alia*\" or \"in circumstances including, but not limited to, the following..\" The clear implication is that satisfaction of one of the two stipulated scenarios is a pre-requisite to commencing international arbitration.\n\n**b) Does the 18-month domestic courts requirement constitute a condition precedent to Argentina's consent to arbitrate or merely a procedural directive or admissibility requirement?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the German-Argentine BIT's 18-month domestic courts requirement constitutes a mere procedural directive and not a true jurisdictional pre-requisite. In support of this contention, it cites several investor-State cases wherein tribunals found they had jurisdiction notwithstanding the claimants' non-satisfaction of waiting periods prescribed by certain BITs. It quotes, for example, the *SGS v. Pakistan* tribunal, which held:\n\n\"Tribunals have generally tended to treat consultation periods as directory and procedural rather than as mandatory and jurisdictional in nature. Compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly, not seen as amounting to a condition precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction.. Finally, it does not appear consistent with the need for orderly and cost-effective procedure to halt this arbitration at this juncture and require the Claimant first to consult with the Respondent before re-submitting the Claimant's BIT claims to this Tribunal.\"332\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan*, above note 69 at para 184 (quoted in Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 101).\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant highlights five other cases in which waiting periods were waived by investor-State tribunals.333 It asserts that the German-Argentine BIT's 18-month domestic courts provision is \"tantamount to a waiting or cooling off period\",334 because \"it is virtually impossible that the dispute would be resolved in or outside Argentina within 18 months to the satisfaction of both parties.\"335\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 98-102.\n\nIbid at para 104.\n\nIbid.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant however overlooks the fact that, in *SGS v. Pakistan*, the respondent government had shown no interest in entering into negotiations with the claimant during the long period that had elapsed prior to the registration of the BIT claim. Moreover, the tribunal noted, the Government of Pakistan had no incentive to do so, since the Supreme Court of Pakistan had already issued a binding decision adverse to the claimant's position.336 The tribunal was therefore of the opinion that requiring the claimant to observe any further negotiation period would have been futile under the circumstances.\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan*, above note 69 at para 107.\n\n187.\n\nLikewise, in each of the five other cases cited by the Claimant, the tribunals allowed claimants to skip prescribed waiting periods not as a general principle but rather on the basis of the peculiar factual circumstances of each case.337 In each and every case, the tribunals stressed that the prescribed waiting periods had, in any event, passed in the interim.338 It must be noted also that not all investor-State tribunals have agreed that waiting periods may be treated as procedural, rather than jurisdictional, provisions. In *Enron v. Argentina*, the tribunal found that the 6-month waiting period had been satisfied on the facts. But it added, in *obiter dictum* :\n\n\"the conclusion reached is not because the six-month negotiation period could be a procedural and not a jurisdictional requirement as has been argued by the Claimants and affirmed by other tribunals. Such requirement is in the view of the Tribunal very much a jurisdictional one. A failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction.\"339\n\nSee e.g. *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (3 Sep 2001), paras 187-91 (waiving waiting period \"in the circumstances of this case\" because the respondent had failed to accept the claimant's invitation to enter into negotiations and had in fact not responded in any manner to the claimant's original notice of dispute prior to the filing of the request for arbitration); *Bayinder Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 Nov 2005), paras 97-102 (finding government had sufficient actual notice of the dispute and numerous opportunities to engage in negotiations, which it declined to do); *Link-Trading Joint Stock Company v. Moldova*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction (16 Feb 2001), pp. 5-6 (noting respondent's refusal to respond to claimant's complaints and fact that more than a year had passed since registration of arbitration without any settlement); *Ethyl*, above note 314 at paras 84-85 (evidence suggested no negotiations were possible and no purpose would be served by requiring claimant to wait, since 6-month waiting period had in any event lapsed in the meantime); *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (29 June 1999), 41 ILM 881, 885-86 (2002) (respondent had, in any event, withdrawn the objection as to the 3-month waiting period on the grounds that it could have been easily rectified).\n\nSee generally ibid.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, (14 Jan 2004), para 88. At least two other ICSID tribunals have recently taken a similar position. See *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 June 2010), paras 310-318; and *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction (15 December 2010), paras 140-157.\n\n188.\n\nThus, with respect to negotiation periods, the prevailing line of reasoning appears to rest upon two considerations: 1) the futility of the provision in the circumstances of the case, and 2) whether the period has in any event passed.340\n\nProfessor Schreuer, upon whom the Claimant also relies, concludes:  \n \"It would seem that the decisive question is whether or not there was a promising opportunity for a settlement. There is little point in declining jurisdiction and sending the parties back to the negotiating table if negotiations are obviously futile. Negotiations remain possible while the arbitration proceedings are pending. Even if the institution of arbitration was premature, the waiting period will often have expired by the time a decision on jurisdiction is rendered. Under these circumstances, compelling the claimant to start the proceedings anew would be uneconomical. A better way to deal with noncompliance with a waiting period is a suspension of proceedings to allow additional time for negotiations if these appear promising.\"  \n SCHREUER - 2009, above n. 92 at p. 239.\n\n189.\n\nIn the present case, it is certainly true that more than 18 months have passed since the institution of the proceedings. Moreover, it is not clear whether a further waiting period would lead to a voluntary settlement between the parties. However, these considerations are not in dispute. What is in dispute is not a mere waiting period but a requirement that the dispute be submitted to the domestic Argentine courts for potential judicial resolution for a period of at least 18 months. The above reasoning must therefore be applied not by rote but rather *mutatis mutandis*.\n\n190.\n\nAnalogizing the logic of the negotiation period analysis to the case of an 18-month domestic courts submission requirement (as the Claimant has urged the Tribunal to do), the relevant questions become: 1) whether the dispute has, at least in the interim, been litigated for 18 months before the Argentine domestic courts, and 2) whether it would be futile to require the Claimant to do so under the circumstances - as would be the case, for example, if Argentine law permitted no remedy for the Claimant's claims in the domestic courts.341\n\nAs should be evident from this analysis, the Tribunal agrees with Judge Brower's objection, in para 14 of his Dissenting Opinion, that the analogy between the 18-months proviso and \"cooling-off\" or \"good faith negotiation\" periods is not an apt one. The Tribunal nevertheless finds it necessary to discuss this analogy because the Claimant has specifically raised it in its pleadings.\n\n191.\n\nOn the facts, the first question must be answered in the negative. The second cannot, based upon the evidence submitted to the Tribunal, be answered in the affirmative. The Claimant has not demonstrated the futility of resorting to the Argentine courts in the circumstances of this case. While the Claimant submitted an expert opinion suggesting that it would have been \"impossible\" for the Argentine courts to deliver a final judgment on the Claimant's claims within 18 months,342 the Respondent rebutted this opinion by citing examples of cases which the Argentine Courts have indeed resolved in 18 months or less.343 It may be that the delimitation of an 18-month period, after which claimants would be free to proceed instead to international arbitration, would induce the domestic Argentine courts to ensure the prompt and fair adjudication of investment disputes. One can only speculate in the present instance, as the Argentine courts were never presented with DFS' claims. In any event, nothing in either the BIT or in any other source of applicable law guarantees the Claimant the right to have its claims finally resolved within 18 months.344 The point of Article 10(2) of the German-Argentine BIT is to afford the domestic courts an opportunity to attempt to resolve investment claims in a prompt manner, not to guarantee a specific time horizon for their final resolution. The Claimant has not asserted that it lacked a cause of action before the Argentine courts or that it was in some other way prevented from complying with the requirements of Article 10(2).345 As such, it has failed to meet the burden necessary to invoke a waiver of the 18-month domestic courts provision on the grounds of futility.\n\nExpert Opinion of Javier Errecondo dated 4 June 2008 (submitted with Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction); Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras 65-80.\n\nRespondent's evidentiary submissions A RA 20 (\"Judgments of the Argentine Supreme Court\") and A RA 22 (\"Final Judgments\"), both submitted with the Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nIf the ability to reach a final decision within 18 months were the relevant metric, then the present Tribunal would be forced to declare its own proceedings futile, along with the proceedings of the vast majority of investor-State arbitration tribunals. See below at n. 430 (noting the average length of proceedings in ICSID cases).\n\nThe recent **Hochtief** award makes much of the fact that Article 10(2) of the German-Argentine BIT allows either disputing party to \"request\" that the dispute be referred to the domestic courts. The suggestion seems to be that Argentina's failure to institute proceedings against the claimant in its domestic courts constituted a waiver of its right to subsequently invoke the BIT's 18-month proviso. See *Hochtief AG v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 October 2011) [hereinafter **Hochtief** - Majority Opinion], paras 35-37, 89. This argument overlooks the fact that Argentina most likely lacked a cause of action with which to seize its domestic courts. In the context of a treaty-based investor-State dispute, it is the claimant, and not the respondent, whose treaty rights have allegedly been violated. Thus, the only practicable way for Argentina to \"request\" a referral to the domestic courts is to exercise its right to insist that the claimant satisfy the BIT's 18-month proviso before instituting arbitral proceedings. If Argentina had wished to waive its right to object to the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction on these grounds, it could have done so in terms of Article 10(3)(b) of the BIT.\n\n192.\n\nOne may ask whether the Tribunal may nonetheless waive the 18-month domestic courts requirement on the grounds that it is merely procedural, not jurisdictional, and therefore within the discretionary power of the Tribunal to observe or discard. Such is the case, for example, with admissibility objections before domestic courts and tribunals. However, admissibility analyses patterned on domestic court practices have no relevance for BIT-based jurisdictional decisions in the context of investor-State disputes. In the domestic context, admissibility requirements are judicially constructed rules designed to preserve the efficiency and integrity of court proceedings. They do not expand the jurisdiction of domestic courts. Rather, they serve to streamline courts' dockets by striking out matters which, though within the jurisdiction of the courts, are for one reason or another not appropriate for adjudication at the particular time or in the particular manner in question.346\n\nSuch is the case with the doctrines of ripeness, *forum non conveniens*, etc.\n\n193.\n\nAll BIT-based dispute resolution provisions, on the other hand, are by their very nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign agreement of two States - not the mere administrative creation of arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state parties' consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts confer jurisdiction upon domestic courts. That this is so is particularly evident in the case of the German-Argentine BIT, which describes its dispute resolution process in mandatory and necessarily sequential language. In the words of the *Wintershall* tribunal:\n\n\"That an investor could choose at will to omit the second step [the 18-month domestic courts requirement] is simply not provided for nor even envisaged by the Argentina-Germany BIT - because (Argentina's) the Host State's \u2018consent' (standing offer) is premised on there being first submitted to the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Host State the entire dispute for resolution in the local courts.\"347\n\n*Wintershall*, above note 330 at p. 99, para 160(2) (parentheticals in original).\n\n194.\n\nSince the 18-month domestic courts provision constitutes a treaty-based pre-condition to the Host State's consent to arbitrate, it cannot be bypassed or otherwise waived by the Tribunal as a mere \"procedural\" or \"admissibility-related\" matter.348\n\nSee in this regard *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections (Decision of 1 April 2011), available at: http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/16398.pdf, at paras 115-184 (finding that the relevant treaty's requirement of good faith negotiations between the parties constituted a procedural condition for the seisin of the Court and further finding that the Court had no jurisdiction because this precondition had not been met).\n\n**c) Relevance of whether or not the 18-month domestic courts requirement is \"nonsensical\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal, commenting upon the *Maffezini* tribunal's decision to evade, by means of the MFN clause, the 18-month domestic courts requirement of the Spain-Argentina BIT, stated the following:\n\n\"The decision in *Maffezini* is perhaps understandable. The case concerned a curious requirement that during the first 18 months the dispute be tried in the local courts. The present Tribunal sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view. However, such exceptional circumstances should not be treated as a statement of general principle guiding future tribunals in other cases where exceptional circumstances are not present.\"349\n\n*Plama v. Republic of Bulgaria*, Decision on Jurisdiction (8 Feb 2005), ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 [hereinafter \" *Plama* \"], para 224.\n\n196.\n\nThis raises the question as to whether the Tribunal may waive the 18-month domestic courts requirement on the grounds that it is \"nonsensical\". Unfortunately, the *Plama* tribunal nowhere explained in what sense the requirement was \"curious\", \"nonsensical\", or \"exceptional\". Perhaps the tribunal referred merely to the fact that the requirement is found only in Latin American BITs. Or perhaps it meant to suggest, as does the Claimant here, that 18 months would not prove sufficient, in most cases, to lead to a satisfactory resolution of the dispute.\n\n197.\n\nWhatever the *Plama* tribunal's meaning may have been, Argentina insists that the requirement is sensible, as it was included \"for the purpose of giving domestic courts the opportunity to settle the dispute\".350 Such a purpose cannot be said to be nonsensical, particularly in light of the Government's assertions that the Argentine courts can and do frequently resolve disputes in less than 18 months.351 Even if this were not the case, one can easily imagine good reasons why a country might wish to include such a provision in some, but not all, of its BITs. In the case of Argentina, it may have wished, for example, to provide its courts with occasional opportunities to gain experience in administering treaty-based investor-State claims without running the risk of overwhelming its courts with too many claims under too many treaties at once.352\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, para 54.\n\nIbid at para 55.\n\nIt may be argued that such a policy would be akin to placing a tax on certain nationalities of foreign investors for the purposes of developing the Argentine judicial system. This may well be so. But this does not change the fact that the development of a Host State's judiciary cannot be assailed as an illegitimate or arbitrary - let alone nonsensical - policy goal. Instead, the decision to saddle only particular groups of foreign investors with the costs of that development would clearly be discriminatory and therefore compensable under the BIT to the extent that these costs exceed the costs of otherwise directly available investor-State arbitration under other BITs. The Tribunal will return to this issue below.\n\n198.\n\nMore importantly, however, even if Argentina had not asserted sensible reasons for including the provision, and even if the Tribunal were unable to posit such reasons of its own initiative, the requirement for waiving treaty-based jurisdictional pre-requisites in international law is not nonsensicality but futility. Sovereign States are free to agree to any treaty provisions they so choose - whether concerning substantive commitments or dispute resolution provisions or otherwise - provided these provisions are not futile and are not otherwise contrary to peremptory norms of international law. As discussed above, futility has not been established on the facts of the present case.353 Thus, the Tribunal's estimation of the apparent sensibility of the Treaty' s prescribed dispute resolution process is irrelevant to the inquiry.354\n\nNor can the subjugation of a sovereign State to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal be said to constitute a peremptory norm of international law.\n\nThe imprudence of engaging in debates as to the desirability of particular treaty provisions within the context of international arbitral deliberations was neatly demonstrated in the recent **Hochtief** matter. There, the majority found the procedure prescribed in Articles 10(2)-(3) of the German-Argentine BIT to be \"pointless\" and of \"no necessary benefit\", while the dissent was able to point out several sensible justifications for the 18-month proviso. Contrast **Hochtief** - Majority Opinion, above note 345, paras 51 & 87-88 with the Separate and Dissenting Opinion of J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., paras 4-10.\n\n**d) The timing aspect of standing - when may an MFN claim be raised before an international arbitral tribunal?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe mandatory and sequential nature of the German-Argentine BIT's dispute resolution provisions raises an important temporal question: when, chronologically speaking, does an aggrieved investor acquire standing to raise an MFN claim before an investor-State arbitral tribunal under Article 10? As will be seen later in this decision, the BIT clearly empowers investors to claim and receive compensation for MFN violations. The immediately foregoing analysis, however, has indicated that fulfilment of the 18-month domestic courts submission provision constitutes a condition precedent to the Host State\u2019s consent to submit a particular dispute to investor-State arbitration.\n\n200.\n\nTaken together, these two conclusions suggest that a claimant wishing to raise an MFN claim under the German-Argentine BIT - whether on procedural or substantive grounds - lacks standing to do so until it has fulfilled the domestic courts proviso. To put it more concretely, since the Claimant has not yet satisfied the necessary condition precedent to Argentina\u2019s consent to international arbitration, its MFN arguments are not yet properly before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is therefore presently without jurisdiction to rule on any MFN-based claims unless the MFN clauses themselves supply the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction.355\n\nThis in no way implies that the word \"\u2018shall\u2019 in Article 10 of the BIT somehow trumps the word \u2018shall\u2019 in Article 3 [one of the MFN clauses] of the same treaty.\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 13.) First, the Tribunal\u2019s underscoring of the word \"unless\" stresses that the MFN clause may well provide the Tribunal with jurisdiction to hear the case. The Award\u2019s separate analysis of both Article 10 (the dispute resolution clause) and Articles 3 and 4 (the MFN clauses) as independent potential bases for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction evinces no \"trump\" of one type of clause over the other. Second, the word \"shall\" in the context of the MFN clauses relates to Argentina\u2019s obligation to provide protected German investors and investments with treatment, in the territory of the Host State, which is no less favorable than the treatment provided to investors and investments from other countries. Argentina\u2019s obligation to observe this commitment toward German investors and investments (an obligatory \"shall\") remains in force irrespective of whether or not a particular German claimant fulfills the necessary conditions precedent to institute an international arbitration proceeding against Argentina under Article 10. Thus, both \"shalls\" retain their obligatory character within their respective spheres of operation.\n\n201.\n\nThat a prospective claimant wishing to raise an MFN claim must satisfy the conditions precedent to international dispute resolution under the basic treaty is supported by the reasoning of the ICJ in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil* case.356 In that case, the United Kingdom invoked an obligation in a 1934 treaty between Iran and Denmark to the effect that Iran would provide \"the most constant protection\" of the persons and property of Denmark\u2019s nationals \"in accordance with the principles and practice of ordinary international law.\"357 The UK attempted to enforce this protection on behalf of a UK company by invoking the MFN clauses contained in two treaties that the UK had concluded with the Government of Persia in 1857 and 1903, respectively.358 The difficulty was that Iran, in its 1932 Declaration accepting the Court\u2019s compulsory jurisdiction, had limited its acceptance to disputes arising out of treaties concluded *after* the coming into effect of the Declaration. Thus, the Iran-Denmark treaty (the \"comparator treaty\") fell within the scope of Iran's Declaration of consent to ICJ jurisdiction, while the two UK treaties (the \"basic treaties\") did not.359\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case (jurisdiction)*, Judgment of July 22nd, 1952: I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 93.\n\nIbid p. 108.\n\nIbid p. 108. The 1857 Treaty appears to have related to consular protection, while the 1903 Treaty was a \"Commercial Convention.\" Both parties accepted that the Government of Iran was legally bound by the treaties in question as the legal successor to Persia under international law.\n\nThe important point to note here is that - just as in the proceedings before the present Tribunal - the ICJ would have had jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the comparator treaty but did not have jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the basic treaties. It was for this reason that the basic treaty's MFN clause could not be invoked.\n\n202.\n\nIn explaining why it lacked jurisdiction to hear the UK's MFN-based claims, the Court said the following:\n\n\"But in order that the United Kingdom may enjoy the benefit of any treaty concluded by Iran with a third party by virtue of a most-favoured-nation clause contained in a treaty concluded by the United Kingdom with Iran, the United Kingdom must be in a position to invoke the latter treaty. The treaty containing the most-favoured-nation clause is the basic treaty upon which the UK must rely. It is this treaty which establishes the juridical link between the United Kingdom and a third-party treaty and confers upon that State the rights enjoyed by the third party. A third party treaty, independent of and isolated from the basic treaty, cannot produce any legal effect as between the United Kingdom and Iran: it is *res inter alios acta*.\"360\n\nIbid p. 109 (emphasis added).\n\n203.\n\nIn other words, in *Anglo-Iranian Oil*, Iran's acceptance of the ICJ's jurisdiction over disputes arising under the two \"basic treaties\" (the UK-Persia treaties) was a condition precedent to the UK's standing to raise its MFN claims before the Court. Because that condition precedent had not been fulfilled, the UK had no standing and the ICJ had no jurisdiction.361\n\nThe core problem in **Anglo-Iranian** was one of **ratione temporis**. That is, the ICJ did not have jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the two pre-1932 basic treaties because Iran's declaration was limited to disputes arising out of its post-1932 treaties. The **ratione temporis** problem in the present arbitration differs in that the present Respondent chose to tie its prospective consent to the Tribunal's jurisdiction not to a specific date (as was done in **Anglo-Iranian**) but rather to the satisfaction of a time-bound condition precedent to arbitration. This difference in form does not, however, give the present Tribunal license to disregard the temporal constraint laid down by the Contracting State Parties to the German-Argentine BIT. The principle illustrated by the *Anglo-Iranian Oil* case remains apposite. Namely, a tribunal must have jurisdiction under the basic treaty in order for a claimant to invoke the MFN clause of that treaty and thereby reach the more favorable provisions of a comparator treaty.\n\n204.\n\nIn the present matter, of course, Argentina's consent to international arbitration is contained within the same instrument as the MFN guarantees giving rise to some of the Claimant's jurisdictional arguments. But the physical location (external instrument versus within the same treaty) of a State's consent to a particular type of dispute resolution does not eviscerate the requirement, stressed by the ICJ, that the State must have consented to the particular type of dispute settlement in question before the claimant may raise any MFN claims before the designated forum. According to this logic, the Claimant may not yet have standing to raise any MFN arguments at all before the Tribunal. This raises a significant impediment to the Claimant's attempts to bypass the 18-month proviso. However, this impediment might be surmounted by the content of the MFN clauses in question, in particular if those clauses evince an intention, on the part of the Contracting State Parties, to allow the Treaty's conditions precedent to accessing international arbitration to be altered by operation of its MFN provisions. The Tribunal will therefore next consider the parties' arguments as to the scope and meaning of the MFN clauses in the Germany-Argentina BIT.\n\n***3. Analysis of the MFN Clauses in the German-Argentine BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Treaty's MFN texts and their interdependence**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe German-Argentine BIT contains two MFN clauses. The first and most general MFN clause appears in Article 3, which addresses both MFN treatment and national treatment. According to the disputing parties' agreed English translation of the German and Spanish original texts, Article 3 reads as follows:\n\n\" **Article 3**\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall accord investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, or investments in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party are participating, treatment less favorable than the treatment accorded investments of its own nationals or companies or investments of nationals or companies of any third country.\n\n(2) With respect to their activities in connection with investments in its territory, nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party shall not be accorded treatment less favorable by a Contracting Party than its own nationals and companies or nationals and companies of third countries.\n\n(3) Such treatment shall not refer to privileges granted by a Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third countries by virtue of their membership in a customs or trade union, a common market, or a free trade area.\n\n(4) The treatment granted in this Article shall not refer to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third countries under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other agreements regarding tax matters.\"\n\n206.\n\nThe second MFN clause appears in Article 4 of the Treaty. Paragraphs (1)-(3) of that article deal with particular substantive protections, while paragraph (4) sets out a special MFN provision relating exclusively to the subjects covered in Article 4. The full English text is set out in a footnote,362 but for present purposes the operative portions proceed roughly as follows:\n\n\" **Article 4**\n\n(1). [Full legal protection and security]\n\n(2). [Expropriation, nationalization, and equivalent measures]\n\n(3). [Losses owing to war or internal strife]\n\nNationals or companies of a Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favored-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in respect of the matters provided for in this Article.\"\n\nThe English translation of the article reads:  \n (1) Investments by nationals or companies of a Contracting Party shall enjoy full legal protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.  \n (2) Investments by nationals or companies of a Contracting Party may not be expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investment before the date on which the actual or threatened expropriation, nationalization, or comparable measure has become publicly known. The compensation shall be paid immediately and shall carry interest at a normal commercial rate until the time of payment; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalization, or comparable measure and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.  \n (3) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, or revolt, shall not be accorded treatment less favorable by such other Contracting Party than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own nationals and companies as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation, or other consideration. Such payments shall be freely transferable.  \n (4) Nationals or companies of a Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favored-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in respect of the matters provided for in this Article.\n\n207.\n\nFinally, paragraph 2 of the BIT's Protocol relates to MFN treatment:\n\n\" **Protocol**\n\n(1) [\u2026]\n\n(2) Ad Article 3\n\na) \"Activity\" within the meaning of Article 3(2) shall in particular, but not exclusively, include the management, use, enjoyment, and disposal of an investment. The following shall, in particular, but not exclusively, be deemed treatment \"less favorable\" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials; of energy or fuel, or of means of production or operation of any kind and unequal treatment in the case of impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country. Measures which have to be taken for reasons of public safety and public order, public health, or morality shall not be deemed treatment \"less favorable\" within the meaning of Article 3.\n\nb) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to natural persons and companies residing in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, exemptions, and tax reductions which according to its tax law are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.\n\n[...]\"\n\n208.\n\nFrom these recitations, three observations concerning the interrelation of these provisions merit notice. First, the Protocol sheds light on the proper interpretation of Article 3 of the BIT. It does so by illustrating, albeit in a non-exclusive fashion, the potential meanings of the terms \"activity\" and \"less favorable\". This makes it necessary to interpret Article 3 in tandem with the relevant portions of the Protocol.\n\n209.\n\nSecondly, Article 3, Article 4(4), and the Protocol all make use of the word \"treatment\", although none of them defines it explicitly. It thus falls to the Tribunal to establish, in good faith, the ordinary meaning of this term in its context and in the light of the Treaty's object and purpose.\n\n210.\n\nThirdly, the MFN clause in Article 4(4) applies only to the particular treatment standards mentioned in Article 4. The MFN clause in Article 3, however, contains no such limitation. On its face, the application of Article 3 is limited only by the proper meaning to be ascribed to such words as \"treatment\", \"activities\" and \"less favorable\". In this sense, one may conceive of Article 3 as a general MFN clause, while Article 4(4) is a more limited one. To the extent that Article 3 - interpreted in the light of its own wording - may also be broad enough to cover the substantive protections listed in Article 4, it may therefore prove necessary to clarify the relationship between the two articles. This will depend upon the meaning that emerges from an interpretive analysis of the two articles, which follows below.\n\n**b) Potential reach of the MFN clauses in light of the** ***ejusdem generis*** **rule**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nBefore scrutinizing the specific texts of the MFN clauses in accordance with the Vienna Convention, it is useful to consider the implications of the **ejusdem generis** rule as a preliminary matter, since both of the disputing parties have raised it in their submissions. As summarized by the Commission of Arbitration in the *Ambatielos* case, the **ejusdem generis** rule specifies that an MFN clause \"can only attract matters belonging to the same category of subject as that to which the clause itself relates\".363 The International Law Commission has characterized the *ejusdem generis* rule as one that is \"generally recognized and affirmed by the jurisprudence of international tribunals and national courts and by diplomatic practice\".364 Indeed, the ILC codified the rule as follows in Article 9(1) of its 1978 Draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment:\n\n\"Under a most-favoured-nation clause the beneficiary State acquires, for itself or for the benefit of persons or things in a determined relationship with it, only those rights which fall within the limits of the subject-matter of the clause.\"365\n\n*Ambatielos Claim (Greece, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island)*, decision of the Commission of Arbitration (6 March 1956), United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. XII p. 83 [hereinafter \" *Ambatielos II* \" to distinguish it from the ICJ matter (*Ambatielos I*), in which the Court upheld the UK's agreement to arbitrate with Greece], at p. 107.\n\nDraft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses, with Commentaries, text adopted by the International Law Commission at its thirtieth session, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission*, 1978, vol. II, Part Two [hereinafter \"ILC Commentary on Draft MFN Articles\"], at p. 27.\n\nIbid.\n\n212.\n\nThus defined, the *ejusdem generis* rule advocates a common sense approach to the interpretation of MFN clauses. It is probably for this reason that the rule appears to have gained acceptance. The ILC's Commentary on the Draft Articles on MFN Clauses sheds further light on the operation of the rule:\n\n\"No writer would deny the validity of the *ejusdem generis* rule which, for the purposes of the most-favoured-nation clause, derives from its very nature. It is generally admitted that a clause conferring most-favoured-nation rights in respect of a certain matter, or class of matter, can attract the rights conferred by other treaties (or unilateral acts) only in regard to the same matter or class of matter.\n\nThe effect of the most-favoured-nation process is, by means of the provisions of one treaty, to attract those of another. Unless this process is strictly confined to cases where there is a substantial identity between the subject-matter of the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number of cases may be to impose upon the granting State obligations it never contemplated. Thus the rule follows clearly from the general principles of treaty interpretation. States cannot be regarded as being bound beyond the obligations they have undertaken.\"366\n\nIbid at p. 30, paras 10-11 (internal citations omitted).\n\n213.\n\nIn the present matter, both the Basic Treaty and the invoked Comparator BIT367 provide not only substantive protections for investments but also investor-State dispute resolution mechanisms for disputes arising out of qualifying investments. There is, in this sense, not only an identity between the subject matter of the two invoked dispute resolution clauses but also between the subject matter of the whole of both treaties.368 In this respect the two invoked treaties fall within the mainstream of modern international investment agreements, almost all of which include some sort of provision concerning the administration of justice in relation to the private rights of investors arising under the agreements.\n\nThe dispute resolution provisions of the invoked Comparator BIT are set forth in note 427 below.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *ejusdem generis* rule does not require the overall subject matter of the basic and comparator treaties to be identical, but only the subject matter of the invoked clauses of the basic and the comparator treaties. As the ILC Commentary notes:  \n \"It is also not proper to say that the *treaty* or *agreement* including the clause must be of the same category (*ejusdem generis*) as that of the benefits that are claimed under the clause. To hold otherwise would seriously diminish the value of a most-favoured-nation clause.\"  \n ILC Commentary on Draft MFN Articles above note 364 at p. 30, para 12 (emphasis in original).\n\n214.\n\nOne may observe in the two treaties, to use the ILC's words, \"a substantial identity between the subject-matter of the two sets of clauses concerned\".369 Moreover, there is a clear and logical connection between the subject matter of the clauses and the subject matter of the invoked treaties.370\n\nIbid at p. 30, para 11. An interpreter can require no more than a substantial identity between the subject matters of the two clauses. For if the complete identity between the clauses were required, there would be no need to invoke the MFN clause in the first place.\n\nAs to the connection between the subject matter of the overall treaties and the subject matter of the specific clauses in relation to which MFN treatment is invoked, the Arbitral Commission in the *Ambatielos II* matter observed more than 50 years ago:  \n \"It is true that \u2018the administration of justice', when viewed in isolation, is a subject-matter other than \u2018commerce and navigation', but this is not necessarily so when it is viewed in connection with the protection of the rights of traders. Protection of the rights of traders naturally finds a place among the matters dealt with by Treaties of commerce and navigation.  \n Therefore it cannot be said that the administration of justice, in so far as it is concerned with the protection of these rights, must necessarily be excluded from the field of application of the most-favoured-nation clause, when the latter includes \u2018all matters relating to commerce and navigation'. The question can only be determined in accordance with the intention of the Contracting Parties as deduced from a reasonable interpretation of the Treaty.\"  \n The same logic prevails here, although there are some important differences between the *Ambatielos* matter (which involved the domestic administration of justice) and the present one (which involves international dispute settlement).\n\n215.\n\nAs such, the application of the *ejusdem generis* rule cannot on its own categorically exclude international dispute resolution from the potential ambit of the German-Argentine BIT's MFN clauses. Nor, however, can it demonstrate that the ambit of the Treaty's MFN clauses necessarily includes international dispute resolution. The *ejusdem generis* rule merely identifies the outer limit of the clauses' field of application; it cannot tell us which particular subject matters, within that outer limit, the clauses were actually intended to cover. As stressed by the *Ambatielos* Commission, the latter question \"can only be determined in accordance with the intention of the Contracting Parties as deduced from a reasonable interpretation of the Treaty\".371 This is so, in the ILC's words, because \"States cannot be regarded as being bound beyond the obligations they have undertaken.\"372\n\n*Ambatielos II*, above note 363 at p. 107.\n\nILC Commentary on Draft MFN Articles, above note 364 at p. 30, para 11.\n\n216.\n\nAs applied to the German-Argentine BIT, then, the outer limits set by the *ejusdem generis* rule are broad enough to encompass international dispute resolution within the meaning of the Treaty's MFN clauses. Argentina's assertions to the contrary must therefore be rejected. This conclusion renders the Claimant's proposed interpretation plausible. It does not, however, in any way diminish the present Tribunal's duty to determine, upon a preponderance of all the arguments, whether Germany and Argentina intended to include international dispute resolution within the reach of the Treaty' s MFN clauses. The Tribunal therefore turns to examine the meaning of those MFN clauses in light of their wording and context.\n\n**c) Ordinary meaning of the term \"treatment\" in the BIT's two MFN clauses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Treaty nowhere defines what constitutes \"treatment\", despite employing the word 13 times across five different provisions of the Treaty and Protocol.373 What may be observed, however, is that in none of these instances does the text indicate that the word carries a special or technical meaning. Nor has either of the disputing parties attempted to attach a special meaning to the term, in the sense of Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal must therefore endeavour to interpret the word in a manner which makes sense of all 13 usages in an ordinary fashion.\n\n\"Treatment\" is used in arts 1(1), 2(1)-(4), 4(3)-(4), 7(1), and Protocol para (2)(a).\n\n218.\n\nIn common usage, \"treatment\" evokes one party's manner of dealing with or behaving towards another party. In the international law setting, the term typically carries with it the sense of how a State or other legal authority regulates, protects, or otherwise interacts with specified actors, whether public or private. Within the investment law context, one arbitral tribunal has defined treatment to include \"the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty.\"374 Another has stated that \"\u2018[t]reatment\u2019 in its ordinary meaning refers to behavior in respect of an entity or a person.\"375 Each of these formulations is extremely broad, and none suggests anything inherent in the word \"treatment\" which would automatically include or exclude certain categories of acts or omissions in relation to a defined investor. What is nevertheless beyond dispute is that \"treatment\" deals with the actual behavior of the Host States towards a foreign private investment as measured against the international obligations binding upon the State on the basis of treaty law and general international law.\n\n*InterAguas*, above note 113 at para 55.\n\n*Siemens*, above note 71at para 85.\n\n219.\n\nNotwithstanding this generality, public international lawyers have in recent years engaged in a lively debate over whether the term should be understood to comprise only \"substantive\" treaty protections, or whether it may also include \"procedural\" ones.376 Commentators also split over whether international dispute resolution provisions in treaties should be viewed as substantive protections in and of themselves, or whether they are merely procedural mechanisms for enforcing the treaty\u2019s other (presumably substantive) obligations.377 The present Tribunal is not convinced that this debate is the most appropriate one.378 What matters is not how the general term treatment potentially could or \"should\" be interpreted but rather what meaning the Contracting State Parties to the specific Treaty in question have attached to the term.\n\nThere appears to be broad consensus among the community of scholars, as well as between the disputing parties in this case, that the term \"treatment\" in treaties relating to international trade, investment, and commerce generally encompasses most, if not all, of the so-called substantive protections of such treaties. In the case of BITs, this would typically comprise guarantees relating to expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, etc - provided, of course, that the MFN clause in question does not itself indicate limits to its subject matter scope. The question at hand, however, is whether the term treatment as used in MFN clauses, or more precisely the German-Argentine BIT\u2019s MFN clauses, also extends to its international dispute resolution provisions.\n\nSee, in this regard, the comments of the *Renta4* tribunal, above note 309 at paras 88-101, and especially its conclusion in para 101, stating: \"Rights and obligations may be classified as substantive or jurisdictional or procedural. Such classifications are not watertight and in any event primarily of pedagogical use.\"\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Dissenting Opinion\u2019s position that \"it is difficult to imagine a more fundamental aspect of an investor\u2019s \u2018treatment\u2019 by a host Government than that investor\u2019s ability to exercise and defend its legal rights by prompt access to dispute settlement mechanisms, and fair and efficient administration of justice.\" Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 20. This uncontroversial observation does not however imply an automatic entitlement to initiate international dispute settlement against a State.\n\n220.\n\nIn order to shed light on whether the Contracting State Parties intended for the term \"treatment\" to encompass the BIT's international dispute settlement provisions, one must apply the classical rule of interpretation known as the principle of contemporaneity. This principle, particularly pertinent in the case of bilateral treaties, requires that the meaning and scope of the term \"treatment\" be ascertained as of the time when Germany and Argentina negotiated the BIT. This BIT was adopted in 1991. Unfortunately neither disputing party has submitted any direct evidence - for example from the Treaty's drafting history - revealing the particular understanding of \"treatment\" maintained by Germany and Argentina as of that date. The Tribunal must therefore look for clues to the meaning generally ascribed to the term by the broader international community of States at the time.\n\n221.\n\n1991 was a time when the distinction between \"treaty claims\" and \"contract claims\", as inaugurated by the *AAPL v Sri Lanka* award379 (facilitating the direct access of private investors to ICSID tribunals) remained obscure. As a consequence, dispute resolution clauses were still predominantly perceived in the context of international contracts, whether \"state contracts\" or otherwise, between a private foreign investor and a sovereign state. At that time, inspired by international commercial arbitration, scholars as well as arbitral awards insisted on the autonomy or severability of the arbitral clause, aimed at protecting in any situation the right of the investor to obtain reparation in case of arbitrary revocation or nullity of the contract by the state party380. Treaty-based questions concerning the relation of MFN clauses to international investor-State dispute resolution mechanisms had not yet arisen and remained entirely unexplored.\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, above note 114.\n\nFouchard, Gaillard, Goldmann, On International Commercial Arbitration, Kluwer Law Int'l (1999), 197-217; S. Schwebel, International Arbitration: Three Salient Problems, 2 (1987); P. Sanders, \"L'autonomie de la clause compromissoire,\" in *Hommage \u00e0 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Eisemann* 32 (1978); C.M. Svernl\u00f6v, The Current Status of the Doctrine of Separability, *Journal of International Arbitration,* 1991, Vol. 8, N\u00b0 4, 37-50.\n\n222.\n\nAlso at that time, as reflected one year later by the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,381 and in particular its Part III devoted to \"treatment\", the prevailing view among the Development Committee of the World Bank (an essentially universal international organization and the host body of ICSID) was that treatment was meant to cover discrete principles of conduct applicable to the State hosting the foreign investment, with a view to safeguarding the investment from any discriminatory or unfair and inequitable practices within the Host State's territory. That is, the treatment of investments was perceived as dealing with the legal regime of the investment to be respected by the Host States in conformity with its international obligations, whatever the national organs (whether legislative, executive, or judicial) concerned with the actual application of this regime.\n\nWorld Bank, Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment (1992) [hereinafter \"World Bank Guidelines\"], available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/WorldBank.pdf.\n\n223.\n\nPart III of the World Bank Guidelines illustrates this basic approach. In its discussion of \"treatment\", it covers in particular: fair and equitable treatment;382 treatment as favorable as that accorded to national investors in similar circumstances;383 full protection and security;384 treatment that does not discriminate among foreign investors on the grounds of nationality;385 the prompt issuance of necessary licenses and permits;386 authorizations for the employment of key foreign personnel;387 the free transfer of revenues earned by or related to the investment;388 the reinvestment of proceeds of the investment within the territory of the Host States;389 and finally the prevention and control of corrupt business practices and the promotion of accountability and transparency in dealings with foreign investors.390 While some of these concepts encompass well-known customary international law obligations binding upon States in respect of foreign investors' access to fair and efficient procedures for the domestic administration of justice,391 nothing within the Guidelines' discussion of \"treatment\" even touches upon the international (as distinguished from domestic) settlement of disputes. In fact, the Guidelines reference the international settlement of investor-State disputes only once, and in an entirely separate section,392 thus suggesting that \"treatment\" and international dispute settlement were viewed at the time as separate issues.393\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, above note 381, Part III.2.\n\nIbid at Part III.3(a).\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid at Part III.3.(b).\n\nIbid at Part III.5(a).\n\nIbid at Part III.5(b).\n\nIncluding salaries earned by foreign personnel, debt payments related to the investment, liquidation proceeds of the investment, and any amounts paid to the investment by reason of the Host State's expropriation of or other interference with the rights of the investment. Ibid at Part III.6.1(a)-(e).\n\nIbid at Part III.7.\n\nIbid at Part III.8.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion points out that the concept of fair and equitable treatment \"includes proper and timely access to dispute settlement, as well as observance of judicial and administrative due process. Relatedly, there is no doubt that under customary international law as well as modern investor-State jurisprudence denial of justice is closely linked to, if not a part of, the fair and equitable treatment requirement.\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 20.) The Tribunal agrees. Yet this does not alter the fact that these concepts, along with all of the case law to which the Dissenting Opinion points in its footnotes 59-60, concern States' obligations in carrying out the domestic administration of justice. There is no basis for asserting that the inability of a claimant to proceed directly to international arbitration against a State constitutes a denial of justice, or that the 18-months proviso somehow prevents claimants from obtaining proper and timely access to dispute settlement or otherwise violates Argentina's duty to observe judicial and administrative due process.\n\nIn a most classical way, Section V of the Guidelines provides for the possible resolution of investment disputes either by recourse to national courts or to \"the agreed mechanisms including conciliation and binding independent arbitration\", the latter including \"any ad hoc or institutional arbitration agreed upon in writing by the State and the investor or between the State and the investor's home State where the majority of the arbitrators are not solely appointed by one party to the dispute\".\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion suggests that, because the overall document title is \"World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,\" this somehow implies that each and every topic discussed within the Guidelines constitutes a type of \"treatment\". This suggestion is puzzling. A document's title cannot function as more than a summary of its general topic, let alone an exhaustive statement of its entire contents. Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, for example, contains many passages which do not directly refer to the fictional person in question.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the World Bank Guidelines of 1992 were and are a \"soft law\" instrument by nature and that they do not purport to shed any direct light on the meaning of the word \"treatment\" as used in the German-Argentine BIT's MFN clauses. The Guidelines nevertheless provide an indication of the prevailing view among the community of states during the period contemporaneous to the adoption of the German-Argentine BIT. Neither disputing party has adduced any evidence to suggest that either Argentina or Germany maintained a distinctive definition of treatment in the early 1990s that departed from the basic concept prevailing among the international community of states at that time, as reflected in the Guidelines. This leads the Tribunal to observe that there is, at the least, some evidence that the term \"treatment\" was likely meant by the two State Parties, at the time of the conclusion of the BIT, to refer to the Host State's direct treatment of the investment and not to the conduct of any international arbitration arising out of that treatment. While this evidence runs counter to the Claimant's position, it is not of a sufficient weight to be outcome determinative. The Tribunal would indeed hesitate to make a definitive pronouncement as to the intended scope of the Treaty's MFN clauses on the basis of an isolated examination of the quite general word \"treatment\". The Treaty however provides several other textual clues all pointing in the same direction. When considered in the aggregate, these textual clues do lead to a definitive conclusion. The Tribunal now continues to examine each in turn.\n\n**d) Limiting effect of the words \"in its territory\" on the scope of the MFN clauses**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nOne salient textual feature of the German-Argentine BIT's three MFN provisions is that all three guarantee MFN treatment by the Host States in its territory.394 In other words, the MFN guarantees are territorially limited. Notably, the concept of territorial application is explicit throughout the German-Argentine BIT. Article 1(1) defines qualifying investments territorially; Article 2 territorially limits the States' obligations in respect of fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary or discriminatory measures; Article 4 does likewise for the States' obligations concerning full legal protection and security, expropriation, and losses in cases of war or other conflict. Indeed, nothing in the Treaty obligates the State Parties to act in any particular manner outside of their own territories.\n\nThe English translation of Article 4(4), as prepared by the disputing parties, faithfully conveys the territorial limitation of the original languages, translating the German (\"genieBen... im Hoheitsgebiet der anderen Vertragspartei Meistbeg\u00fcnstigung\") and Spanish (\"gozor\u00e1n en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante del trato de la naci\u00f3n m\u00e1s favorecida\") as \"shall enjoy most-favored-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party\". In Articles 3(1) and 3(2), however, the disputing parties' English translation misconstrues the qualifier \"in its territory\" by attaching it to the word \"investments\" rather than to the word \"treatment\". The mistake is perhaps understandable, as the translation was prepared primarily from the German original, which - because of the highly complex sentence structure of the German language - arguably renders the intended reference point of the phrase \"in its territory\" uncertain. By contrast, Articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the Spanish text both clearly attach the phrase \"in its territory\" to the word \"treatment\". Since the final sentence of the BIT states that both the Spanish and German versions of the text are equally \"binding\" or \"authentic\", this minor inconsistency is easily resolved by Article 33(3) of that Vienna Convention, according to which the terms of a treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text. In case of difference, Article 33(4) directs that the meaning which \"best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\" Applying these rules to the present discrepancy: since the Spanish text is clear as to the proper placement of the qualifier \"in its territory\" while the German text leaves the question open, the interpretation given by the Spanish text must be preferred.\n\n226.\n\nThe territorial limitation upon the German-Argentine BIT's MFN formulations appears quite standard within the investment treaty universe. Indeed, with only one exception, every MFN clause addressed in each of the publicly available investor-State awards that the Tribunal has been able to examine has contained a territorial reference.395 The ubiquity of the phrase is striking. This is particularly so when one considers how the words \"in its territory\" may operate to limit an MFN clause's use of the general word \"treatment\". Where an MFN clause applies only to treatment in the territory of the Host State, the logical corollary is that treatment outside the territory of the Host State does not fall within the scope of the clause.396\n\nThe sole exception is the MFN clause in the Belgium/Luxembourg-Soviet BIT discussed in *Vladimir Berschader and Moise Bershcader v. The Russian Federation*, Case No. 080/2004, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award (21 April 2006) [hereinafter \" *Berschader* \"] (Todd Weiler dissenting). That BIT states rather generically that \"the most favoured nation clause shall be applied to investors of the other Contracting Party in all matters covered by the present Treaty\", without bothering to define the content of \"the most-favoured nation clause\" so referenced. However, given that the words \"in its territory\" have been consistently included in nearly all other BITs' MFN clauses, it seems at least likely that the BelgoLux-Soviet BIT's reference to \"the MFN clause\" also implicitly incorporates this phrase.\n\nDespite its professed affinity for the Roman law maxim *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, the Dissenting Opinion overlooks this problem with the Claimant's proposed interpretation of the MFN clauses.\n\n227.\n\nThis observation is of critical importance. It is noteworthy that the resolution of an investor-State dispute within the domestic courts of a Host State would constitute an activity that takes place within its territory. Thus, if a Host State were to accord to the investors of some third State more favorable rights in relation to domestic dispute resolution than the rights accorded to the investors of the other contracting State party to the BIT, this could give rise to a violation of the MFN clause.397 This position indeed accords with general international law principles on the international responsibility of States.398 As is well known, a state is internationally responsible for the conduct of its internal organs, including judicial ones, as reflected in Article 4 of the ILC's Draft Articles on State Responsibility.399\n\nThe **Ambatielos** dispute provides a classic example of a case falling squarely within the bounds of the traditional territorial limitation on the operation of MFN clauses. In **Ambatielos**, Greece invoked an MFN clause in order to obtain for its national a type of treatment in the domestic courts of the Host State (the UK) which the UK had accorded by treaty to the nationals of certain third states and which Greece alleged to be more favorable than the treatment accorded to Greek nationals within the UK's domestic courts.\n\nUnder a State responsibility analysis, there is no doubt that a number of principles of treatment -including in particular the non-discrimination and fair and equitable treatment principles - bind Host States not only during the period of the carrying out of the investment but also after it, if and when the occasion for dispute resolution arises. This much is certain at least in so far as the adjudicative bodies engaged in this dispute resolution are acting at the national level. In other words, a State must be held responsible for any breach of the rules of treatment binding upon it which has been committed by any of its organs, including its national courts when acting at the \"procedural\" stage. If, knowing of the investor's claim, a national court ignores one of the rules of treatment binding upon the Host State, it will create a situation giving rise to the international responsibility of that State toward the other State party to the BIT. Within the framework of a treaty claim under a BIT, this implies that the Host State also becomes directly internationally responsible toward the foreign investor having the nationality of the other State.\n\nArticle 4 states: \"the conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions. (emphasis added).\n\n228.\n\nThe same cannot be said, however, of international arbitration, which almost without exception takes place outside the territory of the Host State and which per definition proceeds independently of any state control. This leads to an important result. Assuming, contrary to the Tribunal's above findings, that an unbounded reference to the word \"treatment\" was generally understood by the international community of states in 1991 as encompassing not only \"substantive\" protections but also the international dispute resolution provisions of investment treaties, the German-Argentine BIT's specific MFN clauses nevertheless do not reach international arbitration here. The Host State's obligation extends no further than providing the covered investor with \"treatment\" in respect of domestic dispute resolution (aka dispute resolution \"in its territory\") that is no less favorable than the domestic dispute resolution treatment provided to third-State investors.400\n\nThe present Claimant has not alleged that it would receive less favorable treatment than other foreign investors within the Argentine courts.\n\n229.\n\nNor can it be said that a Host State's consent to grant foreign investors access to particular forms of international dispute resolution under particular conditions necessarily takes place within the Host State's territory, such that the Host State's consent to such arbitration would fall within the scope of the MFN obligation. States are at liberty to give their consent to international treaty commitments anywhere in the world; they need not do so within their own territories.401\n\nIndeed, many international treaties are concluded in locations lying outside of the territory of both of the contracting state parties. They are not, for this reason, any less binding, nor is their territorial application altered by the place of their conclusion.\n\n230.\n\nIn short, it seems that the very concept of extra-territorial dispute resolution and a Host State's consent thereto are both ill-fitted to the clear and ordinary meaning of the words \"treatment in its territory\" as found in many BIT's MFN clauses, including those in the present matter. It is difficult to see how an MFN clause containing this phrase could be applied to international arbitration proceedings without discounting the explicit territorial limitation upon the scope of the clause. This pragmatic incongruity prevents the Tribunal from presuming - in the absence of any supporting evidence - that the Contracting Parties to the present Treaty implicitly intended to include international dispute resolution within the purview of the MFN clauses. If such were their intent, it would seem strange that they should impose a territorial limitation so at variance with that aim.\n\n231.\n\nMore importantly, to base a conclusion solely upon the arguably open-textured nature of the word \"treatment\" without giving due account to the limiting effect of the words \"in its territory\" would be to run afoul of the Vienna Convention's requirement that a treaty be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context \". To do so would also risk violating the principle of effectiveness in relation to the limiting phrase \"in its territory\", as those words would essentially be disregarded.402 With respect, the Dissenting Opinion commits a fundamental error in finding that Article 10(2) of the BIT (the domestic courts proviso) itself constitutes treatment \"in the territory\" of Argentina. Article 10(2) is a provision of an international treaty - nothing more or less. It no more constitutes treatment in the territory of Argentina than does the BIT's preamble, its definition of investment (Article 1), or for that matter its provisions on ratification and entry into force (Article 12).403 The present Tribunal therefore holds that the Treaty's clearly expressed territorial limitation upon the scope of its MFN clauses establishes that the Contracting State Parties to the German-Argentine BIT did not intend for the Treaty's extra-territorial dispute resolution provisions to fall within the scope of those clauses.\n\nThe ***Maffezini*** tribunal appears to have erred in this respect when it cited Spain's practice of pursuing direct access to international arbitration for Spanish investors abroad as evidence of its intent to allow direct access to international arbitration for foreign investors in Spain (in circumvention of the basic BIT's clear 18-month domestic remedies requirement). Whatever may have been Spain's practices in soliciting protections for its own investors abroad, those were activities which occurred outside the territory of Spain, and thus could not possibly run afoul of either the MFN standard or the national treatment standard. In the BIT that was under consideration in ***Maffezini***, both of those standards contained the usual limiting territorial phrase. See ***Maffezini***, above note 114 at paras 61 and 64.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal cannot accept the ***Hochtief*** majority's recent characterization of Argentina's decision to invoke the Treaty's 18-months proviso as an act taking place within the territory of Argentina. (See ***Hochtief*** - Majority Opinion, above note 345, paras 107, 111.) If sovereign states are free to conclude international treaty provisions amongst themselves, then surely they are entitled to rely upon those treaty provisions without this reliance itself constituting a treaty-violating or treaty-altering type of \"treatment\" of third-party beneficiaries. The ***Hochtief*** tribunal posited an alternative ground for finding that the German-Argentine BIT's territorial limitation was satisfied - namely, because the consequences or effects of the domestic courts proviso would be felt by the claimant within Argentina. This argument, though more subtle, is equally misplaced. One can conceive of myriad international agreements whose provisions may impact upon investors operating within the territorial boundaries of Argentina. Examples include treaties addressing climate change, intellectual property rights, financial regulation, competition policy, human rights, peace and security, and countless other topics. Argentina's negotiation of and adherence to such treaties would not automatically constitute direct \"treatment\" of foreign investors by Argentina within its territory merely because they generate some effects which are felt within Argentina.\n\n**e) Significance of distinction between treatment of investments and treatment of investors \"with respect to their activities in connection with investments\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nTurning to the next textual query, it has already been noted that the Treaty contains more than one MFN provision. Article 3(1) guarantees MFN treatment to qualifying investments, while Articles 3(2) and 4(4) guarantee MFN treatment to qualifying investors \"with respect to their activities in connection with investments\". This raises the question as to whether the Contracting State Parties intended for the word treatment to mean something different when used in connection with \"investments\" as opposed to \"investors.\" The Tribunal finds no support in the text for such a difference. The Treaty defines both \"investment\"404 and \"activities in connection with an investment\" in broad terms.405 The parallel breadth of these definitions suggests that the Treaty\u2019s grant of MFN treatment to both investors and investments was intended to be complementary and not differential. The MFN guarantees offered to the two categories might even be co-extensive, for it is difficult to imagine a type of MFN treatment enjoyed by an investment that could not correspondingly be claimed by a qualifying investor in connection with that investment.406\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Treaty provides:  \n \"The term \u2018investment\u2019 shall include any kind of investment in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made in accordance with this Treaty, in particular, but not limited to:  \n (a) moveable and immoveable property and any other property rights such as mortgages and liens;  \n (b) shares or stock in a company or any other form of participation in a company;  \n (c) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance hailing an economic value;  \n (d) intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility patent models, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, trade or business secrets, technical processes, know-how, or goodwill;  \n (e) business concessions under public law, including concessions to search for or exploit natural resources\".\n\nParagraph 2 of the Protocol, reproduced in para 208 above, is careful to emphasize that its broad definition of \"activity\" is illustrative and not exclusive.\n\nThe *Renta4* tribunal articulated it well:  \n \"Whether MFN treatment is stated in the relevant BIT to relate to investors rather than investments is in principle of no moment. Investors will not claim access to international arbitration by way of MFN treatment in the abstract. They will assert a breach and harm in connection with a qualifying investment under the relevant BIT.\"  \n*Renta4*, above note 309 at para 101.\n\n233.\n\nMoreover, the explanation for the Treaty\u2019s distinction between investments and investors in Article 3 becomes evident when one recalls the second major guarantee provided by Article 3: that of national treatment. Investors are granted MFN and national treatment only in respect of their \"activities in connection with investments\" so that they may not lay claim to the myriad of non-investment-related personal rights and privileges that may be afforded by the Host State to its own citizens.407 No such limitation was necessary in Article 4(4), since that MFN clause applies only in respect of the particular investment protections enumerated in sub-paragraphs 4(1)-(3). In any event, since all three MFN provisions utilize the general word \"treatment\" and all three are limited by the territorial qualification, the Treaty's distinction between MFN treatment for investors and MFN treatment for investments cannot constitute evidence that one or the other type of MFN protection was intended to encompass the Treaty's international dispute resolution provisions. The Tribunal's above analysis applies equally to all three MFN clauses.408\n\nExamples might include rights to health care, education, pension schemes, or even the right to vote in political elections.\n\nFor this reason the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to parse the meaning of Article (2)(a) of the BIT's Protocol. The Tribunal agrees that, \"[t]aken in their ordinary meaning, the \u2018management use, enjoyment, and disposal of an investment' necessarily entail the defense and exercise of legal rights via dispute settlement mechanisms\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 22). This explains why the MFN clauses must be read as guaranteeing most-favored nation treatment to German investors in respect of Argentina's domestic administration of justice. But the Protocol nowhere authorizes the Tribunal to jettison the MFN clauses' clear territorial limitation.\n\n**f) Significance of the MFN clauses' failure to refer to \"all matters\" subject to the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe disputing parties have also debated whether the German-Argentine BIT's promise of MFN treatment to investors and their investments evinces a narrower intended field of application than other BITs promising MFN treatment \"in all matters subject to\" the BIT. Several arbitral tribunals interpreting BITs of this latter variety have stressed the \"broader\" formulation of this phrase, citing it as evidence that such BITs were intended to include international dispute resolution within the scope of the MFN clause, even if BITs specifying only MFN \"treatment\" were not. Likewise, some tribunals interpreting BITs lacking the phrase \"all matters\" have cited the omission in support of their decisions to deny the extension of the MFN clause in question to the treaty's dispute resolution provisions.409 Within the investor-State dispute context, this line of argument extends back to the *Maffezini* tribunal, which stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal also notes that of all the Spanish treaties it has been able to examine, the only one that speaks of \u2018all matters subject to this Agreement' in its most favored nation clause, is the one with Argentina. All other treaties, including those with Uruguay and Chile, omit this reference and merely provide that \u2018this treatment' shall be subject to the clause, which is of course a narrower formulation.\"410\n\nThis was in particular the view of the **Wintershall** tribunal, which addressed the interpretation of the very same BIT that is at issue here. See **Wintershall**, above note 330 at para 172.\n\n**Maffezini**, above note 114 at para 60. See also *Gas Natural*, above note 113 at para 30; *InterAguas*, above note 113 at para 55. Indeed, even before **Maffezini**, the arbitral commission in the *Ambatielos* matter seemed to suggest that this type of phrase might be particularly significant. See *Ambatielos II*, above note 363 at p. 107.\n\n235.\n\nThe *Berschader* tribunal, however, devoted ten paragraphs to the observation that \"all matters\" cannot really refer to all matters, since some matters covered in BITs - such as their temporal and territorial application, their provisions on denunciation and renewal, etc - cannot be extended by means of an MFN clause.411 By logical inference then, if some matters are necessarily omitted from the MFN clause's reference to \"all matters\", who is to say whether international investor-State dispute resolution is or is not among the omitted matters? The *Plama* tribunal, which denied extension of an MFN clause to a BIT's international dispute resolution provisions, considered that the omission of the phrase \"with respect to all matters\" could \"not alleviate the doubt\".412 The **Siemens** tribunal, which reached the opposite outcome, seems to have agreed that the phrase was not determinative,413 and at least two tribunals besides **Siemens** have found that a BIT's MFN clause could extend to international dispute settlement provisions even absent any reference to \"all matters\" subject to the agreement.414\n\nSee *Berschader*, above note 395 at paras 184-194.\n\n*Plama*, above note 349 at para 205;\n\n*Siemens*, above note 71 at para 103.\n\nSee *National Grid*, above note 113 and *RosInvest v. The Russian Federation*, Case No: Arbitration V 079/2005 Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award on Jurisdiction (Oct 2007) [hereinafter \" *RosInvest* \"].\n\n236.\n\nThe position of the present Tribunal is simply that the absence of the expression \"all matters\" - a phrase that is indicative of an intention on the part of some contracting State parties to cover the largest scope possible - is consistent with the conclusions which the Tribunal has already reached on the basis of its analysis of the terms \"treatment\" and \"in its territory\" in the German-Argentine BIT. The omission constitutes a supplementary indication that Germany and Argentina, at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty, did maintain a distinction between the Host State's direct treatment of investments within its territory and the international settlement of investor-State disputes.\n\n**g) Significance of the exceptions to MFN treatment listed in Articles 3(3) and 3(4)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nSome tribunals have relied upon the Roman law principle *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* to conclude that, where a treaty lists certain exceptions to MFN treatment, any treatment not specifically excluded is necessarily covered by the MFN clause.415 These tribunals have pointed to exceptions concerning preferential treatment accorded by one State to investors of a third State by reason of a customs union, regional economic integration area, or double taxation treaty as evidence that the contracting parties intended to include international dispute resolution provisions within the scope of the MFN clause.\n\nSee eg *National Grid*, above note 113 at para 82. See also *InterAguas*, above note 113 at para 56 (applying the principle without naming it); and *Siemens*, above note 71 at paras 83-86 (same).\n\n238.\n\nThe German-Argentine BIT also includes these standard exceptions.416 The present Tribunal does not, however, view the presence of these exceptions as an indication that the State Parties intended to include the Treaty's international investor-State dispute resolution provisions within the scope of its MFN commitments. This is so for two reasons. First, the MFN treatment exceptions mentioned in the German-Argentine BIT - like those found in most BITs - refer exclusively to types of treatment normally occurring within the territory of the Host State. Tax treatment, the extension of trade advantages resulting from customs unions, etc - all of these standard exceptions conform to the MFN clause's territorial limitation while the availability or form of international dispute resolution does not. It is therefore necessary for contracting State parties to explicitly exclude the former but not the latter from the scope of a territorially bound MFN clause if such is their intent.\n\nSee Articles 3(3) and 3(4) of the BIT, reproduced in para 206 above.\n\n239.\n\nSecond, wherever one may stand on the debate over \"substantive\" investment protections versus \"procedural\" dispute resolution mechanisms - it cannot be denied that all of the typical exceptions to MFN treatment observed in international investment treaties (at least in treaties concluded prior to the advent of the *Maffezini* decision) deal exclusively with the contracting States' direct treatment of foreign investments, never with the international resolution of investor-State disputes arising out of that treatment.417 Overlooking the obvious differences between rights and remedies would seem to push the principle *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* too far. One cannot use the principle to prove the non-existence of apples based upon the existence of oranges. The exclusion of certain types of domestic substantive treatment from the German-Argentine BIT's Article 3 MFN clauses therefore does not imply the inclusion of particular types of extra-territorial dispute resolution procedures. Indeed, it seems more likely that the Contracting State Parties, acting as they were prior to *Maffezini*, did not explicitly exclude international investor-State dispute resolution provisions from the scope of the MFN clauses simply because they never considered such an invocation of the clause to be possible.418\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion attempts to explain away this fact, stating: \"the Award neglects to mention that most if not all species of allegedly \u2018direct' treatment enumerated as exceptions to MFN treatment in the BIT entail specific mechanisms of dispute settlement, usually outside the territory of the host State\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 35). This argument amounts to a sleight of hand, since all of the examples cited by the Dissenting Opinion involve State-to-State international dispute resolution, not investor versus State. There would have been no need for the Contracting State Parties to specify that the BIT's MFN clauses could not be invoked by investors to reach the State-to-State international dispute resolution provisions of these other treaties. Investors may not initiate such proceedings in any event. It must further be noted that at the time of the conclusion of the German-Argentine BIT, there were no known examples of regional trade agreements containing investor-State dispute settlement provisions. The first such hybrid agreement - the North American Free Trade Agreement - was signed by Canada, the United States and Mexico in 1992 and went into force in 1994. (See generally the materials available at: http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta). And even the **Maffezini** tribunal disavowed the invocation of a BIT-based MFN clause to reach the international investor-State dispute settlement provisions of that \"highly institutionalized system of arbitration.\" (**Maffezini**, above note 114 at para 63.)\n\nThe Tribunal addresses this issue in paras 262-279 below (discussing the relevance of prior and subsequent treaty practice).\n\n**h) Requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be more favorable**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nPursuant to the MFN guarantees in Article 3 of the BIT, the Contracting State Parties may not, in their territory, subject the investments or investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment that is \"less favorable\" than that accorded to third States' investors and investments. Article 4(4), within its more limited sphere of application, articulates the same idea in inverse terms, requiring the Contracting States to afford \"most-favored-nation treatment\". Thus, the BIT's MFN clauses apply only where the treatment accorded under the Basic Treaty is less favorable or the treatment under a comparator treaty is more favorable. Since this Tribunal has already concluded that the wording of Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT as centred on the phrase \"treatment in its territory\" does not permit it to agree with the Claimant's thesis, it is not strictly necessary to examine the requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be more favorable. Even if such an examination were necessary, the Tribunal could not at present reach the same conclusion as the Claimant on this point.\n\n241.\n\nThe words \"less\" and \"more\" are, by their nature, relative terms. They necessitate a comparison between the two types of treatment invoked. Arbitral tribunals have adopted varying approaches, but surprisingly few have actually engaged in any kind of comparative scrutiny. Some appear to have accepted without question the claimant's characterization of a comparator treaty's dispute resolution provisions as more favorable. This was the case, for example, with the *Maffezini* and *Siemens* tribunals.419 Other tribunals have made explicit findings, but in conclusory fashion, without providing any reasoning.420 Still other tribunals appear to have equated \"no less favorable\" with \"same\". In the words of one tribunal:\n\n\"granting a treatment to Spanish investors that is no less favorable than that granted to French investors would mean that the Spanish investors would be able to invoke international arbitration against Argentina on the same terms as French investors.\"421\n\n*Maffezini*, above note 114 and *Siemens*, above note 71. A variation on this approach was employed by the **Renta4** majority, which suggested that since investors rationally believe international arbitration may be more favorable to them than domestic dispute resolution, this necessarily renders \"greater access\" to international arbitration more favorable. **Renta4**, above note 309 at paras 86 and 100.\n\nSee eg *Gas Natural*, above note 113 at para 31 (\"access to [international] arbitration only after resort to national courts and an eighteen-month waiting period is a less favorable degree of protection than access to arbitration immediately upon expiration of the negotiation period\").\n\n*InterAguas*, above note 113 at para 55 (emphasis added). See also *AWG*, above note 113 at para 55 (same quote, but referring to investments rather than investors).\n\n242.\n\nYet neither the ILC in its Draft Articles on MFN clauses nor the much-cited *Ambatielos* arbitral commission conflated MFN treatment with equal treatment, nor did they express any unease with the task of objective comparison. The ILC specifically eschewed any reference to the word \"equal\" in its Draft Articles on MFN clauses.422 In explaining why, the Commission\u2019s Commentary acknowledged that \"the notion of \u2018equality of treatment\u2019 is particularly closely attached to the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause.\"423 It also pointed out, however, that \"equal\" is not the same as \"identical\". This implies \"different\" does not automatically mean \"less favorable\". Rather, the point of MFN clauses is to ensure overall equality of treatment in the sense of creating a level playing field between foreign investors from different countries, even if this is sometimes accomplished through non-identical means.\n\nILC Commentary on Draft MFN Articles, above note 364 at p. 22, para 5.\n\nIbid.\n\n243.\n\nMore fundamentally, however, the \"different = less favorable\" hypothesis proves false in situations where the provisions of the basic treaty may actually be more favorable than those of the comparator treaty. As the ILC noted, \"while most-favoured-nation treatment excludes preferential treatment of third States by the granting State, it is fully compatible with preferential treatment of the beneficiary State by the granting State\".424 Any tribunal called upon to interpret and apply an MFN clause must therefore satisfy itself that the comparator treaty provision invoked by means of the clause is indeed more favorable than that of the basic treaty. This requires an objective determination by the tribunal; an invoking party's bald assertions will not suffice.425\n\nIbid.\n\nThe arbitral commission's decision in *Ambatielos* provides a classic example. In that decision, the tribunal undertook a searching comparative analysis of the basic and comparator treaties' provisions on the administration of justice. It eventually found that the comparator treaties' provisions were not actually more favorable, and therefore the MFN clause did not apply to the matter before it. *Ambatielos II*, above note 363 at pp. 107-110. Despite frequently citing to the decision and lauding its finding that dispute resolution provisions may potentially fall within the reach of an MFN clause, many recent investor-State arbitral tribunals seem to have overlooked this crucial aspect of the commission's approach.\n\n244.\n\nApplying these principles to the present matter, the Tribunal could not endorse the Claimant's proposed use of the MFN clause unless it could determine that the dispute resolution provisions of Article 10 of the German-Argentine BIT (the \"Basic Treaty\") are objectively less favorable than those of Article X of the Chilean-Argentine BIT (the \"Comparator Treaty\").426 Article X of the Comparator Treaty allows investors to proceed to international arbitration immediately upon fulfilment of a 6-month negotiation period.427 The Claimant asserts that this is more favorable than Article 10 of the Basic Treaty, which requires investors to first submit the dispute to the domestic courts of Argentina for 18 months before proceeding to international arbitration. On the other hand, Article X of the Comparator Treaty contains a fork-in-the-road clause, whereas Article 10 of the Basic Treaty does not. Thus, an investor operating under the Basic Treaty's dispute resolution provisions receives two bites at the apple: once before the domestic courts, and - if the investor is still not satisfied - again before an international arbitral tribunal. An investor operating under the Comparator Treaty, by contrast, receives only one chance to obtain a satisfactory outcome. Such an investor must choose either domestic or international dispute resolution, and once the choice is made, it is irrevocable.428 Which provision is more favorable, then?\n\nAs noted by one commentary, \"it would be invidious for international tribunals to be finding (in the absence of specific evidence) that Host State adjudication of treaty rights was necessarily inferior to international arbitration.\" MCLACHLAN, SHORE AND WEININGER, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION, SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 257.\n\nArticle X of the Chile-Argentina BIT, titled \"Settlement of disputes relating to investments\", provides as follows:  \n (1) \"Any dispute relating to an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty, between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party, shall, to the extent possible, be resolved by amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.  \n (2) If the dispute has not been resolved within a period of six months from the moment when a complaint was lodged by one or other of the parties, it shall be submitted at the option of the national or company:  \n - either to the national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party implicated in the dispute;  \n - or to international arbitration in the conditions described in paragraph 3.  \n Once a national or company has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of the relevant Contracting Party or to international arbitration, this election of one or the other of these proceedings shall be definitive.  \n (3) In case of recourse to international arbitration the dispute shall be raised before one of the following designated arbitral organs at the election of the national or company:  \n - The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature in Washington the 18th of March 1965, if each State party to the present agreement has ratified that Convention. So long as this condition is not fulfilled, each Contracting Party gives its consent that the dispute may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID;  \n - An ad hoc arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).  \n (4) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the provisions of the present Treaty, the law of the Contracting Party to the dispute, including its rules on conflict of laws, and the terms of any specific agreement concluded in relation to the investment as well as the relevant principles of international law.  \n (5) The decisions of the arbitral tribunal shall be definitive and binding upon the parties to the dispute.  \n (6) The Contracting Parties shall abstain from pursuing, through diplomatic channels, arguments concerning any arbitration or judicial process in progress and up until after the proceedings have been concluded, unless the parties to the dispute have not complied with the award of the arbitral tribunal or the sentence of the ordinary court under the terms of implementation established in the award or sentence.\"  \n (Tribunal's translation).\n\nSee Article X(2) of the Chile-Argentina BIT ibid. The Tribunal notes that the both of the other comparator BITs invoked by the Claimant contain similar fork-in-the-road clauses. See United States-Argentina BIT at Article VII(3)(a) and Panama-Argentina BIT at Article 9(2).\n\n245.\n\nIt might be tempting to simply accept the Claimant's assertion that the Comparator Treaty is more favorable under the assumption that it must be more favorable if the Claimant prefers it. The problem, however, is that claimants' preferences are subjective. It is certainly conceivable that some future claimant may instead prefer to have two successive chances for a favorable outcome under the Basic Treaty rather than proceed immediately to international arbitration under the Comparator Treaty. This is particularly so since recent trends indicate that the costs of international arbitration may be quite high relative to the costs of domestic dispute resolution,429 and the average time required to resolve disputes via international arbitration may equal or exceed that of domestic court processes.430\n\nA 2005 UNCTAD study (now probably somewhat outdated) stated the following concerning the costs of international investment arbitration:  \n \"A cursory review of cost decisions in recent awards suggests that the average legal costs incurred by Governments are between $1 million and $2 million, including lawyers' fees, the costs for the tribunal of about $400,000 or more, and the costs for the claimants, which are about the same as those for the defendant.\"  \n \"Investor-State Disputes Arising from Investment Treaties: A Review\", UNCTAD Series on International Investment Policies for Development (2005), available at: www.unctad.org/en/docs/iteiit20054\\_en.pdf at p. 8.\n\nThe present arbitration, which was first registered on 2 August 2004 (nearly 8 years ago), provides a case in point. As a statistical matter, one recent study found that the average duration of ICSID cases decided through 1 July 2009 was 3.6 years (1325 days), with the shortest case lasting 1.2 years and the longest lasting 10.5 years. Sinclair, Fisher, and Macrory, \"ICSID Arbitration: How long does it take\", *Global Arbitration Review Journal*, Vol. 4, Issue 5 (2009). The present arbitration has already exceeded the ICSID average. The Tribunal was not provided with reliable independent information indicating the average duration and cost of domestic Argentine court proceedings. Argentina has asserted, however, that its courts can and do regularly dispose of some matters within less than 18 months. Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 55 and note 81, citing Respondent's Exhibits: \"Judgments of the Argentine Supreme Court\" (A RA 20), \"Injunctions (A RA 21), and \"Final Judgments\" (A RA 22).\n\n246.\n\nSimply accepting a claimant's assertions, therefore, could lead to a situation wherein the terms \"more\" and \"less\" favorable have no objective meaning at all, but rather depend upon the whim of the individual claimant in each particular case. It is difficult to believe that the Contracting State Parties to the BIT intended to commit themselves to international legal obligations which derive not from an objective appreciation of the text of the Treaty but from the subjective perceptions of individual claimants.\n\n247.\n\nMoreover, under Article 10 of the Germany-Argentina BIT, if the Claimant submits its claims to the domestic courts of Argentina for 18 months and does not obtain satisfactory results within that period, it remains at liberty to pursue international arbitration thereafter. Should it opt to do so, it will be in a position to submit to an international arbitral tribunal objective evidence of its treatment in the domestic courts of Argentina - including the actual costs expended therein, any recompense obtained, and any opportunity costs suffered by reason of the delay in the full satisfaction of its claims. In other words, the Claimant could add to its other claims an additional claim concerning its treatment in the Argentine courts, which if proven would be fully compensable, with interest, in the same manner as any other treaty violation. That is to say, any violation due to less favorable or discriminatory treatment would be compensated in accordance with the ordinary general international law principle of full reparation.431\n\nThis principle would allow the Tribunal to take account not only of the Claimant's actual legal costs within the Argentine courts for the duration of the 18-month requirement, but also the opportunity costs associated with the delay in the resolution of the claims. Such a calculation presents its challenges, to be sure, but no more so than the calculation of damages due for the violation of any other treaty provision.\n\n248.\n\nThe BIT provides two avenues under which the Claimant could proceed. The first is provided by the MFN clauses themselves432 and the second by its arbitrary and discriminatory treatment clause.433 Both sets of clauses protect German investors such as the Claimant from suffering less favorable treatment than that enjoyed by foreign investors under other BITs. If domestic dispute resolution turns out to be ineffective, the Claimant can recuperate the costs of this process in its subsequent international arbitration proceedings.434 On the other hand, if the Claimant's claims are resolved to its satisfaction in the Argentine courts in a timely and cost efficient manner, then the Claimant will have no basis for either an MFN claim or a discriminatory treatment claim and will have no need to proceed to international arbitration.\n\nSince the treatment received by the Claimant in the Argentine courts would constitute treatment within the territory of the Host State, the territorial limitation of the BIT's MFN clauses would no longer pose a problem. The subsequently concerned arbitral tribunal could therefore consider, in light of the objective evidence, whether Argentina has violated its MFN commitments by forcing the Claimant - in order to vindicate its legal rights - to incur costs and delays in excess of those faced by similarly situated claimants under third-state BITs. This would, of course, require said tribunal to make a definitive finding to the effect that the treatment of an investor within the Host State's domestic courts does fall within the purview of the Treaty's MFN clauses, even if international dispute resolution does not. In this Tribunal's view, such a finding follows naturally from a plain reading of the MFN clauses.\n\nEven if the BIT's MFN clauses did not provide sufficient protection, Article 2(3) of the BIT provides the Claimant with a second avenue for remedying any less favorable treatment ultimately experienced by reason of its compliance with the 18-month domestic courts requirement. Under Article 2(3):  \n \"Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory.\"  \n Requiring German investors to fruitlessly (if such turns out to be the case) expend time and resources in the domestic Argentine courts in order to vindicate their treaty-based legal rights while exempting Chilean investors from the same requirement could be viewed as a discriminatory impairment of German investors' rights. This is so even if Argentina could articulate a good policy reason for requiring some foreign investors, but not others, to first submit their claims to the domestic courts.\n\nIt should be noted that this would not require the Claimant to make out a denial of justice claim concerning its treatment in the Argentine courts. Nor would it require the subsequent arbitral tribunal to sit in review over the actions of the domestic courts. Rather, the sole question would be whether the Claimant, in order to vindicate its legal rights, was discriminatorily (on the grounds of its nationality) forced to bear costs in excess of those imposed upon investors from third countries.\n\n249.\n\nIn either case, the basic purpose of the MFN clauses will have been fulfilled. The Claimant will have been treated at least as well as the investors of third States. It will have experienced no competitive disadvantage as a result of the 18-month domestic courts submission requirement.435 At the end of the day, the Claimant will have enjoyed, alongside other foreign investors, a \"fundamental equality without discrimination among all of the countries concerned\".436\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion expresses concern that if a foreign investor \"subjected itself willingly to a process prescribed under the BIT, foregoing MFN protection in the process,\" it would then be foreclosed from bringing an MFN claim in a subsequent arbitral proceeding (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 38). This concern is unfounded, since the claimant would not have \"foregone\" MFN protection but would have rather fulfilled the necessary condition precedent to claiming such protection before an international tribunal.\n\n*Case concerning rights of nationals of the United States of America in Morocco*, Judgment of August 27th, 1952, I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 176.\n\n250.\n\nThis Tribunal need not worry, therefore, that rejecting the Claimant's bid to skip over the Basic Treaty's 18-month domestic court submission requirement will result in the Claimant receiving treatment, in the territory of the Host State, that is ultimately less favorable than that extended to Chilean investors under the Comparator Treaty. The Claimant may have to follow a different procedural route than similarly situated Chilean investors. But that route will, at worst, ultimately protect the Claimant's rights437 on an equal par with those investors. At best, it may even do so more quickly or cheaply. The weight of the arguments therefore does not indicate that the Comparator Treaty's dispute resolution provisions are objectively more favorable than those of the Basic Treaty. As a consequence, the Basic Treaty's MFN clauses do not presently come into play. This finding is without prejudice to any MFN claims the Claimant may present at the merits stage upon satisfaction of the Treaty's jurisdictional pre-requisites.\n\nIncluding its MFN rights.\n\n**i) Relationship between the Article 3 MFN clauses and the Article 4 MFN clause**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe final textual puzzle to be addressed is as follows: does the relationship between the MFN clauses in Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty reveal anything about whether or not the Treaty' s international dispute resolution provisions fall within the ambit of one or more of the clauses? The parties have once again made disputing submissions concerning this question. As the Tribunal has noted, Article 4(4)'s MFN clause applies only in respect of the specific protections enumerated in Article 4, whereas the MFN clauses in Articles 3(1) and 3(2) appear to apply more generally. In the present matter, the Claimant's claims concerning expropriation as well as full legal protection and security fall within the scope of Article 4(4). Its claims concerning fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, and the free transfer of payments all fall within the scope of Articles 3(1) and 3(2). What is not clear is whether the specific protections provided in Articles 4(1)-(3) of the Treaty simultaneously enjoy the MFN guarantees of Articles 3(1)-(2) and that of Article 4(4), or whether the latter MFN clause ousts the operation of the former two in respect of Article 4.\n\n252.\n\nThe *Siemens* tribunal concluded that Article 4(4) of the German-Argentine BIT was inserted *ex abundante cautela*, because the protections listed in Articles 4(1)-(3) are of particular importance to foreign investors.438 This may be so, although recent trends in investor-State arbitration suggest that the fair and equitable treatment guarantee (which appears in Article 2) may be at least as important to many investors, if not more so.\n\n*Siemens*, above note 71 at para 90.\n\n253.\n\nWhatever the explanation for the separate MFN clauses, it is in any event irrelevant to the present inquiry. The disputing parties have submitted no persuasive evidence as to the overlapping or distinctive scope of application of the Treaty's MFN clauses. Even if they had done so, a determination one way or the other would have no effect upon the outcome. As discussed above, the use of the word \"treatment\" is common to all three MFN clauses, as are the limitations that the treatment invoked must be one occurring within the territory of the Host State and must be either \"more\" or \"less\" favorable than the parallel treatment under some comparator treaty. It makes little difference, therefore, whether the Claimant requests that an allegedly more favorable comparator dispute resolution provision be applied to all of its claims under Articles 3(1) and 3(2) or whether it invokes Articles 3(1)-(2) in relation to some claims and Article 4(4) in relation to others. The same considerations apply in either case.\n\n**j) Meaning of the MFN clauses in light of the objects and purposes of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal has analyzed the meaning of the constituent components of the German-Argentine BIT's MFN clauses by probing their ordinary meaning in context. In so doing, the Tribunal has throughout its analysis born in mind the objects and purposes of the Treaty, as required by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. It has not undertaken a separate three-step analysis of each Treaty term - one step focusing on ordinary meaning, another on context, and another on the \"light\" of the Treaty's object and purpose - because in the Tribunal's view the Vienna Convention posits these as interrelated elements of a holistic approach to treaty interpretation rather than as a set of discrete and sequential steps. It nevertheless seems prudent to make a few explicit comments about the objects and purposes of the BIT so as to clarify the Tribunal\u2019s approach.\n\n255.\n\nThe German-Argentine BIT expresses its objects and purposes in rather general terms in its Preamble, which reads:\n\n\"Desiring to intensify economic cooperation between both States,\n\nIntending to create favorable conditions for investments by nationals or companies of one State in the territory of the other State,\n\nRecognizing that the encouragement and contractual protection of such investments are apt to stimulate private business initiative and to increase the prosperity of both States,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\"\n\n256.\n\nAs formulated, the States resolved to encourage, protect, and create favorable conditions for investments in order to: a) intensify economic cooperation (an amity objective); b) stimulate private business initiative (an economic growth objective); and c) increase the prosperity of both States (a welfare objective). It is important to note that these latter three points represent the ultimate or outcome-based objectives of the States in concluding the Treaty, for which the encouragement, protection, and creation of favorable conditions for investment serve as the chosen instruments.\n\n257.\n\nArticles 1 through 11 of the Treaty, as well as the Protocol, go on to specifically define the manner in which the Contracting Parties mutually agreed to promote and protect investments in pursuit of the Treaty\u2019s specified objectives. The German-Argentine BIT thus conforms to the classical nature of bilateral treaties between States: it commits the Contracting Parties to mutually and reciprocally pursue a chosen set of objectives within a framework that both Parties have deemed to be acceptable.\n\n258.\n\nIn considering the application of this framework to the present matter, one must bear in mind that the Contracting State Parties adopted all of the provisions of the Treaty together as a whole. In one fell swoop they nodded their assent not only to the BIT\u2019s objects and purposes, as expressed in the Preamble, but also to the various treatment standards set forth in Articles 1 to 9 (including the MFN clauses) as well as the international dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 10. This indisputably evinces the State Parties\u2019 belief that all of these provisions -including Article 10's requirement of an 18-month submission of any claims to the domestic courts of the Host State - are perfectly consistent with the objects and purposes of the Treaty.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that dispensing with the 18-month requirement, as the Argentina-Chile BIT has done, would be more consistent with the objective of investment protection and promotion. In a similar vein, the Dissenting Opinion asserts that allowing investors to choose between different types of international dispute settlement \"options\" is inherently more favorable to investors and therefore more conducive to investment promotion than not providing them with options.439 With respect, both of these approaches confuse the real issue. The question is not whether allowing the Claimant to import all or portions of a comparator BIT's investor-State dispute resolution clause would better protect and promote investment,440 nor whether the Claimant would prefer to be able to do so,441 but rather whether Germany and Argentina, in concluding the BIT, agreed to protect and promote investment in that particular manner. This question cannot be answered by reference to external opinions as to which types of dispute resolution may best protect and promote investment in the abstract. Nor can it be answered by reference to a claimant's preference for more options over fewer options. It can only be answered by reference to the scope of the State Parties' consent as expressed in the German-Argentine BIT.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 36.\n\nWhether in the Claimant's view or that of the Tribunal.\n\nFor another critique of this investor \"choice\" argument, see *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award (21 June 2011) [hereinafter \" *Impregilo* \"], Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Brigitte Stern, at paras 11-12 and 105-107.\n\n260.\n\nThe foregoing analysis of the Treaty's text has revealed no indication whatsoever that the Contracting Parties did, in fact, consent to protect and promote investment in the specific manner invoked by the Claimant. Indeed none of the formal textual indicia examined herein - let alone the balance of the indicia when examined collectively - affirmatively establishes the Contracting State Parties' consent to submit themselves, at the whim of individual investors, to a wide variety of different possible combinations of international dispute resolution provisions contained within third-party treaties.442 The same conclusion holds even if one were to limit the Claimant's \"options\" to supplanting the entirety of the Basic Treaty's investor-State dispute resolution article with the entirety of the Comparator Treaty's corresponding article. Since, as noted above, the international dispute resolution provisions of Article 10 of the Basic Treaty are not objectively less favorable than those of the applicable Comparator Treaty,443 it would be incorrect to characterize the Claimant's position as more compatible with the Treaty' s objects and purposes then the Respondent's position. For these reasons, a separate consideration of the Treaty' s objects and purposes does not assist the Claimant here.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Dissenting Opinion of Judge Brower provides no indication whatsoever that the State Parties consented to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal in the circumstances raised by this case. The most that can be said is that the word \"treatment,\" standing on its own, is general enough to potentially encompass international investor-State dispute settlement. But this argument falls away as soon as the word \"treatment\" is examined in connection with the limiting phrase \"in its territory.\" Thus, the open-textured nature of the word \"treatment\" falls well short of fulfilling the international law requirement that a State's consent to submit to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal must be established and not merely presumed.\n\nSee above, paras 241-251.\n\n**k) Supplementary indications from state practice and international jurisprudence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation of the Treaty's text in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention has shown that the Claimant's proposed use of the BIT's MFN clauses does not fall within the scope of the ordinary meaning of those clauses in their context and in the light of the Treaty's object and purpose. An examination of relevant supplemental materials pursuant to Article 32 of the Vienna Convention serves to confirm this conclusion. The Tribunal will begin with a consideration of the state practice of Argentina in the period immediately surrounding the conclusion of the German-Argentine BIT.\n\n262.\n\nIn relation to the 18-month domestic courts proviso, Argentina presented evidence of its prior and subsequent treaty practice in its submissions at the oral hearings. Appendices 1 and 2 below show 29 of Argentina's bilateral investment treaties in chronological order according to the date of signing and the date of entry into force, respectively. The tables also indicate, for each treaty, whether or not it included the 18-month domestic courts requirement that is in contention in this case. According to this evidence, of the 29 BITs signed by Argentina with various States between 22 May 1990 and 17 May 1994, ten treaties contained the 18-month domestic courts submission requirement while the other 19 did not. Only 17 of the 29 treaties concluded have so far entered into force. Of these, nine contain the 18-month domestic courts requirement while eight do not.\n\n263.\n\nIt is instructive to consider the chronology of these treaties in light of the principle of contemporaneity and the principle of effectiveness (\" *effet utile* \"). As can be seen from Appendix 1, if Argentina had intended for its BITs' MFN clauses to apply to their international dispute resolution provisions, then it included the 18-month domestic courts submission requirement in no less than five subsequent treaties (those with Spain, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, and South Korea) for no good reason at all. If one takes dates of entry into force (Appendix 2) as the relevant metric, then Argentina needlessly and inexplicably included the domestic courts provision in nine subsequent treaties,444 including the German-Argentine BIT.\n\nThose with Spain, Sweden, the UK, Canada, Italy, Germany, Belgium/Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Austria. The Tribunal notes that two of these treaties (the Netherlands and South Korea treaties) were negotiated and signed at a time when at last one treaty omitting the 18-month requirement (the Poland treaty) was already in force.\n\n264.\n\nThese patterns would seem strange indeed if the Claimant's assertions concerning the MFN clauses were accepted. In that case, the principle of effectiveness would be violated with respect to the noted treaties, because the 18-month domestic courts requirement would have been void *ab initio* - immediately superseded by means of the treaties' MFN clauses.445 The principle of contemporaneity avoids this incongruity by preferring the interpretation consistent with Argentina's demonstrated treaty practice - namely, that Argentina did not in 1991 understand the phrase \"treatment in the territory of the host state\" as extending to the BIT's international arbitration procedures.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion suggests that Argentina's practice of including the18-month proviso in some later treaties would not have been pointless, since claimants remain at liberty to comply with the proviso should they so wish (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 28). This \"choice\" argument is disingenuous in light of the Dissenting Opinion's insistence that direct access to international arbitration is inherently more favorable to claimants than international arbitration only following a mandatory 18-month domestic court proceeding. In addition, if, in concluding its later treaties, Argentina understood compliance with the 18-month proviso to have become optional, then it is difficult to understand why it continued to word the proviso in mandatory terms.\n\n265.\n\nAs to the state practice of Germany, a cursory examination reveals that the 18-month proviso does not feature in the vast majority of Germany's other contemporaneous BITs. This suggests that while Germany was willing to agree to the proviso in the context of its negotiations with specific Latin American countries,446 it did not place particular importance upon the 18-month domestic courts requirement as a general policy matter. This does not imply, however, that the German Government in 1991 embraced the Claimant's proposed interpretation of the MFN clauses. On the contrary, there are indications within Germany's state practice suggesting that the German Government - like the Argentine Government - never contemplated (let alone endorsed) a possible invocation of the MFN clauses in the manner now proposed.\n\nSee also Treaty between the Republic of Chile and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments, signed 21 October 1991, at art. 10 (containing the same 18-month domestic courts requirement), available at: http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/chile\\_germany\\_sp.pdf.\n\n266.\n\nPrior to concluding its BIT with Argentina, Germany had concluded other BITs authorizing investors to access international arbitration without any sort of prior recourse to the domestic courts.447 The Claimant's theory would imply that Germany, upon signing the German-Argentine BIT, already recognized and accepted the inapplicability of the 18-month domestic courts proviso to any potential investment claims by Argentine investors against the German Government. In that case, one would expect Article 10 of the BIT to reflect this asymmetrical state of affairs. Yet the Contracting State Parties worded Article 10 in entirely symmetric language. There is no indication that - despite the reciprocal and bilateral nature of the rest of the Treaty - Germany consciously consented to proceed directly to binding international arbitration with Argentine investors in circumstances in which similarly situated German investors would not be entitled to proceed directly to binding international arbitration against Argentina.448 This inconsistency provides yet another indication that the Contracting State Parties did not subscribe to the Claimant's proposed interpretation of the MFN clauses at the time of the Treaty's conclusion.\n\nSee e.g. Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and Bolivia concerning the promotion and mutual protection of investments (with protocol), signed 23 March 1987, at art. 11, available at: http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/germany\\_bolivia.pdf.\n\nSince Argentina had not yet concluded any BITs omitting the 18-month requirement.\n\n267.\n\nFrom this starting point, it becomes necessary to examine whether the meaning of the phrase \"treatment in its territory\" has evolved over time in order to see whether an evolutive interpretation is required in the present instance.449 Such an interpretation would only be permissible in the face of convincing evidence, reflected by state practice, doctrinal analysis and international case law, that a coherent and generally accepted new meaning of the phrase has since been accepted by states, and in particular by Argentina and Germany. In this regard, it is striking to note that movements towards an enlargement of the scope of this phrase have stemmed not primarily from state practice but from the investor-State arbitral case law. It was the *Maffezini* decision of 25 January 2000 that, for the first time, initiated an enlarged interpretation of the scope of \"treatment\" so as to cover not only investment protection standards but also international dispute resolution provisions of BITs.450 It need hardly be stated that a BIT\u2019s MFN clause should not now be interpreted in an evolutionary manner solely because some investor-State tribunals have followed, either in toto or in part, the interpretation initiated by one arbitral award which, with due respect to its talented authors, remains one of the most highly controversial awards in the history of contemporary investor-State arbitration.\n\nContrary to the assertion of the Dissenting Opinion, this does not entail an \"abandonment\" of the principle of contemporaneity. (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 27.) Rather, the principle of contemporaneity has revealed that the Contracting States did not likely endorse the Claimant's proposed interpretation of the MFN clauses' use of the phrase \"treatment in the territory of the host State\" at the time of the conclusion of the BIT. The Tribunal now turns to consider whether, in the alternative, the Contracting States have since altered their original understanding of the Treaty's terms so as to subsequently embrace the Claimant's proposed interpretation.\n\n*Maffezini*, above note 114 at paras 38-64.\n\n268.\n\nA brief look at the ways in which various investor-State tribunals and States have since resolved the question proves that neither the arbitral community nor more importantly (as public international law is not made primarily by arbitrators) common state practice has yet reached a consensus whereby an MFN clause\u2019s reference to \"treatment in the territory of the host State\" may nowadays be understood as covering the international settlement of disputes. To-date, at least nine known investor-State arbitral panels have found that a particular BIT\u2019s MFN clause could be used to modify its international dispute resolution provisions451 while another ten have reached the opposite result.452 Eminent arbitrators have come down on opposite sides of the debate, sometimes with respect to the very same treaty - including the Treaty presently under consideration.453 This relatively even split shows that there is as yet no established *opinio juris*.\n\nSee *RosInvest*, above note 414; *Maffezini*, above note 114; *Siemens*, above note 71; *National Grid*, *Gas Natural*, *Camuzzi 2*, **InterAguas**, and **AWG**, all above note 113 (in contrast to the dissent, the Tribunal considers the **InterAguas** and **AWG** awards as comprising only a single finding, as they were issued around the same time by the same panel of arbitrators and are, in large part, nearly verbatim identical); *Impregilo* above note 441 (Brigitte Stern dissenting); and *Hochtief*, above note 345 (Christopher Thomas dissenting).\n\nSee *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003); *Salini v. Jordan*, above note 69; *Plama*, above note 349; *Berschader*, above note 395; *Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15 Award (13 Sep 2006); *Wintershall*, above note 330; *Renta4*, above note 309 (Charles Brower dissenting), *Mr.* *Tza Yap Sum v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Decision on Jurisdiction and Competence (19 June 2009); *Austrian Airlines v. the Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (9 Oct 2009) (redacted version) (Charles Brower dissenting); and *ICS v. Argentina*, above note 303\n\nThe **Wintershall** and **Siemens** tribunals reached opposite conclusions concerning the German-Argentine BIT whose interpretation is at issue in the present case. Most recently, the *Hochtief* majority came down on the side of the **Siemens** tribunal, while the dissent sided with the **Wintershall** outcome.\n\n269.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion attempts to discount the bulk of the contrary authority by asserting that those cases dealt with factually distinct situations.454 With respect, this is a distinction without a difference. It is true that nine out of eleven arbitral panels have allowed claimants to circumvent the 18-month domestic courts requirement of various Argentine BITs in reliance upon MFN clauses.455 It is also true, however, that several of the ten arbitral tribunals denying the applicability of MFN clauses to BITs' international dispute resolution provisions have severely criticized both the reasoning and the outcome of the cases embraced by the Dissenting Opinion.456 This is not surprising, given that none of the cases finding in favor of MFN-generated extensions of jurisdiction has pointed to any principled textual basis for distinguishing between those international dispute settlement provisions which may be altered by operation of an MFN clause and those which may not. Nor does the Dissenting Opinion identify any such basis.457\n\nDissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at paras 23-24.\n\nIbid at n. 67.\n\nSee e.g. *Salini*, above note 69 at paras 113-115; *Plama*, above note 349 at paras 216-227; *Wintershall*, above note 330 at paras 179-184. See also *Impregilo*, above note 451, Separate Opinion of Brigitte Stern. For scholarly critiques, see Zachary Douglas, \"The MFN Clause in Investment Treaty Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails,\" *Journal of International Dispute Settlement*, Vol. 2, No. 1, (2011), pp. 97113; Brigitte Stern, \"ICSID Arbitration and the State's Increasingly Remote Consent: A Propos the Maffezini Case,\" in STEVE CHARNOVITZ, DEBRA STEGER AND PETER VAN DEN BOSSCHE (EDS) LAW IN THE SERVICE OF HUMAN DIGNITY. ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF FLORENTINO FELICIANO (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 246-260.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion criticizes the *Wintershall* tribunal for expressing concern that expansive interpretations of MFN clauses could allow claimants even to change the Basic Treaty's designated arbitral forum, e.g. from ICSID to UNCITRAL (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 25). But the Tribunal notes that the Dissenting Opinion is careful not to disapprove of that possibility. In fact, Judge Brower has on at least one occasion gone so far as to suggest the application of MFN clauses to achieve a still greater feat. Namely, in footnote 6 to his *Austrian Airlines* dissent (above note 452), he stated:  \n \"While we need not decide the point, as it has not been put before us, I pose the question whether, even if the Treaty is interpreted as barring arbitration of all claims for violation of substantive provisions of the Treaty itself, it properly can be construed as precluding an importable \u2018new' substantive provision [an umbrella clause, in that case] from bringing with it an associated right to arbitration.\"  \n In other words, Judge Brower envisions some circumstances wherein an MFN clause may authorize a claimant to engage in international arbitration against a state under a basic treaty which contains no investor-State arbitration clause at all.\n\n270.\n\nThe legal question before the Tribunal is: did the Contracting State Parties intend for the MFN clauses of the Basic Treaty to alter the scope of their consent to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal, at the option of the investor, by reference to the international dispute settlement provisions of all existing and future comparator treaties? The particular type of alteration sought by the Claimant is of no moment in answering this question, because the treaty clauses themselves do not distinguish as to type. The Dissenting Opinion's attempt to draw a distinction is especially baffling in light of the fact that its distinguished author has already found in favor of MFN-generated enlargements of a tribunal's jurisdiction in some of the very circumstances he now distinguishes and on the basis of the same reasons he now cites.458\n\nSee *Austrian Airlines*, above note 452, Separate Opinion of Charles N. Brower (finding, in circumstances where the basic treaty stipulated that the scope of an international arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to claims concerning the amount or method of payment of compensation once the occurrence of an expropriation had already been found by the domestic authorities, that an MFN clause nevertheless entitled the tribunal to: 1) determine the preliminary question as to whether an expropriation had occurred, and 2) decide the claimant's fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security claims); see also *Renta4*, above note 309, Separate Opinion of Charles N. Brower, at paras 5-24 (reaching the same result on the basis of an MFN clause whose application was expressly limited to the fair and equitable treatment standard).\n\n271.\n\nAs far as the evolution of state practice is concerned, one must respectively consider the practice of the Treaty's Contracting State Parties and that of other states. The disputing parties have submitted no evidence concerning the subsequent state practice of Germany that would tend to indicate any change in or clarification of that country's position.459 The Tribunal notes that the most recent German Model BIT neither explicitly accepts nor rejects the *Maffezini* holding. It does, however, retain the territorial limitation upon the scope of the MFN clause.460\n\nThe Tribunal is not aware of any instance in which Germany, as a respondent State in a BIT-based arbitral claim, has had to take a position on the legal question raised by these proceedings.\n\nGerman Model BIT, 2008, available at: http://www.italaw.com/investmenttreaties.htm.\n\n272.\n\nAs for Argentina, as noted by the *National Grid* tribunal:\n\n\"after the decision on jurisdiction in *Siemens*, the Argentine Republic and Panama exchanged diplomatic notes with an \u2018interpretive declaration' of the MFN clause in their 1996 investment treaty to the effect that, the MFN clause does not extend to dispute resolution clauses, and that this has always been their intention.\"461\n\nObviously, an interpretive declaration issued by a State after a treaty-based interpretive dispute has already arisen cannot be considered as a definitive guide to the State's original intentions -particularly when the declaration relates to a different treaty. It merits notice, however, that the Panama-Argentina BIT does not include the 18-months domestic courts proviso. Its dispute resolution provisions are instead similar to those of the Chile-Argentina BIT relied upon by the Claimant. The fact that Argentina and Panama nevertheless went out of their way to distance themselves from the understanding adopted by the *Siemens* tribunal is therefore indicative of their mutual disapproval of that holding.\n\n*National Grid*, above note 113 at para 85 (emphasis added).\n\n273.\n\nLike the Contracting States' own treaty practices, the recent treaty practices of other States may prove illuminating. This is so because they may clarify whether the understanding of the MFN clause's scope of operation that prevailed among the general international community at the time of the conclusion of the German-Argentine BIT has since evolved to acquire a larger scope. In this regard, it should be noted that the only known clarifications issued by other States since the advent of the *Maffezini* decision have gone in the direction of confirming that the Contracting State Parties did not intend for the MFN clauses that are the subject of the clarifications to reach international dispute resolution. This is the case, for example, with the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), wherein the parties inserted a footnote into the negotiating history indicating:\n\n\"The Most-Favored-Nation Treatment Article of this Agreement is expressly limited in its scope to matters \u2018with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct operation and sale or other dispositions of investments.' The Parties share the understanding and intent that this clause does not encompass international dispute resolution mechanisms such as those contained in Section C of this chapter, and therefore could not reasonably lead to a conclusion similar to that of the *Maffezini* case.\"462\n\nReprinted in A.R. Ziegler, \" *The Nascent International Law on Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Clauses in Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)* \", European Yearbook of International Economic Law 77 (Dec 2009), p. 93 (emphasis added). The same \"vanishing footnote\" was also inserted in the draft text of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which has yet to be adopted. (See fn. 13 to chap. XVII, Free Trade Area of the Americas, draft of 21 November 2003, FTAA.TNC/w/133/Rev.3, available at: http://www.ftaa-alca.org/ftaadraft03/ChapterXVII\\_e.asp.)\n\n274.\n\nSwitzerland and Colombia likewise appear to have clarified their investment treaty practice in reaction to *Maffezini* on at least one occasion. In an agreement signed on 17 May 2006, the parties included an annex, which reads:\n\n\"For greater certainty, it is further understood that the most favourable nation treatment... does not encompass mechanisms for the settlement of investment disputes provided for in other international agreements concluded by the Party concerned.\"463\n\nIbid at p. 95.\n\n275.\n\nFinally, the European Commission (DG Trade), in view of its impending competence to negotiate investment treaties on behalf of the European Community, published an Issue Paper on 30 May 2006 in which it advanced its suggested scope for any MFN clauses to be included in future EU BITs. It recommended that \"[t]he scope of the MFN clause is focused and limited to establishment, thus clearly signaling that it could not extend to BIT provisions on expropriation and dispute settlement.\"464\n\nIbid at p. 94. It is of course obvious that this White Paper does not represent settled European policy on the question, since the EU organs are still in the process of charting the future EU-wide investment treaty policy. (See Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 32.) What may nevertheless be observed is that no EU document has yet been issued endorsing the *Maffezini* approach or suggesting its incorporation into EU policy.\n\n276.\n\nIt is striking that these statements by Argentina, Panama, Colombia, the DR-CAFTA countries (including the US465), the EU Commission, and Switzerland (the latter three together representing a majority of the world's highly developed and capital exporting countries) all converge in signaling that the specified MFN clauses do not, and were never intended to, reach the international dispute resolution provisions of the respectively mentioned investment agreements. By contrast there have been no known clarifications issued in which states have embraced the *Maffezini* holding.466\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the United States recently concluded a review of its 2004 Model BIT. As part of that process, the US State Department commissioned an expert report from the Advisory Committee on International Economic Policy. A sub-group of the Committee members addressed the question of the scope of application of the Model BIT's MFN clause and recommended that the BIT be revised so as to clarify that the MFN commitment does not extend to any international commitments - whether substantive or procedural - undertaken by the United States in its treaties with third countries. (See Report of the Advisory Committee on International Economic Policy Regarding the Model Bilateral Investment Treaty, presented to the Department of State, 30 Sep 2009, Annex B: Particular Viewpoints of Subcommittee Members, Collective Statement from Sara Anderson, Linda Andros et al, Part III, Recommendation 5, available at: http://www.state.gov/e/eeb/rls/othr/2009/131118.htm#1.) The newly released US Model BIT of 2012, however, includes no new provisions relevant to the proper interpretation of any MFN clauses as may in future appear in any new US treaties to be concluded subsequent to the adoption of the 2012 US Model BIT. It remains to be seen whether the US will adopt the same tactic of incorporating \"vanishing footnotes\" into its BIT negotiations as it has used when negotiating the investment chapters of its recent preferential trade agreements. In short, no conclusions as to the future state practice of the United States can yet be drawn. All one can say at present is that the US has chosen to disavow the *Maffezini* holding on at least one occasion.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion points to the UK-Bosnia BIT as an example of a post- **Maffezini** treaty which \"explicitly applies that BIT's MFN clause to that treaty's dispute settlement provisions\" (Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower at para 30). The UK-Bosnia BIT, however, does not appear to constitute a change in or clarification of the UK's policy, as it appears to have been based on a UK model BIT that was already in effect prior to **Maffezini**. The UK's distinctive and consistent policy thus does not imply an evolution in the general understanding shared by the majority of states comprising the international community.\n\n277.\n\nThe Dissenting Opinion attempts to turn all of this evidence on its head, arguing that the clarifications issued by some states in respect of particular treaties prove that the MFN clauses in all other treaties were in fact intended to extend to international investor-State dispute settlement provisions. This argument once again gets the default rules of public international law backwards. International law does not construe a State's silence as consent. Neither does it require states to run around disavowing the jurisdiction of international tribunals in order to avoid being ensnared by unanticipated jurisdictional tentacles every time a claimant invents a clever new argument. Each state's consent to submit to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal must be established on the basis of objective indicators. The fact that some States - including Argentina - have chosen to speak out against what they regard as errant rulings by certain investor-State arbitral tribunals provides no such indication here.\n\n278.\n\nIn sum, none of the treaty materials which the Tribunal has been able to examine in any way suggests that the Contracting State Parties to the German-Argentine BIT intended to include international dispute resolution within the purview of the MFN clauses' references to the Host State's treatment of investments within its territory. Nor do these materials authorize the Tribunal to interpret the MFN clauses of the German-Argentine BIT in an evolutive way so as to achieve the enlarged meaning desired by the Claimant. On the contrary, all of the relevant supplementary materials confirm the conclusion reached by the Tribunal on the basis of the Treaty's text.\n\n**l) The Dissenting Opinion and the Concurring Statement**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nJudge Brower has seen fit to append a Dissenting Opinion in which he disagrees with the Tribunal's MFN analysis in vivid terms. The Tribunal has carefully considered each of the points raised but has found that they fail to establish the consent of the Contracting State Parties to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal in the circumstances of the present case. Notwithstanding this disagreement, the Tribunal has greatly benefited from the exchange of views which has taken place among the Tribunal members in the course of the deliberations. The Tribunal expresses its sincere gratitude to Judge Brower for the technical precision which his criticisms have contributed to this Award.\n\n280.\n\nProfessor Bello Janeiro appends a Concurring Statement. He does so in order to explain his reasons for subscribing to this Award, the result of which differs from that of the earlier *Siemens* case, in which Professor Bello Janeiro also participated.\n\n***4. Summary of Tribunal's MFN analysis***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal's above analysis has led to the following conclusions:\n\n(1) The Claimant does not yet have standing to assert its claims under the German-Argentine BIT, because it has not yet satisfied the Treaty's Article 10 conditions precedent to invoke international arbitration. As such, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction at present to entertain the Claimant's MFN or any other claim.\n\n(2) The most-favored-nation clauses contained in Articles 3(1), 3(2), and 4(4) of the BIT do not alter this conclusion, as they do not authorize the Claimant to circumvent the conditions precedent to arbitration laid down in Article 10 of the BIT.\n\n(3) The Treaty's MFN guarantees do not presently apply in any event, as the Claimant has not shown that the dispute resolution process prescribed by Article 10 of the German-Argentine BIT is objectively less favorable to the Claimant than that of any comparator treaty.\n\n(4) The Claimant remains at liberty, however, upon satisfaction of the Treaty's conditions precedent to arbitration, to assert any retrospective MFN claims it may have in any future arbitration proceeding, including any claims relating to its treatment by Argentina pursuant to the Treaty's 18-month domestic courts proviso.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n283.\n\nEach disputing party has requested the Tribunal to assess the costs of these proceedings against the other party. The Tribunal sympathizes with the Claimant's request in respect of Argentina's first three jurisdictional objections. The first objection was patently groundless while the second and third objections largely repeated objections which Argentina has raised in myriad other cases - each time without success. Nevertheless, the Respondent's assertion of these objections in the context of the present proceedings cannot be said to have been vexatious, particularly considering that it chose to rest on its written pleadings without insisting upon any further discussion of the issues at the oral hearings.\n\n284.\n\nWith respect to the fourth and fifth objections, the analysis of these questions was difficult and complex. The fourth objection concerned a question that is novel in ICSID jurisdictional practice, while the fifth concerned a point on which the existing jurisprudence is dramatically split. Both parties presented sound legal arguments, and each side ultimately prevailed on some points but failed on others.\n\n285.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal finds it appropriate for the costs of the arbitration to be split evenly between the parties, with each side bearing its own legal costs.\n\n**VIII.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nPursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on December 20, 2012, Daimler Financial Services AG filed an application requesting the partial annulment of the Award issued on August 22, 2012 by an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President), Judge Charles N. Brower, and Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro, in the arbitration between Daimler Financial Services AG and the Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1) (hereinafter referred to as the \"Award\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicant is Daimler Financial Services AG and is hereinafter referred to as \"Daimler\" or the \"Applicant\".\n\n3.\n\nThe Applicant is a company incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Argentine Republic and is hereinafter referred to as \"Argentina\" or the \"Respondent.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Applicant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (ii).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn December 20, 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") received from Daimler an application for partial annulment of the Award (hereinafter the \"Application\").\n\n7.\n\nOn December 27, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application in accordance with Rule 50(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules and notified the Parties of the registration pursuant to Arbitration Rule 50(2)(b). In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that in accordance with Rule 52(1) of the Arbitration Rules, she would request that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appoint the members of the *ad hoc* committee that would consider the Application as stipulated by Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nOn February 25, 2013, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that ICSID was proceeding to recommend to the Chairman of the Administrative Council the appointment of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia, Judge Florentino Feliciano, a national of the Philippines, and Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, a national of Pakistan.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n10.\n\nThe Committee is composed of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, Chairman of the Committee, Judge Florentino Feliciano and Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, the Parties submitted their Joint Procedural Agreement.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 30, 2013, the Committee acknowledged receipt of the Joint Procedural Agreement. The Committee noted that the Parties had agreed on all points of the agenda and that there were no further points for discussion. Therefore, and provided the Parties did not agree otherwise, the first session with the Parties would be cancelled.\n\n13.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, the Committee informed the Parties that it had held a first session on May 2, 2013 and agreed to the Parties\u2019 Joint Procedural Agreement. In their Joint Procedural Agreement, the Parties confirmed that the Members of the Committee had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish and that the place of proceedings would be the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.\n\n14.\n\nAs agreed in the Parties\u2019 Joint Procedural Agreement, the Applicant filed a Memorial on annulment on July 31, 2013; the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on annulment on November 18, 2013; the Applicant filed a Reply on annulment on January 23, 2014; and the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on annulment on April 7, 2014. Translations of each of these submissions into the other procedural language were submitted by the Parties pursuant to the Joint Procedural Agreement.\n\n15.\n\nA hearing on annulment took place at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on July 14 and 15, 2014. In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, present at the hearing were:\n\nFor the Applicant:\n\nMr. Paolo Di Rosa Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMr. John Bellinger III Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMs. Nancy Perkins Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMs. Mallory Silberman Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMr. Brian Bombassaro Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMr. Kelby Ballena Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMs. Ana Pirnia Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMr. Bernd Fritzinger Daimler Financial Services AG\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\nDr. Javier Pargament Subprocurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDr. Carlos Mihanovich Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDr. Gabriel Bottini\n\nDr. Mariana Lozza Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDr. Silvina Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDr. Juli\u00e1n Negro Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDr. Sebasti\u00e1n A. Green Mart\u00ednez Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDra. Lucila Miranda Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDra. Magdalena Gasparini Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\n16.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on December 5, 2014, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38.\n\n17.\n\nThe Committee has conducted its deliberations in person and by various modes of communication among its members and in issuing this Decision on Annulment has taken into account all written submissions and oral arguments of the Parties.\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES AND THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS ON THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nDaimler seeks partial annulment of the Award on the basis that: (a) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based, contrary to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention; (b) the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention; and (c) the Tribunal committed serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure, in violation of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.1\n\nMem. \u00b6 110.\n\n19.\n\nArgentina argues that Daimler\u2019s request for partial annulment manifestly lacks legal merit as is evident from the fact that the sole basis for Daimler\u2019s request is its disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation in relation to the MFN clauses. Furthermore, even if the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation were incorrect, it would not warrant annulment under the ICSID Convention.2\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 2.\n\n20.\n\nThis section addresses the submissions of the Parties on the three grounds of annulment invoked by Daimler and provides a summary of the claims and reliefs sought by each Party. The Committee\u2019s analysis on each of these grounds for annulment is included after the summary on the position of the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nThe Committee has carefully reviewed all claims, reasoning, documents and legal authorities submitted by the Parties, and the fact that a reasoning, document or legal authority is not cited or referred to in the summary does not mean that the Committee has not considered the same.\n\n**A. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS - ARTICLE 52(1)(E)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Standard**\n-------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n22.\n\nDaimler argues that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based regarding the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the applicability of the BIT\u2019s MFN clause to bypass the 18-month domestic court litigation requirement stipulated in the BIT.3 According to Daimler, the Award suffers from *\"lacunae,* contradictory reasons and a failure to explain the reasoning on key issues.\"4\n\nMem. \u00b6 111.\n\nMem. \u00b6 111.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Parties agree on the following: a failure to state reasons might result from the omission of reasons or from contradictory reasons; a tribunal\u2019s failure to \"deal with every question presented\" or to reach a majority decision on such questions is a failure to state reasons; and a failure to state reasons, on a point logically necessary for the tribunal\u2019s decision, must leave the decision essentially lacking in any expressed rationale.5\n\nReply \u00b6 5.\n\n24.\n\nHowever, Daimler states that the Parties disagree on a number of points. Even though the standard under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is a failure to state \"reasons\", Argentina proposes a different standard based on whether \"decisions\" were made by the Tribunal.6 This is evident in Argentina\u2019s claims that the Tribunal analysed the Parties\u2019 positions and took decisions on all questions put forward.7 Yet, according to Daimler, \"analyzing\" and \"deciding\" all questions is not sufficient to escape annulment because the tribunal must explain why it reached its conclusions in order to fulfill the purpose of Article 52(1)(e).8 A tribunal must \"show its work\" by guiding the reader through logical steps that lead to a conclusion. If one of the steps is missing, then the decision is not capable of leading the reader from \"Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion\" and the award must be annulled.9 Daimler argues that its position has been confirmed in the *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* v. *Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4) *(\"'MINE'\u2019)* and *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7) (\"*Soufraki\u2019'\u2019)* decisions on annulment.10\n\nReply \u00b6 6.\n\nReply \u00b6 6.\n\nReply \u00b6 7.\n\nMem. \u00b6 116; Reply \u00b6 7.\n\nReply \u00b6 8.\n\n25.\n\nAccordingly, Daimler argues, the Committee must review each pivotal or outcome-determinative point that serves as a link in the logical chain of the Award\u2019s premises and conclusions, and determine whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons or stated contradictory reasons on each of these points.11\n\nReply \u00b6 9.\n\n26.\n\nDaimler submits that the Award should be annulled because of failure to state reasons, given (1) a failure to reach a majority decision on each question submitted and (2) the existence of inconsistencies in the Award\u2019s findings concerning the BIT\u2019s 18-month clause and the scope of the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Argentina, it is clear that Daimler has fully understood the Tribunal\u2019s analysis and reasons for declining jurisdiction as can been seen from the arguments in its Memorial.12 The weakness in Daimler\u2019s arguments is further evidenced in its acknowledgement that the BIT requires submission of its dispute to local courts and that it failed to meet this requirement. Yet, it argued that in spite of this, the Tribunal was not mandated to apply the 18-month clause by virtue of the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses.13 It is clear in the Award that the Tribunal analyzed each party\u2019s position and ultimately disagreed with Daimler\u2019s position on the MFN clauses.14 Moreover, Daimler has admitted that the majority took into consideration the positions of both Parties and based its interpretation on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\").15 Argentina states that the Tribunal neither failed to exercise its jurisdiction nor to state the reasons on which its decision was based.16 This is also true of the application of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation to the facts of the case in relation to the failure to satisfy the prior recourse to local courts requirement and the alleged futility of such recourse.17\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 4.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 5.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 10.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 11.\n\n28.\n\nArgentina argues that a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is warranted in circumstances where \"two *genuinely* contradictory reasons cancel each other out\", which is not the case here.18 Additionally, in order for an award to be annulled on the basis of failure to state reasons, the omission has to be pivotal to the outcome of the case and, as such, two conditions must be met: i) the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any express rationale and, ii) that point must be logically necessary for sustaining the tribunal\u2019s decision.19 Daimler invokes four alleged contradictions but it has not explained how they would affect the outcome of the Award.20\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 53.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b654, citing the *ad hoc* committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) (\"*Vivendi I*\").\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, \u00b6 75.\n\n**2. Failure to reach a majority decision on each question submitted**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAccording to Daimler, as per Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal must decide each question by a majority of votes and, pursuant to Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the award must deal with each question submitted and provide a statement of reasons.21 Daimler states that a necessary predicate to the notion of \"dealing with a question\" is that the majority of the tribunal has reached a consensus decision on such question.22 As such, it is possible for a tribunal to fail to deal with every question by failing to reach a majority decision on such question.23\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\nMem. \u00b6 114.\n\nMem. \u00b6 114.\n\n30.\n\nDaimler argues that a very small number of ICSID cases feature separate opinions by more than one arbitrator and in the instances where this is the case, the *ad hoc* committees must look carefully at the reasoning provided by each arbitrator to determine whether each question has been decided by a majority of the tribunal.24 If there is different reasoning on outcome-determinative issues, then a majority is not reached on such issues and the requirement of Article 48(1) is not satisfied.25 This may be a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) if the parties are unable to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal from \"Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion\"26. In addition, annulment can also be ordered if there is a complete absence of reasoning. This takes place by an omission to state reasons or by reasons, which are contradictory.27\n\nMem. \u00b6 115.\n\nMem. \u00b6 115.\n\nMem. \u00b6 116.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 117-118, also citing the *ad hoc* committee in *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2) *(\"Pey Casado\").*\n\n31.\n\nIn this vein, Daimler argues that the Committee must take Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s Separate Opinion into account for the purpose of following the Award\u2019s reasoning and thus determining if there was a failure to state reasons.28\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 66:12-71:12.\n\n32.\n\nDaimler argues that although all three arbitrators in the *Daimler* case signed the Award, the act of signature itself is insufficient to establish that there was a majority on all questions presented.29 This is evidenced by Judge Brower\u2019s Dissenting Opinion disagreeing with the Award\u2019s determination on the MFN issue and Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s divergence of conclusions and reasoning in his Separate Opinion.30\n\nMem. \u00b6 121.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, Daimler states that it seems that the Award reflects the reasons and conclusions of only the President of the Tribunal.31 As acknowledged in the Award, it reproduces in large part the reasoning in an award of a different case that shared the same President.32 This aspect is even more significant because the analysis that the Award reproduced was critical to the outcome in this case: defining the principles of treaty interpretation that would apply to the MFN issue.33 The gravity of the situation is further compounded because the *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited* v. *Argentine Republic (\"ICS\")* award was issued in another case, conducted under a different set of rules and under a different Bilateral Investment Treaty.34\n\nMem. \u00b6 123.\n\nMem. \u00b6 123.\n\nMem. \u00b6 124.\n\nMem. \u00b6 125.\n\n34.\n\nDaimler argues that another manifestation that the Award does not reflect the majority opinion was Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s recognition in his Separate Opinion that he was subscribing or adhering to the President\u2019s conclusions.35 This admission further suggests that the Tribunal failed to abide by its obligation to render an Award, which enables the reader to determine the reasons of the Tribunal, and not those of each individual member, on each question presented.36\n\nMem \u00b6 127.\n\nMem. \u00b6 128.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the crucial part of the Award turns mainly on the meaning of \"treatment\" in the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses. Interpreting this word in the context of the VCLT, the Award adopts a two pronged approach in that it 1) ascertains the intention of the State Parties to the BIT, and 2) applies the principle of contemporaneity. The Tribunal then determined whether its conclusion represents the Parties\u2019 intention at the time the BIT was negotiated.37 A failure of the majority to decide and deal with these questions amounts to a gap in the logic of the Award.38\n\nMem. \u00b6 129.\n\nMem. \u00b6 130.\n\n36.\n\nContrary to the conclusion in the Award that the World Bank Guidelines shed light on the word \"treatment\" but are not determinative, Professor Bello Janeiro in his Separate Opinion considers these Guidelines as determinative.39 The Award discusses other textual evidence to discern the meaning of \"treatment\" but, according to Daimler, this is not the approach of the majority because Professor Bello Janeiro contradicts this analysis and bases his conclusions on the World Bank Guidelines, without referring to other evidence of contemporaneous understanding of State Parties to the BIT.40 Daimler argues that this divergence of views makes it impossible to confirm either that a majority decision was reached with respect to each element of the standard determined to be applicable by the Award or to follow the majority\u2019s reasoning on each key point.41\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 131-132.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 134-136.\n\nMem. \u00b6 137.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to Daimler, if an arbitrator\u2019s signature alone were sufficient to establish his agreement with the award and its reasoning, Judge Brower\u2019s signature on the Award would have meant that he accepted the discussion of the MFN issue, which he expressly stated in his Dissenting Opinion that he did not.42 Consequently, Argentina\u2019s argument in this respect is incorrect. Daimler argues that the two cases before the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") that Argentina relies on, dealt with different questions, which are not before this Committee.43\n\nReply \u00b611.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.\n\n38.\n\nIn the ICJ *Case Concerning the Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau* v. *Senegal) (\"Case Concerning the Award of 1989\")* the question before the ICJ was the validity of an individual\u2019s vote and its effect on the existence of the award.44 Daimler states that it is not questioning the validity of the Tribunal members\u2019 votes, but whether the Award must be annulled for failing to fulfill the requirements in Article 48 of the ICSID Convention.45 Similarly, the *Advisory Opinion on Application for review of Judgment No. 333 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal (\"Review of Judgment No. 333 Opinion\")* does not address any claims regarding the failure to state reasons. However, Daimler continues, this case does give some guidance on the relevance of separate opinions under international law, which need to be taken into account in order to interpret or elucidate a judgment.46 The ICJ decisions relied on by Argentina actually favor a close review by the Committee of Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s Opinion, which is in line with the conclusion in the *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1) *(\"Amco I\")* decision, that committees in ICSID cases must examine what the tribunal had said it was doing and what it was in fact doing to resolve a question.47\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nReply \u00b6 12.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\nReply \u00b6 16.\n\n39.\n\nSimilarly, the *Granite State Machine Co. Inc* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran et al48* award from the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal cited by Argentina supports Argentina\u2019s submission in respect of the validity or existence of the award, which is distinct from the question of whether reasons in a concurring opinion, which contradict the award, warrant annulment.49 This is consistent with the views of Judge Schwebel, who, citing the same authorities that Argentina refers to, stated that an arbitrator who expresses views at variance with his vote might prejudice the execution of the award and this prejudice could include annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.50 Daimler argues that in light of this, the existence of an award or the validity of an arbitrator\u2019s vote in favor of the *dispositif* does not preclude that a separate statement of reasons might lead to the annulment of the award.51 In this case, according to Daimler, Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s Opinion contradicts the Award in several material aspects and thus nullity is required.52\n\n*Granite State Machine Co. Inc.* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran et al..* Award No. 18-30-3, dated 15 December 1982, *Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports,* vol. 1, at 442\n\nReply \u00b6 17.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\nReply \u00b6 19.\n\nReply \u00b619.\n\n40.\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments with regard to the contents of the Separate Opinion fail to rebut Daimler\u2019s argument that the substance of the Separate Opinion is important to the Committee\u2019s task under Article 52(1)(e).53 Daimler argues that, contrary to Argentina\u2019s contention, the Committee must examine Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s Opinion, which ostensibly states that he fully subscribes to the Award but which actually contradicts it on two outcome-determinative questions that the Tribunal had to decide. The first concerned the Contracting State Parties\u2019 intentions at the time of negotiating the BIT and, the second concerned the principle of contemporaneity.54\n\nReply \u00b6 20.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to Daimler, on the first point the Award found that certain material was not direct evidence of the intention of the State Parties to the BIT, whereas Professor Bello Janeiro found this material decisive. This is evident in the different treatment of the World Bank Guidelines in the Award and the Separate Opinion.55 On the second point regarding the principle of contemporaneity, Daimler argues that the Award considers decisions of other investor-State tribunals, made subsequent to the execution of the BIT, as \"inadequate for the purposes of assessing the Parties\u2019 understanding of particular BIT terms\".56 Yet, Professor Bello Janeiro lists the evolution in investor-State arbitration as \"decisive\" and \"most important\" to his reasoning. Moreover, the three most important reasons that he gives are based on legal materials that the Award rejects.57 A review of what Professor Bello Janeiro said he would do and what he actually did shows a clear contradiction on the same issues between his reasons and those in the Award.58 Furthermore, Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s contradictory reasons and his reliance on authorities not cited by or which the Parties had an opportunity to address or explain was unfair to Daimler.59\n\nReply \u00b6 23.\n\nReply \u00b6 24.\n\nReply \u00b6 25.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nReply\u00b627.\n\n42.\n\nDaimler states that Argentina\u2019s argument to the effect that it wasn\u2019t necessary for Professor Bello Janeiro to refer to all arguments in the Award is inapplicable. Indeed, Professor Bello Janeiro refers to certain sections of the Award before proceeding to give contradictory reasoning.60 Argentina\u2019s defence that Professor Bello Janeiro wrote his Separate Opinion to explain his \"change of heart\" since the *Siemens A.G.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8) *(\"Siemens\")* case, is unresponsive. Whatever Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s motivations were, his Separate Opinion articulates his reasons for concurring in the Award\u2019s findings, and these reasons are contradictory to those set forth in the Award.61\n\nReply \u00b6 28.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n43.\n\nWith regard to the Award\u2019s \"importation\" of the analysis in the *ICS* case, Daimler states that this shows that the deliberative process was not undertaken, or critical determinations were not made, by a majority of the Tribunal as required by the ICSID rules.62 According to Daimler, Argentina\u2019s defense of the \"Tribunal President\u2019s recycling of the analysis from *ICS\"63* misses the point that Daimler made: that the \"President\u2019s copy/paste exercise reflects a failure by *this* Tribunal to agree on a single line of reasoning for the Award\u2019s conclusion on the issue of the 18-month and MFN clauses\".64\n\nReply \u00b6 30.\n\nReply \u00b6 33\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Argentina, there is no \"divergence of views\" between the two majority arbitrators and, even if there were, it would not affect the validity of the Award.65 Firstly, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 47(3), an arbitrator may \"attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not\". It would be futile for an arbitrator to attach a concurring opinion if it did not say anything different from what was stated in the award, provided that this arbitrator supports the decision made in the award.66 Secondly, Argentina argues that Professor Bello Janeiro stated that he was attaching an individual opinion to explain his position, which differed from his position in the *Siemens* case.67 Thus, the reasons in the Separate Opinion have a different function from those of the Award.68 Moreover, it was recognized in Daimler\u2019s Memorial, and also by Judge Brower, that Professor Bello Janeiro joined the President to form the majority.69 According to Argentina, it was only natural for Professor Bello Janeiro to include in his opinion points that only concerned him.70\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 12; Hearing on Annulment,Tr, 147:17 - 150:1.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 14.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 15.\n\nRej. \u00b6 22.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16\n\nC-Mem. \u00b616.\n\n45.\n\nDaimler\u2019s argument that, by his own admission, Professor Bello Janeiro merely adhered to the conclusions of the Tribunal\u2019s President shows its lack of understanding of Arbitration Rule 14(1), which envisages that the President of the Tribunal take a leading role in the deliberations.71 Additionally, Argentina argues, deliberations are secret and subject to no regulations and as such they can be conducted as arbitrators see fit. In fact, Judge Brower\u2019s harshly critical opinion does not maintain that the deliberations were conducted in violation of any rule or principle.72\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 17.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b618.\n\n46.\n\nArgentina argues that the Award is well founded and Daimler\u2019s grounds for seeking partial annulment are inadequate. In this regard, Argentina refers to the decision of the committee in *Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) *(\"Azurix*\"), which held that this ground for annulment only applies in a clear case of a tribunal failing to state reasons.73 Additionally, the *Azurix* committee, citing the decision by an *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi I,* observed that Article 52(1)(e) concerns the failure to state reasons and not \"the failure to state correct or convincing reasons\".74 According to Argentina, in the case at hand, there was a majority on each question, the Tribunal gave a decision on each question, the reader can follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and all three members of the Tribunal signed the Award.75\n\nC-Mem. \u00b63l.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b63l, citing the *Azurix* Decision on Annulment at \u00b6 55.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 33.\n\n47.\n\nContrary to Daimler\u2019s claims, the Tribunal reached a majority decision on both questions *i.e.,* the 18-month wait clause and the MFN clause, with Professor Bello Janeiro voting in favor of the Award\u2019s conclusions and explaining \"his reasons for subscribing to the Award\".76 According to Argentina, in this context, which Tribunal member proposed the terms of the Award is merely anecdotic. What is important is that the decision was by a majority, as was the case here when Professor Bello Janeiro voted in favor of the decision contained in the Award and its grounds regarding each of the Parties\u2019 claims.77 In fact, ICJ jurisprudence78 supports the view that even if Professor Bello Janeiro had expressed an opinion different from the Award or had expressed preference for a different solution, the decision in the Award that he voted for would have been sustained.79 This has also been confirmed by the jurisprudence of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.80\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n*Case Concerning the Award of 1989; Review of Judgment No. 333 Opinion.*\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 38-42\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 43.\n\n48.\n\nArgentina argues that contrary to Daimler\u2019s allegations, there is nothing incorrect or inappropriate about the Award referring to the *ICS* decision. The reason it makes this reference is because both cases share the same President, who did not want to burden the parties \"with duplicative drafting costs in respect of certain general points of law common to both cases\"81. According to Argentina, it is common practice for tribunals to transcribe parts of other awards they agree with and consider applicable.82 The fact that the *ICS* case was an UNCITRAL case brought under a different Bilateral Investment Treaty is irrelevant as the Tribunal referred to it with regard to a question that applied *mutatis mutandi* to this case. Accepting Daimler\u2019s argument would lead to the \"absurd situation\" that tribunals could only refer to case-law based on the same treaty and originating from the same tribunal.83\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 44, citing Award, footnote 303.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 44.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 45.\n\n49.\n\nAs regards the Award\u2019s interpretation of the term \"treatment\", Argentina states that paragraph 224 of the Award, referring to the use of the World Bank Guidelines, clearly indicates that they were taken into account \"not as outcome-determinative evidence *per se* but \u2018as an indication of the prevailing view among the community of states during the period contemporaneous to the adoption of the Germ an-Argentine BIT\u2019\".84 Argentina refutes Daimler\u2019s assertion that Professor Bello Janeiro seems to contradict the Award\u2019s reference to the Guidelines. The Award was clear in its reference to these Guidelines and Professor Bello Janeiro had no need to repeat all that was stated in the Award.85\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 47.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 48.\n\n50.\n\nWith regard to Daimler\u2019s claim that Professor Bello Janeiro failed to cite any evidence as to \"the contemporaneous understanding of the State Parties to the BIT\", Argentina argues that he had no reason to do so because an arbitrator is not obligated to attach an individual opinion.86 In fact, the ICJ has found that the content of a separate opinion or statement is of no consequence to a tribunal\u2019s decision. The fact that subsequent decisions to the *Siemens* case have led arbitrator Bello Janeiro to review his position on the applicability of the MFN clause does not nullify the decision adopted by the majority.87\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 49.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\n51.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina argues that Daimler devotes several paragraphs of its Reply to the need for the Tribunal to explain the process of its analysis. This argument is futile because Argentina has already showed that the Tribunal stated reasons for its decisions on each issue submitted in connection with the 18-month period and the MFN clauses, which can be followed easily by any reader.88 The *MINE* decision supports its arguments because that committee rejected the request for annulment on the grounds of contradictions in the award, clarifying that it was not necessary to state reasons for \"truly obvious issues from which it drew no conclusions\".89 The *Caratube International Oil Company LLP* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12) *(\"Caratube\")* committee held that only contradictory or frivolous reasons could be equated to a failure to state reasons. Daimler has failed to prove that the reasons given by the Tribunal were either contradictory or not well founded.90\n\nRej. \u00b6 8.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n52.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler continues to distort its position in the Reply. Argentina did not state that arbitrator Bello Janeiro gave contradictory reasons. It posed a hypothetical and subsidiary argument on \"the meaning of the majority opinion in an award and the value of separate opinions\".91 Additionally, it did not state that the Committee should limit itself to the verification of whether or not an arbitrator signed the Award. Indeed, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee must determine whether an award has stated the reasons on which it is based.92\n\nRej. \u00b6 13.\n\nRej.\u00b614.\n\n53.\n\nDaimler failed to support with jurisprudence this ground for annulment, whereas Argentina referred to ICJ jurisprudence for the proposition that an award issued by a majority with a separate or individual opinion is valid.93 This lack of reference to jurisprudence by Daimler is due to the fact that the jurisprudence suggests that even if there were contradictions between statements in the award and an individual opinion, the arbitrator\u2019s decision in the award will prevail.94 As to Daimler\u2019s citation of the ICJ\u2019s *Review of Judgement No. 333 Opinion* regarding the consideration of individual opinions, Argentina emphasises that whatever the position is under general international law, pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee must determine whether *\"the award* has stated the reasons on which it is based.\"95\n\nRej.\u00b615.\n\nRej. \u00b6I6.\n\nRej.\u00b617.\n\n54.\n\nIn this case, the Award can be understood and is well founded thereby precluding the need to refer to explanations in the individual opinions.96 Judge Schwebel, whom Daimler quotes, is of the opinion that even if an arbitrator expresses strong disagreement, \"his vote will stand anyway\". This is not the case here, as arbitrator Bello Janeiro did not disagree with the Award.97\n\nRej. \u00b6 18.\n\nRej.\u00b619.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina further argues that the Tribunal reached a majority on the 18-month and the MFN clauses, and it took account of the World Bank Guidelines as an indication of the prevailing view of the community of states at the time the BIT was adopted, not as determinative evidence.98 Arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s Opinion adds additional grounds and does not alter the decision made jointly with the President.99 Moreover, the reasons stated in his Separate Opinion had a different role than those reasons set forth by the Tribunal as grounds for the Award;100 Professor Bello Janeiro never argued against the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the World Bank Guidelines do not intend to directly clarify a term of the BIT.101 In his Opinion, Professor Bello Janeiro merely clarified that he considered the MFN issue the most important part of the Award. Both the Opinion and the Award refer to the meaning given to the term \"treatment\" at the time of the conclusion of the BIT, and arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s reference to more recent case law does not alter the analysis in the Award.102\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nRej. \u00b6 22.\n\nRej. \u00b6 22.\n\nRej. \u00b6 25.\n\nRej.\u00b625.\n\n56.\n\nIn arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s view, the World Bank Guidelines confirm that at the time of the BIT\u2019s conclusion, \"treatment\" of investments and dispute settlement were different issues and the Award conveys the same. His emphasis on the Guidelines is of no relevance because what matters is that the majority considered it a \"due\" that, together with other elements, allowed the majority to reach its conclusion.103 Moreover, under international law there are no binding precedents and as such arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s references to other case law is of no compelling consequence.104\n\nRej. \u00b6 26.\n\nRej. \u00b6 27.\n\n57.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler\u2019s argument on the transcription of the *ICS* decision is a *non-sequitur.* The fact that the Tribunal transcribed some paragraphs of another award in this Award does not mean that the reasons so transcribed were not discussed. Given the secret nature of deliberations, the Parties may not have had knowledge of them. As such, the logical conclusion would be that all paragraphs in the Award, including those taken from the *ICS* award, were discussed by the three arbitrators and two arbitrators agreed to form the majority. Nothing in the Award or in the Opinions leads to a different conclusion.105\n\nRej. \u00b6 28.\n\n**3. The Award is Internally Inconsistent in its Findings Concerning the BIT\u2019S 18-month Clause and the Scope of the BIT\u2019S MFN Clauses**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Award is inconsistent in its treatment of the 18-month clause and of the scope of the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses. First, Daimler contends that the Award invokes contradictory reasons regarding the nature of the BIT\u2019s 18-month clause. In this regard, Daimler explains that the Award contradicts itself by saying in one paragraph that the 18-month clause cannot be waived as a condition of Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate, and in another paragraph that it can be waived under certain circumstances.106 Daimler argues that pre-arbitration requirements can be either mandatory or permissive. Mandatory requirements are \"conditions of consent\", which are jurisdictional in nature and must be fulfilled. Permissive requirements can be, and have been, disregarded by a tribunal for various reasons.107 The Award contradictorily treats the 18-month requirement as both mandatory and permissive by first concluding that it cannot be bypassed or waived by the Tribunal, and subsequently concluding that the clause can be waived in certain circumstances.108\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 139-142.\n\nReply \u00b6 36.\n\nReply \u00b6 37.\n\n59.\n\nThe two scenarios described by Argentina to explain the contradictions outlined by Daimler are not different: if the 18-month clause is jurisdictional (mandatory) it cannot be bypassed; but if it is a procedural requirement (permissive), it could be waived by the Tribunal.109 Daimler argues that the Tribunal\u2019s findings in paragraphs 192 and 193 of the Award that the 18-month clause was jurisdictional, cannot be reconciled with its findings a few paragraphs later that it could be waived if complying with the 18-month clause was deemed futile. Daimler states that this contradiction leaves the Award \"essentially lacking in any express rationale\".110\n\nReply \u00b6 38.\n\nReply \u00b6 38.\n\n60.\n\nDaimler further argues that the Award is contradictory on whether the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses reflect the Contracting States\u2019 intention to allow the MFN clauses to be invoked in order to overcome the Treaty\u2019s conditions precedent to accessing international arbitration.111 In its analysis the Award looks to the expression treatment \"in the territory\" found in the MFN clauses to determine the intention of the Contracting States. The Award states that if the MFN clause applies to \"treatment in the territory of the Host State\", treatment that is outside the territory of the host State cannot be covered.112 It then concludes that while litigating before the domestic courts - as required by the 18-month clause - constitutes treatment within Argentina, resorting to international arbitration does not constitute treatment within the territory because it occurs, by definition, outside the host State.113 Since the right to invoke international arbitration does not implicate \"treatment in the territory\", the Award concludes that Daimler could not rely upon the MFN clause in order to bypass the 18-month requirement.114 However, this conclusion is contradicted in the Award\u2019s comparison of the dispute resolution clauses contained in the Argentina-Chile and Argentina-Germany BITs when it states that Argentina could violate the MFN provision by requiring Daimler to litigate its dispute in local courts, which constitutes treatment within Argentina, and not requiring the same of Chilean investors.115 According to Daimler, this contradictory reasoning, \"seriously affects the coherence of the Award\".116\n\nMem. \u00b6 144.\n\nMem, \u00b6 146.\n\nMem. \u00b6 147.\n\nMem. \u00b6 149.\n\nMem. \u00b6 148.\n\nMem. \u00b6 151.\n\n61.\n\nIn Daimler\u2019s views, Argentina\u2019s defense that these contradictions should be accepted by the Committee because they appear in the section of the Award that is *dicta,* fails. Contradictory reasons cancel each other out and warrant annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention whether or not they are in the operative part of the award, because this Article does not limit its coverage to sections of the Award \"its author (or defender) considers operative\".117\n\nReply \u00b6 45.\n\n62.\n\nDaimler also argues that the Award suffers from further contradictory reasons in its analysis of the Tribunal\u2019s authority to address the MFN claim. In analyzing such claim, the Tribunal first conveyed that the MFN clause may confer the Tribunal with jurisdiction to hear the case, but then asserted that Daimler had no standing to invoke the MFN clauses because it had not satisfied the 18-month domestic litigation requirement.118 Contrary to Argentina\u2019s contentions, the use of the term \"unless\" in paragraph 200 of the Award underscores the circularity of the Award\u2019s reasoning because it implies that the Tribunal does not have the power to review the MFN clause, unless the MFN clause itself confers such power on the Tribunal.119 Furthermore, this contradiction would not be in favor of Daimler because the Tribunal declined jurisdiction as a result of the conflicting reasons.120\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 152-154; Reply \u00b6 46.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\nReply \u00b6 49.\n\n63.\n\nFinally, Daimler claims that the Award contradicts itself by holding that the BIT\u2019s 18-month clause did not accord German investors less favorable treatment than Chilean investors, whose BIT does not have such a clause, but then concluding that requiring German investors to fruitlessly spend time and resources in Argentine courts while exempting Chilean investors from such requirement, \"could be viewed as discriminatory impairment of the German investors\u2019 rights\".121 Daimler argues that Argentina\u2019s claim that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on \"more favorable treatment\" is not comparable with its reasoning on \"a discriminatory impairment\" is a position of \"willful blindness\"122. According to Daimler, these two concepts overlap and their treatment in different sections of the BIT does not alter this overlap.123\n\nMem. \u00b6 155.\n\nReply \u00b6 52.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 50-53.\n\n64.\n\nIn its Reply, Daimler argues that Argentina\u2019s statement that it did not prove how the alleged contradictions would affect the outcome of the Award, reflects three critical errors: i) it premises its counter-arguments on an improperly narrow understanding of the term \"question\"; ii) it overlooks the fact that reasons that conflict cancel each other out whether or not one of them appears in *dicta,* and iii) it describes an improperly heightened burden of proof.124\n\nReply\u00b654.\n\n65.\n\nDaimler argues that previous committees have explained in the context of a \"serious departure\" under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, that an applicant cannot be required to prove that the tribunal would have reached a different conclusion. The standard is focused on \"the steps that comprise the award\u2019s \u2018logical chain\u2019, from premise to conclusion\".125 According to Daimler, the Award bases its decision to decline jurisdiction on four preliminary conclusions that are contradictory and cannot stand. Even a single contradiction would leave the Award lacking in rationale and collapse its foundation. If the majority had dealt with any of them, it might have reached a different conclusion.126\n\nReply \u00b6 55\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAs to the nature of the 18-month clause, Argentina argues that there are no contradictory reasons in the passages described by Daimler. The Tribunal stated in paragraph 194 that the 18-month clause could not be bypassed or waived by the Tribunal \"as a mere \u2018procedural\u2019 or \u2018admissibility-related\u2019 matter\", which leaves open potential exceptions for reasons other than those indicated by the Tribunal.127 As such, Argentina argues, in paragraph 190 of the Award the Tribunal examines the alleged futility argument invoked by Daimler as a potential exception to the 18-month provision and concludes that there was no such futility.128 Similarly, in paragraph 192 of the Award, the Tribunal examines a different hypothesis for bypassing the 18-month requirement to the effect that the requirement was merely procedural and not jurisdictional, granting the Tribunal discretionary power to observe or discard it, and concludes in paragraph 194 that it is not a procedural or admissibility-related matter.129 Thus, Argentina argues, there is no contradiction between the paragraphs Daimler cites because they analyse different scenarios. Moreover, there is no contradiction in regard to the nature of the 18-month clause since the Tribunal analyses the futility requirement as a possible exemption from compliance with this clause, which the Tribunal has described as a jurisdictional pre-requisite.130\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 58.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 59.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 60.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 61 131 Rej. \u00b6 33; \u00b636.\n\n67.\n\nIn this regard, Argentina further argues that the alleged contradiction asserted by Daimler is in reality a difference in judgement between Applicant and the Tribunal regarding the concepts of \"jurisdictional clause\" and \"procedural clause\".131 The Award concludes that a procedural requirement is one within the discretion of the Tribunal to observe or discard, and finds that the 18-month clause is not a procedural requirement. Further, the Award concludes that a jurisdictional requirement establishes the conditions under which a tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the consent of the parties.132 Yet there are exceptions to those conditions, such as futility, which was addressed in the Award ultimately concluding that there was no futility in this case.133\n\nRej. \u00b6 33; \u00b636.\n\nRej. \u00b6 35.\n\nRej.\u00b635.\n\n68.\n\nFurthermore, there are no contradictions in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the meaning of the term \"treatment in the territory\". According to Argentina, paragraphs 226 to 228 and footnote 402 cited by Daimler are not contradictory as they refer to the treatment afforded by Argentine national courts to Daimler within the context of \"treatment in the territory\", excluding international arbitration.134 Additionally, footnote 402 applies to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in the alternative of the requirement that the comparator treaty must be more favourable. In this regard, the Award itself states, \"that it is not necessary to examine the requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be more favorable\"135 and as such, even if there were a contradiction, it would not be \"outcome-determinative\".136\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 64.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 65.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 66.\n\n69.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina states that Daimler has changed the paragraphs that it considered contradictory in regard to the meaning of \"most-favoured nation treatment in the territory\", because it was unable to show the alleged contradictions. However, a plain reading of these paragraphs shows that there are no contradictions. The Award clearly distinguishes between extraterritorial dispute resolution and the actual treatment an investor receives in domestic courts.137\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\n70.\n\nArgentina argues that upon Applicant\u2019s own admission, to warrant annulment there must be genuinely contradictory reasons that leave the decision on a pivotal point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale138. Daimler has not explained how the alleged contradiction would affect the outcome of the Award.139 Argentina states that even if there were contradictions, these would not have an effect upon a pivotal or outcome-determinative point. This is so, because the portions of the Award referred to by Daimler belong to a section of the Award that contains a subsidiary analysis on the comparator treaty requirement, which was not necessary to the Tribunal\u2019s decision.140 In this regard, Argentina refers to the *Caratube* committee, which rejected an annulment application because it related to an issue that was incidental to and unnecessary for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.141\n\nRej. \u00b6 40.\n\nRej. \u00b6 40.\n\nRej. \u00b6 41.\n\nRej. \u00b6 42.\n\n71.\n\nAs to Daimler\u2019s argument on the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of its power to hear the MFN claim, Argentina argues that the Award is not contradictory. The Tribunal analyses two different bases for determining its jurisdiction, which is clear in the underlining of the term \"unless\" in paragraph 200 and items 1 and 2 of paragraph 281 of the Award. This is further clarified in footnote 355, which states that the Tribunal analyses its jurisdiction on two independent bases, namely Article 10 (the dispute resolution clause) and Articles 3 and 4 (the MFN clauses) of the BIT.142 According to Argentina, following the rationale of the Award, the Tribunal must first determine whether it has jurisdiction under the basic BIT, *i.e.* the Germany-Argentina BIT, to then settle a claim about the applicability of the MFN clauses. The Tribunal does so by first determining its jurisdiction under the dispute resolution clause of the BIT, concluding that it does not have jurisdiction because Daimler failed to fulfil the 18-month requirement. It then examines its potential basis for jurisdiction under the MFN clauses and, in this context the Tribunal considers the parties\u2019 arguments on the scope and meaning of the MFN clause in the BIT.143 According to Argentina, even if there were a contradiction, it would be in favor of Daimler because the MFN analysis considers the possibility of providing the Tribunal with jurisdiction to the advantage of Daimler.144\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 69; Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 70.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 71; Rej. \u00b6 47.\n\n72.\n\nSimilarly, with reference to Daimler\u2019s claim that the Award is contradictory on the issue of whether the 18-month clause grants less favorable treatment or not, Argentina states that the paragraph and footnote invoked by Daimler deal with different issues under different provisions of the BIT and, as such, cannot be contradictory.145 Paragraph 250 deals with treatment in the territory of the host State under the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses, whereas footnote 433 examines arbitrary or discriminatory treatment under Article 2(3) of the BIT.146 Additionally, the alleged contradiction is non-existent because footnotes 432 and 433 do not refer to the 18-month clause as a jurisdictional requirement, but to the actual treatment received by an investor in local courts after submitting its claims thereto. If such treatment were to put an investor in an unfavorable position, it could result in less favorable treatment according to the circumstances of the case.147\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 73; Rej. \u00b6 50.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 73; Rej. \u00b6 50.\n\nRej. \u00b6 51.\n\n73.\n\nAdditionally, even if there were contradictions they would not affect a \"pivotal or outcome-determinative point\" since the Award itself clarifies that it need not examine the requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be more favorable, because the wording of the MFN clauses do not allow agreement with Daimler\u2019s position.148\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 74; Rej. \u00b6 52.\n\n**4. The Committee\u2019s Analysis of the Alleged Failure to State Reasons**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Standard**\n--------------------\n\n74.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may be annulled if it has \"failed to state the reasons on which it is based\". Several *ad hoc* committees have observed that annulment under this ground requires that the tribunal has failed to comply with its obligation to render an award that allows readers to comprehend and follow its reasoning.149\n\nSee, *e.g.:* *MINE* \u00b6\u00b6 \u00b65.08-5.09; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egvpt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4) (\" *Wena\")* \u00b6 81 ; *Vivendi I,* \u00b664.\n\n75.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee, in the *MINE* annulment proceeding stated that:\n\n\"5.08 The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal\u2019s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. [...] 5.09 In the Committee\u2019s view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"150\n\nMINE \u00b6\u00b6 5.08-5.09.\n\n76.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention does not empower the Committee to review the merits of the case. Such a review would amount to an appeal which is not a remedy provided for in Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. As stated by the *Wena* annulment committee:\n\n\"79. The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in MINE, this ground for annulment refers to \u2018minimum requirement\u2019 only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If the Tribunal has given such sequence of reasons, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).151\n\n*Wena,\u00b6* 79 and 81.\n\n77.\n\nTwo tests must be satisfied before an *ad hoc* committee can annul an award based on contradictory reasons. First, the reasons must be genuinely contradictory in that they cancel each other out so as to amount to no reasons at all. Second, the point with regard to which these reasons are given is necessary for the tribunal\u2019s decision. In this regard the *Vivendi I* annulment committee observed:\n\n\"In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an ad hoc committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"152\n\n*Vivendi I,* \u00b6 65.\n\n78.\n\nTherefore, in reviewing the alleged contradictions, an *ad hoc* committee must be mindful of the fact that what sometimes may appear as a contradiction may be the result of a compromise reached by a collegiate body to reach a decision. In addition, in reviewing the apparent contradictions, the *ad hoc* committee should, to the extent possible and considering each case, prefer an interpretation which confirms an award\u2019s consistency as opposed to its alleged inner contradictions.153\n\nSee: *Vivendi I,* \u00b6 65 and *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14) *(\"CDC\"),* \u00b681.\n\n79.\n\nThe standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is, therefore, high. It does not permit an *ad hoc* committee to second guess the reasoning of the tribunal and that imposes on the applicant the burden of proving that the reasoning of the tribunal on a point that is essential for the outcome of the case was either absent, unintelligible, contradictory or frivolous. In order to succeed the Applicant must discharge this burden.\n\n**(ii) The Alleged Failure to Reach a Majority Decision on Each Question Submitted**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe issue posed to this Committee is whether, considering the scope and application of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention (and in particular sections 1 and 3 thereof), the Separate Opinion contradicts the Award and such contradiction results in a failure by the Tribunal to reach a majority decision on each question submitted by the Parties.\n\n81.\n\nArticle 48 of the ICSID Convention reads:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall decide questions by a majority of the votes of all its members.\n\n(2) The award of the Tribunal shall be in writing and shall be signed by the members of the Tribunal who voted for it. (3) The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based. (4) Any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his dissent. (5) The Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties.\"\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee will interpret Article 48 of the ICSID Convention following the provisions of the VCLT, particularly Articles 31 and 33. Article 48 of the ICSID Convention must, therefore, be read in good faith. Its words should be given their ordinary meaning, taking into account their context, and in the light of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention taken as a whole.154 The texts of the ICSID Convention in English, French and Spanish, (English and Spanish, are the languages of these proceedings) must be, insofar as possible, given identical meaning.155\n\nCf. VCLT, art. 31.\n\nCf. VCLT, art. 33.\n\n83.\n\nThe Parties do not seem to differ on the scope and interpretation of sections (2) and (4) of Article 48 as regards the Separate Opinion. Professor Bello Janeiro signed the Award and \"voted for it\" (section (2)), and he had the option of attaching an individual opinion, even when not dissenting from the majority (section 4).\n\n84.\n\nAs regards paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee observes that they use different language in addressing the issue of \"questions\" to be decided by the tribunal in the award that it drafts. Paragraph (1), in the English text, refers to *\"questions\"* which a tribunal shall *\"decide\"... \"by a majority of votes of its members\".* Paragraph (3) uses a different expression. It refers to *\"every question\".* The context is also different from paragraph (1). In paragraph (3) the requirement is different. The award is to *\"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based\"* In the Spanish version, paragraph (1) uses the words *\"todas las cuestiones\"* and paragraph (3) makes reference to *\"todas las pretensiones\"*,156 The French version uses, in paragraph (1) the expression *\"toute question,\"* while paragraph (3) refers to *\"tous les chefs de conclusions\",157*\n\nThe Spanish version of Article 48 reads: \"(1) El Tribunal *decidir\u00e1 todas las* cuestiones por mayor\u00eda de votos de todos sus miembros. (2) El laudo deber\u00e1 dictarse por escrito y llevar\u00e1 la firma de los miembros del Tribunal que hayan votado en su favor. (3) El laudo contendr\u00e1 *declaraci\u00f3n* sobre *todas las pretensiones* sometidas por las partes al Tribunal y ser\u00e1 motivado. (4) Los \u00e1rbitros podr\u00e1n formular un voto particular, est\u00e9no no de acuerdo con la mayor\u00eda, o manifestar su voto contrario si disienten de ella. (5) El Centro no publicar\u00e1 el laudo sin consentimiento de las partes.\" [Emphasis added].\n\nThe French version of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention reads: \"(1) Le Tribunal *statue* sur *toute question* \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des voix de tous ses membres. (2) La sentence est rendue par \u00e9crit; elle est sign\u00e9e par les membres du Tribunal qui se sont prononc\u00e9s en sa faveur. (3) La sentence doit *r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les chefs de conclusions* soumises au Tribunal et doit \u00eatre motiv\u00e9e. (4) Tout membre du Tribunal peut faire joindre \u00e0 la sentence soit son opinion particuli\u00e8re - qu\u2019il partage ou non l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 - soit la mention de son dissentiment. (5) Le Centre ne publie aucune sentence sans le consentement des parties.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n85.\n\nA reading of the aforementioned sections of Article 48 in English, French and Spanish, the three authoritative languages of the ICSID Convention leads the Committee to conclude that despite the ostensible similarity of the language in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 referring to \"questions\" to be addressed in the decision, these two paragraphs address two different issues and deal with different matters.\n\n86.\n\nArticle 48(1) generally refers to how the decision-making process of the tribunal must take place, and indicates that when the tribunal *\"decides\" \"questions\",* the decision must be supported by the vote of a majority of its members. In other words, any decision of the tribunal in the award on a question decided by it requires a majority \"vote\".\n\n87.\n\nArticle 48(3) refers to the tribunal\u2019s obligation to *\"deal with\" \"every question\"* submitted to it when rendering an *\"award\u2019.* The expression *\"every question\"* has not been defined by the ICSID Convention. All versions of the ICSID Convention ought to be given the same meaning.158 When read in conjunction with the Spanish and French versions of the ICSID Convention, it seems without doubt that the words *\"every question\"* in the English version refer to the heads of claim of the parties *(\"las pretensiones\"* in the Spanish version, *les chefs de conclusions* in the French version). Article 48(3), therefore, refers to the tribunal\u2019s obligation to deal with, either directly or indirectly, all of the parties\u2019 *heads of claim* within its award.\n\nAccording to Article 33(4) of the VCLT, when there are multiple, equally authentic versions of a treaty, they are all presumed to have the same meaning.\n\n88.\n\nIn sum, the Committee considers that paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention refer to two different obligations of the tribunal. On the one hand, Article 48(1) provides that each and every question that is decided by a tribunal must be approved by a majority of its members. On the other hand, Article 48(3) stipulates that, in its award, a tribunal needs to deal with, either directly or indirectly, all the parties\u2019 heads of claim *(\"questions\", \"chefs de conclusions\"* or *\"las pretensiones sometidas... al Tribunal\").* To meet this obligation, it is for the tribunal to determine and formulate the questions, which are material to resolve the dispute between the parties and put these to a vote by the members of the tribunal.\n\n89.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee will now turn to the analysis of whether, as claimed by Daimler, the Separate Opinion evidenced the Tribunal\u2019s failing to reach a majority on each question submitted.\n\n90.\n\nAccording to Daimler, in the case of separate opinions, *ad hoc* committees must look carefully at the reasoning provided by each arbitrator.159 If there is different reasoning on outcome determinative issues, then a majority is not reached. Daimler submits that the signature of the arbitrator or the vote alone is not sufficient to establish that there was a majority on all questions presented.160\n\nMem. \u00b6 115.\n\nMem. \u00b6 121.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to Daimler, since the Award reproduces in a large part the reasoning of an award rendered in a different case that shared the same President, and Professor Bello Janeiro subscribed or adhered to the President\u2019s conclusions, the Tribunal failed to render an award that reflected the reasons of the Tribunal and not those of each individual member.161\n\nMem. \u00b6 123; \u00b6\u00b6 127-128.\n\n92.\n\nAccording to Argentina, there are no divergent views between the two majority arbitrators, and if there were, the Award would still be valid.162 In addition, it would be futile for an arbitrator, in the majority, to attach a separate concurring opinion if he had nothing different to say from what was stated in the award.163 Argentina claims that Professor Bello Janeiro joined the President to form the majority. He attached an individual opinion to explain his position as it expressed a view different from that expressed by him in his previous position in the *Siemens* case.164\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 12; Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 147:17 - 150:1.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\n93.\n\nWhat is important, according to Argentina, is that the decisions on the 18-month and on the MFN clauses was by a majority. Professor Bello Janeiro voted in favor of the decision contained in the Award and added reasons to explain his change of mind, which reasons do not affect the Award.165\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n94.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that the question of jurisdiction that the Parties required the Tribunal to resolve - and which the Tribunal had to decide - was whether or not it had jurisdiction over the dispute between Daimler and Argentina, in the light of the 18-months and the MFN clauses of the Germany-Argentina BIT. The decision of these questions was dispositive of the issue before the Tribunal.\n\n95.\n\nThe Committee is of the considered opinion that the Tribunal in its Award dealt with the question before it *i.e.,* whether it had jurisdiction in the matter. The Tribunal decided this question by a majority vote. It complied with the ICSID Convention. Both Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy and Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro agreed that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Judge Brower dissented and concluded that the Tribunal had jurisdiction. The question of jurisdiction was decided by a 2 to 1 vote in favor of declining jurisdiction.\n\n96.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal dealt in its Award with the *\"question\"* of jurisdiction and *\"decided\"* it by a majority vote in strict compliance with both paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n97.\n\nIn the following paragraphs the Committee will deal with (a) the question of whether the reasoning of the opinion of Professor Bello Janeiro (i) affects the majority and (ii) contradicts the Award; and (b) assuming that there is a contradiction, whether, it would result in the Award (i) not dealing with the questions submitted to the Tribunal or (ii) not stating the reasons on which it is based.\n\n98.\n\nThe Committee has carefully reviewed the Separate Opinion and the alleged contradictions between the Separate Opinion and the Award. The Committee is of the view that there are no such contradictions. But even if the Committee were to accept Daimler\u2019s submission with regard to contradictions between the Separate Opinion and the Award its conclusion would remain unchanged. The majority clearly voted that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction, and the reasoning in the Separate Opinion did not affect the vote of Professor Bello Janeiro or the majority decision. Further, the Committee does not regard any of these alleged contradictions as having the effect of stripping the Award of its rational basis on an outcome-determinative question.\n\n99.\n\nAs for the alleged contradictions, Daimler claims that \"there is a divergence of conclusions and reasoning between the Award and Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s Separate Opinion, rendering it impossible to confirm that a majority decision exists on the key jurisdictional issue decided in the Award.\"166 According to Daimler, the contradictions lie in three specific points: (a) the interpretative framework; (b) the World Bank Guidelines and (c) the evolution in case law. The Committee does not agree with Daimler.\n\nMem. \u00b6 122.\n\n100.\n\nIn the introductory paragraphs to his Separate Opinion Professor Bello Janeiro states his full agreement with the decision contained in the Award and the reasoning thereof.167 After an examination of the Separate Opinion this Committee has no doubt that Professor Bello Janeiro not only voted for the decision, but also clearly expressed his agreement with the foundational reasons thereof.\n\nSeparate Opinion, page 1. \"Introductory Considerations: I wish to state at the outset that I fully subscribe to the decision proposed by the President of the Tribunal. I find the award to be well founded since the question of most favoured-nation (MFN) treatment is dealt with much more judiciously than in prior cases, in particular *Mafezzini* and *Siemens* (Decision on Jurisdiction).\"\n\n101.\n\nAfter explaining his involvement in the *Siemens* case and the discussions that took place in that case, Professor Bello Janeiro refers to the right that an arbitrator has to change his mind with respect to positions taken or opinions expressed in previous cases.168\n\nSeparate Opinion, page 2, \"In any case, with regard to the practical possibility for an arbitrator on an ICSID Tribunal to change, clarify or alter in any way his opinion or his position, he clearly has in principle complete freedom to do so, particularly after considering developments in the case and subsequent decisions rejecting the extension or maximum expansion of the ambit of the MFN clause to cover dispute resolutions\".\n\n102.\n\nProfessor Bello Janeiro cites examples of cases where arbitrators, in his view, have changed their opinion on certain issues, indicates the factors that led him to clarify his opinion and concludes that ***\"my change of heart*** between the decision in the arbitral award concerning the claim by *Siemens* against Argentina and the current case ***can be explained by the important aspects summarized below,*** naturally without prejudice to any other more substantiated opinion, but can be fully justified by the obvious fact that each arbitration is different.\"169 (Emphasis added). The \"important aspects summarized below\", *i.e.,* the reasons that made Professor Bello Janeiro change his mind with respect to *Siemens,* are basically contained under the heading \"Substantive Elements\" of the Separate Opinion.\n\nSeparate Opinion, page 3.\n\n103.\n\nIt is in this context that the wording of the Separate Opinion must be understood. Professor Bello Janeiro agreed with the decision in the Award as well as with its foundational reasons. The comments that he made, on the several aspects which Daimler terms contradictions, are, on the one hand, explanations as to why he changed his mind with respect to the *Siemens* award, and on the other hand additional reasons to support his vote in favor of the decision on jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n104.\n\nArticle 48(4) of the ICSID Convention clearly lends support to the approach taken in the Separate Opinion. It explicitly permits an arbitrator to record a separate opinion even if he does not dissent *\"from the majority\".* While voting with the majority on the decision(s) he may author and attach his *\"individual opinion to the award\".* Such an opinion is unlikely to be authored or attached to the award if it records nothing in addition to or different from what is stated there. If a separate opinion were limited to agreeing with all aspects of the reasoning in the majority award then it would be both repetitive and meaningless. If this is all that Article 48(4) permitted it too would be meaningless.\n\n105.\n\nBut even assuming that in the three topics identified by Daimler (i.e., the interpretative framework, the World Bank Guidelines and the evolution in case law) Professor Bello Janeiro was not giving explanations as to his \"change of heart\" but stating his reasons to support the Award, the Committee finds no contradiction between the Separate Opinion and the Award with regard to the three topics.\n\n106.\n\nFirst, there is no indication in the Separate Opinion that Professor Bello Janeiro disagrees with the reasoning in the Award or that the reasoning that he puts forward substitutes the reasoning of the Award. On the contrary, he expressly supports the reasoning of the Award. Second, even if the Separate Opinion were to suggest, as Daimler submits, that more weight should be assigned to certain sources (e.g., to judicial practice and case law), or that more relevance should be given to the World Bank Guidelines, or that the evolution of case law was relevant and should have been considered, these are, in the context of the Separate Opinion, additional or subsidiary reasons that Professor Bello Janeiro gives. These reasons are not intended to replace those in the Award. The two arbitrators in majority agreed on the decision and the foundations thereof, but assigned different weight to certain sources. Third, a separate opinion by its very nature includes additional or subsidiary considerations that are not reflected in the award.\n\n107.\n\nHowever, even assuming that the reasoning of the Award and that of the Separate Opinion were contradictory, this would not affect the Award in any way or result in a ground for annulment.\n\n108.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 98 above, in the Committee\u2019s view the relevant issue is how the majority voted. If the arbitrators in majority agree on the decision and vote in favor of it, the fact that they may not concur in all the reasons leading to their vote in support of the decision is irrelevant. The ICSID Convention, as already mentioned in paragraphs 83 and 104 above, provides that arbitrators may issue a separate opinion if they agree on the decision but disagree on the reasons leading to that decision.\n\n109.\n\nThe Committee would like to emphasize that a separate opinion is attached to express a complementary, subsidiary or even different reasoning than that of the award. As correctly pointed out by Argentina, \"if an arbitrator has nothing to add to the award, there would be no reason to draft a separate opinion\".170\n\nRej.\u00b623.\n\n110.\n\nOn the issue of whether the award would be affected by a contradiction in the reasoning between the award and the separate opinion, Prof. Schreuer states that:\n\n\"A majority vote is not affected by an apparent contradiction contained in a declaration or individual opinion [...] made by a member who has voted in favor of the decision. A member of a tribunal may vote for an award not because he or she wholly agrees with it but because he or she feels that it is necessary to provide a majority.\"171 \"A concurring opinion that differs from the majority opinion on certain points of the reasons does not affect the majority necessary for reaching a decision [...]. What matters for the validity of the award in accordance with Art. 48(1) is that the result has attracted the votes of a majority of the tribunal and not that the members who voted for the award agreed on all points of the reasoning accompanying it.\"172\n\nChristoph H. Schreurer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\", Second Edition, p. 810.\n\nChristoph H. Schreurer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\", Second Edition, p. 832.\n\n111.\n\nThe three ICJ decisions cited by Argentina in its Counter-Memorial and discussed by the Parties in these proceedings support the above conclusion.\n\n112.\n\nIn the *Case Concerning the Award of 1989,* the ICJ reviewed an award in which one of the arbitrators dissented and the president, who formed the majority, added a statement to the effect that he would have responded in a different manner to one of the issues that had to be decided in the award. The ICJ considered that even though there had been some contradictions between the award and the opinion of the president, the alleged contradiction would not prevail over the position of the president when voting the award. In the words of the ICJ:\n\n\"Furthermore, even if there had been any contradiction [...] between the view expressed by President Barberis and that stated in the Award, *such contradiction could not prevail over the position which President Barberis had taken when voting for the Award.* In agreeing to the Award, he definitively agreed to the decisions, which it incorporated, as to the extent of the maritime areas governed by the 1960 Agreement, and as to the Tribunal not being required to answer the second question in view of its answer to the first. As the practice of international tribunals shows, it sometimes happens that a member of a tribunal votes in favor of a decision of the tribunal even though he might individually have been inclined to prefer another solution. *The validity of his vote remains unaffected by the expression of any such differences in a declaration or separate opinion of the member concerned, which are therefore without consequence for the decision of the tribunal\"*173 (Emphasis added).\n\n*Case concerning the Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989* (Guinea-Bissau v Senegal), ICJ Judgment of 12 November, 1991.\n\n113.\n\nThe ICJ also upheld an award under similar circumstances - a separate opinion from the president of the tribunal who formed the majority - in the *Review of Judgment No. 333 Opinion.*\n\n114.\n\nIn the *Granite State Machine Company, Inc.* v. *Iran* case, one of the arbitrators issued a concurring opinion stating that he concurred in the award so as to \"end protracted deliberations\" despite the fact that he did not concur with one of the elements considered for compensation of the claimant. Moreover, the arbitrator, even though he did form the majority, did not sign the award.174\n\n*Granite State Machinery Company, Inc.* v. *Iran,* Award No. 18-30-3, December 15 1982; Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports, vol. 1 at 442.\n\n115.\n\nOther decisions, not cited in these proceedings, took the same approach. For example in *Starred Housing International, Inc.* v. *Iran,* an arbitrator, whose vote formed the majority, decided to vote in favor of the award, rather than to dissent, despite his disagreement with the damages awarded, based on \"the realistic old saying that there are circumstances in which \u2018something is better than nothing. \" The arbitrator indicated that \"in a three-member Chamber a majority of two members must join, or there can be no Award. My colleague Dr. Kashani having dissented, I am faced with the choice of either joining in the present Award or accepting the prospect of an indefinite postponement of any Award in this case. [...] The deliberations in this case have continued long enough; [...]. Neither the parties nor the Tribunal will, in my view, benefit from further delay.\"175\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc., Starrett Housing International, Inc.,* v. *The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,* Bank Omran, Bank Mellat, Interlocutory Award No. ITL 32-24-1, December 19, 1983, 4 Iran-US C.T.R. 122, 159 (Concurring Opinion of Howard H. Holtzmann).\n\n116.\n\nIn all the cases referred to above, an arbitrator expressed reasons that could be considered - and in some cases were in fact claimed as such by the party seeking annulment of the award - contradictory to the reasoning in the award. Moreover, without the vote of the concurring arbitrator, no award could have been issued in those cases. There was no identity of views or similarity in the reasons given by the arbitrators forming the majority. Yet, given the identity of their votes, the awards were valid.\n\n117.\n\nIn sum, what matters for purposes of making up a majority is not the individual reasoning of the members in majority, but their votes.\n\n118.\n\nIn his 1996 Freshfields Lecture, profusely cited by the Parties in these proceedings, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel noted the following in commenting the *Case Concerning the 1989 Arbitral Award:*\n\n\"The claim of Guinea-Bissau in the end boiled down to the complaint that the tribunal had voted for what it could muster a majority for rather than for what a majority of its members thought to be right. That complaint was well founded. But it did not follow that the resultant award was inexistent, null and void, or even voidable. On the contrary, so much of the judicial and arbitral process is characterized by judges and arbitrators voting to form a majority rather than voting to express what each of them may see as the optimum judgment. In a collective body, there is very frequently a process of accommodation of differing views, sometimes sharply differing views. The result may be the consecration of the least common denominator. That may not be a noble result, but it is a practical result. It is better than no result.\"176\n\nStephen M. Schwebel, May the Majority Vote of an International Arbitral Tribunal be Impeached?: The 1996 Freshfields Lecture, Arbitration International, (Kluwer Law International 1997 Volume 13 Issue 2) pp. 145 - 154.\n\n119.\n\nDaimler suggests that the decisions invoked by Argentina and referred to above would not apply to this case given that the grounds for annulment presented in those cases did not refer to a \"failure to state reasons\".177 The Committee disagrees. What emerges from the authorities cited above is that what matters for the validity of an award is not an identity of reasoning by the arbitrators in majority, but the identity of their votes with respect to the outcome. In this case the majority clearly voted to decline jurisdiction.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.\n\n120.\n\nIn sum, in the present case, the Committee has no doubt that the arbitrators making up the majority voted in favor of dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction and the Separate Opinion does not affect the Award nor does it allow annulment based on the alleged \"failure to state reasons\".\n\n**(iii) The Alleged Internal Inconsistencies of the Award in its Findings Concerning the BIT\u2019s 18-month Clause and the Scope of the BIT\u2019s MFN Clauses**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Award \"suffers from fatal internal inconsistencies, contradictions and gaps in logic, including with respect to issues that the Award itself recognizes as integral to its acceptance of Argentina\u2019s objection based on the 18-month clause in the Germany-Argentina BIT.\"178\n\nMem. \u00b6I38.\n\n122.\n\nDaimler finds that the Award invokes contradictory reasons related to the BIT\u2019s 18-month clause and scope of the BIT\u2019s MFN clauses in four different aspects: (a) the nature of the BIT\u2019s 18 month clause; (b) the meaning of \"treatment in the territory\" in the MFN clauses; (c) the Tribunal\u2019s authority to address the MFN claim; and (d) whether the 18-month clause grants less favorable treatment.\n\n123.\n\nThe Committee will address each of these alleged inconsistencies.\n\n**(a) The nature of the BIT\u2019s 18-month clause.**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nDaimler claims that, while in paragraph 194 \"the Award concludes that \u2018the 18-month domestic courts provision constitutes a treaty-based precondition to the Host State\u2019s consent to arbitrate, [and] it *cannot be bypassed or otherwise waived by the Tribunal\"179*, in both paragraphs 190 and 198, \"the Award states directly the opposite: that the 18-month clause, despite being a \u2018treaty-based jurisdictional pre-condition\u2019, *could* be bypassed if certain circumstances were found to exist.\"180\n\nMem. \u00b6 140, citing Award, \u00b6 194.\n\nMem. \u00b6 141.\n\n125.\n\nAccording to Daimler \"the Award asserts, on the one hand, that the 18-month clause *was not waivable at all, and,* on the other, *that it was indeed waivable under certain circumstances.*\"181 \"These findings - Daimler argues - are entirely contradictory and cannot be reconciled.\"182\n\nMem. \u00b6 142.\n\nMem. \u00b6 142.\n\n126.\n\nArgentina, however, was of the view that there was no contradiction whatsoever between paragraph 194, on the one hand, and paragraphs 190 and 198, on the other hand.183 According to Argentina, \"the Award analyses and discards two different hypotheses invoked as potential ways to bypass compliance with the BIT\u2019s 18-month provision.\"184 First, in paragraph 190, the Tribunal analyses futility as a possible exception to the 18-month requirement and concludes that there is no futility. Then, in paragraph 192, it analyses if the 18-month clause may be by-passed on the grounds that it is procedural. The answer thereto is provided in paragraph 194, where the Tribunal concludes that \"the 18-month provision cannot be bypassed or otherwise waived by the Tribunal **as a mere \u2018procedural\u2019 or \u2018admissibility-related\u2019 matter.\"185** Finally, in paragraph 198 the Tribunal refers to futility - as opposed to nonsensicality - as a possible exemption from compliance with a treaty-based jurisdictional pre-requisite - such as the 18-month clause- and reiterates that futility was not established in the present case.186\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 61.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 58.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 58 citing to Award, \u00b6 194.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 58-61.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee has already stated in paragraph 77 above that for contradictory reasons to result in a failure to state reasons, the reason must be on an outcome determinative issue and the contradictions must be such that the reasons cancel each other out. Only in such cases can it be said that the reasons amount to no reasons at all. The Committee has also observed that an interpretation in favor of the award\u2019s consistency should be preferred to an approach, which expresses preference for annulling an award on grounds of some alleged inner contradictions.\n\n128.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Argentina that there is nothing in the Award or the Separate Opinion that could suggest that the award is not based on reasons. A holistic reading of the Award, in its context, as opposed to a comparison between isolated sections further supports the decision of this Committee.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal found that it had no jurisdiction based on Article 10 of the BIT (the 18-month clause). In doing so, the Tribunal first considered whether the 18-month provision could be waived or bypassed by the Tribunal as a mere \"procedural\" or \"admissibility related matter\" (paragraph 194). The Tribunal concluded that the 18-month requirement could not be waived or bypassed because it is of a jurisdictional nature. Then the Tribunal examined whether or not the 18-month domestic court litigation requirement is \"nonsensical\" (paragraphs 195-198) and in that context concluded that \"[s]overeign States are free to agree to any treaty provisions they so choose - whether concerning substantive commitments or dispute resolution provisions or otherwise - provided these provisions are not futile and are not otherwise contrary to peremptory norms of international law\".187\n\nAward, \u00b6 198.\n\n130.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal - as correctly pointed out by Argentina - analyzed two different scenarios but did not - as claimed by Daimler - record contradictory findings on the issue of whether the 18-month clause can be waived or bypassed.\n\n**(b) The meaning of \"treatment in the territory\" in the MFN clauses.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nBy first comparing paragraphs 226 to 228 of the Award with footnote 432, Daimler claimed that the Award reached contradictory conclusions regarding the question of whether the 18-month requirement could be bypassed by virtue of a MFN clause. According to Daimler, in doing so the Award first concluded that the right to invoke international arbitration did not involve treatment \"in the territory\" of the host State and that the MFN clause was, thus, inapplicable. But then - Daimler argued - the Award reached a contradictory conclusion as it admitted that treatment received by an investor in Argentinean courts could lead to a violation of the State\u2019s MFN commitments.188 According to Daimler, the fact that the contradiction is contained in a footnote made no difference, because contradictory reasons have the same effect regardless of their position in the award.189\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 147-149.\n\nReply \u00b6 45.\n\n132.\n\nArgentina, argued that the contents of footnote 432 did not contradict the prior determination made by the Tribunal in paragraphs 226 to 228 of the Award. First, Argentina pointed out that paragraphs 226 to 228 and footnote 432 referred to treatment received by an investor in the Argentinean courts, *i.e.* \"treatment in the territory\" - without including international arbitration as a part thereof.190 Second, Argentina noted that footnote 432 referred to an analysis of the favorability of the comparator treaty, which, as previously established by the Tribunal, was not required. Given that the analysis was not necessary, even if the alleged contradictions had taken place, they would not have an effect upon an outcome-determinative point of the Award.191\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 64.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42\n\n133.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina noted that Daimler changed the portions of the Award invoked by Daimler as contradictory. Regarding these newly compared portions, Argentina stated that when analyzing the territorial limitation of the MFN clauses of the BIT, the Award drew a clear distinction between extraterritorial dispute resolution from the actual treatment received by the investor in the domestic courts and hence, there was no contradiction between the conclusion of the Tribunal on this matter.192\n\nRej. \u00b6 39.\n\n134.\n\nUpon an examination of the sections of the Award invoked by Daimler as contradictory -paragraphs 230 and footnote 403, on the one hand, and paragraphs 247 to 248 and footnote 432 on the other hand193 - the Committee is of the view that these sections of the Award do not contradict each other. Further, the Committee is of the view that, even assuming that such sections were contradictory; they do not meet the required standard to annul an award. That standard is met only when contradictions within the award cancel its reasons out to such an extent that these amount to no reasons at all on a point that is determinative for the decision of the Tribunal.\n\nThe Committee notes that Daimler changed the parts of the Award which are the subject matter of the comparison. In the Memorial it compared paragraphs 226 to 228 with footnote 432 (See: Mem.\u00b6144-151) and in the Reply it compared paragraph 230 and footnote 403 (See: Reply. \u00b64O), on the one hand, and paragraphs 247-248 and footnotes 432 and 433, on the other (See: Reply. \u00b6 40). In the Hearing Daimler cited the contradictions between \u00b623l of the Award and footnote 403 (Tr: 81:11-22)\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee reiterates that a submission that an award contains contradictory reasons must not be examined in isolation. The reasons in an award have to be examined with due regard to their context. A committee before it proceeds to annul an award on the ground of contradictory reasons must examine their context and satisfy itself that these have the effect of cancelling each other out leaving the decision on an outcome-determinative issue without any rational basis. Moreover, if after having stated its reasons and deciding a given point, the Tribunal, in an excess of caution or otherwise, analyses the other arguments made by the parties, such additional - and perhaps unnecessary - analysis cannot be compared with the reasons for the decision of the Tribunal to determine whether the two sets of reasons are contradictory, for even if they are they will not cancel one another. In such cases, the reasons for the decision are already in the Award, and the additional reasons can have no impact on the decision of the Tribunal.\n\n136.\n\nFootnote 432 belongs to paragraph 248 of the Award. This paragraph is under the section titled *\"Requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be favorable\".* This section comprises paragraphs 240 to 250. In the first paragraph of that particular section, *i.e.* paragraph 240, the Tribunal stated:\n\n\"Since this Tribunal has already concluded that the wording of Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT as centred on the phrase \u2018treatment in its territory\u2019 does not permit it to agree with the Claimant\u2019s thesis, *it is not strictly necessary to examine the requirement that the comparator treatment invoked must be more favorable.* Even *if such an examination were necessary,* the Tribunal could not at present reach the same conclusion as the Claimant on this point.\"194 (Emphasis added).\n\nAward, \u00b6 240.\n\n137.\n\nOn a reading of the text and on examining the context of the Award, it is clear for the Committee that the Tribunal gave its reasons in connection with the words \"treatment in the territory\" and concluded that the wording of the BIT, and specifically Articles 3 and 4 thereof, did not allow the Tribunal to accept Daimler\u2019s submissions in this regard. The reasoning on the requirement of favorability of the comparator treatment is not - in the words of the Tribunal - *\"strictly necessary\",* but even if it were it would not lead the Tribunal to a conclusion favorable to the Applicant.195\n\nAward, \u00b6 240.\n\n138.\n\nConsidering that the reasoning on the comparator treatment was subsidiary or - in the words of the Tribunal - *\"not strictly necessary\",* and that a decision was made on the point for different reasons, the alleged contradictions, even if these existed, would not have affected the outcome of the Award.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s authority to address the MFN claim.**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nDaimler submitted that the Award invoked contradictory reasons on the Tribunal\u2019s authority to address the MFN claim. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal contradicted itself when it conveyed that the MFN clause might confer it with jurisdiction, but then asserted that Daimler could not invoke MFN treatment because it had not satisfied the conditions precedent to arbitration.196 According to Daimler these contradictory reasons resulted in the Tribunal rejecting jurisdiction.197\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 152-154; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\nReply \u00b6 49.\n\n140.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the alleged contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of its authority to address the MFN claim does not exist. This is obvious from a simple review of the wording in the Award. In fact - Argentina argued - the Award dealt with the dispute resolution clause and the MFN clauses as two separate potential bases for jurisdiction. In addition to the fact that there is no contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on this issue, the fact that the Tribunal considered two independent bases for jurisdiction is more favorable to Daimler. Referring to the decision on annulment in *Azurix,* Argentina further argued that the Award should not be annulled on the basis of an alleged contradiction that was to the advantage of the Applicant.198\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 67-71; Rej. \u00b6\u00b6. 43-47.\n\n141.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Argentina in that there is no contradiction between paragraphs 200 and 281, on the one hand, and footnote 355 and paragraph 204, on the other.\n\n142.\n\nIn paragraph 200, the Tribunal addresses the issue of whether it has jurisdiction under the BIT, which requires an initial recourse to domestic courts. It concludes that since \"Claimant has not yet satisfied the necessary condition precedent to Argentina\u2019s consent to international arbitration, its MFN arguments are not yet properly before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is therefore presently without jurisdiction to rule on any MFN-based claims unless the MFN clause themselves supply the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction\".199\n\nAward, \u00b6 200.\n\n143.\n\nIn footnote 355 the Tribunal used the word *\"unless\"* to clarify that the dispute resolution clause and the MFN clause are to be analyzed as independent potential bases for the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n144.\n\nParagraph 204 examined whether the 18-month provision could be bypassed by the MFN clauses, *i.e.,* the analysis in paragraph 200 (the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction \"unless the MFN clauses themselves supply the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction\"). In this regard the Tribunal concluded that the impediment arising from the 18-month proviso \"might be surmounted by the content of the MFN clauses in question, in particular if those clauses evince an intention, on the part of the Contracting State Parties, to allow the Treaty's conditions precedent to accessing international arbitration to be altered by operation of its MFN provisions.\"200\n\nAward, \u00b6 204.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, in paragraph 281 the Tribunal reached the conclusions based on its analysis of the issue.\n\n146.\n\nThe line of reasoning of the Tribunal is clear and leads to its conclusion. The Tribunal noted that since Daimler had not complied with the 18-month clause, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear Daimler\u2019s claims (including claims based on MFN clauses). The Tribunal was of the view that unless the MFN clause itself conferred such jurisdiction it could not go further. The Tribunal then considered whether the MFN clause would confer such jurisdiction and concluded that it did not. There is no contradiction in this reasoning, much less a contradiction of a nature where the reasons cancel each other out.\n\n**(d) Whether the 18-month clause grants less favorable treatment.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Award contains contradictions as it states that the 18-month requirement does not grant German investors less favorable treatment compared to Chilean investors under the Chile-Argentina BIT, but, at the same time, holds that requiring German investors to fruitlessly litigate their treaty-based disputes in the Argentine courts, \"while exempting Chilean investors from the same requirement *could be viewed as discriminatory impairment of the German investors\u2019 rights.\"201* (Emphasis added).\n\nMem,\u00b6 78.\n\n148.\n\nIn response, Argentina argued that (i) Daimler\u2019s comparison between paragraph 250 and footnote 433 was inappropriate because those portions of the Award deal with different provisions of the BIT; (ii) the alleged contradiction does not exist since the cited footnote does not refer to the 18-month clause as a jurisdictional requirement; and (iii) even if the reasoning on this issue was contradictory, it would not affect an outcome-determinative point of the Award, to justify annulment.202\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 48-52.\n\n149.\n\nFootnote 433 is included in paragraph 248 of the Award where, as stated in paragraph 138 above, the Tribunal undertook an additional and subsidiary analysis that was not necessary. Based on the standard spelt out in paragraph 77 above, the Committee agrees with Argentina that even if footnote 433 contradicted paragraphs 250 and 281, the contradiction would not affect a pivotal or outcome determinative point of the Award.\n\n150.\n\nIn other words, the text of footnote 433 is not pivotal to the main decision, and does not affect the main reasoning of the Award on the point.\n\n151.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee is of the considered view that neither of the two grounds for annulment put forward by Daimler constitute a failure by the Tribunal to state reasons. Accordingly Daimler\u2019s application for annulment of the Award, under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention cannot succeed.\n\n**B. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS - ARTICLE 52(1)(B)**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Standard**\n-------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n152.\n\nDaimler\u2019s second ground for partial annulment rests on the basis that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention by concluding that the MFN clause could not be used by Daimler to bypass the 18-month clause.203 Daimler cited the decision in the *CDC* case, in which the committee observed that for a tribunal to commit an excess of powers, it \"(1) must do something in excess of its powers and (2) that excess must be manifest\".204 According to Daimler, it has been recognized by numerous committees that an excess of powers can also be committed by a tribunal that fails to exercise its jurisdiction or errs in such exercise. Daimler further refers to the *Duke* *Energy International* *Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd.* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28) *(\"Duke Energy\")* committee, which stated that the powers of a tribunal go further than its jurisdiction; they go to the scope of the task entrusted to the tribunal by the parties. As such, a tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the law chosen by the Parties was accepted by the ICSID Contracting States to be an excess of powers.205\n\nMem. \u00b6158.\n\nMem. \u00b6 159.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 160-162.\n\n153.\n\nIn determining whether a tribunal failed to apply the applicable law under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee must determine whether in fact the tribunal applied the law it was bound to apply. Accordingly, the Committee need not accept without questioning the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on the applicable law, nor must it accept as dispositive the Tribunal\u2019s statement that it applied the applicable law. Moreover, many committees have confirmed that non-application of the applicable law constitutes manifest excess of power and this non-application may consist of applying rules other than those agreed to by the parties or a decision not based on any law.206 Daimler cited the *Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16) *(\u2018Sempra\")* decision, in which the award was annulled because the committee found that the tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the relevant provisions of the BIT amounted to a failure to apply the proper law.207 Daimler also cited the *Duke Energy* committee, which held that a tribunal\u2019s failure to deal with all the questions presented to it amounted to an excess of power.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 163-165.\n\nMem. \u00b6I66.\n\n154.\n\nDaimler argued that an excess of power is manifest when the excess is *\"obvious, clear, or self-evident\"*, but it can also be manifest when the excess is *\"serious and material\"* to the outcome of the case.208\n\nMem. \u00b6 168.\n\n155.\n\nIn its Reply, Daimler stated what it considered to be the points of agreement between the Parties on the legal standard: that a failure to apply the applicable law is an excess of powers; that a *\"gross or egregious\"* error in applying the law can be grounds for annulment; and that *\"manifest\"* means *\"obvious, clear or self-evident\",209*\n\nReply\u00b657.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Parties disagree on how *\"obviousness\"* should be determined. Argentina relies on the *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A.* v. *Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10) (\"*Repsol')* and *Wena* annulment decisions and argues that obviousness must be determined *\"simply by reading the Award\u2019* and avoiding *\"elaborate interpretations one way or another\".* However, Daimler argues, that recent annulment decisions have held that a more detailed review of the arguments of the parties in the arbitration is necessary when conducting an analysis of manifest excess of powers.210\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\n157.\n\nConcerning its claims for annulment, Daimler argued that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in three ways: (i) it failed to apply the VCLT; (ii) it improperly applied the law of \"Full Reparation\"; and (iii) it failed to apply the principle of *Pacta sunt servanda.*\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler\u2019s claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by concluding that the MFN clause could not be used to bypass the 18-month requirement is simply an allegation that the Tribunal applied the law incorrectly.211 Argentina argues that previous ICSID committees have recognized that an error in the application of the law is not a ground for annulment unless \"it is so gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law\".212 Argentina submitted that Daimler has acknowledged that a tribunal\u2019s excess must be manifest to warrant annulment. Previous committees have held that \"[t]he excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other\".213 According to Argentina, the excesses identified by Daimler are not manifest but are \"a product of elaborate interpretations\" not warranting annulment.214\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 77.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 79.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.\n\n159.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina submitted that Daimler failed to show how the Tribunal exceeded its powers and stated that the three grounds invoked by Daimler are interrelated and constitute a mere disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law.215\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to Argentina, it is undisputed that a mere disagreement with the interpretation of an award on the applicable law is not a ground for annulment. This has been confirmed by committees such as the *Pey Casado* and *Amco I* committees.216 Daimler itself recognized that the Tribunal was exclusively responsible for defining the scope of the Treaty, which was done in the present case regarding the 18-month and MFN clauses.217\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.\n\nRej. \u00b6 57.\n\n**2. Failure to apply the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the law agreed to by the Contracting States to the BIT in connection with Argentina\u2019s fifth jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal\u2019s failures are contrary to the mandate in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 10(5) of the BIT, rendering each such failure an independent ground for annulment.218\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 169-171.\n\n162.\n\nThe first failure was a failure by the Tribunal to apply the VCLT to which Germany and Argentina are parties. Moreover, the rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT are a part of customary international law. As such, under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, the Tribunal was obligated to interpret the BIT provisions pursuant to the VCLT rules on treaty interpretation.219 According to Daimler, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the VCLT\u2019s rules on treaty interpretation constitutes one of two annullable errors: an application of a law not agreed to by the parties or *\"a decision not based on any law\"220* Indeed, even though the Award mentioned the VCLT it failed to apply its principles in reaching the conclusion that the BIT\u2019s MFN provisions cannot be used by Daimler to overcome its non-compliance with the 18-month requirement. Judge Brower referred to this failure in his Dissenting Opinion.221\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 172-174.\n\nMem. \u00b6 175.\n\nMem. \u00b6 176.\n\n163.\n\nDuring the hearing, Daimler explained that the application of the *\"affirmative-evidence standard\"* and the *\"standing-community standard\"* to the issue of the Contracting State\u2019s consent to international arbitration, shows that the Tribunal failed to apply the VCLT\u2019s rule according to which an international treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms.222\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 104:3 - 109:19.\n\n164.\n\nDaimler argued that in addition to the Award failing facially to apply the VCLT, Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s admission in his Separate Opinion that he found other authorities to be decisive on the MFN issue, underscores that there was not a majority decision *\"of the Tribunal based on an interpretation of the relevant clauses of the Germany-Argentina BIT pursuant to VCLT principles\"223* This shows that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law, which amounts to a manifest excess of powers.224\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 177-180.\n\nMem. \u00b6 181.\n\n165.\n\nIn its Reply, Daimler stated that Argentina failed to rebut Daimler\u2019s argument based on the Tribunal\u2019s manifest excess of powers.225 Moreover, Daimler pointed out that instead of addressing Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s failure to apply the VCLT, Argentina repeated its arguments that the Separate Opinion is immune from scrutiny and that Professor Bello Janeiro simply added some additional considerations.226 According to Daimler, such contentions contradict the ICJ\u2019s ruling that a separate opinion attached to an arbitral award is important for the analysis of the award under review.227\n\nReply \u00b6 60.\n\nReply \u00b6 64.\n\nReply \u00b6 64.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nArgentina referred to the passages cited by Daimler as a basis for its claim and stated that these passages actually show that the Tribunal did in fact apply the interpretative principles of the VCLT.228 It is evident from the Award itself that the Tribunal analysed the MFN clauses with reference to the VCLT. Indeed, the Award clarifies that as a preliminary matter it would refer to the *ejusdem generis* principle and then develop the interpretation of the clause in light of the VCLT. In paragraph 217 of the Award the Tribunal first referred to the ordinary meaning of the word *\"treatment\"* and then considered the context of the term.229 According to Argentina, the Tribunal followed this same construction in its analysis of activities related to investment and investors, the exceptions established in Articles 3(3) and 3(4) of the BIT, the expression *\"less favorable\"*, and the relationship between the MFN clauses in the BIT and other BIT provisions.230 Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that it has undertaken the MFN analysis by taking into account the ordinary meaning of the text in the relevant context and bearing in mind the BIT\u2019s object and purpose, as mandated by the VCLT.231 Thus, it cannot be seriously argued that the Tribunal did not apply the interpretation provisions of the VCLT.232\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 81-84.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 85.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 86.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 87 citing Award, \u00b6254.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 88.\n\n167.\n\nArgentina further rejected Daimler\u2019s argument according to which the Tribunal increased Claimant\u2019s burden of proof by applying an *\"affirmative evidence standard\"* in contravention of the VCLT\u2019s rules of treaty interpretation. Argentina argued that such change in the burden of proof was non-existent. The Tribunal carried out an interpretative analysis of whether consent existed and such analysis was conducted within the framework in which the Parties presented their arguments.233\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 175:16 - 177:12.\n\n168.\n\nArgentina argued that the \"weakness\" in Daimler\u2019s argument is further evidenced by the fact that the entire argument relies on the alleged failure to apply the applicable rules in arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s opinion, which is false and, in any case, irrelevant. There was a majority sustaining the Award as evidenced by arbitrator Bello Janeiro\u2019s express adherence to it and, as such, the text of the Award needs to be examined and not his Separate Opinion.234 Additionally, citing ICJ decisions, Argentina argues that the use of separate opinions has been recognized in international law as a means to add further reasoning to a decision without rejecting its reasons or grounds. Arbitrator Bello Janeiro expressly subscribed to the Award and its grounds, and added additional considerations on issues that he thought should be mentioned.235 Given the purpose of the Separate Opinion and Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s joining the majority vote, on the decision, there was no need for him to reiterate the rules of treaty interpretation in his concurring opinion.236\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 91-94.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 94\n\n169.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina argued that because Daimler alleged that the Tribunal failed to apply the VCLT, it is Daimler which bears the burden of proof.237 Daimler recognized that the Tribunal applied the VCLT rules of interpretation but submitted that it failed to do so with regard to *\"certain\"* provisions, such as the MFN clauses. This shows that *\"a fortiori\"* Daimler\u2019s argument is a mere discrepancy in the application of the law.238\n\nRej. \u00b6 59.\n\nRej.\u00b659.\n\n170.\n\nArgentina argued that in its Counter-Memorial it demonstrated the interpretative course the Tribunal undertook and the Applicant gave no answer to this. Indeed, there is no difficulty in following the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the application of VCLT interpretative principles to its MFN analysis.239 With respect to other decisions of arbitral tribunals, the Tribunal made clear that it would consider these decisions because the Parties made extensive references to them. The Tribunal also acknowledged that there is no precedent system in investor-State arbitration but that it would consider decisions of other tribunals under certain criteria, which it laid out.240\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nRej.\u00b665.\n\n171.\n\nOn the Tribunal\u2019s application and non-application of the MFN clauses, Argentina submitted that the Applicant is mistaken in focusing its analysis on only seven paragraphs of the Award without taking into account other relevant sections.241 The Applicant is dissatisfied because it disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and not because there is a failure to apply the applicable law.242 This is also confirmed by Daimler\u2019s argument on the *pacta sunt servanda* principle; it sought that this be disregarded by the Tribunal when it claimed that the Tribunal should ignore the dispute resolution clause in the BIT.243\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 66-70.\n\nRej. \u00b6 71.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n\n172.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s argument, arbitrator Bello Janeiro did not fail to apply the VCLT. He fully subscribed to the Award and as the Award applied the VCLT, so did arbitrator Bello Janeiro, who limited himself to adding additional arguments that did not contradict the decisions reached in the Award.244\n\nRej. \u00b6 72.\n\n173.\n\nAs to Daimler\u2019s reference to the *Sempra* case, Argentina stated that it is clearly distinguishable. In that case the tribunal failed to apply the applicable law.245 That was not the case here.\n\nRej. \u00b6 76.\n\n**3. Application of the non-applicable principle of \"full reparation\" and FAILURE TO APPLY THE RULE OF** ***PACTA SUNT SERVANDA***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAccording to Daimler, another flaw in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is found in its analysis of whether the *\"comparator treatment\"* given by Argentina to Chilean investors was *\"more* *favorable\"* than the treatment it gave to German investors.246 Daimler argues that the Tribunal applied the general principle of full reparation to determine whether the comparator treaty was in fact more favorable to the investor.247 However, the Award does not apply the applicable law because this principle applies exclusively to the consequences of an internationally wrongful act of a State, as evidenced by the plain text of Article 31 of the 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"2001 Draft Articles\") and the commentaries thereon.248 Indeed, Daimler argues that the *\"full reparation\"* rule applies only after a tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction over a dispute, that the State is responsible for an unlawful act and that there is injury.249 According to Daimler, the Award reflects a manifest excess of powers by applying an inapplicable rule.250\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 182-183.\n\nMem. \u00b6I85; Reply \u00b6 65.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 186-190; citing the Report of the International Law Commission to the General Assembly, 2001 Draft Articles, with Commentaries, U.N.

Moreover, Argentina did not submit any observations on Daimler\u2019s reference to the *Sempra* decision that strongly supports annulment in the present case. These *\"implicit concessions\"* confirm that annulment is warranted.259\n\nReply \u00b6 71.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nRegarding the alleged misapplication of the principle of full reparation and the nonapplication of the rule of *pacta sunt servanda,* Argentina argued that the Tribunal sought to objectively determine whether a BIT with a prior submission to a local court requirement was less favorable than the one with a fork-in-the-road provision.260 The Tribunal then concluded that a BIT, such as the present one with a local court submission requirement was not less favorable than the Argentina-Chile BIT, which did not have this provision.261 According to Argentina, the Award\u2019s reference to the possibility of claiming before an arbitral tribunal any expenses related to the domestic court litigation reinforced the fact that the dispute resolution provision in the BIT was not less favorable. These references were made in this context to illustrate that the investor couldn\u2019t argue less favorable treatment than that accorded to investors in BITs with fork-in-the-road provisions, as it may seek reparations for these higher costs.262 Accordingly, there are no grounds for claiming that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.263\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 95-97.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 97.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 98.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 99.\n\n180.\n\nRegarding the alleged application of the principle of full reparation, Argentina claimed that the Tribunal considered it an additional consideration to the time and cost factors, in its discussion on whether there was less favourable treatment or not when investors had to resort to local courts before arbitration, as opposed to investors that could proceed directly to arbitration.264 Indeed, the Tribunal had already decided that the MFN clauses were not applicable, which is evidenced by the use of the word *\"moreover\"* in paragraph 247 in which it refers to the full reparation principle. According to Argentina, this shows that the analysis was alternative and not determinative for the conclusion of the Award.265\n\nRej. \u00b6 77.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 78-81.\n\n**4. The Committee's Decision on the Alleged Manifest Excess of Powers**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Standard**\n--------------------\n\n181.\n\nDaimler submitted that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the rules of law agreed by the Contracting States to the BIT because the Tribunal (i) failed to apply Article 31 of the VCLT; (ii) applied the non-applicable principle of \"full reparation\" and (iii) failed to apply the rule of *pacta sunt servanda.*\n\n182.\n\nThe Parties agree that under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention the applicable test for a manifest excess of powers is to determine whether (i) there is an excess of powers; and (ii) whether the excess is \"manifest.\" They also seem to agree on the well-established point that a failure to apply the proper law or a failure to apply the law chosen by the parties may amount to an excess of powers.\n\n183.\n\nThe Parties seem to differ, however, as to what is *\"obvious\"* or *\"manifest\".* Argentina, quoting, *inter alia,* the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees of *Repsol* and *Wena* advanced an interpretation where obviousness must be determined by simply reading the award without entering into a detailed examination of its contents and without elaborate interpretations one way or the other.266 Daimler, citing, *inter alia,* the *ad-hoc* committees of *Continental Casualty Company* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9); *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide* v. *Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25) *(\"Fraport\")* and *Pey Casado* supported an interpretation whereby it is necessary for the *ad hoc* committee to engage in a careful review of the arguments that have been advanced by the parties in the underlying arbitral proceedings, rather than in a merely superficial inquiry.267\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 79.\n\nReply \u00b6 59.\n\n184.\n\nAs regards the test to determine whether the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law, Daimler submitted that there was no presumption of validity in favor of the Award and therefore the Committee must (i) reach its own conclusion on the applicable law; (ii) determine if that was the law that the Tribunal purported to apply; and (iii) whether there were any basis for concluding that the decision of the Tribunal involved a manifest failure to apply the proper law.268\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 163-165; Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 101:16 - 102:4.\n\n185.\n\nArgentina, in turn, claimed that this was not a case in which the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law or the law agreed upon by the Parties, but rather a case in which Daimler was not satisfied because the Tribunal disagreed with its interpretation.269\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 80\n\n186.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that an excess of power must be *\"manifest\"',* in other words it must be plain, evident, obvious and clear to warrant annulment.270 As stated by the *Wena* annulment committee: *\"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"271* If this Committee were to undertake a careful and detailed analysis of the respective submissions of the parties before the Tribunal, as Daimler suggests, and annul the Award on the ground that its understanding of facts or interpretation of law or appreciation of evidence is different from that of the Tribunal, it will cross the line that separates annulment from appeal.\n\nSee, e.g.: *Wena,* \u00b6 25; *Repsol,* \u00b6 36; *Azurix,* \u00b6\u00b6 48 and 68; *Sempra* \u00b6 213.\n\nWena \u00b625.\n\n187.\n\nThe Committee also considers that when more than one interpretation is possible, an award cannot be annulled on the ground that it suffers from an exercise of excess of powers, much less a manifest excess of powers. In the words of the *CDC* annulment committee\n\n\"[...] the term \u2018manifest\u2019 means clear or \u2018self-evident\u2019. Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other\u2019, is not manifest. [...] If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal\u2019s decision is based, the tribunal\u2019s determination is conclusive.\u2019\"272\n\n*CDC* \u00b6 41.\n\n188.\n\nThe annulment proceeding is not an appeal and therefore, is not a mechanism to correct alleged errors of fact or law that a tribunal may have committed.273 Annulment under the ICSID Convention is a limited remedy destined to ensure the fundamental fairness of the arbitration proceeding.274\n\n*See, e.g.: Amco 1, \u00b6 23; Wena, \u00b6 18; Azurix, \u00b6 41; Impregilo S.P.A* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), Decision of the *Ad Hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, January 24, 2014,\u00b6 119\n\nSee, e.g.: *AUNE,* \u00b6 4.04; *Soufraki,* \u00b6 20;\n\n189.\n\nTherefore, when an allegation is made that there was a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the applicable law, it is not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to verify whether the interpretation of the law by the tribunal was correct, or whether it correctly ascertained the facts or whether it correctly appreciated the evidence. These are issues relevant to an appeal, but not for annulment proceedings in view of the limited grounds provided for under the ICSID Convention.\n\n190.\n\nAs stated by the *CDC* annulment committee:\n\n\"Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s legal analysis, however, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law. That it did so is made plain by its explicit statement in the Award that it did as well as by its repeated citation to relevant English authorities.\"275\n\n*CDC,* \u00b6 45. The *MINE* annulment committee, in turn, considered that: \"Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.\" *MINE,* \u00b6 5.04.\n\n191.\n\nIn sum, what the Committee can do is to determine whether the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavoured to apply it. As to the latter, there is a distinction between endeavouring to apply the correct law and correctly applying the law. While the former may provide a ground for annulment the latter is outside the scope of authority of an *ad hoc* annulment committee. The Committee is of the view that the Tribunal complied with what was required of it by the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(ii) The Alleged Failure to apply the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nAs regards the alleged failure to apply the VCLT, the Committee finds that the Tribunal clearly identified the VCLT as applicable to the dispute and endeavored to apply it to the several issues of interpretation of the BIT that arose between the Parties.\n\n193.\n\nIn paragraph 46 of the Award (corresponding to the section titled \"Applicable Law\") the Tribunal observed:\n\n\"This claim arises under the German-Argentine BIT, in conjunction with the ICSID Convention. As both the BIT and the ICSID Convention are international treaties concluded between sovereign States, both are subject to the usual customary law rules governing treaty interpretation under public international law, as reflected in article 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"). *The Tribunal will apply these rules in discerning whether all of the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT have been met\"* (Emphasis added).\n\n194.\n\nThereafter the Award undertakes the analysis of the application or non-application of the MFN clauses and indicates, in several paragraphs, how, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the VCLT is relevant to the interpretation of the different provisions of the BIT.276\n\nSee, e.g., Award, \u00b6 167; \u00b6\u00b6 172-173; \u00b6 178; \u00b623l and \u00b6254.\n\n195.\n\nDaimler quoted Judge Brower\u2019s Dissenting Opinion to support the alleged lack of application of the VCLT and referred to the Separate Opinion to indicate that Professor Bello Janeiro did not apply the VCLT.277 As for the opinion of Judge Brower, it constitutes a different approach to the application of the VCLT and it is not for the Committee to review the correctness of the interpretation of the Tribunal or the merits of the criticism of Judge Brower. Suffice it to say that had Judge Brower not been critical of either the Award or the Separate Opinion he would have joined the majority and the Award would have been unanimous. He dissented because he was critical of the reasoning and disagreed with the decision. His dissent cannot form the basis of annulment unless it is evident that the majority Award suffers from a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal. With respect to the Separate Opinion, the Committee has already expressed its views and conclusions as to the effects of such a Separate Opinion on the Award in paragraphs 107 to 120.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 175-179.\n\n196.\n\nThis is sufficient, in the Committee\u2019s view, to conclude that annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the alleged failure to apply the VCLT is not warranted.\n\n**(iii) The Alleged Application of the Non-applicable Principle of Full Reparation and Lack of Application of the Principle of** ***Pacta Sunt Servanda***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nDaimler considered that the excess of powers resulting from the application of the non-applicable principle of full reparation and the excess of powers resulting from the lack of application of the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* are related \"since by applying the \u2018full reparation\u2019 principle, the Award failed to honor the principle of *pacta sunt servanda,\"278*\n\nReply \u00b6 69.\n\n198.\n\nAccording to Daimler, in its analysis of the \"comparator treatment\" to determine whether the treatment granted by Argentina to Chilean investors was more favorable than the one granted to German investors, the Award applied the principle of full reparation to conclude that Chilean investors do not necessarily receive a better treatment than German investors. This principle, according to Daimler, applied only after a tribunal had found (i) jurisdiction over the dispute, (ii) State responsibility for an unlawful act and (iii) injury.279\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 183-190.\n\n199.\n\nDaimler further contended that first by applying the principle of full reparation the Tribunal acted in a manifest excess of its powers by applying a non-applicable provision. Second, the Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply the applicable law, *i.e.* the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.* In the words of Daimler, the Award failed to apply such principle \"by failing to vindicate the rule that the Germany-Argentina BIT is *binding* on Argentina, and that Argentina must therefore perform its obligations under the treaty in good faith.\"280.\n\nMem. \u00b6 200.\n\n200.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that there was no failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n201.\n\nIn paragraphs 240 to 243 of the Award, the Tribunal identifies the sources and principles that it would apply to determine whether Chilean investors receive a better treatment than German investors, and concludes that applying such principles to the matter in question \"the Tribunal could not endorse the Claimant\u2019s proposed use of the MFN clause unless it could determine that the dispute resolution provisions of Article 10 of the German-Argentine BIT (the \"Basic Treaty\") are objectively less favorable than those of Article **X** of the Chilean-Argentine BIT (the \"Comparator Treaty\").\"281\n\nAward, \u00b6 244.\n\n202.\n\nThe Award then states:\n\n\"It might be tempting to simply accept the Claimant's assertion that the Comparator Treaty is more favorable under the assumption that it must be favorable if the Claimant prefers it. The problem, however, is that claimants' preferences are subjective. It is certainly conceivable that some future claimant may instead prefer to have two successive chances for a favorable outcome under the Basic Treaty rather than proceed immediately to international arbitration under the Comparator Treaty. *This is particularly so since recent trends indicate that the costs of international arbitration may be quite high relative to the costs of domestic dispute resolution, and the average time required to resolve disputes via international arbitration may equal or exceed that of domestic court processes*,\"282 (Emphasis added).\n\nAward, \u00b6 245.\n\n203.\n\nAfter indicating that accepting Claimant's assertions as to what is favorable could lead to a situation where the terms \"more\" or \"less\" favorable have no objective meaning, the Award analyzes the factors that should be considered in determining when the treatment of an investor may be considered more favorable, which factors include the costs of pursuing a case in the domestic courts and in international arbitration.283 In such context, the Award indicates that if in resorting to the domestic courts the investor receives less favorable or discriminatory treatment, such investor would have to be compensated \"in accordance with the ordinary general international law principle of full reparation\".284\n\nSee: Award, \u00b6\u00b6 246-247.\n\nAward, \u00b6 247.\n\n204.\n\nThe Committee stresses that the Award must be read in context. The Tribunal reviewed in detail the factors relevant for the so-called comparator treatment, including costs, and indicated, in an ancillary manner, that if the investor received less favorable or discriminatory treatment in the local courts it could be compensated in accordance with the principle of full reparation. Moreover, this analysis of the \"comparator treatment\", as stated under paragraph 138 above, was identified by the Tribunal as unnecessary to determine the issue of jurisdiction, and specifically, the application of the 18-month clause and the MFN clause.\n\n205.\n\nTherefore, Daimler is not correct in its claim that the Award applied the principle of \"full reparation\" or failed to apply the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* to its decision on jurisdiction. An ancillary observation in the context of a section that the Tribunal considered as additional, but not necessary, to its decision could not result in an annulment for failure to apply the proper law.\n\n206.\n\nConsequently, the *ad hoc* Committee dismisses the contention by Daimler that the Award is the result of a manifest excess of powers, as per Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE - ARTICLE 52(1)(D)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Standard**\n-------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n207.\n\nDaimler also requested a partial annulment of the Award on the ground that the Tribunal committed serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. According to Daimler, the Tribunal committed\n\n\"numerous procedural anomalies and excesses, including causing prejudicial delay in forcing the parties to undertake a prolonged and costly merits phase that could and should have been averted; by failing to apply the applicable principles concerning the burden of proof; by depriving the parties of the opportunity to address authorities that were critical to the conclusions reached by the two purported members of the majority of the Tribunal; and by effectively failing to deliberate on the issues that yielded the Award\u2019s outcome-determinative conclusion with respect to Argentina\u2019s fifth jurisdictional objection.\"285\n\nMem. \u00b6 205.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to Daimler, Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention protects parties from awards that violate their due process rights.286 The Committee must establish three elements for annulment to occur: \"(1) identification of a *\"fundamental\"* rule of procedure; (2) a finding that the tribunal *\"departed\u2019* from such fundamental rule; and (3) a finding that such departure was *\"serious \"\"287*\n\nMem. \u00b6 206, citing the *CDC* Committee that Article 52(1)(d) is \"necessary in order to ensure that the resulting award is truly an \u2018award,\u2019 *i.e.* a result arrived at fairly, under due process and with transparency, and hence in the basic justice of which parties will have faith.\"\n\nMem. \u00b6 208. Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 36:14-17.\n\n209.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(1)(d), only violations *of \"fundamental*\u00a0rules of procedure warrant annulment of an award. Daimler cited the *CDC* and *Pey Casado* committees, which explained *\"fundamental*\u00a0as rules of natural justice, rules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process.288 According to Daimler, four such rules were violated by the Tribunal: \"(1) the right to the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes, free from prejudicial delay; (2) proper allocation of the burden of proof; (3) the right to a full and fair opportunity to be heard; and (4) the tribunal\u2019s obligation to deliberate and render a majority decision on each question presented.\"289\n\nMem. \u00b6 209.\n\nMem. \u00b6 210.\n\n210.\n\nIn regard to the right to prompt and efficient resolution of the dispute, Daimler argued that the notion of ICSID arbitration as an efficient dispute resolution mechanism is reflected throughout the Arbitration Rules, which establish timelines for claims, limits for the preparation of an award and places primacy on the early resolution of preliminary issues.290 Daimler states that fairness sometimes requires timelines to remain flexible, but it also prohibits prejudicial delay.291 Delay alone has not been found as a ground for annulment, but committees have left open the possibility for annulment for unreasonable delay. Unreasonable delay has been examined by international tribunals in the context of denial of justice claims and in those cases, most tribunals have taken into account the complexity of the case and the parties\u2019 procedural behavior.292 Daimler argued that the effect of a delay may also determine whether it was unreasonable, as was determined in the *Pey Casado* case.293 In short, annulment must follow in cases where the delay is unreasonable, *i.e.* the delay is unjustified or it causes prejudicial effects.294\n\nMem. \u00b6 211\n\nMem. \u00b6 211.\n\nMem. \u00b6 212, citing *Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius* v. *Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL (Award, 23 April 2012); *and Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA)* v. *Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877 (Partial Award on the Merits, 30 March 2010).\n\nMem. \u00b6 213.\n\nReply, \u00b6 76.\n\n211.\n\nIn regard to the proper allocation of the burden of proof, Daimler quoted Professor Schreuer who has noted that Arbitration Rule 34(1) is the only rule that refers to rules of evidence, yet parties have attacked arbitral awards in annulment procedures for the way in which they deal with evidence and the burden of proof, alleging a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.295 Professor Schreuer further noted the distinction drawn in the *Wena* and the *CDC* cases between a tribunal\u2019s failure to follow the applicable rules of evidence and its discretion to form its view and weigh the evidence.296 According to Daimler, reversing this burden by imposing a higher burden exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power and can lead to annulment.297 Additionally, the tribunal\u2019s discretion under Arbitration Rule 34(1) is not unlimited and it cannot exercise this discretion without discussing or referring to the relevant evidence or respecting relevant legal standards.298\n\nMem. \u00b6 214.\n\nMem. \u00b6 214.\n\nMem. \u00b6 215.\n\nMem. \u00b6 216.\n\n212.\n\nThe right to a full and fair opportunity to be heard is one of the most basic concepts of fairness in adversarial proceedings and has been recognized by numerous committees as a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d).299 Unless this right is given to the parties at every stage of the proceeding, annulment is justified.300*\"Full\"* means the right to address every formal motion before the tribunal and every legal issue raised, and *\"fair\"* opportunity to be heard not only means that the right is given equally to both parties to respond adequately to arguments and evidence raised by the other, but that neither party is prejudiced by unexpected events.301 Daimler cited the *Fraport* committee, which annulled the relevant award on the basis that the tribunal had admitted certain documents by the respondent, did not give an opportunity to the parties to comment on the documents and then based much of its findings on them.302 According to Daimler, a party\u2019s right to be heard is *\"equally critical\"* when the Tribunal relies on evidence and arguments presented in another case by one of the parties without affording the other party the right to comment.303\n\nMem. \u00b6217.\n\nMem. \u00b6 218.\n\nMem. \u00b6 218.\n\nMem. \u00b6 219.\n\nMem. \u00b6 220.\n\n213.\n\nIn regard to the Tribunal\u2019s obligation to deliberate and render a decision on each question presented, Daimler stated that the obligation to deliberate is not explicit but is presupposed in ICSID Arbitration Rule 15(1) by establishing that deliberations shall take place in private and remain secret.304 A previous committee found that \"the requirement of deliberations could be considered a fundamental rule of procedure\", which must be real and not merely apparent.305 However, given the secret nature of deliberations, it is not possible to determine their seriousness, but a committee may be able to determine their effectiveness or whether they occurred.306 This is true for situations where an award is issued together with separate opinions that diverge on outcome-determinative points, evidencing that deliberations did not fulfill their purpose of reaching a majority on each question presented.307\n\nMem. \u00b622l.\n\nMem. \u00b6 221.\n\nMem. \u00b6 222.\n\nMem. \u00b6 223.\n\n214.\n\nDaimler argued that whether or not a there was a *\"departure\"* from a fundamental rule of procedure was a fact specific inquiry, which required the committee to look at what the tribunal said it was doing and what it was actually doing. Daimler added that in order to determine whether there was a *\"departure\"* the *ad hoc* committee must examine the full record308.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr., 37:2-7.\n\n215.\n\nWhether a departure was *\"serious\"* will be determined by the fact that the tribunal issued an award substantially different from the award it would have issued had the rule been observed, which only requires proof of the impact the issue may have had, or whether the party was deprived of the protection the rule intended to provide.309 Referring to annulment decisions in *Wena, Caratube* and *Pey Casado,* Daimler submitted that the applicant must demonstrate the impact the issue may have had on the award, and not that the result would have been different.310 Furthermore, Daimler argued that if a committee finds a serious departure from a fundamental rule, it has no discretion to uphold the award.311\n\nMem. \u00b6 225.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 37:12-38:6.\n\nMem. \u00b6 226.\n\n216.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Parties agree on most of the aspects of the legal standard applicable under Article 52(1)(d).312 The Parties agree that to be a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the departure \"must be substantial and deprive the party of the benefit or protection that the rule was intended to provide\", yet they disagree on whether the *\"seriousness\"* requirement entails proof that the departure in effect altered one or more of the Tribunal\u2019s decisions.313 Daimler disagreed with Argentina\u2019s argument which refers to *Repsol,* which in turn refers to the *Wena* committee. Argentina submitted that there must be proof that the Tribunal would have reached a different decision had it not been for the violation. According to Daimler, the *Pey Casado* committee also referred to the *Wena* decision and argued that it stood for the proposition that the applicant must prove the impact that the issue *\"may have had on the award\",* not the impact the tribunal\u2019s error actually had.314 According to Daimler, this analysis is more logical since it is impossible to prove the impact that an alternative scenario would have had. Furthermore, when an ICSID tribunal departs from a fundamental rule of procedure, such departure is serious and warrants annulment.315\n\nReply \u00b6 72.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73\n\nReply, \u00b6 73; Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 249:1-250:13.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nArgentina stated that the purpose of Article 52(1)(d) is to \"safeguard basic fairness and integrity of the arbitration process\".316 A departure from a fundamental rule is serious if it has deprived the party of the benefit or protection of the rule; it must be outcome-determinative.317 According to Argentina, what is important to determine is \"whether the underlying proceeding was fundamentally fair\" in respect of basic rules of procedure under international law.318\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 100.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 101.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 102; referring to the *Wena* committee\u2019s Decision on Annulment.\n\n218.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler failed to prove the elements it identifies as part of the analysis under Article 52(1)(d), namely: i) the *\"fundamental*\u00a0nature of the rule of procedure; ii) a finding that there was a departure from such fundamental rule and iii) a finding that the departure was *\"serious\"* or substantial319 and would have resulted in a different outcome.320\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 182:16-183:2\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.\n\n219.\n\nAccording to Argentina, there was no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Argentina\u2019s fifth jurisdictional objection. Indeed, the Award contains a description of the facts, a well-reasoned analysis of the applicable law and the defenses raised by Daimler.321 Daimler\u2019s claim is based on its disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s dismissal of its claims but it does not show that there was a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.322\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 110.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 111.\n\n**2. Prejudicial delay in rendering a jurisdictional decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by unduly delaying a decision on jurisdiction despite having the elements to rule on it since 2008. Indeed, on July 16, 2008 the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had enough information on the issue of jurisdiction, yet it made them plead the merits of the case. According to Daimler, the jurisdictional issues regarding the 18-month and the MFN clauses were purely legal, not factual, and thus, joinder was not necessary.323 This resulted in the Parties wasting time and resources pleading an issue on which the Tribunal ultimately decided it had no jurisdiction.324 Daimler argued that the \"fundamental\" nature of the right to a prompt and efficient resolution of a dispute is clear from the fact that its violation may constitute a denial of justice. In this case, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to issue its decision in a timely manner deprived Daimler during \"four years, one month and six days\" from pursuing annulment proceedings and/or litigation before Argentine courts.325 Furthermore, the delay in rendering a jurisdiction decision led the Tribunal to rely on key issues imported from the *ICS* award with regard to which Daimler never had an opportunity to be heard.326\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 231:11-12.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 228-229.\n\nMem. \u00b6 229.\n\nReply \u00b6 76.\n\n221.\n\nIn the Hearing on Annulment, Daimler argued that it \"suffered prejudice from the jurisdictional proceeding in ICS because the chair of both of the Tribunals, Professor Dupuy, was influenced by these new arguments and Legal Authorities that were presented by Argentina on the 18-month objection in the ICS context, which Daimler did not have an opportunity to rebut.\"327 Daimler argued that the delay led to a change of heart by the majority of the Tribunal that in 2012 decided to uphold the 18-month objection put forward by Argentina,328 although the same had not crossed their minds back in 2008.329\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 44:5-11.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 50:2-9.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 15:16 - 17:3; 41:1-3.\n\n222.\n\nDaimler argued that the Parties agree that in some circumstances, delay may render an award subject to annulment and that delay, in and of itself, may be insufficient to justify annulment.330 Daimler rejected as incorrect Argentina\u2019s submission that for a delay to justify annulment it must be equivalent to a denial of justice. Similarly, Argentina questioned Daimler\u2019s reliance on the *CDC* committee because while that committee found that even if the tribunal had erred in issuing the award when it did, it did not find that to be a ground for annulment.331 According to Daimler, this conclusion was reached because the committee in that case found that the applicant had failed to show how it was prejudiced by the alleged unreasonable delay. In this case, Daimler argued, it has shown the prejudice it suffered from the delay.332\n\nReply \u00b6 77.\n\nReply \u00b6 78.\n\nReply \u00b6 78.\n\n223.\n\nRegarding Argentina\u2019s argument that Daimler had proposed the joinder of the merits and jurisdiction phases and that it had conceded that there was no unfairness, Daimler argued that Argentina\u2019s submission is erroneous. According to Daimler, its first proposition of joinder was made in order to expedite the process and have the pleadings in both phases proceed *in tandem,* and it was only in this context that it stated that there would be no unfairness. Daimler\u2019s second proposal had been to only have two rounds on the jurisdictional issue and then, based on these pleadings, the Tribunal had to decide the issue of jurisdiction. As such, Argentina erred in its submission that Daimler cannot now object to the procedure adopted by the Tribunal.333\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 79-81.\n\n224.\n\nDaimler submitted that Argentina\u2019s next argument that Daimler waived its right to the length of the proceeding overlooks the record. On August 5, 2008 Daimler sent a letter to the Tribunal urging it to issue \"its decision on jurisdiction now...\" stating its concern on the further delay that might be caused. Thereafter, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 joining jurisdiction to merits and Daimler had no choice but to comply with the Order.334 Moreover, Daimler argued, it was not required to object during the drafting period since it had already objected to the joinder. The important aspect of the Award is the fact that it addressed only the jurisdictional issues for which the Tribunal had stated it had enough information since 2008. Arbitration Rule 27 applies only when a party \"knows or should have known that a rule has not been complied with\". Daimler did not and could not know that the Award would only address jurisdictional points and, thus, Rule 27 is not applicable.335\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\nReply \u00b6 84.\n\n225.\n\nDaimler agreed with Argentina\u2019s statement that tribunals have discretion to join the jurisdictional and merits phases, but it argued that this discretion is not unbridled and cannot be exercised arbitrarily.336 Daimler also disagreed with Argentina\u2019s suggestion that a tribunal exercising this discretion is immune from review under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.337 Additionally, Argentina\u2019s submission that the Award referred to citations of the merits pleadings does not reconcile the Award\u2019s delay when the Tribunal declared in 2008 that it had enough information. Occasional references to the merits pleadings regarding the jurisdictional objections did not justify a four-year delay in issuing the Award.338\n\nReply \u00b6 85.\n\nReply \u00b6 85.\n\nReply \u00b6 86.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nIn regard to the Tribunal\u2019s joinder of the jurisdictional objections to the merits of the case, Argentina submitted that this is a power that tribunals have been granted expressly under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.339 This power is further confirmed by the Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* as well as the Report of the Advisory Regional Meeting of Legal Experts in Investment Disputes.340\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 112.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 113-115.\n\n227.\n\nAs to Daimler\u2019s argument on the length of time it took the Tribunal to issue its Award, Argentina argued that, first, it was Daimler that initially insisted on the joinder of the objections to the merits. It cannot now complain that the Tribunal exercised a power envisaged in the Rules and invoked by Daimler.341 Second, Daimler cannot complain now about the length of the proceedings when it had expressly agreed with Argentina that the deadlines for the first submissions would be 180 days long.342 Third, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 27, Daimler waived its right to object because it did not complain before the Tribunal that its delay was a breach of a rule of procedure.343 Fourth, the joining of jurisdiction and merits implies that the Award could uphold a jurisdictional objection. Failure to have raised this objection at the time of the joinder entailed a waiver by Daimler.344 Additionally, it was appropriate for the Tribunal to join its objections to the merits because three of the five objections raised by Argentina concerned the merits of the case.345 As such, Argentina submitted that the Tribunal\u2019s joinder of the objections to jurisdiction to the merits of the case and the subsequent admission by the majority of one such objection was within the Tribunal\u2019s scope of competence and does not warrant annulment of the Award.346 In any case, the duration of the proceedings between the first hearing and the issuance of the Award was five years and seven months, which is not unusual for ICSID timelines.347\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 25.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 26.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 27.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 28.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 29.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 128:17-21.\n\n228.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina referred to Daimler\u2019s argument that relies on the *Pey Casado* case regarding the concept of \"*unreasonable\"* delay examined in the context *of \"denial of justice\"* claims. According to Argentina, the conclusion in the *Pey Casado* case is not applicable to the present case because the alleged delay in the Award did not result in the lack of treatment of Daimler\u2019s claims.348 Daimler\u2019s subjective belief of the appropriate period to consider the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision as timely, cannot serve as grounds for annulment where the issues claimed by the Parties were analysed and decided by the Tribunal.349 Argentina submitted that Daimler\u2019s complaint was about only one of the five jurisdictional objections. It further submitted that the time it must have taken to prepare the Dissenting and Separate Opinions must also be considered as that probably added to the time of issuance of the Award.350\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 120-121.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 122.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 123.\n\n229.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler centered its request for annulment on the *CDC* case, which, according to Daimler, left open the door for consideration of unreasonable delays as grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d). However, Daimler failed to mention that the committee in that case stated that \"[e]ven had the Tribunal erred in issuing the Award when it did, the Committee would see no basis for annulling the Award as a result\".351\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 124.\n\n230.\n\nCiting *Wena,* Argentina submitted that Daimler failed to demonstrate how the decision would have been different if it had been issued earlier352, depriving it of the benefit it would have received.353\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 193:11-21.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 125.\n\n231.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina states that Daimler\u2019s argument on the dismissal of the claim on jurisdictional grounds would mean that every time a tribunal joined jurisdictional objections to the merits it would be forced to reject the jurisdictional objections because otherwise its decision would be unduly delayed.354 Such a result would not only be absurd but would also go against the tribunal\u2019s powers under the ICSID Convention and Rules.355 It would be contrary to the manner of exercise of authority as set forth by international courts and tribunals, as well as the common practice of ICSID tribunals.356 Argentina further argued that Daimler had not cited a single case which supported annulment on the ground of delay in issuing an award.357\n\nRej. \u00b6 84; Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 124:2-9.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 84-87.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 90-91; According to Argentina, the Committee in the *CDC* case cited by the Applicant\u2019s rejected the argument of undue delay and did not leave the door open to such annulment had the evidence been different.\n\n232.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler mischaracterized the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3. The Tribunal did not state in Procedural Order No. 3 that it had enough information to decide the jurisdictional issues nor did it close the discussion thereon. The Tribunal simply stated that it would not hold a jurisdictional hearing as it had \"received enough information on the positions of the parties on the issue of jurisdiction as they have been so far developed by them in their respective written pleadings\"358, leaving the joinder to the merits as an issue to be decided in a further procedural order. Following the Tribunal\u2019s decision to join jurisdiction to merits, there were discussions over jurisdictional issues and both merits and objections to jurisdiction were dealt with at the hearing.359 The decision taken by the Tribunal is not different from that of other ICSID Tribunals.360\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nRej. \u00b6 93.\n\nRej. \u00b6 94.\n\n**3. Imposition of an improperly-heightened burden of proof**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n233.\n\nDaimler argued that the Award further departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by applying an improperly heightened burden of proof in its interpretation of the expression of consent in the BIT. Instead of interpreting the BIT\u2019s meaning in accordance with the VCLT, the Award imposed an affirmative evidence requirement on Daimler to prove that the Parties to the BIT intended the MFN clauses to include dispute resolution.361 According to Daimler, reversing the burden of proof was an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to handle evidence and to form its own view of the relevance to be accorded to evidence under Arbitration Rule 34.362 The ICJ has also recognized a ruling of this nature as contrary to a fundamental rule of procedure founded upon the *\"basic principle\"* of *\"the equality between the parties to the dispute\"*,363 Applying the ICJ\u2019s observation to this case, Daimler submitted that \"\u2019establishing or proving\u2019 the \u2018rules of international law\u2019 contained in the Germany-Argentina BIT \u2018[could not] be imposed upon any of the parties.\u2019 \"364\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 215-216.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nMem. \u00b6 235.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal imposed on Daimler this \"affirmative evidence\" requirement relying on a single quote from the ICJ\u2019s *Djibouti* v. *France* judgment *(\"Djibouti\"* judgment), a decision that first appeared in the Award and on which Daimler was never given an opportunity to comment.365 As put in the Hearing on Annulment, Daimler was held to a higher standard without its knowledge because the higher standard was imported from the *ICS* proceeding.366 Additionally, the quote relied on by the Award was taken out of context and imposed no such burden upon the Parties. The ICJ merely discerned the scope of consent to jurisdiction of the parties and did not impose a burden of proof on the respondent to present affirmative evidence. The analysis undertaken by the ICJ in the *Djibouti* judgment mirrors its analysis in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction 1974 (\u2018Fisheries\")* case, where the court determined the scope of consent of the parties by interpreting the consent in light of the VCLT and did not impose a burden on the parties.367 Daimler stated that this was the approach that Judge Brower found appropriate for the Tribunal in this case.368\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 236-237.\n\nHearing on Annulment; Tr. 240:11-21.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 238-241; Reply, \u00b688.\n\nMem. \u00b6 242.\n\n235.\n\nDaimler argued that the Tribunal\u2019s misplaced reliance on the *Djibouti* judgment led to its imposing an improperly heightened burden of proof on Daimler and demonstrated that its use as an authority for the *\"affirmative evidence\"* requirement was crucial and, as such, Daimler should have had an opportunity to submit its views.369 Imposing on Daimler the *\"affirmative evidence\"* burden to prove Argentina\u2019s expression of consent to the BIT was a breach of the fundamental rule of procedure that parties could not be required to establish or prove rules of international law. The Tribunal thereby breached *\"the basic principle\"* of equality of the parties.370 Daimler stated that the departure was *\"serious\"* because it imposed on it an improper burden on the essential issue of consent to arbitration, which was an issue that could have led to a substantially different outcome in the Award.371 Additionally, it deprived Daimler of the protection afforded by the rule, *i.e.* equality of the parties.372\n\nMem. \u00b6 243.\n\nMem. \u00b6 244.\n\nMem. \u00b6 245; Reply. \u00b6 95.\n\nMem. \u00b6 245.\n\n236.\n\nDaimler further argued that it is irrelevant whether the Tribunal intended to impose the standard only on itself rather than on Daimler. The establishment of the affirmative evidence standard was a *de facto* change in the burden of proof that ultimately led the Tribunal to review the evidence presented by Daimler on the issue of consent under a more stringent standard.373\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 60:8 - 61:9.\n\n237.\n\nIn response to Argentina\u2019s argument, Daimler submitted that the fact that consent is important does not justify imposing an improper burden on Daimler because consent is a matter of treaty interpretation, which is the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility.374 According to Daimler, the Tribunal \"advances a novel theory\" that when determining consent to a treaty, fundamental rules of treaty interpretation no longer apply. However, the ICSID Convention requires tribunals to apply the applicable law and forbids them from departing from fundamental rules of procedure.375 Argentina criticized the authorities cited by Daimler as misleading because the quote from the ICJ *Fisheries* case referred to the principle of *iura novit curia.* According to Daimler, the criticism is unfair because Daimler did quote the entire passage and, more importantly, this principle is both consistent and relevant to the principle of equality between the parties, which was made clear by the ICJ in the cases376 of *Fisheries* and *Military and Paramilitary Activities377* cases. According to Daimler, *\"in an attempt to distract\"* Argentina also argued that Daimler failed to prove a violation of Arbitration Rule 34, yet this rule does not encompass all rules of evidence and procedure and does not address the burden of proof. As such, it is irrelevant to a claim of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.378\n\nReply \u00b6 89.\n\nReply \u00b6 90.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua* v. *U.S.),* 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27).\n\nReply \u00b6 94.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Award did not commit an \"annullable error\" in requiring Daimler to produce evidence on the interpretation of the expression of consent in the BIT. Indeed, the Tribunal explained the importance of consent to the interpretation of the Treaty and its analysis showed that this evidentiary requirement is not abusive or excessive.379\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 116.\n\n239.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina argued, that the principle of equality between the parties was not breached by the Tribunal and Daimler\u2019s reference to the *Fisheries* case was misleading, as this case did not refer to this principle but to the *iura novit curia* principle.380 According to Argentina, Daimler failed to prove that the Tribunal breached the principle of equality between the parties by upholding Argentina\u2019s fifth jurisdictional objection.381\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 117.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 118.\n\n240.\n\nContrary to Daimler\u2019s allegation, Argentina never acknowledged a wrongful imposition of the burden of proof upon Daimler.382 The Tribunal did not impose an improper burden of proof on Daimler and the paragraph cited to this effect merely supports the undisputed proposition that State consent to any international settlement procedure must be conclusively established. This is further made clear in the following paragraph where the Tribunal assumes such responsibility.383 Furthermore, Argentina argued that the Tribunal\u2019s reference to the *Djibouti* judgement - which is only cited once in a footnote - relates to the need to determine the scope of the State\u2019s consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and is not relied upon for the burden of proof.384\n\nRej. \u00b6 96.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 97-99.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 100-101.\n\n241.\n\nAccording to Argentina, it is evident from the Award that the Tribunal ascertained the relevant law, engaged in an interpretive analysis pursuant to the VCLT and applied the applicable law.385\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.\n\n242.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Daimler further failed to prove that the departure was serious. Indeed, the Tribunal determined the scope of the clauses in the Treaty and interpreted them, so any alleged change in the burden of proof would not have had a substantial impact on the decision.386\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\n**4. Denial of a full and fair opportunity to be heard**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n243.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the Award\u2019s reliance on the *Djibouti* judgment as the sole authority for the *\"affirmative evidence\"* burden also evidences the Tribunal\u2019s breach of Daimler\u2019s right to a full and fair opportunity to be heard. Daimler submits that a full opportunity implies that both parties receive the opportunity to address every legal issue raised by the case; and a fair opportunity means that each party is allowed to respond adequately to arguments presented by the other and that it is not prejudiced by unexpected events.387\n\nMem. \u00b6 218, \u00b6\u00b6 236-238.\n\n244.\n\nAccordingly, even after the briefing phase is closed, the parties should be able to controvert new evidence on which the tribunal intends to rely on as well as arguments and evidence that were submitted in another case by one of the parties.388 Daimler argued that the *Djibouti* judgment was neither submitted nor referred to by either party in this case, but seemed to have been discussed in the *ICS* case. In that proceeding, Argentina submitted the *Djibouti* judgment for the proposition that consent must be *\"unequivocal\".* The case was later cited in the *ICS* award, which reveals that the Tribunal applied the same *\"affirmative evidence\"* requirement as in the present case.389 Similarly, the World Bank Guidelines were relied upon in the Award even though they were not submitted by the Parties or addressed during the hearing. Although the Award stated that they were not determinative for the issue of the Contracting Parties\u2019 intentions, Professor Bello Janeiro seems to have treated them as applicable law in his Separate Opinion.390 Daimler argued that given these circumstances, the Tribunal was required to reopen the proceedings and hear both Parties *\"on the* *arbitrators\u2019 new thesis\"* and the evidence it relied upon391, as it actually did in 2010 in regard to another of the jurisdictional objections.392\n\nMem. \u00b622O.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 247-248.\n\nMem. \u00b6249.\n\nMem. \u00b6 255.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 251:15 - 255:4.\n\n245.\n\nICSID tribunals retain some ability to rely on evidence or arguments not introduced by the parties to the extent that the parties receive a full and fair opportunity to be heard if the evidence or arguments are determinative or constitute the sole basis or authority invoked by the tribunal for the outcome, and are not merely duplicative or corroborative.393 Daimler stated that two of the three awards annulled in ICSID proceedings under Article 52(1) (d) of the ICSID Convention were annulled due to the fact that the tribunal failed to afford the parties a full and fair opportunity to be heard on evidence that resulted decisive in the award.394\n\nMem. \u00b6 250.\n\nMem. \u00b6 250-251; citing to *Fraport,* and *Pey Casado.*\n\n246.\n\nContrary to Argentina\u2019s contention, Daimler argued that the fact that the reference to the *Djibouti* judgement was preceded by the term *\"e.g.\"* does not negate that this was the only authority on which the Tribunal based its determination that Daimler bore the burden of proving Argentina\u2019s consent to the BIT.395 Also in response to Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Daimler stated that it did not argue that the mere reference to the *ICS* decision warrants annulment. Instead, its reference to the *ICS* case was noted because it appeared that the *Djibouti* judgement had been introduced in the *ICS* case and found its way into the Award without input from Daimler.396 This is also the case for the World Bank Guidelines, which Professor Bello Janeiro found *\"particularly revealing\"*,397 On this point Argentina only argued that there was extensive discussion on whether or not consent existed, but this says nothing on whether the Parties discussed these two points.398 In sum, Daimler submitted that while Argentina had the chance to address the *Djibouti* judgment as well as the World Bank Guidelines during the *ICS* proceedings, Daimler was not given such an opportunity during this arbitration.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n\nReply \u00b6 101.\n\nReply \u00b6 102.\n\nReply \u00b6 102.\n\n247.\n\nFurthermore, Daimler notes that the Award and the Separate Opinion refer to several post-July 2008 references, despite the fact that the Tribunal had told the parties in July 2008, that it had enough information on the question of jurisdiction.399 Daimler argued that in light of these new materials, the Tribunal was obliged to request additional submissions by the Parties and its failure to do so amounts to a denial of a full opportunity to be heard that warrants annulment under Article 52(1)(d).400\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 104-110.\n\nReply \u00b6 110; Hearing on Annulment, Tr. 53:\\4 - 54:2; 56:16-18.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nIn regard to the Tribunal\u2019s alleged reliance on the *Djibouti* judgment, Argentina argued that this reference is made at the end of a long footnote by way of an example. Furthermore, it was cited in response to the distinction drawn in Judge Brower\u2019s Dissenting Opinion between consent to submit to a specific dispute resolution method and the scope of this consent.401 Likewise, Daimler\u2019s claim that the Tribunal incorrectly referred to the affirmative evidence requirement of consent is misplaced as consent is the *\"cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\"* and the existence of consent was extensively discussed before the Tribunal.402 The Award is very eloquent in paragraph 175 on Daimler\u2019s alleged inconsistency between the fundamental principle of consent to international jurisdiction, the need for a party invoking it to prove it and the interpretation rules contained in the VCLT.403\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 191:1 - 8.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 21.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 21.\n\n249.\n\nArgentina stated that Daimler was not deprived of the right to be heard. Daimler only contends that it was not given the opportunity to comment on certain legal authorities cited by the Tribunal, which were publicly available and some of which were in the record.404 However, the relevant question here is that during the proceedings the Parties widely discussed the relevant issues in relation to which the Tribunal cited the legal authorities.405 As such, the Tribunal was not limited by the submissions of the Parties in regard to the legal authorities. This is further confirmed by the principle of *iura novit curia,* whereby the Tribunal had the duty to consider on its own initiative the rules of international law and legal authorities relevant to the case.406 Furthermore, Argentina claimed that Daimler did not even argue that such authorities exceed the *\"legal framework\"* established by the Parties\u2019 arguments. In fact, the Parties extensively discussed the issues in relation to which the Tribunal cited or invoked the legal authorities in question.407 Specifically, the proposition that the State\u2019s consent cannot be presumed - which, according to Argentina, is what *\"affirmative evidence\"* means - was discussed by the Parties in the hearing with reference to the *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14) decision and also addressed by Argentina in its post-hearing brief in reference to the *\"Armed Activities Case in the Territory of Congo\"*,408 Moreover, the Tribunal did not need the *ICS* case record to have access to these authorities because they were publicly available and the Tribunal could consider them *sua sponte.409*\n\nRej.\u00b6109.\n\nRej. \u00b6 111.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.\n\nRej. \u00b6 115.\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 284:17 -291:11.\n\nRej. \u00b6 116.\n\n250.\n\nContrary to Daimler\u2019s argument, this case is not similar to that of *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1) (Second Decision on Annulment) because in the present case the Tribunal did not make any decisions on a request from Argentina without hearing Daimler.410\n\nRej. \u00b6 121.\n\n251.\n\nRegarding the reference to legal authorities subsequent to July 2008, Argentina stated that the Tribunal did not close the discussion on the jurisdictional issue, but simply considered that it had received enough information on the position of the Parties *\"so far developed\"*, and therefore a hearing to address exclusively jurisdictional issues was not required411. Following the joinder of the jurisdictional objections to the merits, jurisdictional issues were further discussed, both at the hearing and thereafter.412\n\nRej. \u00b6 124\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 122-125.\n\n252.\n\nThe cases cited by Daimler in support of its argument were clearly distinguishable. In *Fraport* the tribunal took into account essential factual issues, specifically prohibiting the parties from making submissions on such material and then relied on this factual material to decide the case.413 In *Pey Casado* the committee found that the tribunal decided issues not raised by the parties and, thus, went beyond the legal framework.414 This is not the case here. Daimler only contends that it was not given an opportunity to comment on legal authorities cited by the Tribunal in relation to matters that had been widely discussed by the Parties.415 Additionally, Daimler failed to show that this alleged breach was serious. Indeed, the Tribunal already knew the Parties\u2019 positions on these issues so that the lack of opportunity to comment on the authorities could not have had an impact on the Award.416\n\nRej. \u00b6 127.\n\nRej. \u00b6 128.\n\nRej.\u00b6129.\n\nRej. \u00b6 130.\n\n**5. Failure by the Tribunal to deliberate and render a majority decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Daimler\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n253.\n\nDaimler argued that the Tribunal also breached a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to deliberate and render a majority decision. Daimler stated that although deliberations are not expressly required under the ICSID Rules, they are fundamental to an ICSID arbitration and \"annulment is nevertheless justified when it is apparent that deliberations have not occurred, have not been meaningful, or have not achieved their purpose.\"417\n\nMem. \u00b6 256.\n\n254.\n\nIn accordance with Article 48 of the ICSID Convention, deliberations are intended to ensure that all questions submitted to a tribunal are decided by majority vote418. During deliberations the tribunal seeks to reach a majority decision on each *\"question submitted\"* by the parties; arbitrators cannot simply *\"agree to disagree\"*,419 Daimler argued that it is evident in this case that on some of the issues deliberations took place but a review of the Award and the Separate Opinions reveals that \"no deliberations took place between the two arbitrators who declined jurisdiction\".420 Daimler stated that upon the Award\u2019s own admission, the MFN discussion was taken from the analysis of a different award and was, therefore, not subject to deliberations.421 Additionally, Professor Bello Janeiro stated in his Separate Opinion that the Award was fully drafted and he simply \"subscribe[d] to the decision proposed by the President of the Tribunal\".422\n\nMem. \u00b6 257.\n\nMem. \u00b6 258.\n\nMem. \u00b6 259.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 260-261.\n\nMem. \u00b6 261.\n\n255.\n\nDaimler argued that if the Committee were to find the above evidence insufficient, the divergence of opinions between the two *\"majority\"* arbitrators on the interpretation of the term *\"treatment\"* in the MFN clauses was proof of the failure to deliberate.423 According to Daimler, in spite of the Award\u2019s recognition of the two-prong test (see paragraph 35 above), the Award and the Separate Opinion reflect different positions in regard to each prong. Indeed, the Award recognizes that the World Bank Guidelines are soft law and do not shed direct light on the matter, whereas the Separate Opinion treats these Guidelines as applicable law.424 Similarly, the Award distinguishes between State practice and investment case law and states that investor-State jurisprudence cannot be evidence of the understanding of States. As such, the Award looks to other textual evidence to discern the meaning of *\"treatment\"*. However, Professor Bello Janeiro in his Separate Opinion relied on previous investment case law, such as the *Wintershall* case, as well as apparent statements by States, including Argentina. Daimler argued that this shows Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s opinion was *\"divorced\"* from the intention of the Contracting Parties to the BIT.425 Furthermore, Daimler stated that Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s decision was also *\"divorced'* from the principle of contemporaneity because, apart from relying on the World Bank Guidelines, he relied on evidence almost exclusively post-dating the BIT negotiations.426\n\nMem. \u00b6 262.\n\nMem. \u00b6 264.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 265-267.\n\nMem. \u00b6268.\n\n256.\n\nAccording to Daimler, despite the fact that the Award concluded that the term *\"treatment\"* depended on the understanding of the Contracting Parties at the time the BIT was negotiated, only the Tribunal\u2019s President purported to apply this analysis to the conclusion that dispute resolution was not within the term *\"treatment\"* in the MFN clauses of the BIT.427 Given the importance of this term to the Award\u2019s conclusion and the fact that the analysis turned on those two elements, the absence of a majority decision on each of those elements constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.428\n\nMem. \u00b6 269.\n\nMem. \u00b6 270.\n\n257.\n\nAccording to Daimler, Professor Bello Janeiro enjoyed a degree of discretion to add supplementary comments or reasons, but these needed to be consistent with the Award. That not being the case, the deliberations cannot be said to have fulfilled their purpose.429 Contrary to Argentina\u2019s contention, Daimler\u2019s argument was not merely that the Tribunal cited the *ICS* case, but that the President\u2019s copy/paste of the *ICS* reasoning showed that the Tribunal failed to deliberate and agree on a line of reasoning, because it merely imported into the Award the product of deliberations of a different Tribunal and did not reach a genuine majority.430\n\nReply \u00b6 112.\n\nReply \u00b6 113.\n\n**(ii) Argentina\u2019s arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nArgentina submitted that Daimler\u2019s arguments on the *ICS* decision are made simply to divert attention from the jurisdictional objection that was upheld in the Award. Indeed, Daimler failed to prove that any question on the fifth jurisdictional objection was not discussed by the Parties during this proceeding irrespective of whether or not it appears in the *ICS* decision.431\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 119.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to Argentina since deliberations are secret, Daimler conveniently assumed that the Tribunal failed to deliberate meaningfully. However, there is no indication in either opinion to this effect.432 Furthermore, the fact that the President of the Tribunal submitted a proposal to which arbitrator Bello Janeiro subscribed is in accordance with the ICSID rules which recognize the President\u2019s leading role in deliberations.433 The fact that certain paragraphs of the *ICS* award are transcribed does not alter this position.434\n\nRej. \u00b6 132.\n\nRej. \u00b6 133.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 135-137.\n\n**6. The Committee's Decision on the Alleged Serious Departure From Fundamental Rules of Procedure**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Standard**\n--------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree that a decision to annul under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention comprises three elements: (i) the identification of a *\"fundamental rule of procedure\";* (ii) a finding that the tribunal has departed from such a fundamental rule; and (iii) a finding that the departure was serious.\n\n261.\n\nAs to the seriousness of the departure, Daimler submitted that for departure from a fundamental rule of procedure to be serious it must either (i) have the potential to cause the tribunal to render an award substantially different than that it would have rendered if the fundamental rule had been observed, or (ii) deprive a party of the benefit or protection that the rule was intended to provide.435 Argentina agreed that for a departure to be serious it must deprive the party of the benefit or protection that the rule intended to provide.436 However, Argentina submitted that the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure was serious when it led a tribunal to a result substantially different from the result it would have reached had the departure not occurred.437 Moreover, the applicant in an annulment proceeding must prove that a different result would have been reached otherwise438.\n\nMem. \u00b6 225.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 101.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 104.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 104.\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee considers that under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, a departure from a procedural rule justifies annulment of the award provided that (i) the given departure is serious; and (ii) the rule in question is fundamental.\n\n263.\n\nA departure is serious if it deprives a party of the protection afforded by the said rule. In the words of the *MINE* annulment committee:\n\n\"5.05 A first comment on this provision concerns the term \u2018serious\u2019. In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"439\n\n*MINE,* \u00b6 5.05.\n\n264.\n\nIn other words, for a violation of the procedural rule to be serious, such violation \"must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.\"440\n\n*CDC,* \u00b6 49.\n\n265.\n\nWith respect to the rules of procedure that are to be considered fundamental, the Committee considers that they are the rules of natural justice *i.e.,* rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding. As pointed out by the *CDC* annulment committee:\n\n\"A departure is serious where it is \u2018substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide. \u2019 [... ] As for what rules of procedure are fundamental, the drafters of the Convention refrained from attempting to enumerate them, but the consensus seems to be that only rules of natural justice - rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding - are fundamental. Not all ICSID Arbitration Rules are fundamental in this sense.\"441\n\n*CDC,* \u00b6 49.\n\n266.\n\nThe applicant, in this case Daimler, had the burden of proving both that (i) the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a procedural rule; and (ii) that the said rule was fundamental.\n\n267.\n\nThe Committee will now address the four actions of the Tribunal that, according to Daimler, seriously violated fundamental rules of procedure.\n\n**(ii) Alleged Prejudicial Delay in Rendering a Jurisdictional Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nDaimler submitted that on July 16, 2008, the Tribunal indicated that it had enough information on the positions of the Parties on the issue of jurisdiction. However, it did not issue its jurisdictional decision at that time, but joined jurisdiction and merits and \"mandated a long series of pleadings, oral argumentation, and witness examinations exclusively addressing the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute, which delayed a decision on the jurisdictional issues for an additional four years, one month and six days. [...] These extensive and expensive proceedings in the end amounted to a nullity and an egregious waste of resources, given the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to decide any merits issues at all\".442\n\nMem. \u00b6 229.\n\n269.\n\nAccording to Daimler, it was clearly prejudiced by the delay because, (i) had the Tribunal issued its jurisdictional decision in time, Daimler would have devoted its time and resources to annulment proceedings, and/or to litigate the matter before the Argentinian courts;443 and (ii) the delay \"led the Tribunal to rely on key sources imported from another arbitration, with respect to which Daimler Financial never had an opportunity to be heard.\"444\n\nMem. \u00b6 230; Reply \u00b6 76.\n\nReply \u00b6 76.\n\n270.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree that a delay *per se* would not merit annulment, but that impermissible or unreasonable delay that causes prejudice to a party may, depending on the circumstances, open the door for annulment.\n\n271.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s opinion, the record of these annulment proceedings does not support Daimler\u2019s allegations and therefore the Committee will dismiss such allegations.\n\n272.\n\nAccording to the text of Procedural Order No. 3, on July 16, 2008 the Tribunal did not decide, as contended by Daimler, that it had enough information to make a determination on the issue of jurisdiction. In the said Procedural Order the Tribunal considered that no separate hearing was required for jurisdiction given that it had received enough information through the written submissions Therefore, the Tribunal cancelled the hearing on jurisdiction originally scheduled for December 5 and 6, 2008.\n\n273.\n\nIt was in Procedural Order No. 4, dated August 27, 2008 that the Tribunal decided to join jurisdiction and merits.\n\n274.\n\nNothing in the record of these annulment proceedings suggests that as a result of Procedural Order No. 3, or the decision to join jurisdiction and the merits, the Tribunal closed the submissions on jurisdiction or prevented the Parties from presenting further arguments or allegations on jurisdiction. On the contrary, the record indicates, and during the Hearing on Annulment it became even clearer, that after July 16, 2008 the Parties further discussed the objections on jurisdiction, including debates in the hearing that took place from November 30 through December 7, 2009, where merits and jurisdictions were addressed.445\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 312:21 - 317:8; Tr. 342:21 - 343:9.\n\n275.\n\nThe Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs on March 29,2010 - Respondent - and March 30, 2010 - Claimant.446 Thereafter the Tribunal requested some additional information from the Parties on August 20, 2010 and the Parties responded on 28 September 2010.447\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n276.\n\nIn the proceedings that ended with the Award, Argentina submitted five different jurisdictional objections. In the Award the Tribunal referred to each one of these objections, and after stating the positions of the Parties it rejected four objections and accepted the fifth titled \"The Most-Favored Nation Clause does not Authorize the Claimant to Bypass the Requirements of Articles 10(2) and 10(3) of the Treaty\". It was not, therefore, a case where, as suggested by Daimler, the Tribunal decided to postpone the decision on one objection to jurisdiction, have the Parties plead merits for months, and then issue an Award based on that particular objection to jurisdiction.\n\n277.\n\nA reading of the Award suggests that at least some of the objections to jurisdiction could not have been decided without discussing the facts, or additional evidence related to the merits of the case. But in any event, it is not the duty of the Committee to second-guess the reasons that the Tribunal may have had to cancel the separate hearing on jurisdiction, or to join jurisdiction and merits or not to decide all the objections to jurisdiction without addressing the merits. That would require, on the one hand, a review of the entire file and all the circumstances existing at the time each such decision was made, and on the other, a review of the reasons that the Tribunal had to conduct the proceedings in the manner it did. Even if the Committee carried out this exercise it would serve no purpose. An extensive review of this nature while it may be permissible in appellate proceedings which allow a review of both errors of fact and law is clearly beyond the scope of annulment proceedings.\n\n278.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, the Committee considers that there was no undue or unreasonable delay in issuing the Award as claimed by Daimler and therefore, no violation of a fundamental rule of procedure that merits annulment of the Award.\n\n**(iii) Alleged Imposition of an improperly-heightened burden of proof**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nDaimler attacked the wording of paragraph 175 of the Award as an imposition on Daimler of an *\"affirmative evidence\"* requirement to prove the consent of the State Parties to the BIT to include dispute resolution within the scope of the MFN clause.448\n\nMem. \u00b6 234.\n\n280.\n\nDaimler, citing the ICJ *Fisheries* case, argued that the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the parties and that such a rule is founded upon the basic principle of the equality of the parties to the dispute.449 The concept of *\"rules of international law\"* includes rules contained in treaties binding on the parties. Therefore, by imposing on Daimler the burden of proving the scope of the consent of the Contracting States to the BIT the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.450\n\nMem. \u00b6 234.\n\nMem. \u00b6 235.\n\n281.\n\nThe Committee considers that - as rightly stated by Argentina451 - a reading of paragraph 175 of the Award in its proper context together with the paragraphs which immediately follow, including paragraph 177 of the Award, makes clear that the Tribunal did not impose a burden of proof on Daimler, much less a heightened and unacceptable burden of proof, that resulted in a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 98-101.\n\n282.\n\nParagraph 175 of the Award reads:\n\n\"[I]t is not possible to presume that consent has been given by a state. Rather, *the existence of consent must be established.* This may be accomplished either through an express declaration of consent to an international tribunal 's jurisdiction or on the basis of acts \u2018conclusively establishing\u2019 such consent.[321] What is not permissible is to presume a state\u2019s consent by reason of the state\u2019s failure to proactively disavow the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Non-consent is the default rule; consent is the exception. Establishing consent therefore requires affirmative evidence. But the impossibility of basing a state\u2019s consent on a mere presumption should not be taken as a \u2018strict\u2019 or \u2018restrictive\u2019 approach in terms of interpretation of dispute resolution clauses. It is simply the result of respect for the *rule according to which state consent is the incontrovertible requisite for any kind of international settlement procedure.\"* (Emphasis added)\n\n283.\n\nParagraph 177 of the Award states the following:\n\n\"In addressing the different issues raised by the disputing parties in the present case, the *main task of the Tribunal is therefore to identify the true will of the Federal* *Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina as it was stated in the 1991 Treaty* which they agreed upon for the \u2018promotion and reciprocal protection of investments\u2019. In particular, *the Tribunal must determine whether the State Parties, in concluding the German-Argentine BIT, intended to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal* in circumstances wherein the investor has satisfied the procedural requirements for international dispute resolution under a Comparator Treaty but has not fully complied with the investor-State dispute resolution process laid down in the Basic Treaty.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n284.\n\nAs already observed, the Award must be read in its context, and the paragraphs and sentences cannot be interpreted or given a meaning in isolation from the section in which they are included or the related paragraphs that provide them context. A reading of the above quoted paragraphs and a review of the Award makes it clear that the Tribunal did not impose a burden of proof on either Party; it simply stated that consent of the State cannot be presumed and therefore must be established. Thereafter the Tribunal noted that it was its duty, based on the different issues raised by the Parties, to identify the true will of the States when expressing their consent to the BIT.\n\n285.\n\nIt follows from the above that the Tribunal did not impose an improper burden of proof on Daimler that amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**(iv) Alleged Denial of a Full and Fair Opportunity to be Heard**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nDaimler submitted that it was denied a fair opportunity to be heard because the Tribunal relied on the *Djibouti* judgment as the sole authority for the affirmative evidence requirement. Such decision was never discussed or presented in the arbitration between Daimler and Argentina and appeared only in the Award. The *Djibouti* judgment was imported into the Award by the President of the Tribunal from the *ICS* case where Argentina had the opportunity to be heard with respect to such opinion.452\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 236-237; \u00b6\u00b6 247-248.\n\n287.\n\nDaimler also submitted that it was denied a fair opportunity to be heard because the Tribunal informed the Parties in 2008 that the Tribunal had received enough information from the parties on the issue of jurisdiction, and then introduced and referenced a number of cases in the Award and Separate Opinion that did not even exist in July 2008.453\n\nReply \u00b6 104.\n\n288.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that there was no serious violation of the fundamental right of Daimler to be heard in the proceedings that ended with the Award.\n\n289.\n\nThe *Djibouti* judgment is mentioned once in the Award, in a footnote454 and its purpose is to respond to an argument advanced in the Dissenting Opinion. After indicating that State consent is the incontrovertible requisite for any kind of international settlement procedure, the Award states: \"What is true of the very existence of consent to have recourse to a specific international dispute resolution mechanism is also true as far as the scope of this consent is concerned\". Footnote 325 was inserted after this sentence and reads as follows:\n\n\"The Dissenting Opinion attempts to draw a neat dividing line between the establishment of consent to be bound by a specific dispute resolution mechanism and the scope of that consent, suggesting that the former can be founded on purely \"formal indicia\" such as the fact of signature and ratification of a treaty, while the latter is a matter of textual interpretation (Dissenting Opinion at n. 15). This distinction is a red herring. If the interpretive analysis reveals that the scope of Argentina\u2019s consent to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal does not extend to the matter at hand, it is difficult to understand in what sense the State\u2019s consent to submit to that jurisdiction will have nevertheless been \"established\" on the basis of the State\u2019s mere signature and ratification of the Treaty. The relevant question is not whether the Treaty was ratified - which it was - but what precisely the States consented to in ratifying the Treaty. See e.g. *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti* v. *France),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 177, at paras. 65ff (finding it necessary to determine the \"extent of the consent given by the Parties to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction\").\n\nAward, Footnote 325.\n\n290.\n\nThe *Djibouti* judgment is not, as Daimler contends, the legal authority on the basis of which the Tribunal required a heightened burden of proof from Daimler. Its text and context clearly indicates, in the opinion of the Committee, that it was mentioned to support a response to the Dissenting Opinion on the matter of how the Tribunal should interpret the provisions of the BIT to establish the existence and scope of consent. It is clear from the record that the Parties made extensive submissions on the issue of consent in relation to jurisdiction. A single reference to an opinion, in a footnote responding to the Dissenting Opinion cannot be, in the context in which it was written, considered as a legal authority that imposed an undue burden of proof on Daimler, or as a legal authority with respect to which Daimler should have been provided an opportunity to be heard.\n\n291.\n\nAs for the submission that the Tribunal informed the Parties in 2008 that it had received enough information on the positions of the Parties on the issue of jurisdiction, and then introduced and referenced a number of cases in the Award and Separate Opinion that did not even exist as of July 2008 without giving Daimler the opportunity to be heard on those authorities, the record in this annulment proceedings does not support Daimler\u2019s contention.\n\n292.\n\nAs already observed in paragraph 274 above, by joining the merits and jurisdiction the Tribunal did not close the submissions on jurisdiction or prevent the Parties from making further arguments or allegations on jurisdiction. The Parties, in fact, referred to the jurisdictional objections in the hearing and included jurisdictional submissions in their posthearing briefs.\n\n293.\n\nTurning to the authorities quoted by Professor Bello Janeiro in the Separate Opinion, and the effect thereof on the Award, the Committee has already addressed this matter in paragraphs 107 to 120 above. The reasons stated there are sufficient to reject the claim that the reference in the Separate Opinion to authorities other than those presented by the Parties constitutes a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n294.\n\nAs to the post-July 2008 authorities cited in the Award, the Committee has three observations: First, they were publicly available and either Party could access them. Second, they were available before the Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs and nothing prevented the Parties from relying on such authorities in support of their arguments. Third, the Parties had extensively discussed the issues on which the legal authorities were cited in the Award.\n\n295.\n\nThis Committee is of the view that an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte,* rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it. This is exactly the case here. Daimler had the opportunity to make submissions on all the relevant issues related to objections to jurisdiction. Once such an opportunity was provided the Tribunal was not obliged to confine itself to only those authorities, which had been cited by the parties. No rule of law or procedure or requirement of due process prevented it from referring to or relying upon other authorities that were in the public domain. Such reliance did not violate any rule of natural justice including the right to be heard.\n\n296.\n\nIn sum, on July 16, 2008 the Tribunal decided not to hold a separate hearing on jurisdiction, but did not close the proceedings on jurisdiction or prevented the Parties from making further submissions on jurisdiction. Daimler had the opportunity to present its case on the objections to jurisdiction filed by Argentina, from July 16, 2008 to the submission of the post-hearing briefs on March 2010, including submissions during the hearing on jurisdiction and merits held on November and December 2009. The fact that the Tribunal cited in the Award decisions or authorities not previously cited by the Parties, but which were publicly available, and were relevant to the issues on which the Parties had made extensive submissions, does not constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**(v) Alleged Failure by the Tribunal to Deliberate and Render a Majority Decision**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nDaimler contended that the Tribunal had failed to comply with one of its basic duties: to deliberate and reach a majority decision on each one of the questions submitted by the Parties. In Daimler\u2019s view, a review of the Award and the Separate Opinion reveals that no deliberations had taken place between the two arbitrators who declined jurisdiction.455\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 258-259.\n\n298.\n\nAccording to Daimler, the lack of deliberations is evidenced by (i) the admission in the Award, in footnote 303, that portions of specific parts of the analysis overlap with the decision in the *ICS* arbitration whose tribunal shared the same President; (ii) the statement by Professor Bello Janeiro in his Separate Opinion that he subscribed to the decision proposed by the President of the Tribunal, which statement suggests that he was simply presented with the Award by the President of the Tribunal; and (iii) the divergence of opinions between the arbitrators that formed the majority.456\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 260-262.\n\n299.\n\nNeither the text of the Award, nor the Arbitration Rules much less arbitration practice, and other evidence in these annulment proceedings support Daimler\u2019s contentions.\n\n300.\n\nThe Committee sees no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the President preparing and submitting to the co-arbitrators for their consideration a draft award. On the one hand, it is the President who presides over the deliberations (Arbitration Rule 14(1)). On the other hand the preparation of a first draft by the President of the Tribunal is a working method that tribunals frequently employ in order to draw up an award. From this it cannot be inferred that the members of the Tribunal did not deliberate upon the Award. Nothing in the record suggests that the draft was not discussed or that there was no deliberation. On the contrary, the Dissenting Opinion and the Separate Opinion strongly suggest that the arbitrators had deliberated; that there was dissent from the decision - Judge Brower - and a need to clarify the vote - Professor Bello Janeiro - which clearly establishes that the Tribunal reached its conclusions after due deliberations.\n\n301.\n\nIt is true, and the Parties do not dispute, that in the drafting of the Award the President decided to use, in certain parts of the analysis, portions of the draft used in a different case that he was chairing. This was clearly disclosed in footnote 303 of the Award. However, this cannot *ipso facto* lead to the conclusion that the Award was made without deliberations. There is not even an iota of evidence, which even remotely suggests that the President simply copied an award, or substantial portions of it, from a different case and that Professor Bello Janeiro merely concurred without any discussion or deliberation. Again, the Dissenting Opinion and the Separate Opinion suggest otherwise.\n\n302.\n\nAs for the differences between the Award and the Separate Opinion, the Committee has already referred to them in paragraphs 89 to 120 above and concluded that the tribunal had deliberated. There are no contradictions between the Award and the Separate Opinion of Professor Bello Janeiro. Even if there were, the Award would not be affected as the majority clearly voted to decline jurisdiction.\n\n303.\n\nThe Committee thus considers that there was no violation of a fundamental rule of procedure resulting from the alleged failure of the Tribunal to deliberate and reach a majority decision.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Committee must now deal with the question of the costs of these annulment proceedings, as to which the Committee has discretion.\n\n305.\n\nThe large majority of committees, in annulment proceedings, have held that legal costs should be borne equally by the parties. They have done so not only where the application for annulment has succeeded in whole or part, but also where it failed.\n\n306.\n\nThis Committee has considered whether such practice should be followed and whether or not the result of such practice may be anomalous. In particular, the Committee debated whether the Respondent should bear costs at all, given that every ground for annulment presented by Daimler has been rejected.\n\n307.\n\nFinally, the Committee decided that the Applicant should bear the costs of the annulment proceedings (which it has already paid).\n\n308.\n\nInsofar as legal costs are concerned this Committee decided to follow the aforesaid practice and order that each Party should bear its own legal costs. This is not because this Committee agrees that it should be applied as a general rule, but because of the circumstances of the present case.\n\n309.\n\nEven though Daimler was not successful in any of its claims, this is not a case where, as indicated in *CDC,* the annulment application is \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" and that Applicant\u2019s case was \"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\" In addition, the present case involved a \"difficult and novel question of public importance\" *(Vivendi I,* paras. 117) concerning the effects of concurring opinions in the formation of the majority, the deliberations and the reasoning of the award.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n310.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\ni. To dismiss in its entirety the Application for Annulment of the Award submitted by Daimler Financial Services A.G.\n\nii. That each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\niii. That the Applicant, Daimler Financial Services A.G. shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities."}]}
