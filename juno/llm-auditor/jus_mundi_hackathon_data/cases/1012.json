PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated January 31, 2018 (the **\"Notice of Arbitration\"),** Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda **(\"Mr. Orlandini\")** and Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Orlandini Ltda. **(\"CMO\")** commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article IX of the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, entered into force on June 6, 2001 (the **\"Treaty\").**\n\n2.\n\nOn January 17, 2019, counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr. Orlandini had passed away on January 1, 2019.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first procedural meeting on January 29, 2019 (the **\"First Procedural Meeting\"),** following which the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 dated February 4, 2019. Procedural Order No. 1, among other things, fixed a procedural calendar leading to a Decision on Bifurcation. In its cover letter circulating Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal made the following observation regarding the procedural calendar:\n\nIn light of the passing of Mr. Orlandini, the Tribunal has resolved not to invite any submissions from the Parties until the personal representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate is formally appointed. Accordingly, the Procedural Calendar set forth in Annex 1 first requires the Claimants to (i) promptly inform the Tribunal and the Respondent of the appointment of a personal representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate; (ii) provide a power of attorney evidencing the authority of counsel for the Second Claimant to also represent the First Claimant in this arbitration; and (iii) provide a declaration from the appointed personal representative ratifying all submissions made by the Second Claimant in these proceedings prior to such appointment.\n\n4.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 included two other provisions that are relevant to this Decision. First, Section 11 (Third Party Funding) of Procedural Order No. 1 reads:\n\n11.1 The Parties shall submit a written notice disclosing the use of third party funding to cover the costs of this arbitration and the identity of the third party funder. Such notice shall be sent to the Tribunal once the third party funding agreement has been signed.\n\n11.2 Each Party bears the ongoing duty to disclose any change in the information addressed in Section 11.1 occurred after the initial disclosure, including termination or withdrawal of the funding agreement.\n\n5.\n\nIn turn, Section 14 (Issuance of Procedural Order No. 1) of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n14.1 This Procedural Order No. 1 is issued subject to the legal representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate ratifying the actions taken so far in this arbitration by the Second Claimant.\n\n14.2 The Second Claimant shall bear any costs of arbitration, as defined in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, that may arise from the legal representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate not ratifying the actions taken by the Second Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n14.3 The dispositions in this Procedural Order are without prejudice to the rights of Respondent to challenge the representation or the standing of either Claimant or to raise any other objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 6, 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Notice of Arbitration (the **\"Response\").**\n\n7.\n\nOn March 8, 2019, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (Procedural Calendar), which reads, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n4. Having carefully considered the Parties\u2019 proposed calendar scenarios, the Tribunal has determined that the Procedural Calendar shall be as set out in Annex 1 to this order.\n\n5. The schedule for the phase of the proceedings following the Decision on Bifurcation shall be fixed in accordance with Scenario 1 or 2 of Annex 1 to this order, as applicable, after the issuance of the Decision on Bifurcation.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated March 25, 2019, counsel for the Claimants (i) informed the Tribunal that Mrs. Francees Rosario de la Via de Orlandini **(\"Mrs. Orlandini\").** who is Mr. Oriandini\u2019s widow, had been formally appointed to serve as personal representative of Mr. Oriandini\u2019s estate; (ii) submitted a copy of an order issued on March 21, 2019 by the Probate Division of the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County (the **\"Miami-Dade Court\")** ordering that \"FRANCEES ORLANDINI [be] appointed personal representative(s) of the [estate of Mr. Orlandini]\" (the **\"Miami-Dade Court Order\");1** (iii) submitted a copy of a power of attorney dated March 22, 2019, granted by Mrs. Orlandini to Mr. David M. Orta of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, Mr. Bernardo A. Wayar Caballero of Wayar & Von Borries Abogados S.C. and any lawyer working with them; and (iv) submitted a declaration dated March 22, 2019 and signed by Mrs. Orlandini stating that \"[i]n my capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda, I hereby ratify and approve all actions taken thus far in this arbitration by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP and by the law firm of Wayar & Von Borries S.C. in Bolivia as well as by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Orlandini Ltda.\"2 This letter included the following request for relief:\n\nIn light of the foregoing, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal declare that:\n\n(i) the undersigned counsel are duly authorized to represent the Estate of Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda, the First Claimant, in this arbitral proceeding for all consequent purposes;\n\n(ii) Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 is now moot; and\n\n(iii) the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation of the Proceedings is due by April 24, 2019, should the Respondent wish to file one.\n\n*In Re: Estate of Julio M. Orlandini-Agreda,* Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County. Case No. 19-000371 CP, Order Admitting Will to Probate & Appointing Personal Representative(s), March 21, 2019 (R-17).\n\nDeclaration of Francees Rosario de la Via de Orlandini, dated March 22, 2019 (Annex D to Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal dated March 25, 2019).\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated April 1, 2019, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for submissions on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, and confirmed that it would decide the Claimants\u2019 requests, as set out in their letter of March 25, 2019, no later than in its Decision on Bifurcation.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 24, 2019, the Respondent submitted its *Solicitud de Terminaci\u00f3n, 'Trifurcaci\u00f3n y Cautio Judicatum Solvi* (the **\"Respondent\u2019s Triple Application\").**\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated April 27, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to respond to all matters addressed in the Respondent's Triple Application within the deadline set forth in Procedural Order No. 3 for the filing of the Response to the Request for Bifurcation of the Proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated May 23, 2019, the Claimants alleged \"that the Respondent, through the Bolivian National Service of Pension Funds **(\"SENASIR\"** for its acronym in Spanish), has taken serious and harmful retaliatory actions against the Claimants in Bolivia as a reprisal for having filed this arbitration.\"\n\n13.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, the Claimants submitted their Opposition to the Application for Termination, Trifurcation and Security for Costs (the **\"Claimants\u2019 Opposition\").**\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated June 7, 2019, the Respondent provided a response to the Claimants\u2019 letter of May 23, 2019.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated June 14, 2019, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter of June 7, 2019.\n\n**II. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 claims relate to two mining concessions over the Antequera River in Bolivia known as *Veneros San Juan* and *Pretoria* (the **\"Antequera River Concessions\")3** and 46 other concessions in an area known as *Mina Totoral* (the **\"Mina Totoral Concessions\",** and, together with the Antequera River Concessions, the **\"Concessions\").4**\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 24.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 26.\n\n17.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the dispute concerns the purported expropriation of the Concessions and other related properties in Bolivia through the concerted actions of the Bolivian administrative mining authority *(Superintendente Departamental de Minas),5* the Bolivian mining agency and registry *(Servicio Nacional de Geolog\u00eda* y *T\u00e9cnico de Minas)',6* the Bolivian Judiciary (in particular, the Judiciary\u2019s actions in connection with labor proceedings against CMO referred to as the **\"Martinez Case\"),7** the State-owned Mining Company of Bolivia *(Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia,* **\"COMIBOL\")8** and certain private entities and individuals.9 The Claimants allege that the actions undertaken by the Respondent\u2019s instrumentalities purported to deprive CMO of its Concessions and other related property in Bolivia to favor COMIBOL and its corporate jointventure partners, in breach of the Claimants\u2019 rights under Bolivian law. the Treaty and international law.10\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 45, 53-55. 60.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 65.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 87, 92, 121.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 53, 63.\n\nThese include Glencore International. Sinchi Wayra S.A., Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera San Lucas S.A., former CMO workers and Ms. Cristina Wanderley da Silva (see *generally* Notice of Arbitration, paras. 17, 22, 70, 75, 78, 87- 88. 103).\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent argues that (i) the Claimants have failed to establish the scope of their mining rights over the Antequera River Concessions and to prove that works were actually carried out in that area;11 (ii) the Claimants have no right to request that the Tribunal review the decisions of the Bolivian courts in the Martinez Case;12 and (iii) none of the State measures underlying the Claimants' claims constitute a breach of the Treaty, international law or Bolivian law.13\n\nResponse, paras. 35-41.\n\nResponse, paras. 42-45.\n\nResponse, paras. 49-50.\n\n**III. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR TERMINATION, SUSPENSION AND TRIFURCATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.** The Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent has advanced four objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, relevantly summarized below **(A).14** Flowing from the first of these jurisdictional objections, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the termination of these proceedings or, in the alternative, their suspension **(B).15** If the Tribunal decides for the proceedings to continue, the Respondent requests that the proceedings be trifurcated **(C).16**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 15-18. *See infra* paras. 20 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 14, 86-101.\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent first objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae* **(a).** Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to prove that they possess a \"covered investment\" in the Antequera River Concessions as per Article I(e) of the Treaty (b). Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to prove that they have made an investment in the Concessions (c). Fourth and lastly, the Respondent claims that its conduct in the Mart\u200e\u00ednez Case does not constitute a *prima facie* violation of the Treaty for denial of justice **(d).**\n\n**a)** ***Rationae Personae*** **Objection**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae* on the basis that Mr. Orlandini, his successors and CMO do not hold US nationality under the terms of the Treaty, and, as such, they are not entitled to bring a Treaty claim.17 The Tribunal refers to this objection as the ***' Rationae Personae*** **Objection\".**\n\nRespondent's Triple Application, para. 16. *See also* para. 34: *\"En contraste, las pruebas contempor\u00e1neas demuestran que el Sr. Orlandini se present\u00f3, a lo largo de su vida, ante Bolivia y los \u00f3rganos del Estado, como un nacional boliviano (nunca fue, por lo tanto, un \u2018nacional\u2019 de los Estados Unidos en los t\u00e9rminos del Tratado)\".*\n\n22.\n\nFirst, the Respondent posits that the Treaty does not extend its protections to dual US-Bolivian investors.18 According to the Respondent, Article I of the Treaty defines \"company\",19 \"company of a Party\",20 \"national\" of a Party21 and \"covered investment\"22 in such a way as to require that Bolivian companies be controlled by a US national in order to constitute an \"investment\" for the purposes of the Treaty.23 The Respondent also reads Article IX of the Treaty through the prism of Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"VCLT\")** as restricting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes involving \"a Party and a national or company of the other Party\",24 thus excluding dual nationals.25 Finally, the Respondent considers that Treaty Article IX(4) imports the jurisdictional requirements set forth in Chapter II of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\"),** and contends that these requirements apply irrespective of the dispute resolution forum selected by the investor.26 The Respondent recalls that these requirements encompass the prohibition for investors to bring a claim against their State of nationality (explicitly referring to dual nationals) set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.27\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 21-27.\n\nTreaty Article I(a) provides: \"\u2018company\u2019 means any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, whether or not for profit, and whether privately or governmentally owned or controlled, and includes a corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, branch, joint venture, association, or other organization\" **(C-1).**\n\nTreaty Article I(b) reads: \"\u2018company of a Party\u2019 means a company constituted or organized under the laws of that Party\" **(C-1).**\n\nTreaty Article I(c) states: \"\u2018national\u2019 of a Party means a natural person who is a national of that Party under its applicable law\" **(C-1).**\n\nTreaty Article I(e) provides: \"\u2018covered investment\u2019 means an investment of a national or company of a Party in the territory of the other Party\" **(C-1).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 21-22.\n\nTreaty Article IX(1), **(C-1).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 24-26. Treaty Article IX(4) provides, in relevant part, that: \"[e]ach Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice of the national or company under paragraph 3 (a)(i), (ii), and (iii) or the mutual agreement of both parties to the dispute under paragraph 3 (a)(iv). This consent and the submission of the dispute by a national or company under paragraph 3 (a) shall satisfy the requirement of [...] Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties to the dispute.\" **(C-1).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 27. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part, that: \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre\"; where \"\u2018[n]ational of another Contracting State\u2019 [...] does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\" but includes \"any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\" **(RLA-5).**\n\n23.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that dual nationals must prove that the nationality on which they rely when bringing a claim is the dominant one \"both at the date of the alleged injury and at the time of submission of the claim.\"28\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 32-35.\n\n24.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Respondent claims that Mr. Orlandini\u2019s Bolivian nationality\u2014which the Respondent alleges he has held from his birth29\u2014excludes the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims.30 First, as a dual national, Mr. Orlandini would be precluded from resorting to Treaty Article IX.31 Second, the Respondent refers to several documents on record showing, in its view, that Mr. Orlandini\u2019s Bolivian nationality was the dominant one, and thus could not have been considered a US national under the Treaty.32\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 29.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 30-31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 34-35: *Mart* \u00ed *nez et. al. c. CMO, Testimonio de poder general especial y suficiente que otorga el Sr. Miguel Orlandini Agreda en representaci\u00f3n de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Orlandini Ltda. en favor del Dr. Victor L\u00f3pez Alcal\u00e1.* December 16, 1988, p. 9 **(R-19);** *Mart\u00ednez* v. *CMO.* Judgment, December 22, 1989, p.

If the gift to that trust is ineffective for any reason, I give all my Residuary Estate to the trustee of my Revocable Trust upon the same terms and conditions set forth in that trust as of this date. I incorporate those terms by reference, but only for the purpose of this contingent gift.35\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 38.\n\nTestament, Art. 3 **(R-23).**\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there is no information available concerning \"the Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda Trost\" (the **\"JMO Trust\")** or its ultimate beneficiaries.36 Mrs. Orlandini could be the ultimate beneficiary of the JMO Trust, the Respondent notes, but the Claimants have conceded that she is a Bolivian national.37 The Claimants have also failed to indicate whether Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims have been passed on to a specific entity or person.38 It is nonetheless certain, the Respondent avers, that \"the Estate must be closed within 12 months\" under the terms of the Miami-Dade Court Order, which might result in a yet unknown entity or individual claiming title over Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims.39\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 39, 44.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 39.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 39.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 40; Miami-Dade Court Order, p. 1 **(R-17).**\n\n27.\n\nWithout this information, the Respondent asserts, the Tribunal is impeded from establishing its own jurisdiction at this stage, forthree reasons.40 First, the Tribunal cannot determine whetherthe continuous nationality requirement embedded in the Treaty has been fulfilled without first ascertaining who the beneficiaries and the managers of the JMO Trust are.41 Second, the Respondent cannot determine whether it will deny the benefits of the Treaty to the beneficiaries of the JMO Trust under Treaty Article XII until their identity and nationality are determined.42 Third, the Respondent may decide to submit further jurisdictional objections directed at the assignees of Mr. Orlandini's claims after his estate is closed.43\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 41 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 42.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 43-44.\n\nRespondent's Triple Application, para. 45.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that CMO has no standing to bring a claim against Bolivia under the Treaty because CMO is a company controlled by Bolivian nationals, and thus cannot qualify as a US \"company\" under Articles I(d). IX(4) and 1X(8) of the Treaty.44 According to the Respondent, this is again because Article IX(4) imports the jurisdictional requirements set forth in Chapter II of the ICSID Convention, including the prohibition for nationals of a respondent State and companies controlled by nationals of that State to bring claims against their State of nationality.45\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 47-48.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 48; C. Schreuer. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* (2nd ed. 2009). Oxford University Press, paras. 826. 828 **(RLA-6)** : \"[t]he second clause of Art. 25(2)(b) [of the ICSID Convention] refers to 'foreign control' without specifying any nationality requirements in this respect. It is clear from the wording and from the context that control exercised by nationals of the host State is not \u2018foreign control\u2019 and that juridical persons controlled by such nationals are excluded from ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\" *See also supra* para. 22.\n\n29.\n\nAs a result, upholding jurisdiction over CMO's claims would, in the Respondent's view, defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty and the intention of the Treaty Parties.46 The Respondent refers to certain evidence on record showing, in its view, that CMO was controlled in its entirety by Mr. Orlandini and Ms. Jeannette Said de Orlandini (Mr. Orlandini's former partner), who are both Bolivian nationals.47 According to the Respondent, this is also consistent with CMO\u2019s conduct before Bolivian authorities.48\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 50; Treaty Preamble: \"Desiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them, with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party.\" **(C-1).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 49. This includes Mr. Orlandini\u2019s alleged 95% stake in CMO.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 49.\n\n30.\n\nIrrespective of the nationality of the owners of CMO, the Respondent posits that the Claimants have failed to prove that Mr. Orlandini held control over CMO at all relevant times. The Respondent considers that the ownership of CMO was. at least, \"confusing\", owing to (i) Mr. Orlandini's relatives bringing judicial proceedings against him to take over CMO;49 (ii) Bolivian authorities taking control over CMO at certain stages:50 and (iii) the recording of liens on CMO\u2019s shares.51\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 51(a); *Protocolizaci\u00f3n del testimonio referente a la transferencia a t\u00edtulo de compraventa de cuotas de capital de la CMO suscrita por la Sra.

The State measures allegedly dispossessing CMO of its rights in the Antequera River Concessions are the Decisions of the *Superintendente de Minas* dated April 20, 2000 **(C-25)** and May 9, 2007 **(C-33).** *See* Notice of Arbitration, paras. 45, 141.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the scope of the Antequera River Concessions is defined in a 1906 act that was deliberately not filed with the Notice of Arbitration,56 and rejects the Claimants\u2019 reliance on certain certificates issued by the *Servicio Nacional T\u00e9cnico de Minas* **(\"SETMIN\")** in 2000 because they do not address the nature or scope of the Claimants\u2019 rights under the Antequera River Concessions.57\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 62-63: *Protocolizaci\u00f3n de los obrados relativos a la concesi\u00f3n de Veneros San Juan,* March 20, 1906 **(R-29).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 64; SETMIN Certificates of Final Inscription, March & October 2000 **(C-3).**\n\n**c) Protected Investment Objection**\n-------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects that Mr. Orlandini\u2019s shareholding in CMO or CMO\u2019s mining concessions and other property constitute investments protected by the Treaty.58 The Tribunal refers to this objection as the **\"Protected Investment Objection\".**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 66.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Treaty only protects \"investments\" that (i) are \"covered\" in the sense of Article I(d) and (e) of the Treaty: and (ii) constitute an investment in accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which is incorporated into the Treaty via Article IX(4).59 Under both of these instruments, the Respondent says, claiming ownership of an asset with economic value would not suffice to demonstrate the existence of an investment: an \"economic aspect\" or a \"commitment of resources\" must also exist.60 Relying on *Orascom v. Argelia* and other ICSID and UNCITRAL investment cases, the Respondent submits that the \"economic dimension\" of the concept of investment requires that an investment encompass \"(i) a contribution or allocation of resources, (ii) a duration, and (iii) risk, which includes the expectation (albeit not necessarily fulfilled) of a commercial return.\"61\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 68; C.

Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, May 31, 2017. para. 370 **(RLA-26).**\n\n36.\n\nApplying the above rationale to the instant case, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to prove ownership of an investment pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention: first, because the issues raised in connection the *Rationae Personae* Objection preclude the existence of a \"covered investment\" owned by a US national:62 and second, because tine Claimants have failed to prove that they have made a longstanding economic contribution, home any risk or sought to obtain a commercial profit with respect to the Concessions.63\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 71.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 72-74.\n\n**d) Denial of Justice Objection**\n----------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nLastly, the Respondent argues that its course of conduct in the Mart\u200e\u00ednez Case, as characterized by the Claimants, does not amount to a *prima facie* violation of the Treaty for denial of justice.64 Tire Tribunal refers to this objection as the **\"Denial of Justice Objection\".**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 76.\n\n38.\n\nRelying on Judge Higgins\u2019 Separate Opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case and other decisions in investment cases, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must prove that the facts underlying their claims, as alleged, constitute a *prima facie* violation of the Treaty for the Tribunal to hold jurisdiction over those claims.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 77-78; *Oil Platforms Case (Iran v.

Request for Termination or Suspension**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent requests, in connection with its *Rationae Personae* Objection, that these proceedings be terminated without prejudice as per Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.69 The termination of the proceedings would be justified, in the Respondent\u2019s view, because it is evident that Mr. Orlandini, his successors and CMO do not fulfill the requirements to bring a Treaty claim against Bolivia.70\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 5. 16, 46, 53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 16. *See also supra* paras. 21 *et seq.*\n\n42.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent opines that suspending the proceedings until the estate of Mr. Orlandini is closed by the Miami-Dade Court71 would be a \"pragmatic solution\",72 seeing that it is still uncertain who Mr. Orlandini\u2019s future heirs or legatees may be and the Tribunal is impeded from establishing its jurisdiction until their identity is determined.73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 16, 40, 46, 53, 130. The Miami-Dade Court Order (R-17) provides: \"[t]his Estate must be closed within 12 months, unless it is contested or its closing date is extended by court order.\"\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 38. *See supra* para. 25 *et seq.*\n\n**C. Request for Trifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the proceedings be trifurcated as between jurisdiction, merits and quantum if the Tribunal decides for the proceedings to continue.74\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 86.\n\n44.\n\nFirst, the Respondent refers to considerations of elementary justice and procedural efficiency to support its trifurcation request.75 Compelling a State to respond on the merits and quantum of claims over which no tribunal has established its jurisdiction is. in the Respondent\u2019s view, inherently unjust and contrary to basic principles of international dispute resolution.76 This is because no sovereign State can be presumed to have consented to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.77 The Respondent also refers to instances in which investment tribunals have opted for bifurcation when addressing jurisdiction as a preliminary question would result in significant savings of work and costs.78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 87.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application para. 88; H.

Australia.* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, April 14, 2014, para. 109 **(RLA-48).**\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the above standard for bifurcation is clearly met vis-a-vis its jurisdictional objections:81\n\n(a) First, the Respondent sees its objections as \"serious and substantial\" because they require the Tribunal to address fundamental questions of public international law and interpretation of the Treaty,82 such as the implications of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s dual nationality,83 the standing of a company controlled by Bolivian nationals to bring a claim against Bolivia84 and the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s power to scrutinize the actions of domestic Bolivian courts.85\n\n(b) Second, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal can decide its jurisdictional objections without entering into analysis of 15 years of proceedings in the Mart\u00ednez Case,86 the decisions of the *Superintendente de Minas* in connection with the Antequera River Concessions87 or whether the Respondent\u2019s actions constitute an expropriation.88\n\n(c) Third, the Respondent argues that the *Rationae Personae* Objection, the Protected Investment Objection and the Denial of Justice Objection would, if upheld, dispose of the entirety of the dispute; while upholding the Covered Investment Objection would dispose of all claims raised in connection with the Antequera River Concessions.89\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 92-97.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 93.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 93(a).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 93(b).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 93(c).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 94.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 94; Decisions of the *Superintendente de Minas* dated April 20, 2000 **(C-25)** and May 9, 2007 **(C-33).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 95.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 97.\n\n47.\n\nLastly, the Respondent contends that both the merits and the quantum phase of the arbitration would be significantly large and complex, if at all necessary. It therefore claims that trifurcating the proceedings would simplify the analysis of the dispute.90\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 98-100; *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia,* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, April 14, 2014. para. 106 **(RLA-48).**\n\n**2.** The Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the Respondent\u2019s request for termination or suspension of the proceedings is made in bad faith and with dilatory purposes, and request that it be rejected **(A).91** The Claimants also oppose the Respondent\u2019s request that jurisdiction and merits issues be decided separately, but do not object to the bifurcation of the proceedings with regard to quantum **(B).92**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 3, 7-8, 34.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 8, 120-121.\n\n**A. Request for Termination or Suspension**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants first argue that the Tribunal has already addressed and rejected the Respondent\u2019s request for termination or suspension of the proceedings:93 the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the consequences of Mr. Orlandini's passing (including the need to terminate or suspend the proceedings) during the First Procedural Meeting, and the Tribunal later decided that the proceedings continue in Section 14 of its Procedural Order No. I.94 The Claimants also consider that they have \"fully complied with all of the Tribunal\u2019s instructions\" as set forth in that provision, which they infer is confirmed by the fact that the proceedings continued and a schedule for submissions on bifurcation was fixed.95\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 10; Procedural Order No. 1, Section 14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 12; Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties.

As a result, the Claimants request that the Tribunal grant their outstanding requests, as set out in their letter of March 25, 2019, that the Tribunal confirm that (i) counsel appointed by Mrs. Orlandini are authorized to represent the First Claimant; and (ii) Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 is now moot.97\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 14; Audio recording of First Procedural Conference, January 29, 2019, 38:44-39:00.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, para. 16. fn. 8; Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal, March 25, 2019. *See supra* para. 8.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants further reject that continuation of the arbitral proceedings has become \"unnecessary or impossible\" as per Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules following the passing of Mr. Orlandini.98\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 18.\n\n52.\n\nFirst, the Claimants consider that all applicable nationality requirements have been satisfied because Mr. Orlandini was a US national from birth until his passing,99 and investment tribunals have consistently determined that the investor's nationality at the time of filing the claim \"is what is germane to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"100 The identities or nationalities of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s heirs or beneficiaries, according to the Claimants, are completely irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction101 because the Treaty does not contain a continuous nationality requirement.102 The Claimants argue that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent to support the existence of this requirement pertain to the diplomatic protection context, not to investor-State arbitration.103 Even in that context, they note, the International Law Commission (tire **\"ILC\")** has declined to adopt a blanket continuous nationality rule.104\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 23.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 21. 23-24; *Siag and Vecchi* v. *Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, June 1, 2009, para. 503 **(CLA-1).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 13; Respondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 38-39.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, para. 20.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 21-22; *Serafin Garcia Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v.

Request for Trifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants first address the applicable standard on bifurcation **(a)** and then explain how, in their view, the *Rationae Personae* Objection **(b).** the Covered Investment Objection **(c),** the Protected Investment Objection **(d)** and the Denial of Justice Objection **(e)** fail to meet that standard. Finally, they propose that the proceedings be bifurcated exclusively with respect to quantum **(f).**\n\n**a) Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants refer to Articles 17(1) and 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules as containing the applicable standard on bifurcation.117 The \"proper touchstone\", the Claimants opine, is whether bifurcation would contribute to a \"fair and efficient process.\"118\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 36.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 37; *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v.

Australia,* on which the Respondent relies, \"involve substantially the same considerations.\"125 The Claimants consider that, under either standard, all criteria are cumulative;126 and even when all three requirements are met, the Tribunal may still \"exercise its discretion to hear all issues in a single phase.\"127\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 39; *Glamis Gold v.

Venezuela*,137 the Claimants argue that reading an exclusion of dual nationals into Treaty Article IX(1) would be tantamount to an impermissible revision of the text of the Treaty, which would be contrary to Article 31 of the VCLT138 and would also contradict the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose in \"promot[ing] greater economic cooperation,\" \"stimulat[ing] the flow of private capital\" and establishing a \"stable framework for investment.\"139\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 49; Notice of Arbitration, para. 7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 50.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 54-55; *Serafin Garc\u00eda Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v.

Venezuela,* observing that the tribunal in that case found that the dominant and effective nationality test was irrelevant for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction *rationae personae.150*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 69-72.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 69. 73.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 70-72; Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, Art. 10.28 **(CLA-40);** *Ioan Micula and others v.

As such, the Claimants claim, CMO qualifies as a \"covered investment\" under Treaty Article I(e),156 and shall be treated as a US company under Article IX(8),157 regardless of how it presented itself before Bolivian authorities.158 The Claimants also repeat their argument that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention do not apply, and extend this consideration to CMO.159\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 83-87.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 85; Treaty Article I(e) ('\"covered investment\u2019 means an investment of a national or company of a party in the territory of the other Party\") **(C-1).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 83, 85; Treaty Article IX(8) (\"For purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and this Article, a company of a Party that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to an investment dispute, was a covered investment, shall be treated as a company of the other Party.\") **(C-1).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 86.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 87; Respondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 48.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the relevant test for establishing CMO\u2019s standing in this arbitration is whether Mr. Orlandini held ownership or control \"immediately before\" the allegedly unlawful actions of the Respondent, and claim that this test is satisfied in the instant case.160\n\nClaimants' Opposition, paras. 88-90, Treaty Article IX(8) **(C-1);** *Link-Trading Joint Stock Company v.

As per Treaty Article I(d). \"\u2018investment\u2019 of a national or company means every kind of investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by that national or company, and includes investment consisting or taking the form of: (i) a company; (ii) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation, and [...] debt interests, in a company; (iii) contractual rights, [...]; (iv) tangible property, including real property; and intangible property, including rights.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not relied on this decision in its submissions, but observes that it lias referred to similar criteria as defined by other ICSID tribunals. *See* Respondent's Triple Application, paras. 68-69.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants finally observe that, in considering the Protected Investment Objection, the Tribunal would irremediably come across factual and legal questions (such as the essential features of the Claimants\u2019 investments) that are closely linked with the merits of the case.177\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 111.\n\n**e) Denial of Justice Objection**\n----------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimants finally submit that the Denial of Justice Objection fails to meet all three factors in *Glamis Gold v. United States* and *Philip Morris v. Australia.178*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 112.\n\n79.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that dealing with the Denial of Justice Objection as a preliminary question would lead to duplication of the analysis of the factual background of the Mart\u00ednez Case.179 Second, they claim this objection could not dispose of the whole dispute because the Notice of Arbitration refers to several violations of the Treaty and international law beyond the alleged denial of justice in the Mart\u00ednez Case.180 Third and last, the Claimants describe the Denial of Justice Objection as \"frivolous\" given the level of detail provided in the Notice of Arbitration regarding the alleged breaches.181\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 113-114.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 115-116; Notice of Arbitration, paras. 154, 159-160, 167, 181, 192-193.

THE RESPONDENT\u2019S APPLICATION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nAs part of its Triple Application, the Respondent has requested that the Tribunal order the Claimants to (i) provide a USD 4 million security for its costs of arbitration, in the form of a guarantee payable on first demand or a deposit held in escrow by the PCA;185 and (ii) disclose whether they use third party funding to cover the costs of the arbitration, and, if so, the identity of the third party funder and the terms of any third party funding agreement.186\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 130.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 130.\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal is empowered to order security for costs, which it claims would be fully warranted in light of the events following the passing of Mr. Orlandini.187 The Respondent first refers to the standard for the Tribunal to impose security for costs (A) and then explains why that standard is met in the instant case (B).\n\nRespondent's Triple Application, para. 102.\n\n**A. Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Tribunal has the power to order the Claimants to provide security for costs in favor of the Respondent under Articles 17(1)188 and 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.189 This is evidenced, in the Respondent\u2019s view, by decisions in other investor-State arbitrations190 and by Section 11 of Procedural Order No. 1, explicitly requiring the Parties to disclose the use of third party funding.191\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 104-105; D.

Circumstances Warranting Security for Costs**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nApplying the *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* test, the Respondent contends that the circumstances of the present case warrant a security for costs order in its favor.194\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 111.\n\n87.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that there is, *prima facie,* a reasonable prospect that the Tribunal will award the Respondent its costs of legal representation.195 In this regard, the Respondent notes that the *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* tribunal considered that the respondent\u2019s objections concerning the dual nationality of the claimants were reasonable and substantiated for purposes of an application for security for costs.196 In the Respondent's view, the same rationale applies to its jurisdictional objections *rationae materiae* and *rationae personae.*197 The Respondent also notes that the Claimants have failed to provide an estimate of the amount they claim in this dispute, thus raising doubts about the reasonableness and credibility of the Claimants\u2019 case and the likelihood that an award will be issued in their favor.198\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 112.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 113.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 115; Notice of Arbitration, para. 198(2) (\"an amount likely in the many hundreds of millions and possibly more\").\n\n88.\n\nSecond, the Respondent asserts that it would likely be precluded from recovering its legal costs if an award is issued in its favor.199 This is because, in its view, there are \"serious doubts\" concerning the Claimants\u2019 ability to honor an award on costs or the existence of assets against which such an award could be enforced:200 the amount of the residual estate that will be left after the closing of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate is still unclear, as are the finances of the JMO Trust201 or the solvency of CMO202 (which the Claimants themselves have noted has \"no other meaningful assets\" other than the Concessions and \"the claims in this proceeding\").203 The Respondent also posits that the Claimants\u2019 credit history raises \"legitimate concerns\", seeing that Mr. Orlandini had been involved in several bankruptcy proceedings in the US and other proceedings concerning debts with his employees in CMO,204 while CMO and its assets have been sequestered on several occasions.205 The Respondent claims that these circumstances led it to invite the Claimants to disclose whether they are using third party funding, but note that the Claimants are yet to respond.206\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 116-119; *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas and others v.

Venezuela,* the Respondent argues that there is an actual risk that its representation and other costs will not be recoverable because it is unclear whether the Claimants are solvent or are using third party funding.208 In contrast, an order requiring security for costs would, in the Respondent\u2019s view, cause no harm to the Claimants, since they have already assumed the risk of an adverse decision on costs.209\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 127; *Manuel Garc\u200e\u00eda Armas and others* v. *Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, June 20, 2018. paras. 233, 235 **(RLA-52).**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 128.\n\n90.\n\nLastly, the Respondent asserts that the requested measure cannot be delayed until a final award is issued. According to the Respondent, the urgency of its application lies in the increasing amount of funds destined to its legal representation in this proceeding.210\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 129.\n\n**2.** The Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal reject the Respondent\u2019s application for security for costs, since it fails to meet the general standard of extreme and exceptional circumstances (A) or the specific requirements set out in Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules **(B).211**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 124-126.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants have also provided the following clarification in response to Bolivia\u2019s request that they confirm whether they have secured third party funding for this arbitration:\n\n[] Bolivia\u2019s request that the Tribunal order the Claimants to confirm whether they have secured third-party funding is improper, as it is not in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1. Procedural Order No. 1 provides that the Parties have to send a written notice to the Tribunal if they have signed a third-party funding agreement to cover the costs of the arbitration. As long as this event does not occur, the Parties have no obligation to make any general disclosure of the kind that Bolivia is improperly seeking from the Claimants. Claimants have no disclosures to make based on Procedural Order No. 1, and Bolivia\u2019s request should be rejected.212\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 188 (footnotes omitted).\n\n**A. Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n93.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"security for costs is an extraordinary measure that is granted only in the most extreme and exceptional of circumstances,\"213 such as bad faith on the part from whom security for costs is requested, the likelihood of an irreparable damage or serious misconduct.214 The Claimants deny that \"[a] general doubt or concern for a party\u2019s inability to pay\",215 or \"even financial distress and the risk that an adverse costs award will go unpaid\"216 could meet the standard applicable to a request for security for costs. According to the Claimants, the Respondent bears the burden of proving217 \"clearly and sufficiently\" that the Claimants are unable or unwilling to comply with a costs order.218\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 127.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 130-131; *South American Silver Limited v.

St. Lucia,* where security for costs was granted because the claimant had proven financial difficulties and also had a track record of failure to pay adverse costs awards in prior proceedings.219 In the Claimants\u2019 view, this stands in contrast with their \"cooperative attitude\" in the present proceeding, which they claim is evidenced by their timely payment of the first deposit and their agreement to cover any additional costs that could have resulted from the First Claimant not ratifying all the actions taken by the Second Claimant following the passing of Mr. Orlandini.220 The Claimants note that it is actually the Respondent who, in what they consider was an attempt to \"clean its hands\", paid its share of the deposit only one day before submitting its application for security for costs.221\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 136; *RSM Production Corporation* v. *Saint Lucia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on Saint Lucia\u2019s Request for Security for Costs.

Bolivia,* that the Tribunal should follow a conservative approach to avoid the risk of prejudgment.250\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 176-180; Respondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 102.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 176; D.

This conduct includes, first, the Respondent\u2019s alleged \"harmful retaliatory measures\" against CMO through SENASIR.251 which, according to the Claimants, are \"completely without legal support\", reflect the Respondent's bad faith approach and could even amount to a further violation of the Treaty.252 The Claimants also invite the Tribunal to assess Bolivia\u2019s conduct in two other investment arbitrations *(Rurelec v. Bolivia* and *South American Silver v. Bolivia)* where two tribunals rejected Bolivia's security for costs applications for reasons that, the Claimants argue, are largely similar to their arguments in connection with this application.253 The Claimants also believe there is a contradiction between (i) Bolivia's argument in those cases that the existence of a third party funder constituted a risk that the claimant(s) would not be able to pay an adverse costs award, and (ii) the Respondent\u2019s argument in this case that the absence of a third party funder would create the same risk.254\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 182; Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal, May 23, 2019. *See also supra* para. 12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 183.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, paras. 184-185; *Guaracachi America, Inc. & Rurelec v.

TRIBUNAL\u2019 S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered and analyzed carefully the positions and the arguments of the Parties relating to the Respondent\u2019s Triple Application. The Tribunal will proceed to analyze below the three different parts of the Respondent's Application.\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Application for Termination or Suspension**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent has advanced four jurisdictional objections. The Respondent submits that the first of these objections *(rationae personae)* alone results in a manifest lack of jurisdiction. On that basis, the Respondent requests that these proceedings be terminated without prejudice pursuant to Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.257 The Claimants object to this request.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 3. 5. 16. 46. 53.\n\n109.\n\nNeither Party has argued that the Tribunal lacks the powers to terminate the proceedings. Indeed, such power is derived, *inter alia,* from Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which states:\n\nIf, before the award is made, the conlinualion of the arbitral proceedings becomes unnecessary or impossible for any reason not mentioned in paragraph 1, the arbitral tribunal shall inform the parties of its intention to issue an order for the termination of the proceedings. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to issue such an order unless there are remaining matters that may need to be decided and the arbitral tribunal considers it appropriate to do so.\n\n110.\n\nPursuant to this provision, the Tribunal has the power to terminate the proceedings for any reason not mentioned in para. 1 of Article 36 (which deals with settlement of the dispute) if the continuation of the proceedings becomes unnecessary or impossible. The Tribunal understands the Respondent to be arguing that the continuation of the proceeding is unnecessary or impossible because of the Tribunal's manifest lack of jurisdiction.258\n\n*See* J. Paulsson, G. Petrochilos, *UNCITRAL Arbitration* (2017), Kluwer Law International, pp. 333-334 (noting that \"impossible\" may include a situation where the tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute and. as a result, decides to terminate the proceedings). *See also* D. Caron. L. Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary.* (2nd ed. 2013), Oxford University Press, pp. 788-789.\n\n111.\n\nThe difficulty the Tribunal has with the Respondent\u2019s argument is that the Tribunal must decide that it lacks jurisdiction at this initial stage of the proceedings without having been fully briefed on the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. Due process requires that the Parties be granted an opportunity to be heard on the matters pertaining to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and to fully present their arguments on the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent.\n\n112.\n\nTo be clear, there may be situations where the lack ofjurisdiction is manifest. ICSID jurisprudence addresses the existence of a manifest lack of jurisdiction because of the provision in Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention allowing ICSID\u2019s Secretary-General to decline to register a request for arbitration if the dispute is manifestly outside of the jurisdiction of the Centre, as well as because of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), which provides for an expedited procedure if a claim is \"manifestly\" without legal merit. ICSID jurisprudence also addresses amply the meaning of the term \"manifest\" in the context of annulment proceedings pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which allows annulment of an ICSID award in case the tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n113.\n\nThis Tribunal does not operate under the ICSID Convention and does not need to engage in an analysis of ICSID case law to determine the meaning of the term \"manifest.\" It is sufficient for present purposes to rely on the meaning of the term \"manifest\" in authoritative English or Spanish language dictionaries, where it is described as \"evident,\" \"obvious,\" \"readily perceived by the eye or the understanding.\"259 It is nevertheless helpful to note that ICSID tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have referred to \"manifest\" as \"obvious by itself.\"260 \"self-evident\" rather than the product of interpretations,261 \"plain on its face\" rather than susceptible to argument,262 or \"textually obvious.\"263\n\n*See for example,* Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola* (defining *\"manifiesto\"* as *\"descubierto, patente, claro\").*\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 36.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 25.\n\n*CDC Group plc v. Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14. Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 41.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 40.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal is not in a position to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction in a manner that is \"evident,\" \"obvious\" or \"readily perceived by the eye or the understanding,\" nor that it is \"plain on its face\" rather than susceptible to argument, or \"textually obvious.\" Such would be the case, for example, if the Claimants relied on a treaty that did not exist or if the applicable treaty explicitly excluded investor-State arbitration.\n\n115.\n\nHere, by contrast, the Claimants have vigorously disputed the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections and advanced arguments that those objections are not meritorious. To conclude that it manifestly lacks jurisdiction, the Tribunal must dismiss the Claimants\u2019 arguments off-hand, i.e., it must conclude that the Claimants\u2019 arguments manifestly lack merit. Without prejudging in any way the strength of the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent, the Tribunal believes that it is not in a position to rule on those objections at this stage. The Tribunal needs to hear from the Parties their fully developed arguments on the jurisdictional obj ections before it can reach any conclusion with respect to its jurisdiction.\n\n116.\n\nIn that sense, the continuation of the arbitration proceedings is both necessary and possible within the terms of Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It is necessary because the Tribunal needs to be fully briefed by the Parties on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. Further, the continuation of the proceedings is possible because the Tribunal is not in a position, at this stage, to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, must decline the Respondent\u2019s application to tenninate the proceedings for manifest lack of jurisdiction.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in the alternative, that the proceedings must be suspended until the estate of Mr. Orlandini is closed by the Miami-Dade Court.264 In the view of the Respondent, this would be a \"pragmatic solution,\"265 given that it is still uncertain who Mr. Orlandini\u2019s future heirs or beneficiaries may be. The Respondent further argues that the Tribunal is not in a position to establish that it has jurisdiction until the identity of those heirs or beneficiaries is determined,266 which would then allow the Tribunal to determine whether they meet the relevant jurisdictional requirements.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 16, 40, 46, 53, 130. The Miami-Dade Court Order **(R-17)** provides that \"[t]his Estate must be closed within 12 months, unless it is contested or its closing date is extended by court order\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 38. *See supra* para. 25 *et seq.*\n\n119.\n\nIn response, the Claimants advance essentially three arguments. First, according to the Claimants, the investor\u2019s nationality at the time of filing the claim \"is what is germane to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\"267 and, therefore, the identities or nationalities of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s heirs or beneficiaries are \"irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"268\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 21, 23-24; *Siag and Vecchi* v. *Egypt.* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, June 1, 2009, para. 503 **(CLA-1).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 13; Respondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 38-39.\n\n120.\n\nSecond, according to the Claimants, after Mr. Orlandini\u2019s passing, his claims have remained with his estate: and Mrs. Orlandini is duly qualified to prosecute Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims on behalf of his estate269 as a duly authorized representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate. The Claimants point out that, as confirmed by Ms. Mart\u00ednez-Lejarza, the attorney representing Mrs. Orlandini before the Miami-Dade Court, Mrs. Orlandini will be the trustee and sole beneficiary of the JMO Trust, as well as the recipient of the residuary estate.270 On this basis, the Claimants also assert that the identity of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s heirs is irrelevant.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 27: Miami-Dade Court Order **(R-17)** ; *In Re: Estate of Julio M. Orlandini-Agreda,* Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Case No. 19-000371 CP. Letters of Administration, March 21, 2019 (Annex B to Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal dated March 25, 2019): Power of Attorney given by Francees Rosario de la V\u00eda de Orlandini, March 22, 2019 (Annex C to Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal dated March 25, 2019).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 30: Testament, Arts. 3, 11 **(R-23);** Mart\u00ednez-Lejarza Statement, para. 9 **(CWS-** 1).\n\n121.\n\nThird, the Claimants assert that the probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court will remain open until Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims against Bolivia are fully resolved.271 Therefore, in the Claimants' view, the suspension of the proceedings would be \"impractical.\"272\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 33: Martinez-Lejarza Statement, para. 11 **(CWS-1).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 33.\n\n122.\n\nSimilarly to the application for termination, the Respondent\u2019s request for a suspension requires that the Tribunal rule on matters on which it has not been fully briefed. The Tribunal must give the Parties full opportunity to submit evidence and present arguments on matters such as: (i) the existence of a requirement of continuous nationality and its potential application to the facts of this case: (ii) the relevance, if any, of the identity of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s heirs or the beneficiaries of the JMO Trust; or (iii) the relevance of the probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court and whether such proceeding can conclude before the disposition of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s (and his estate\u2019s) claims in this arbitration.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal is not in a position to rule definitively on any of those, or other relevant, matters without hearing further from the Parties. Moreover, because the Tribunal needs to hear further from the Parties, the disposition of those matters at the current stage may affect one or the other Party's due process rights. The questions raised by the Parties need to be fully aired before this Tribunal. A suspension of the proceedings would not achieve that objective.\n\n124.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is reluctant to suspend these proceedings in light of the possibility that the probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court may not be closed until Mr. Orlandini\u2019s claims against Bolivia are resolved by this Tribunal. In such a scenario, the suspension of these proceedings would not only be impractical but place the Claimants in a situation of legal limbo and this would impede the process of rendering justice. To the extent that such a possibility exists, the suspension of these proceedings is not justified.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot, at this stage, grant the Respondent\u2019s alternative application to suspend the arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent is not precluded from renewing its application for suspension if in the course of the arbitration proceedings evidence emerges that a suspension would better serve the interests of justice.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Application for Trifurcation**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree to a separate stage of the proceedings dedicated to damages in case the Tribunal finds jurisdiction and liability. In light of that agreement, the question the Tribunal needs to decide is whether to hear the matters related to its jurisdiction and the matters related to the Respondent\u2019s liability in two separate stages or together, in one stage.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Parties do not disagree materially with respect to the applicable criteria for bifurcating jurisdiction from liability/merits. For example, the Respondent relies on the decision of the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Australia* to identify three criteria for bifurcation: (i) whether the jurisdictional objections are *prima facie* serious and substantial; (ii) whether the jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits; and (iii) whether the jurisdictional objections, if granted, are capable of disposing of the whole case or an essential part of the case.273 The Respondent also refers to the decision of the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Australia* to point out that a tribunal\u2019s decision on bifurcation must take into consideration the matter of efficiency, i.e., the savings of costs and time that may result from bifurcation.274\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 92.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 90.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants have also relied on the criteria articulated by the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Australia* and on the (very similar) criteria articulated by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold* v. *United States.275* The Tribunal will also rely on those criteria in its analysis and consideration of the application for bifurcation of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 39-40.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal is, however, reluctant to engage in an analysis of whether the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent are serious and substantial. As discussed in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the application for termination, the Tribunal believes that it is premature to form a view on the seriousness of the objections. Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not prepared to rule that the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent are not serious or not substantial and deny bifurcating them on that basis.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal further believes that at least some of the jurisdictional objections, if granted, are capable of disposing of the entire case or of an essential part of the case. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot deny bifurcating the jurisdictional objections on that basis either.\n\n131.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, therefore, the key question is whether the jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits (more specifically, with the questions of liability). The Tribunal believes that they are.\n\n132.\n\nFor example, while the *ratione personae* objections relating to Mr. Orlandini\u2019s nationality may seemingly require only an analysis of legal matters, the Tribunal\u2019s task would be more complicated if the Tribunal were to find eventually that it needs to decide on Mr. Orlandini\u2019s \"dominant and effective\" nationality. Such an inquiry would inevitably lead the Tribunal into an investigation of factual matters relating to Mr. Orlandini\u2019s actions in relation to his business and his investments in Bolivia. Further, an analysis of the *ratione materiae* objections would require a factual analysis of what rights the Claimants acquired, how, when, etc., which would also inevitably lead the Tribunal to delve into facts that would also be relevant to liability.\n\n133.\n\nThe problem that arises out of situations where the jurisdictional objections are, at least in some respects, intertw ined with the merits, is two-fold. First, evidence, such as documents and witness testimony, relevant to the determination of jurisdiction would also be relevant to the detennination of liability. Thus, assuming the Tribunal finds jurisdiction, the Tribunal will have to review the same or substantially the same evidence in the next phase of the proceedings, dedicated to liability. Such an overlap would not contribute to the efficient conduct of the proceedings. It will hardly be efficient if the same documents would have to be reviewed twice, the same witnesses would have to be heard twice, etc.\n\n134.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more significantly, such overlap of evidence may result in due process concerns. At the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal w ill need to make certain findings of fact. To the extent that the same facts are also relevant to liability, and if the Tribunal reaches that stage, the Tribunal may have prejudged some of the issues of fact without having heard (at the jurisdictional stage) all the relevant evidence, which will only become fully available to the Tribunal at the liability stage.\n\n135.\n\nIn light of its conclusion that the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent are, at least w ith respect to significant matters of fact, intertw ined with the merits, the Tribunal concludes that bifurcation of the jurisdictional objections is not warranted and that they should be heard together w ith the matters of liability.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal further believes that its decision not to bifurcate jurisdiction from liability is not at variance with the goal of conducting efficient proceedings. When jurisdictional objections are raised, there is always the possibility that the tribunal declines jurisdiction. In a unitary proceeding, such a result would lead to inefficiency in that the parties will have also spent time and resources arguing the merits. This possibility has to be weighed against the inefficiency of the tribunal finding jurisdiction after a separate jurisdictional stage and only then proceeding to the merits. When seeking to determine which of the two alternatives is more likely to result in a more efficient proceeding, tribunals take into consideration, among other matters, the time, cost and fees associated with the presentation of the parties\u2019 case on damages, the engagement of damages experts, etc., which typically constitutes part of the merits stage.\n\n137.\n\nHere, however, the Claimants do not oppose bifurcation of the damages stage if jurisdiction and liability are heard together. A lion-bifurcated stage of jurisdiction and liability would not be as time-consuming and expensive as a non-bifurcated proceeding that also includes damages. If the Respondent prevails on jurisdiction, additional time and cost will have been spent (unnecessarily) on presenting the case on liability; however, that additional cost will be less, possibly significantly so, than the typical case that includes damages.\n\n138.\n\nMoreover, trifurcation of the proceedings into jurisdiction, liability and quantum, as requested by the Respondent, would result (assuming the Claimants are successful on jurisdiction and liability) in three sequential stages of the proceedings. The Tribunal finds that this would materially prolong the duration of the proceedings, delay the final disposition of the dispute and cause increased costs.\n\n139.\n\nThus, the Tribunal has to balance the possibility that the case may be dismissed on jurisdiction after a separate jurisdictional stage without engaging in the matters of liability and damages against the possibility that the case will proceed to three separate stages resulting in considerable length and increased cost of the proceedings.276 In light of the totality of the circumstances as currently known by the Tribunal, and in particular (i) the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits, and (ii) the Parties\u2019 agreement to bifurcate damages, the Tribunal believes that hearing jurisdiction and liability together is more likely to contribute to the efficient conduct of the proceedings.\n\nA third possibility would be that that the Tribunal deals first with jurisdiction alone and then (assuming it finds jurisdiction) hear liability and quantum together. The Tribunal believes that hearing jurisdiction and liability first and quantum later (if necessary) is most likely to contribute to the efficient conduct of the proceedings.\n\n**3. The Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the applicable standard. The views of the Parties differ somewhat in that regard. The Respondent refers to a four-limb test: (i) whether there is, *prima facie,* a reasonable prospect that the Tribunal will issue an award in favor of the Respondent including its costs of legal representation *(fumus boni iuris);* (ii) whether harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages may be caused if the measure is not ordered; (iii) whether such harm would substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and (iv) whether the measure requested is of such urgency that it cannot be postponed until the issuance of the award.277\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 109; *Manuel* *Garc\u00eda Armas and others* v. *Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, June 20, 2018, para. 191 **(RLA-52).**\n\n141.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, security for costs is \"an extraordinary measure\" that is granted only \"in the most extreme and exceptional of circumstances.\"278 In the Claimants' view, \"[a] general doubt or concern for a party\u2019s inability to pay\",279 or \"even financial distress and the risk that an adverse costs award will go unpaid\"280 is not sufficient. For the Claimants, the burden is on the Respondent to prove that the Claimants are unable or unwilling to comply with a costs order.281\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 127.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 132-133; Respondent\u2019s Triple Application, paras. 118-121.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, paras. 132-133; *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No. 3 - Decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures, June 23, 2015, para. 123 **(CLA-42);** *South American Silver Limited* v. *Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2013-15, Procedural Order No. 10, January 11, 2016, para. 67 **(RLA-54).**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opposition, para. 133; *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No. 3 - Decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures, June 23, 2015, para. 123 **(CLA-42);** *South American Silver Limited v. Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2013-15, Procedural Order No. 10, January 11, 2016. para. 67 **(RLA-54).**\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal is reluctant to opine, at this stage of the proceedings, on whether there is a reasonable prospect of an award of costs in favor or against either Party. To the extent that there is a reasonable prospect of an award of costs against the Claimants, there is also a reasonable prospect of an award of costs against the Respondent. Any pronouncement by the Tribunal on the matter at this stage would be premature. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot issue a ruling on the Respondent\u2019s application for security for costs on the basis of whether it is reasonable, or not, to expect that there would be an award of costs against the Claimants.\n\n143.\n\nThat, however, does not mean that a tribunal would be precluded from ordering security for costs at an early stage of the proceedings if such an order is compelled by other factors. The Tribunal believes that such factors would include: (i) a claimant\u2019s track record of non-payment of cost awards in prior proceedings; (ii) a claimant\u2019s improper behavior in the proceedings at issue, such as conduct that interferes with the efficient and orderly conduct of the proceedings; (iii) evidence of a claimant moving or hiding assets to avoid any potential exposure to a cost award; or (iv) other evidence of a claimant\u2019s bad faith or improper behavior.282\n\n*See for example.* *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues. June 23, 2008 **(CLA-20);** *Commerce Group Corp. & San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v. El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Decision on El Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs, September 20, 2012 **(CLA-21);** *South American Silver Limited v. Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2013-15, Procedural Order No. 10. January 11, 2016 **(RLA-54);** *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14, Procedural Order No. 3 - Decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures, June 23, 2015 **(CLA-42);** *RSM Production Corporation* v. *Saint Lucia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on Saint Lucia\u2019s Request for Security for Costs, August 13, 2014 **(RLA-58).**\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that other factors, such as third-party funding or a claimant\u2019s serious and proven financial difficulties, may also play a role in the assessment of whether security for costs should be ordered. However, those factors should be assessed in the context of all other relevant circumstances and would typically not, in and of themselves, constitute a sufficient basis for such an order.\n\n145.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal agrees that a balancing test must be applied when considering the potential harm to a respondent resulting from the non-payment of a cost award and the potential harm to a claimant resulting from an order of security for costs. The potential harm to a respondent, i.e., the inability to recover its costs pursuant to a cost award, if no security for costs is ordered, must be weighed against the potential harm to a claimant, taking into account that: (i) providing security involves costs of its own; (ii) a claimant should not be required to pay a \"fee\" for the right to submit a claim (in addition to the filing fees and advance payments);283 and (iii) a claimant\u2019s financial distress may be caused by the respondent\u2019s actions that are the subject of the dispute, etc. All these circumstances may play a role in striking the right balance when assessing the potential harm to a claimant or to a respondent.\n\n*See for example,* *Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A v. Albania.* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, May 3, 2012, para. 41 (\"Even if there were more persuasive evidence than that offered by the Respondent concerning the Claimants\u2019 ability or willingness to pay a possible award on costs, the Tribunal would be reluctant to impose on the Claimants what amounts to an additional financial requirement as a condition for the case to proceed.\") **(CLA-22).**\n\n146.\n\nIn applying those tests, the Tribunal takes into account the following factors. First, the Claimants have paid their share of the advance payment. There is no evidence that the Claimants experienced financial difficulties in making that payment. Second, pursuant to Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Second Claimant was to \"bear any costs of arbitration, as defined in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, that may arise from the legal representative of Mr. Orlandini\u2019s estate not ratifying the actions taken by the Second Claimant in this arbitration.\" Although this event did not arise, the Second Claimant\u2019s acceptance of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling does not evidence reluctance or inability to make the payments necessary for the conduct of the proceedings. On the contrary, it demonstrates the Claimants\u2019 willingness to shoulder the necessary financial burden to ensure the continuation of the proceedings. Third, the Claimants have not engaged in any abuse, serious misconduct, inappropriate behavior, dilatory tactics or bad faith actions during the course of these proceedings.\n\n147.\n\nThe Parties have presented extensive arguments with respect to the financial situation of the Claimants and their financial ability, or inability, to comply with a potential costs award. The Tribunal does not believe that it is necessary, at this stage, to engage in further analysis of the Claimants\u2019 financial situation. As a factual matter, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the Claimants have demonstrated their willingness and ability to cover their share of the costs of these proceedings. As a legal matter, this Tribunal is of the view that financial distress, in and of itself, does not provide a sufficient basis for ordering security for costs. In that sense, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *EuroGas v. Slovakia* that \"financial difficulties and third party-funding\u2014 which has become a common practice\u2014do not necessarily constitute *per se* exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order of security for costs.\"284\n\n*EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No. 3 - Decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures, June 23, 2015, para. 123 **(CLA-42).**\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to opine on the significance of third-party funding for an order of security for costs. Pursuant to Section 11 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties are required to \"submit a written notice disclosing the use of third party funding to cover the costs of this arbitration and the identity of the third party funder.\" This has not happened and, thus, any discussion of the relevance of third-party funding to these proceedings is, at this stage, unnecessary.\n\n149.\n\nIt is worth noting, in this context, that the decision of the tribunal in *Manuel Garc* \u00ed *a Armas v. Venezuela,* which the Parties have discussed extensively in their respective submissions, is distinguishable from the situation in this case for a number of reasons. Like this Tribunal, the *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas* tribunal agreed that the appropriate test is the existence of \"exceptional circumstances.\" It concluded, however, that such circumstances existed in that case as a result of the combination of third-party funding and the insolvency (or the lack of proof of solvency) of the claimants.285 On that basis, the *Manuel Garcia Armas* tribunal found that, on balance, the claimants\u2019 harm (in providing security for costs through their third-party funder) did not outweigh the potential harm to Venezuela.286 Whether one agrees with the *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas* tribunal or not, the situation in the present case is different, as discussed above, and the Tribunal is therefore not persuaded that exceptional circumstances exist.\n\n*Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas and others* v. *J enezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, June 20, 2018. para. 250 **(RLA-52).**\n\n*Manuel Garcia Armas and others* v. *Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, June 20, 2018. para. 233 **(RLA-52).**\n\n150.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal agrees that the urgency of an order of security for costs is a matter to be duly taken into consideration. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s arguments on urgency. The argument advanced by the Respondent is that it will continue to incur costs and fees, the amounts of which will increase as the proceedings advance.287 There is no sufficient evidence, however, that the financial situation of the Claimants is such that an order of security for costs is urgent. In particular, there is no evidence that the Claimants may be in a position to provide security for costs today but would lose that ability in the future. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent is of course free to renew its application should the circumstances change.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Triple Application, para. 129.\n\n151.\n\nOn balance, for all the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal is not persuaded that circumstances exist that warrant an order of security for costs.\n\n**VII. DECISION AND ORDERS**\n----------------------------\n\n152.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s request for termination or suspension of the proceedings;\n\n(b) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s request for trifurcation of the proceedings;\n\n(c) Bifurcates the proceedings into a stage of jurisdiction and liability to be followed, if necessary, by a stage on damages and quantum;\n\n(d) Invites the Parties to seek to reach an agreement on the schedule for the next stage of the proceedings (jurisdiction and liability) that is consistent with the non-bifurcated timetable set out under Scenario 1 of Annex 1 to Procedural Order No. 3, dated March 8, 2019, and inform the Tribunal of their agreement (or their respective views) by **Tuesday, July 23, 2019;**\n\n(e) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s application for security for costs;\n\n(f) Defers to a later stage its decision on the costs and fees relating to the stage of the proceedings dealing with the Respondent\u2019s Triple Application;\n\n(g) Declares that Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 is now moot;\n\n(h) Declares that counsel for the Second Claimant are duly authorized to represent the First Claimant, the Estate of Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda, in these arbitral proceedings; and\n\n(i) Rejects all other claims and requests for relief in this stage of the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No.15 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Application for a Partial Award and the Respondent\u2019s Second Request for Security for Costs)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2021-11-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No.15 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Application for a Partial Award and the Respondent\u2019s Second Request for Security for Costs)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

The Tribunal will request that the Parties make supplementary deposits in equal amounts, without prejudice to the final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs.\n\n2.\n\nOn February 4, 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO 1**\"). Section 11 (Third Party Funding) of PO 1 reads as follows:\n\n11.1 The Parties shall submit a written notice disclosing the use of third party funding to cover the costs of this arbitration and the identity of the third party funder. Such notice shall be sent to the Tribunal once the third party funding agreement has been signed.\n\n11.2 Each Party bears the ongoing duty to disclose any change in the information addressed in Section 11.1 occurred after the initial disclosure, including termination or withdrawal of the funding agreement.\n\n3.\n\nOn April 24, 2019, the Respondent submitted its *Solicitud de Terminaci\u00f3n, Trifurcaci\u00f3n y Cautio Judicatum Solvi*, requesting, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal (i) order the Claimants to provide security for costs in the amount of, at least, USD 4 million to guarantee full payment of an award requiring the Claimants to bear the costs of arbitration (the \"**First SFC Request**\"); and (ii) order the Claimants to confirm whether they are using any third party funding and, if so, to disclose the identity of the funder, as well as the terms of the funding agreement.\n\n4.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, the Claimants submitted their Opposition to the Application for Termination, Trifurcation and Security for Costs, requesting, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's First SFC Request. In their submission, the Claimants further advised that they had \"no disclosures to make based on Procedural Order No. 1\".\n\n5.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Respondent's Application for Termination, Trifurcation and Security for Costs (the \"**First Decision on SFC**\"), in which the Tribunal, *inter alia*, rejected the Respondent's application for security for costs.\n\n6.\n\nAt the pre-hearing conference held on March 18, 2021, and with the Tribunal's leave, the Parties made certain comments regarding the Respondent's contentions on the Claimants' alleged non-compliance with Section 11.1 of PO 1.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 22, 2021, and as directed by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted a written application \"for an order compelling Claimants to disclose the circumstances in which their claims in this arbitration are being funded\" (the \"**Application for Disclosure**\"). The Claimants submitted their response to the Application for Disclosure on March 29, 2021.\n\n8.\n\nAlso on March 29, 2021, the Tribunal requested the Parties to make a supplementary deposit of USD 500,000 (*i.e.*, USD 250,000 each Party) no later than April 28, 2021 (the \"**First Supplementary Deposit**\"), in order to ensure sufficient funds for the Oral Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (the \"**Hearing**\") and the preparation of the Tribunal's ruling on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n9.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 12, in which the Tribunal (i) took note of the Claimants' statement that there was no funding agreement, whether in writing or oral, with a third-party funder; and (ii) declined the remaining requests included in the Application for Disclosure.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 8, 2021, the Respondent informed that it \"cannot make any further deposits of public funds unless and until Claimants provide appropriate security for Bolivia's costs.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn April 9, 2021, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to make a substitute payment of the Respondent's share of the First Supplementary Deposit, as well as their own share (*i.e.*, USD 500,000 in total), without prejudice to any consequences that may arise from the Respondent's decision not to make further deposit payments in this case.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, the PCA confirmed receipt of USD 250,000 from the Claimants, representing their share of the First Supplementary Deposit. On the same day, the Claimants submitted certain comments regarding the Respondent's decision not to make any further deposit payments and reaffirmed their willingness and ability to advance the remainder of the total amount of the First Supplementary Deposit, should the Tribunal require it following the Hearing.\n\n13.\n\nThe Hearing was held by videoconference between May 17 and May 22, 2021.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 26, 2021, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent's share of the First Supplementary Deposit remained unpaid and requested the Claimants to make a substitute payment of the Respondent's share of such deposit, in order to ensure sufficient funds for the preparation of the Tribunal's upcoming ruling.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, the PCA confirmed receipt of USD 250,000 from the Claimants, representing a substitute payment of the Respondent's share of the First Supplementary Deposit. On the same day, the Claimants submitted further comments on the Respondent's decision not to make further deposit payments, reserving their right to seek relief from the Tribunal in that respect and noting that they had made the substitute payment without prejudice.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 12, 2021, the Tribunal requested the Parties to make an additional supplementary deposit of USD 400,000 (*i.e.*, USD 200,000 each Party) (the \"**Second Supplementary Deposit**\") in order to ensure sufficient funds for the continued preparation of the Tribunal's upcoming ruling. It also invited the Respondent to revisit its decision not to make further deposit payments and inform the Tribunal accordingly.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 19, 2021, the Respondent confirmed \"that it cannot make any further deposit payments in this case unless and until Claimants provide appropriate security for Bolivia's costs.\"\n\n18.\n\nOn August 20, 2021, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to make a substitute payment of the Respondent's share of the Second Supplementary Deposit (*i.e.*, USD 200,000) pursuant to Article 43(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, without prejudice to any consequences that may arise from the Respondent's decision not to make any further deposit payments.\n\n19.\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Claimants submitted certain comments concerning the Respondent's refusal to pay the Second Supplementary Deposit, reserving their right to seek relief from the Tribunal in this respect, \"including Claimants' right to submit an application to the Tribunal for a partial award seeking reimbursement by Bolivia of the substitute payments made by Claimants and all costs associated with Bolivia's failure to make its payments as per the Tribunal's orders.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn September 15 and 17, 2021, the PCA confirmed receipt of two USD 200,000 payments from the Claimants, representing, respectively, their own share and the substitute payment of the Respondent's share of the Second Supplementary Deposit.\n\n21.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, the Claimants' submitted their Application for a Partial Award on Respondent's Obligation to Pay its Share of the Advance on Costs (the \"**Application for a Partial Award**\").\n\n22.\n\nOn October 2, 2021, and further to the Tribunal's invitation for comments on the Application for a Partial Award, the Respondent requested (i) additional time to respond to the Application for a Partial Award, such that its submission be due no later than October 22, 2021; and (ii) a one-day virtual hearing for oral argument on the Application for a Partial Award.\n\n23.\n\nOn October 4, 2021, the Tribunal advised that (i) it had decided to extend the deadline for the Respondent to submit its comments on the Application for a Partial Award until October 15, 2021; and (ii) it saw no need to hold a hearing on the Application for a Partial Award and thus rejected the Respondent's request in this respect.\n\n24.\n\nOn October 15, 2021, the Respondent submitted its Reply to Claimants' Application for a Partial Award and Request for Security for Costs (the \"**Reply on Partial Award and SFC Request**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn October 29, 2021, and at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants submitted their Opposition to Respondent's Second Request for Security for Costs (the \"**Opposition to SFC Request**\").\n\n**II. The Claimants' Application for a Partial Award**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\na) The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants begin by referring to the framework established by the Terms of Appointment, which \"constitute a valid and binding contract between the Parties as to how these proceedings would be conducted\", and provided for the Parties' obligation to make deposits in equal installments when so requested by the PCA or ordered by the Tribunal.1 The Claimants recall that, while they timely paid their share of the initial deposit of advance on costs, the Respondent only did so after being granted two extensions, soon after which it submitted the First SFC Request.2 They further reiterate some of their arguments to oppose the First SFC Request, as well as some of the reasons for which the Tribunal rejected it.3\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, para. 5; Terms of Appointment, Sections 11.1-11.2; PO 1, para. 1.\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 4, 6-7\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 8-9.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants are also critical of the Respondent's refusal to pay its share of the First Supplementary Deposit, which, in their view, lacked evidence or justification, as it disregarded its contractual obligations in this case and flaunted the Decision on the Respondent's Application for Termination, Trifurcation and Security for Costs and Procedural Order No. 12, whereby the Tribunal denied the Application for Disclosure.4 By again refusing to bear its share of the Second Supplementary Deposit, the Claimants argue, the Respondent has ignored the Tribunal's unwillingness to grant its request for security for costs and has instead exercised \"an improper 'self-help' remedy\", with the objective to obstruct the advancement and issuance of the award in this proceeding.5\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 11-13.\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 19-20.\n\n28.\n\nIn light of the Respondent's \"bad-faith refusal to fulfill its financial obligations without any justifiable reason\", the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should issue a partial award ordering the Respondent to reimburse them for the USD 450,000, with interest, that they have paid in this respect, which is authorized by Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and \"supported by well-accepted arbitral practice\".6 They note that an enforceable award is the only means to provide them with a legally protected method of recouping these funds now, and would also be without prejudice to the Tribunal's ability to make a different order as to the allocation of fees and costs at the conclusion of the present phase of the proceedings and its upcoming ruling on jurisdiction and merits.7\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 21-24.\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 39-40.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent's actions are in direct violation of the Tribunals directives of March 29 and August 12, 2021, as well as of the Respondent's express agreements.8 They explain that the Respondent has consented at least three times to pay half of the advances on costs throughout this proceeding, namely, by:\n\n(i) executing the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"**Treaty**\"), whereby the Respondent consented to arbitrate in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, which in turn enshrine, in Article 43(1), the principle that the parties bear the advance on costs in equal shares;\n\n(ii) accepting Section 11 of the Terms of Appointment, in which the Respondent assumed and consented to its obligation to pay supplementary deposits in equal amounts pursuant to Article 43(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules; and\n\n(iii) paying the first advance in the amount of USD 150,000 as requested by the Tribunal.9\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, para. 28.\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 25-27; Treaty, Art. IX.3(a)(iii).\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants argue that international arbitral tribunals have frequently confirmed a party's right to seek reimbursement from another party unwilling to pay its share of the advance on costs, as the obligation to pay such advance in equal shares forms an integral part of the arbitration agreement and the parties' general duties towards each other, aside from being also recognized by arbitral jurisprudence.10 They further stress that the purpose of Article 43(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules is to allow for the continuation of the proceedings by permitting a claimant to substitute a recalcitrant respondent's share of the advance payments, while also noting that this provision does not and cannot discharge the defaulting respondent from its obligation to pay half of the advance of costs, since such interpretation would render that obligation \"unenforceable and potentially meaningless in practice\".11\n\nApplication for a Partial Award, paras. 29-31. *See, inter alia,* *SensorDynamics AG Entwicklungs- UND Produktionsgesellschaft and Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der angewandten Forschung E.V.V.

Sky Park AB*, judgment rendered on December 29, 2000 in case T 5119-99, pp. 4-5 (**Respondent's Annex C**).\n\n34.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that the Claimants' application lacks merit and denies having refused to pay its share of the advance on costs without any justifiable reason or in bad faith.20 First, it contends that it is not obliged under any set of rules \"to finance the frivolous claims of a purported investor\", explaining that it only stopped regular payments of the advance on costs after it had become undisputed the Claimants have no assets whatsoever and the Claimants refused to provide security for the Respondent's costs and to disclose information regarding their funding.21 In particular, the Respondent reiterates that it is undisputed that it would not be able to recover any of the significant costs if the Tribunal were to grant the Claimants' application, seeing that (i) the Claimants do not have any assets, other than the potential proceeds of this arbitration; (ii) the timing and substance of the application further confirms the Claimants' \"dire financial straits\"; (iii) there is no evidence that the Claimants themselves made the payments of the advance on costs; and (iv) Mr. Orlandini was \"a serial debtor and defaulter\" and CMO reflected the same pattern of conduct, which came to light after the Respondent paid the first advance on costs.22\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 18, 39.\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 19-20.\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 20-26. *See also id.* at 17.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, the Respondent underscores that it has not breached any obligation to pay its share of the advance on costs because its position has always been that it is unable to make further payments \"unless and until Claimants provide appropriate security for Bolivia's costs\".23\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 27-28 (emphasis omitted); *BDMS LIMITED v. RAFAEL ADVANCED DEFENCE SYSTEMS* [2014] EWHC 451 (Comm), para. 57 (**Claimants' Annex D**).\n\n36.\n\nThird, the Respondent opines that it is the Claimants, rather than the Respondent, who have breached their duty to arbitrate in good faith, noting that (i) at the very same time the Claimants confirmed that they had no third-party funding agreement, they were using the services of Black Cube, whose fees were covered by a third-party funder (Ofer Amir); and (ii) the Claimants have not submitted a single invoice issued to them by its counsel or experts, or any evidence of payment of such amounts, the only invoice of this kind being from Black Cube and for a lower amount than that stated by Dr. Avi Yanus at the Hearing.24\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 29-35; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 82:13-25, 83:1-7, 84:1- 16 (Mr. Avi Yanus); Claimants' Costs Submission, 21 July 2021, Annexes A-D.\n\n37.\n\nFourth, the Respondent considers inapposite the ICSID and commercial arbitration decisions relied upon by the Claimants, since, in those cases, there was no evidence of the claimants' precarious financial situation, history of unpaid debts or inability to honor an adverse award on costs.25\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, para. 36. *See* *SensorDynamics AG Entwicklungs- UND Produktionsgesellschaft and Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der angewandten Forschung E.V.V.

Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award, October 5, 2012, para. 82 (**RLA-362**).\n\n39.\n\nLastly, the Respondent contends that, in any event, a partial award on costs should not be made considering that it has put forward well-founded jurisdictional objections (*ratione personae, materiae, temporis* and *voluntatis*) and demonstrated that the Claimants' claims related to the *Mart\u00ednez* case are meritless.27\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 40-45; *Scan Coin Industries AB v.

The Respondent's Second Request for Security for Costs**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent refers to its First SFC Request and the Tribunal's decision thereon, claiming that \"circumstances have changed dramatically\" since then, such that a renewed request for an order of security for costs is warranted (the \"**Second Request for SFC**\").29 In its view, if this request is not upheld, the harm to the Respondent will far outweigh any harm that such order may cause to the Claimants.30\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 46-47.\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, para. 47.\n\n42.\n\nFirst, the Respondent insists that the evidence on record confirms that the Claimants are not capable of honoring a future adverse award on costs and that the Estate of Mr. Orlandini has no assets other than the claims submitted in this arbitration (which have an \"estimated fair market value\" of USD 0.00), which in turn is \"exclusively the result of Claimants' own *modus operandi* of incurring debts, refusing to honor them, and compelling their creditors to seek judicial enforcement against their assets\".31\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 48-50; Procedural Order No. 8, July 27, 2020, Respondent's Request 3(iii), pp. 315-316 [PDF]; In the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida Probate Division, In re: Estate of Julio M. Orlandini Agreda, Inventory, May 20, 2019, p. 2 (**R-463**).\n\n43.\n\nSecond, while the First Decision on SFC was largely premised on the Tribunal's assumption that the Claimants had not engaged in any inappropriate behavior or bad faith actions, and on their non-disclosure of the use of third-party funding, the Respondent recalls that evidence to the contrary came to light during the Hearing, when Black Cube revealed the existence of the funder Ofer Amin.32 The existence of a third-party funder, together with the fact that the funder has not provided coverage to protect the Respondent's right to the reimbursement of costs in this proceeding, would justify that the Tribunal order a *cautio judicatum solvi* as the tribunal in *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* did.33\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 51-52; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 82:13-25, 83:1-7 (Mr. Avi Yanus).\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 53-55; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 39:14-20 (Mr. Avi Yanus);*Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas y otros c. la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela*, PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, June 20, 2018, para. 225 (**RLA-52**); *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures, December 12, 2013, para. 73 (**Claimants' Annex G**).\n\n44.\n\nThird, the Respondent posits that this is a case of much more than simply an impecunious claimant, recalling that (i) the Claimants have an established track record of non-compliance with their debts, including by moving or hiding assets to avoid any potential exposure to its creditors; (ii) various examples have been provided of creditors who sought to enforce payment of Mr. Orlandini's or CMO's overdue debts and \"were foiled by Claimants' avoidance tactics\", such as the *Mart\u00ednez* case; and (iii) CMO was placed under the administration of the State in the mid-1980s and a criminal complaint was filed for several crimes of economic nature.34\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, paras. 56-60.\n\n45.\n\nFourth, the Respondent notes that an order for security would not cause any harm to the Claimants, since the cost of posting such security could easily be recovered as part of the Tribunal's final decision on the allocation of costs and there is no risk that the Claimants may be unable to collect on a favorable costs award.35\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, para. 61.\n\n46.\n\nFifth and last, the Respondent underscores that the relief it seeks cannot wait for the issuance of the Tribunal's final award, as it is urgent that at least some assurance be provided that the Respondent will be in a position to collect on a favorable costs award.36\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, para. 62.\n\n47.\n\nFor these reasons, and in addition to the dismissal of the Application for a Partial Award, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n\u25cf Order Claimants to post security for Bolivia's costs in the present arbitration, in an amount of, at least, US$ 5 million, within 15 days of the Tribunal's order, by either:\n\n- Providing an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit from a reputable international bank, pledged in favor of Bolivia and to be released on the order of the Tribunal; or\n\n- Making a deposit, pledged in favor of Bolivia, into an escrow account to be designated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, under the sole control of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and direction of the Tribunal.\n\n\u25cf Grant any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.37\n\nReply on Partial Award and SFC Request, para. 64. The Respondent further requests that the Tribunal \"refrain from issuing its upcoming ruling on jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits, unless and until Claimants provide adequate security for Bolivia's costs\". *See id.* at 63.\n\nb) The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants first recall the background of the First Decision on SFC, explaining that the circumstances that led to it \"are exactly the same today\", as the current circumstances confirm the Claimants' continuing willingness and ability to shoulder the costs of this arbitration to ensure its continuation.38 As such, they submit that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent's request because it (i) is based on misstatements; (ii) attempts improperly to reargue the merits of the case; (iii) does not meet the high standard governing security for costs; and (iv) unnecessarily increases the costs and aggravates this proceeding.39\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 4-6. *See generally id.* at 7-13.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 14, 40.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants contend that security for costs is an extraordinary measure which is granted \"in the most extreme and exceptional circumstances\", in line with Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules and the findings of various investment tribunals.40 In particular, they emphasize that evidence of a party's financial distress or use of third-party funding does not alone constitute exceptional circumstances justifying security for costs, such that this measure would be especially inappropriate when the claimant's financial condition is allegedly the result of the State measures at issue in the arbitration.41 As the requesting party, the Respondent bears the burden of establishing \"extreme and exceptional circumstances\", as well as the requirements stated in Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, including that (i) there is a reasonable possibility that it will succeed on its defenses, without pre-judgment by the tribunal; (ii) there is a reasonable possibility that it will receive a cost award in its favor; (iii) the Claimants are unwilling or unable to pay a costs award if granted; (iv) the harm prevented by the requested measure would substantially outweigh the countervailing burden of the Claimants; and (v) there is urgency justifying issuance of a security for costs order.42 Adding that the Respondent's conduct in this proceeding is also relevant in assessing its request, the Claimants conclude that such request fails to meet any of the relevant requirements.43\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 15-18; *South American* *Silver Limited v.

The Claimants further note that the Respondent has only cited the inventory of Mr. Orlandini's estate in Florida in this regard, insisting that, under basic accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the value of a contingent claim should be reported as zero, until it is paid.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 27-28.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 29-30.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 31.\n\n51.\n\nSecond, the Claimants criticize that the Respondent's request comes belatedly and at a very late stage, while it presents no track record of non-payment of costs awards, improper behavior or dilatory tactics, and only repeats the arguments from prior submissions concerning the Respondent's version of events that occurred twenty or more years ago.49\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 33.\n\n52.\n\nThird, the Claimants opine that the Respondent will not prevail on the merits of the case and has otherwise not conducted itself in a manner that would merit a costs award under any circumstances, noting that the Respondent has failed to establish or even argue that there is a reasonable possibility of the contrary.50\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 34.\n\n53.\n\nFourth, in the Claimants' view, the Respondent has not met its burden of demonstrating that they would or could not satisfy a costs award.51\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 35.\n\n54.\n\nFifth, they contend that the burden of posting security for costs would compound that which the Claimants have already borne by covering Respondent's unpaid share of the advance on costs, stressing that the history of this proceeding and the Respondent's \"recalcitrance\" show that it will not comply with an award on costs in favor of the Claimants.52 Conversely, they observe, the Respondent would face no harm if security for costs were not granted.53\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 36. The Claimants further recall that, in its First Decision on SFC, the Tribunal already rejected the Respondent's assumption that the requested \"extraordinary relief\" would not harm them.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 36.\n\n55.\n\nSixth, the Claimants dispute the alleged urgency of the Respondent's request, since it is premised upon \"new circumstances\" allegedly disclosed between mid-2019 and the Hearing, and suggest that the request was devised *post hoc* further to undermine this proceeding and to manufacture a response to the Application for a Partial Award.54\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 37.\n\n56.\n\nSeventh, the Claimants posit that the timing of this request is prejudicial to their rights and this proceeding, claiming that the Respondent should not be permitted to use it to relitigate its case on the merits at this late stage in the arbitration.55\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 38; *Guaracachi America, Inc. & Rurelec v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, Procedural Order No. 14, March 11, 2013, para. 8 (**RLA-57**); *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v.

Park (ed), Arbitration International, (\u00a9 The Author(s); Oxford University Press 2017, Volume 33 Issue 3), pp. 427-495, p. 488 (**Claimants' Annex B**).\n\n58.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants submit that an order for security for costs is unjustified in the present circumstances, stressing that they have satisfied their financial obligations in these proceedings and will continue to do so, while such an order would impose a significant hurdle to their pursuit of access to justice.57 Accordingly, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Reject Respondent's Second Request for security for costs;\n\n(b) Order Respondent to pay all of Claimants' costs incurred in responding to Respondent's Second Request for security for costs;\n\n(c) Reject all of Respondent's remaining requests for relief; and\n\n(d) Order such other relief as the Tribunal may deem just and proper.58\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, paras. 40-41.\n\nOpposition to SFC Request, para. 42.\n\n**IV. Analysis**\n----------------\n\na) The Claimants' Application for a Partial Award\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis with the question whether it has the authority to issue a partial award as requested by the Claimants. Pursuant to Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"[t]he arbitral tribunal may make separate awards on different issues at different times.\" There is nothing in this provision that limits the Tribunal's powers to issue a partial award regarding the Respondent's obligation to pay its share of the advance on costs. The Tribunal's powers in that regard would only be circumscribed by the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Article 43 of the UNCITRAL Rules grants tribunals broad authority to fix amounts payable as advances on costs and to require that the parties pay them in equal shares. Moreover, pursuant to Article 42(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, a tribunal has the power to allocate costs (not just advance payments) in a partial award prior to entering the final award in a case. The Claimants' Application for a Partial Award thus falls squarely within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, rejects the Respondent's argument that Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules is not a proper basis for the Tribunal's power to issue a partial award on costs advances. The Tribunal further disagrees with the Respondent's argument that Article 43(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not authorize the Claimants to request a partial award on cost advances or the Tribunal to grant such a request.\n\n61.\n\nNext, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the purpose of Article 43(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules is to allow for the continuation of the proceedings by permitting a claimant to substitute a recalcitrant respondent's share of the advance payments; however, zArticle 43(4) does not and cannot discharge the defaulting respondent from its obligation to pay half of the advance of costs if so ordered by a tribunal. The Claimants are also correct that the Respondent has failed to seek any order from the Tribunal altering the allocation of the advance on costs.\n\n62.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that it has the right to decline to pay its share of the advance on costs because the Claimants' claims are frivolous or meritless while the Respondent's jurisdictional objections are well-founded. Such determinations will be made by the Tribunal in its final award; the Respondent cannot proceed to act as if the Tribunal has already drawn such conclusions. The Tribunal is also unpersuaded that the Respondent has the right to decline making the requested advance payments because \"it is undisputed that it would not be able to recover any of the significant costs if the Tribunal were to grant the Claimants' application.\" The question whether the Claimants are impecunious has been dealt with, and will be dealt with below, in the context of the Respondent's Second Request for SFC. It is not open to the Respondent to withhold advance payments based on its own view of the Claimants' ability or inability to cover the Respondent's costs \u2013 this determination is for the Tribunal to make, and it is not for the Respondent to resort to a \"self-help\" type of conduct.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's further arguments in that regard also focus on the Claimants' alleged impecuniousness. Therefore, the Respondent's opposition to the Claimants' Application for a Partial Award depends on the Tribunal's ruling in favor of the Respondent on its Second Request for SFC.\n\n64.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' Application for a Partial Award should be denied because it constitutes a claim for specific performance. Whether or not a tribunal's order to make advance payments is characterized as an order for specific performance, the Tribunal is empowered to make such an order as discussed above.\n\n65.\n\nHaving said that, the Tribunal is of the view that an essential element is missing from the Claimants' argument in support of its Application for a Partial Award. The Claimants have failed to substantiate why it is necessary *at this stage* to issue a partial award requiring that the Respondent make the requisite advance payments. Both Parties agree that the Tribunal has the authority to allocate the costs of the arbitration, as well as the Parties' costs and fees, in its final award. Indeed, it is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion with respect to that matter, including pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Claimants have not made a persuasive case that covering the Respondent's share of the advance payments imposes on them a burden that would be too onerous to bear.\n\n66.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal believes that a ruling on costs, including a potential order that the Respondent reimburse the Claimants for the Respondent's share of the advance payments (or any other disposition relating to the costs and fees incurred in this arbitration) can and should be made in the Tribunal's final award \u2013 including, if necessary, an appropriate interest rate.\n\n67.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants' Application for a Partial Award.\n\nb) The Respondent's Second Request for Security for Costs\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn its First Decision on SFC, the Tribunal determined that the factors relevant to its determination would include: (i) a claimant's track record of non-payment of cost awards in prior proceedings; (ii) a claimant's improper behavior in the proceedings at issue, such as conduct that interferes with the efficient and orderly conduct of the proceedings; (iii) evidence of a claimant moving or hiding assets to avoid any potential exposure to a cost award; or (iv) other evidence of a claimant's bad faith or improper behavior. The Tribunal also observed that other factors, such as third-party funding or a claimant's serious and proven financial difficulties, may also play a role in the assessment of whether security for costs should be ordered. However, those factors should be assessed in the context of all other relevant circumstances and would typically not, in and of themselves, constitute a sufficient basis for such an order.59\n\n*See* Decision on the Respondent's Application for Termination, Trifurcation and Security for Costs, July 9, 2019, paras. 143-144.\n\n69.\n\nThe gist of the Respondent's Second Request for SFC is that \"circumstances have changed dramatically\" since its First SFC Request. The Respondent asserts that the evidence on record confirms that the Claimants are not capable of honoring a future adverse award on costs because, *inter alia*, the Estate of Mr. Orlandini has no assets other than the claims submitted in this arbitration. The Respondent further argues that evidence of the existence of a third-party funder was revealed by Black Cube during the Hearing. Next, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants have an established track record of non-compliance with their debts and avoiding payment to creditors, as confirmed during the Hearing.\n\n70.\n\nSeparately, the Respondent argues that an order for security would not cause any harm to the Claimants and that the relief it seeks cannot wait for the issuance of the Tribunal's final award; the matter, says the Respondent, is urgent because currently there is no assurance that the Respondent will be in a position to collect on a favorable costs award.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Respondent's request. The vast majority of the Claimants' arguments, however, focus on the same matters that the Respondent invoked in its First SFC Request. The Tribunal has already ruled on that request and the Claimants' related arguments and does not believe it should repeat its conclusions here. Instead, the Tribunal will address the question whether any newly-arisen circumstances and new evidence emerged at the Hearing require that the Tribunal reconsider its previous decision.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, none of the evidence that emerged subsequent to the Tribunal's First Decision on SFC has affected the factors (listed in para. 68 above) that the Tribunal found relevant for its determination.\n\n73.\n\nIndeed it was revealed at the Hearing that a third-party funder covered the fees of Black Cube. No evidence emerged, however, that a third-party funder covered the Claimants' counsel's legal fees and the Claimants' arbitration costs, including the advance payments made by the Claimants to cover their own share, as well as for the Respondent's share, of those payments. Moreover, as the Tribunal ruled in its earlier First Decision on SFC, the existence of a third-party funder may play a role but is not dispositive for granting security for costs, particularly if the other factors are not present.\n\n74.\n\nFurther, various arguments were advanced at the Hearing regarding the value of the Estate of Mr. Orlandini and its legal and financial situation. The Tribunal is still in the process of evaluating those arguments; nevertheless, the Tribunal does not share the Respondent's view that the evidence proffered at the Hearing in that context demonstrates a dramatic change of circumstances requiring that the Tribunal reconsider its earlier decision.\n\n75.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' alleged misbehavior, the Tribunal considers this assertion as an important part of the Respondent's case, *i.e.*, as an important part of its substantive defense against the Claimants' claims. The Tribunal is reluctant to rule on this matter before it has reached its conclusions and ruled on the matter in its final award.\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal takes seriously the Respondent's assertion that the Claimants have an established track record of non-compliance with their debts and of avoiding payment to creditors. This is, however, still a matter disputed between the Parties, on which the Tribunal has not made a final determination. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Claimants have been engaged in any effort to strip themselves of assets in order to avoid an adverse cost award in this arbitration.\n\n77.\n\nThe fact remains that the Claimants have continued making advance payments to cover the costs of this arbitration, including covering the Respondent's share of those advances on costs. As the Tribunal observed in its First Decision on SFC, this is not a case where the Claimants have a record of non-payment of advances on costs, cost orders, or awards. The payment or non-payment by the Claimants of certain debts and court judgments in Bolivia is a matter of dispute between the Parties, which is an important part of both the Claimants' claims and the Respondent's defenses. The Tribunal cannot reconsider its First Decision on SFC on the basis of such allegations before it has made a final determination on the key matters in dispute between the Parties in this case.\n\n78.\n\nFinally, the Respondent's arguments that an order for security would not cause any harm to the Claimants and that the relief it seeks cannot wait for the issuance of the Tribunal's final award are not new. They have already been addressed by the Tribunal in its First Decision on SFC and no new evidence has emerged that would affect the Tribunal's earlier analysis and conclusions on this point.\n\n79.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's Second Request for SFC.\n\n**V. Decision**\n---------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants' Application for a Partial Award is dismissed.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent's Second Request for SFC is dismissed.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal defers to a later stage its decision on costs and fees relating to the Claimants' Application for a Partial Award and the Respondent's Second Request for SFC."}]}
