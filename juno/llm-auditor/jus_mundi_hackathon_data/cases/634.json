FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis chapter summarizes the factual background of this arbitration insofar as it is necessary to rule on Bangladesh\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**1.** THE PARTIES\n------------------\n\n**1.1 The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant, Saipem S.p.A (\"Saipem\" or the \"Claimant\"), is a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Italy. Its principal office is situated at Via Martin di Cefalonia, 67, 20097 San Donato Milanese, Milan, Italy.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Professors Antonio Crivellaro and Luca Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Andrea Carta Mantiglia, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo, Via Barozzi 1.20122 Milan, Italy.\n\n**1.2 The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (\"Bangladesh\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Ajmalul Hossain QC, Mejbahur Rahman and Syed A Hossain, A. Hossain & Associates Law Offices, 3/B Outer Circular Road, Maghbazar, Dhaka-1217, Bangladesh.\n\n**2.** THE**PROJECT AND THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**2.1 The pipeline contract**\n-----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) is a State entity established under the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Ordinance of 1985 as amended by the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Act of 1989.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 February 1990, Saipem and Petrobangla entered into a contract to build a pipeline of 409 km to carry condensate and gas in various locations of the north east of Bangladesh (the \"Contract\"). The contract price amounted to USD 34,796,140 and BDT 415,664,200. The project was sponsored by the World Bank and financed to a large extent by the International Development Association (IDA).\n\n8.\n\nClause 1.2.5 of the Contract afforded Petrobangla the right to retain 10% of each progress payment due to Salpem as Retention Money up to an amount equivalent to 5% of the total contract price, *i.e.,* USD 1,739,807 plus BDT 20,783,210 (the \"Retention Money\"). The Retention Money was to be released to Salpem In two tranches, half of It not later than 30 days from the Issuance of the Final Taking Over Certificate by Petrobangla, and the remaining half not later than 30 days from the Issuance of the Final Acceptance Certificate by Petrobangla.\n\n9.\n\nThe same Clause 1.2.5 of the Contract provided that Petrobangla could release the second half of the Retention Money prior to the Final Acceptance Certificate against a Warranty Bond of equal value from a bank acceptable to Petrobangla (the \"Warranty Bond\").\n\n10.\n\nThe Contract was governed by the laws of Bangladesh and contained the following arbitration clause:\n\nIf any dispute, question or difference should arise between the parties to this Contract with regard to rights and obligations hereunder which cannot be settled amicably, such dispute, question or difference shall be finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each party and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two arbitrators in accordance with the said Rules and if the arbitrators are unable to do so, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce under the said Rules. The venue of the arbitration shall be Dhaka, Bangladesh. The procedure in arbitration shall be in English.\n\n(Exh. C-4)\n\n**2.2 The origin of the present dispute**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to Article 1.1.14 of the Contract, the project was to be completed by 30 April 1991. It was, however, significantly delayed due to problems with the local population which rebelled against the project. On 29 May 1991, Saipem and Petrobangla, with the approval of the World Bank, agreed to extend the completion date by one year, *i.e.,* to 30 April 1992.\n\n12.\n\nThe project was completed and the pipeline taken over by Petrobangla with effect from 14 June 1992. Petrobangla issued the certificate of final taking over on 17 June 1992. Shortly thereafter, Petrobangla returned the first half of the Retention Money.\n\n13.\n\nThe second half of the Retention Money was to be released by Petrobangla against a warranty bond of the same amount, *i.e.,* USD 869,903.50 and BDT 10,391,605.00.\n\n14.\n\nThe warranty bond was provided on behalf of Saipem on 27 June 1992 (warranty Bond No. PG/USD/12/92 issued by Banque Indosuez; the \"Warranty Bond\"). Petrobangla agreed that such bond would be released no later than 30 days from the issuance of the certificate of final acceptance (see C-Mem, p. 26).\n\n15.\n\nOn 18 April 1993, Petrobangla sent an \"extend or pay letter\" in the following terms:\n\nThe validity of the captioned guarantee which was extended by you vide your letter No. CRDT/AU.-PG-12/92-551/93 dated 04-05-93, will expire on 30-06-93.\n\nWe have requested the Contractor to extend the validity of the said guarantee for further period up to 31-12-93 before its expiry.\n\nIf the Contractor does not give any extension of the validity of this guarantee before its expiry date i.e. 30-06-93, you will treat this letter as our encashment notice against the subject guarantee and in that event you will effect payment to us by a Demand-Draft drawn in favour of the Project Implementation Unit, Petrobangla.\n\n(Exh. R-67)\n\n16.\n\nIt is undisputed that Petrobangla did not repay the Retention Money even though the Warranty Bond had been issued. The parties disagree on whether the letter to \"extend or pay\" just quoted constitutes a call on the Warranty Bond and whether Petrobangla initiated an action to obtain and eventually obtained payment under the Warranty Bond.\n\n17.\n\nA dispute arose between the parties with respect to Petrobangla\u2019s failure (i) to pay the additional costs allegedly agreed, together with the extension of time as well as other compensations and (ii) to return the Warranty Bond and the balance of the Retention Money.\n\n**2.3 The ICC Arbitration**\n---------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAccording to the dispute resolution procedure set forth in the Contract, Saipem referred this dispute to ICC arbitration by filing a request for arbitration on 7 June 1993.\n\n19.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal composed of Dr. Werner Melis (Chairman), Prof. Riccardo Luzzatto and Prof. Ian Brownlie, QC, was constituted on 4 May 1994 (the \"ICC Arbitral Tribunal\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 27 November 1995, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued an award on jurisdiction dismissing Petrobangla\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction (Exh. C-7). It then addressed the merits of the case.\n\n21.\n\nIn substance, Saipem claimed compensation in excess of USD 11 million (USD 7,579,445 and BDT 123,350,330) and the return of the Warranty Bond. Petrobangla opposed these claims and raised several counterclaims in the total amount of USD 10,577,941.98.\n\n22.\n\nAfter the exchange of the written submissions in the ICC Arbitration, a witness hearing was held on 22-27 July 1997 in Dhaka. During the hearing, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal rejected several procedural motions made by Petrobangla, in particular (i) a request to strike from the record the statement of a witness produced by Saipem who could not attend the hearing, (ii) a request that all witnesses to be heard during the hearing be allowed to stay in the hearing room, (iii) a request that a letter from Petrobangla which was not on record be filed during the cross-examination of a witness, (iv) a request to strike from the record a \"draft aide-m\u00e9moire\" of the World Bank and certain unilaterally prepared calculations of costs, and (v) a request for written transcripts to be made of the tape recordings of the hearing.\n\n23.\n\nIn August 1997, Petrobangla wrote to the ICC Arbitral Tribunal to request information regarding Saipem\u2019s insurance policy and claims. The ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued an order that Saipem\u2019s refusal to submit the requested documents would be assessed at a later stage of the proceedings, when appropriate.\n\n24.\n\nOn 16 November 1997, Petrobangla filed an action seeking the revocation of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's authority in the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka (Exh. R-83)1. The action was based on the arbitrators\u2019 alleged misconduct and breach of the parties\u2019 procedural rights when rejecting Petrobangla\u2019s procedural motions during the hearing of 22-27 July 19972.\n\nOn 23 June 1999, Saipem filed an application for \"rejection of the application\" on the merits (Exh. R-85), which was refused by an order dated 5 September 1999 (Exh. R-87). Saipem did not appeal from this order in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court.\n\nPetrobangla also sought an interim injunction pending the hearing of its application, which was dismissed by the Court by an order dated 16 November 1997 (Exh. C-10.1). On 17 November 1997, Petrobangla filed an appeal from this order (Exh. C-10.2). By a judgment dated 2 May 1999, the High Court allowed Petrobangla\u2019s appeal, set aside the order dated 16 November 1997 of the lower court, and granted the interim injunction in respect of the proceedings of the ICC Tribunal (Exh. C-10.5). On 30 June 1999, Saipem appealed from this judgment in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and requested a stay of the operation of the Judgment of the High Court Division. The Appellate Division granted the stay and extended it by two separate orders dated 4 and 18 July 1999 until 22 July 1999. After having heard both parties, on 25 July 1999 the Appellate Division rendered a judgment upholding the High Court decision of 2 May 1999.\n\n25.\n\nOn 17 November 1997, Petrobangla seized the High Court of Dhaka of an application requesting a decision \"to stay all further proceedings of the Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK pending before the arbitral tribunal and/or to restrain the opposite party and/or the tribunal by and from proceeding further with the said arbitration\" (Exh. C-10.2).\n\n26.\n\nOn 24 November 1997, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh issued an injunction restraining Saipem from proceeding with the ICC Arbitration (Exh. C-10.3)3:\n\n[Saipem] is hereby restrained by an order of ad-interim injunction from proceeding with the said arbitration case No. 7934CK for a period of 8 (eight) weeks from date.\n\n(Exh. C-10.3, p. 2)\n\nSaipem appealed against the judicial stay of the arbitration on the ground that the Bangladeshi courts had no jurisdiction to decide on Petrobangla\u2019s petition regarding the alleged misconduct of the proceedings by the arbitrators. Specifically, Saipem submitted that the ICC Arbitration Rules elected by the parties provided for an exclusive mechanism for disqualification of the arbitrators and that such an election had to be taken into consideration according to Section V of the Bangladeshi Arbitration Act of 1940. Pursuant to this provision, \"the authority of an appointed arbitrator is irrevocable except with the leave of the court, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement\".\n\n27.\n\nSeveral other decisions confirmed and maintained the stay of the arbitration, including a decision of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh handed down on 23 March 1998 (Exh. C-10.4).\n\n28.\n\nOn 19 September 1999, Saipem filed a written objection to Petrobangla\u2019s action seeking the revocation of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's authority (Exh. R-88).\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 April 2000, the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka issued a decision revoking the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal on the following grounds:\n\nIn view of the submission of the lawyers for the parties and perusal of the documents filed by both sides I hold that the Arbitral Tribunal has conducted the arbitration proceedings improperly by refusing to determine the question of the admissibility of evidence and the exclusion of certain documents from the record as well as by its failure to direct that information regarding insurance be provided. Moreover, the Tribunal has manifestly been in disregard of the law and as such the Tribunal committed misconduct.\n\nTherefore, in the above circumstances, it appears to me that there is a likelihood of miscarriage of justice.\n\n(Exh. C-11, as quoted in Mem., p. 21, para. 92)\n\n30.\n\nIt is common ground that Saipem has not appealed this decision.\n\n31.\n\nOn 30 April 2001, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal decided to resume the proceedings on the ground that the challenge or replacement of the arbitrators in an ICC arbitration falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Court and not of the Bangladeshi courts. It thus held that the revocation of the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by the Bangladeshi courts was contrary to the general principles governing international arbitration (Exh. C-8).\n\n32.\n\nOn 9 May 2001, Petrobangla brought an action before the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka to set aside the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s order of 30 April resuming the arbitration (Exh. C-12).\n\n33.\n\nOn 24 May 2001, Petrobangla filed a request for a declaration that the ICC Arbitration was unlawful on the ground that the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal was revoked by the decision of the Subordinate Judge of 5 April 2000. It also applied for an interim and a permanent injunction. On the same day, the court refused to grant the interim injunction. On 27 May 2001, Petrobangla filed an appeal before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court against this refusal. On the same date, the High Court Division issued an injunction restraining Saipem from pursuing the ICC Arbitration4. This decision was confirmed by the High Court Division on 23 October 2001, 16 January 2002 and 15 July 2002.\n\nSaipem did not appear before the Court and the case is still pending.\n\n34.\n\nOn 9 May 2003, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal rendered an award holding that Petrobangla had breached its contractual obligations by not paying the compensation for time extension and additional works and ordered Petrobangla to pay to Saipem the total amount of USD 6,148,770.80 plus EUR 110,995.92 (which included the Retention Money which remained unpaid) plus interest at 3,375% from 7 June 1993. It also ordered Petrobangla to return the Warranty Bond to Saipem (the \"ICC Award\"; Exh. C-6).\n\n35.\n\nOn 19 July 2003, Petrobangla filed an application before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh under Sections 42(2) and 43 of the Arbitration Act 2001 to set aside the ICC Award (Exhibit C-13).\n\n36.\n\nOn 21 April 2004, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh denied Petrobangla\u2019s application to set aside the Award as it was \"misconceived and incompetent inasmuch as there is no Award in the eye of the law, which can be set aside\" (Exh. C-21, p. 11). In the most relevant passage, the High Court Division decision reads as follows:\n\n[...] On a perusal of materials on record and particularly Annexure-\"D\" that is the judgment passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, First Court, in Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997, it appears that the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to proceed with the Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK/AER/ACS/MS has been revoked on 5.4.2000. Therefore the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded with the said arbitration case most illegally and without jurisdiction after the pronouncement of the judgment of Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997. Moreover, the Arbitral Tribunal was injuncted upon by the High Court Division not to proceed with the said arbitration case any further but in spite of that the Tribunal proceeded with the Arbitration Case and ultimately declared their Award on 9.5.2003. [...]\n\nThe applicable law of the agreement was set out in clause 1.1.1a of the agreement in the following terms: \"1.1.1a The contract shall be governed and construed with reference to the law in force in Bangladesh...\". Thus it is clear the Bangladesh Court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit/proceeding if initiated by a party to the Contract. Therefore, the judgment passed by the First Subordinate Judge in Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997 and the injunction order dated 2.5.1999 passed by this Court in the Miscellaneous Appeal No. 25 of 1997 were binding upon the Arbitral Tribunal [...]\n\nIt is, thus, clear and obvious that the Award dated 9.5.2003 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal in Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK/AER/ACS/MS is a nullity in the eye of the law and this Award can not be treated as an Award in the eye of the law as it is clearly illegal and without jurisdiction inasmuch as the authority of the Tribunal was revoked as back as on 5.4.2000 by a competent Court of Bangladesh. [...]\n\nA non-existent award can neither be set aside nor can it be enforced.\n\n(Exh. C-21, p. 11).\n\n**2.4 Related litigation**\n--------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 4 October 1992, at the request of a subcontractor of Saipem, a court in Bangladesh issued an injunction restraining payments by Petrobangla to Saipem. The injunction was lifted on 31 May 1993.\n\n38.\n\nOn 17 June 1993, Saipem obtained an injunction from the courts in Milan prohibiting Banque Indosuez Italy (the bank which had issued the Warranty Bond) to pay out on the Warranty Bond to Banque Indosuez Pakistan (the correspondent bank in Pakistan). This injunction was confirmed on 19 July 1993 and subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal of Milan on 12 August 19935.\n\nThe action on the merits, which was initiated to maintain the injunction was still pending at the time of the hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration (Tr. II 63:22-64:3).\n\n39.\n\nBeing exposed to the risk of a call on the Warranty Bond, on 12 February 1994, Banque Indosuez Pakistan filed an action before the Court of the 4th Sub-Judge of Dhaka for a declaration that no payment should be made in favor of Petrobangla under the Warranty Bond until the injunction of the court of Milan was vacated. According to the Court\u2019s order sheet, a further hearing was set on 4 June 2006. This action was still pending at the time of the hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration. Saipem is not a party to it (Tr. I 53:14-21).\n\n**2.5 The BIT**\n---------------\n\n40.\n\nThe present proceedings are brought on the basis of the \"Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Italy and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\" of 20 March 1990 (the \"BIT\"), which entered into force on 20 September 1994 (Exh. C-1).\n\n41.\n\nSpecifically, Saipem relies upon Article 5 of the BIT, pursuant to which investments under the Treaty may not be subject to expropriation or measures equivalent to expropriation without immediate, full, and effective compensation.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**1.** Initial phase\n--------------------\n\n42.\n\nOn 5 October 2004, Saipem filed a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\" or \"RA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"), accompanied by 17 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to 17). In its Request, Saipem invoked the provisions of the BIT and sought the following relief:\n\n6. *1 Claim for Declaratory Decisions*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal declare that:\n\nBangladesh has expropriated Claimant of its investment without paying compensation;\n\nBangladesh has breached its international obligations under the BIT.\n\n*6.2 Monetary Claims*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal award it complete compensation for all the damages and losses it suffered as a result of Bangladesh's breaches of its obligations.\n\nAs the Claimant will substantiate at the proper stage of the proceedings, the loss suffered by the Claimant amounts to at least US$ 12,500,000.00, plus interest at the proper rate.\n\nThe Claimant also requests that the Arbitral Tribunal order Bangladesh to return or extinguish the Warranty Bond.\n\n*6.3 Interim Relief*\n\nIn light of Bangladesh's bad faith attempts to draw upon the Warranty Bond, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue a provisional order pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention ordering Respondent to refrain from pursuing -and to prevent Petrobangla from pursuing - any payment demand based on this Bond until the outcome of the present arbitration.\n\n*6.4 The Costs of the Present Arbitration*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal order Respondent to reimburse Claimant for all the costs incurred and to be incurred by it in connection with the present arbitration, including legal fees.\n\n(RA, pp. 27-28, paras. 121-126, footnote omitted)\n\n43.\n\nOn 12 October 2004, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), transmitted a copy of the RA to Bangladesh.\n\n44.\n\nAfter a protracted exchange of correspondence (during which the Claimant filed additional exhibits to the Request - Exh. C-18 to 21) between the parties and the Centre, on 27 April 2005, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Saipem\u2019s Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n45.\n\nThe parties agreed on a Tribunal composed of three arbitrators with one arbitrator each to be appointed by the parties and the presiding arbitrator to be jointly nominated by the two party-appointed arbitrators. On 27 June 2005, Saipem appointed Prof. Christoph Schreuer, a national of Austria. On 4 July 2005, Bangladesh appointed Sir Philip Otton, a national of the United Kingdom. On 21 July 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties that the co-arbitrators had agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n46.\n\nOn 22 August 2005, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. The same letter informed the parties that Mrs. Eloise M. Obadia, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal. Mrs. Obadia was subsequently replaced as the Secretary of the Tribunal by Mrs. Martina Polasek, ICSID Counsel.\n\n47.\n\nBy decision of 11 October 2005, Sir Philip Otton and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler dismissed Bangladesh\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Prof. Christoph Schreuer concluding that the latter met the requirement of independence and impartiality, or, in the words of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, that he had the ability to \"exercise independent judgement\".\n\n48.\n\nOn 1 December 2005, the Tribunal held a preliminary session in London. At the outset of the session, the parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections in this respect. The remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda of the session were discussed and agreed upon, including a procedural calendar. An audio recording of the session was later distributed to the parties. Minutes were drafted, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and sent to the parties on 13 January 2006.\n\n**2.** The written phase on jurisdiction\n----------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable agreed upon during the preliminary session, on 20 February 2006, Saipem submitted its Statement of Claim (Mem.) accompanied by two volumes of exhibits (Exh. C-21 to Exh. C-84). Saipem did not append any witness statement or expert opinion.\n\n50.\n\nFollowing a short extension, on 14 May 2006, Bangladesh submitted its Counter-Memorial on the objections to jurisdiction and the merits (C-Mem.) accompanied by five volumes of exhibits (Exh. R-1 to R-113) and four witness statements (WS of Messrs. Mohammed Guamruzzaman, Abdul Monsur Md. Azad, Salahuddin Ahmad and Abdur Razzaq). Mr. Razzaq\u2019s WS introduced a legal opinion on issues of Bangladeshi law, which was accompanied by ten annexes.\n\n51.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable agreed upon during the preliminary session, on 14 July 2006, Saipem submitted its Response on Objections to Jurisdiction (Response J.) accompanied by one volume of exhibits (Exhibits C-85 to C-99). Saipem did not append any witness statement or expert opinion.\n\n52.\n\nOn July 26, 2006, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with counsel for the parties to deal with the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n53.\n\nIn line with the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, on 18 August 2006, Bangladesh submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction (Reply J.)6.\n\nIn the cover letter, Bangladesh announced that a Supplemental WS by Mr. Razzaq would be filed \"over the week-end\"\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 September 2006, within the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, Saipem submitted its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction (Rejoinder J.) accompanied by one volume of exhibits (Exhibits C-100 to C-101), without witness statements or expert opinions.\n\n**3.** The\u00a0hearing on jurisdiction\n----------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on jurisdiction from 21 to 22 September 2006 in London. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following persons attended the jurisdictional hearing:\n\n(i) On behalf of Saipem:\n\n\u2022 Prof. Antonio Crivellaro, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo\n\n\u2022 Prof. Luca Radicati di Brozolo, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo\n\n\u2022 Mr. Andrea Carta Mantiglia, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo\n\n\u2022 Mr. Alexander Backovic, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francesco del Giudice, Saipem\n\n(ii) On behalf of Bangladesh:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, QC, A Hossain & Associates Law Offices\n\n\u2022 Mr. Sameer Sattar, A Hossain & Associates Law Offices\n\n\u2022 Mr. Sayed Afzal Hossain, A Hossain & Associates Law Offices\n\n\u2022 Mr. Sayed Ahrarul Hossain, A Hossain & Associates Law Offices\n\n56.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional hearing, the Tribunal heard witness evidence from Messrs. Abdul Monsour Azad, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdul Razzaq and Mohammed Quamruzzaman.\n\n57.\n\nMr. Hossain presented oral argument on behalf of Bangladesh and Messrs. Crivellaro, Radicati di Brozolo and Carta Mantiglia addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Saipem.\n\n58.\n\nThe jurisdictional hearing was tape-recorded, a *verbatim* transcript was taken and delivered to the parties (Tr. J. J.).\n\n59.\n\nIt was agreed at the close of the jurisdictional hearing that the Tribunal would issue a reasoned decision on the preliminary question of jurisdiction. If the decision were negative, the Tribunal would render an award terminating the arbitration. If the decision were affirmative, the Tribunal would render a decision asserting jurisdiction and issue an order with directions for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and thoroughly considered the parties\u2019 written submissions on jurisdiction and the oral arguments presented in the course of the jurisdictional hearing. In the following sections, it will first summarize the parties\u2019 positions (III), analyze them (IV), and then reach a conclusion on jurisdiction (V).\n\n**III. PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n**1.** Saipem\u2019s position\n------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Saipem has put forward the following five main contentions:\n\n(i) Petrobangla has resorted to the local courts which colluded with the State entity to sabotage the ICC Arbitration and deny the foreign investor\u2019s right to arbitrate under the Contract and obtain satisfaction of its claims;\n\n(ii) By referring to the ICC Arbitration Rules, the parties validly excluded the authority of the courts of the seat of the arbitration;\n\n(iii) The Contract constitutes an investment under the BIT;\n\n(iv) Immaterial rights can be subject to expropriation;\n\n(v) Saipem\u2019s right to arbitrate and more specifically its right that disputes with Petrobangla be settled by arbitration is a contractual right or, in the words of Article 1(e) of the BIT, a \"right accruing by law or by contract\" having an economic value;\n\n(vi) The actions of Petrobangla and of the courts of Bangladesh can be attributed to the Republic of Bangladesh.\n\n62.\n\nOn the basis of these contentions, Saipem requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) find that the conditions for its jurisdiction in the present case are satisfied and accordingly reject the Respondent's objections and declare itself to have jurisdiction in respect of the Claimant's claim; and\n\n(ii) issue a provisional measure recommending that Bangladesh refrain from calling on the Warranty Bond and return it to the Claimant together with the Retention Money without further delay.\n\n(Rejoinder, p. 28, para. 107)\n\n**2.** Bangladesh\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Bangladesh has raised the following five main arguments:\n\n(i) Saipem did not make an investment within the meaning of the BIT;\n\n(ii) Since the seat of the ICC Arbitration was Dhaka, the courts of Bangladesh had jurisdiction to revoke the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n(iii) In Art. 5(1)(1) of the BIT, Bangladesh has expressly excluded consent in respect of \"judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction\";\n\n(iv) Saipem elected not to lodge an appeal to a higher court. It has thus deprived Bangladesh of the opportunity to rectify the alleged wrongdoings of its lower courts in connection with the ICC Arbitration;\n\n(v) By agreeing on ICC Arbitration in Dakha, Saipem accepted any potential failure to enforce an ICC award in its favour in Bangladesh as a calculated business risk.\n\n64.\n\nIn reliance on these arguments, Bangladesh invites the Tribunal to:\n\nMake findings [...] that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear this case.\n\nIf the Tribunal does not wish to go into the evidence on jurisdictional facts at this stage, it should still decline jurisdiction on the basis that the Claimant has not discharged its prima facie burden of proof.\n\nDismiss the claim in its entirety and [...] make a declaration to that effect and make an award of costs in favour of the Respondent on a full indemnity basis.\n\n(Reply J., pp. 19-20)\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**1.** Introductory matters\n---------------------------\n\n65.\n\nBefore turning to the issues to be resolved, the Tribunal wishes to address certain preliminary matters, *i.e.,* the relevance of prior ICSID decisions (a), the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (b), and certain uncontroversial matters (c).\n\n**1.1 The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nIn support of their positions, both parties relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions7. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law8.\n\n*See e.g.,* *AES Corporation v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on jurisdiction of 13 July 2005, paras. 30-32; available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/ decisions/AES-Argentina\\_Jurisdiction.pdf.\n\nOn the precedential value of ICSID decisions, *see* Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse?, Freshfields lecture 2006, publication forthcoming in Arbitration International 2007.\n\n**1.2 The rules governing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the BIT and of the ICSID Convention. The law applicable to the merits of the dispute does not govern jurisdiction.\n\n69.\n\nThe relevant provision of the ICSID Convention is Article 25(1), which reads as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n70.\n\nThe relevant provision of the BIT is Article 9, which provides for ICSID arbitration in the following terms:\n\n1. Any disputes arising between a Contracting Party and the investors of the other, relating to compensation for expropriation, nationalization, requisition or similar measures including disputes relating to the amount of the relevant payments shall be settled amicably, as far as possible.\n\n2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of a written application, the investor in question may submit the dispute, at his discretion for settlement to: [...]\n\nc) the \"International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes\", for the application of the arbitration procedures provided by the Washington Convention of 18th March 1965 on the \"Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States\", whenever, or as soon as both Contracting Parties have validly acceded to it.\n\n**1.3 Uncontroversial matters**\n-------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThere is no dispute as to the competence of this Tribunal to decide on the jurisdictional challenges brought by Bangladesh pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n72.\n\nIt is further undisputed that four conditions must be met for the Tribunal to uphold jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, *i.e.,* (i) the dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) the dispute must be a legal dispute (iii) it must arise directly from an investment, and (iv) the parties must have expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration in writing.\n\n73.\n\nWith respect to the first requirement just referred to, the Tribunal notes that, at the hearing, Bangladesh has abandoned its jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* pursuant to which Saipem was not a private investor (Tr. J. II 31:12-13). The Tribunal further notes that the parties to the dispute are a State (Bangladesh) and an Italian company (Saipem), and that both Bangladesh and Italy are Contracting States within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. It thus deems the first requirement met.\n\n74.\n\nWith respect to the fourth requirement, Saipem relies upon (i) the consent of Bangladesh to arbitration contained in the BIT combined with (ii) its own consent embodied in the Request. According to a now \"well established practice, it is clear that the coincidence of these two forms of consent can constitute \u2018consent in writing\u2019 within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention [...] if the dispute falls within the scope of the BIT.\"9 This is not disputed by Bangladesh.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 April 2005, para. 108; available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/ impregilo-decision.pdf.\n\n75.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s objections concern the scope of its consent under the BIT as well as the second and the third requirements referred to above.\n\n**1.4 Bangladesh\u2019s objections**\n-------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nBangladesh has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or to the admissibility of Saipem\u2019s claim upon the following main grounds:\n\n(i) There is no real legal dispute between the parties (Tr. J. II 23:9-20).\n\n(ii) Saipem has not made an investment within Article 1 (1) of the BIT.\n\n(iii) Bangladesh\u2019s consent to arbitration does not cover disputes arising out of the acts of its courts pursuant to Article 5(1) of the BIT (Reply J., p. 15, paras. 3.14-3.16).\n\n(iv) The alleged breaches of the Treaty \"have not crossed the necessary threshold for establishing that the actions were that of the state of Bangladesh in the exercise of its sovereign authority\" (Reply J., p. 16, at para. 31.8).\n\n(v) Saipem\u2019s claim constitutes an abuse of process (C-Mem para. 4.40 *et seq.;* Tr. J. II 34:9 *et seq.).*\n\nWhile recognising that there may be an overlap between some of the objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and some of the objections to the admissibility of the claims10, the Tribunal will distinguish between jurisdictional objections under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (see below 4), jurisdictional objections under the BIT (see below 5), and objections to the admissibility of Saipem\u2019s claims (see below 6). As preliminary matters, the Tribunal will discuss the law applicable to its jurisdiction (see below 2) and the relevant standard for establishing jurisdiction (see below 3).\n\n*See* also *Consortium Groupement L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v. R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne D\u00e9mocratique et Populaire,* Award of 10 January 2005, p. 12 at para. 2, where the Tribunal stresses that the distinction has no practical bearing in ICSID proceedings; available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/lesi-sentence-fr.pdf.\n\n**2.** Law applicable to jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nIt is not challenged that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and of the BIT is governed by international law (Reply J., p. 12, para. 3.2).\n\n79.\n\nAt the hearing, Bangladesh withdrew the argument that the words \"in conformity with the laws and regulations of the latter\" at the end of the first paragraph of Article 1(1) of the BIT, impose the application of national law. Bangladesh accepts that the words relate to the mode, not to the definition of the investment (Tr. J. II 20:1-2)11.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal wishes to note that the phrase \"in conformity with the laws and regulations [of the host State]\" following the \"investment\" in Article 1(1) does not limit the definition of investment under the BIT to investment within the laws and regulations of Bangladesh. Indeed, as convincingly held by the tribunal in *Salini v. Morocco,* such a \"provision [/.e., the requirement of conformity with local laws] refers to the validity of the investment and not to its definition\" *(Salini. v. Morocco, [supra* Fn. 22] para. 46. *See* also *PSEG* et al. v. *Turkey,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 June 2004, paras. 109, 116-120, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/PSEG-Turkey-Jurisdiction-4Jun2004.pdf; *L.E.S.I. -Dipenta v. Algeria [supra* Fn. 10]; *Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, 44 ILM 721 (2005) paras. 126-131; *Bayindirv. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, paras. 105-110, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Bayindir-Pakistan-Jurisdiction.pdf.\n\n80.\n\nThe parties are, however, in disagreement on the question whether the BIT refers to Bangladeshi law \"in respect of the definition and construction of the word \u2018investment\u2019\" (Reply J., p. 12, paras. 3.2 and 3.4).\n\n81.\n\nAccording to Bangladesh, the fact that the BIT\u2019S definition of investment uses the word \u2018property\u2019 and not \u2018assets\u2019 as in other bilateral investment treaties implies a reference to Bangladeshi law. In support of this assertion, Bangladesh submits that the word \u2018property\u2019 was chosen because it is a notion well known in Bangladesh (Reply J., pp. 13-14, para. 3.8), thus suggesting that the word \u2018property\u2019 must be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning in Bangladeshi law. That meaning is allegedly \"more specific and narrower than the word \u2018assets\u2019\" (Reply J., p. 14, para. 3.9).\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Bangladesh has indeed entered into other bilateral investment treaties in which the definition of \u2018investment\u2019 refers to the concept of \u2018asset\u201912. However, in the absence of any indication that the contracting states intended to refer to \u2018property\u2019 as a notion of Bangladeshi law13, the Tribunal cannot depart from the general rule that treaties are to be interpreted by reference to international law. It is thus not prepared to consider that the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT is defined according to the law of the host State.\n\n*See,* in particular, the Bangladesh-UK BIT, the Bangladesh-Japan BIT, and the Belgo-Luxemburg-Bangladesh BIT mentioned in Mr. Razzaq\u2019s supplemental WS.\n\n*See,* in a different context, the clear intent of the parties resulting from *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* in *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of 2 August 2006, paras.190 *et seq.,* available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/ lnceysaVallisoletana-EISalvador-Award.pdf.\n\n**3.** Test for establishing jurisdiction\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**3.1 The onus of establishing jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nIn accordance with accepted International practice (and generally also with national practice), a party bears the burden of proving the facts it asserts. For instance, an ICSID tribunal held that the Claimant had to satisfy the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase and make a *prima facie* showing of Treaty breaches14.\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra* Fn. 9], para. 79. On the *prima facie* test for purposes of jurisdiction, *see* among others *UPS v. Canada,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002, paras. 33-37; *Siemens v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, para. 180, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Siemens-Argentina-Jurisdiction-3Aug2004-Eng.pdf; *Plama* v. *Bulgaria* [Fn. 11], paras. 118-120, 132; *Bayindir v. Pakistan* [Fn. 11] paras. 185-200; *El Paso v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, paras. 40-45, 109, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/EI\\_Paso\\_Energy-Argentina-Jurisdictional\\_Decision.pdf; *Jan de Nul v. Egypt,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006, paras. 69-71, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Jan\\_de\\_Nul-Egypt-Jurisdictional\\_Award.pdf; *Telenor v.

Pakistan [supra* Fn. 9], para. 254, emphasis in the original.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this test, which is in line with the one proposed by Judge Higgins in her dissenting opinion in *Oil Platforms16.* The test strikes a fair balance between a more demanding standard which would imply examining the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a lighter standard which would rest entirely on the Claimant\u2019s characterization of its claims.\n\n*Case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* I.C.J. Reports 1996, II, p. 803, 810, at paras. 16-17.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine whether the claims \"fall within the scope of the BIT, assuming *pro tem* that they may be sustained on the facts\"17. In other words, the Tribunal should be satisfied that, if the facts alleged by Saipem ultimately prove true, they would be capable of constituting a violation of Article 5 of the BIT. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the observation in *United Parcel Service v. Government of Canada* that \"the reference to the facts alleged being \u2018capable\u2019 of constituting a violation of the invoked obligations, as opposed to their \u2018falling within\u2019 the provisions, may be of little or no consequence.18\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan*\u00a0[*supra* Fn. 9], para. 263.\n\n*United Parcel Service v. Government of Canada* [NAFTA], Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 November 200, para. 36; available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/UPS-Canada-Jurisdiction-22Nov2002.pdf.\n\n87.\n\nAt the hearing, Bangladesh agreed with this approach:\n\nIf we look at paragraph 16 of the rejoinder, it is stated that it is unanimously recognised that in the jurisdictional phase issues of merits are relevant only insofar as they are necessary to enable the court or the tribunal to ascertain whether the claims brought before it fall within its personal subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n[...] With respect, we agree. We submit that that is the way that you should approach your task.\n\n(Tr. J. II, 7:18-25)\n\n88.\n\nIn spite of this statement, Bangladesh submitted that Saipem\u2019s case is not supported by appropriate evidence nor is it sufficiently defined. Specifically, Bangladesh alleges that Saipem must establish the following elements: (i) the existence of an investment, (ii) the occurrence of an act of expropriation, and (iii) the threshold for treaty claims (Rejoinder J., p. 11). Bangladesh referred to a definition of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) and to another one of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and submitted that the facts relevant to assert jurisdiction must be proven.\n\n89.\n\nIn particular, Bangladesh referred to the PCIJ decision in *Mavromatis'19*. It also relied on the following passages of the ICJ decision between Spain and Canada in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case'.*\n\nThere is no doubt that it is for the Applicant, in its Application, to present to the Court the dispute with which it wishes to seise the Court and to set out the claims which it is submitting to it. [...]\n\nIn order to identify its task in any proceedings instituted by one State against another, the Court must begin by examining the Application. However, it may happen that uncertainties or disagreements arise with regard to the real subject of the dispute with which the Court has been seised, or to the exact nature of the claims submitted to it. In such cases the Court cannot be restricted to a consideration of the terms of the Application alone nor, more generally, can it regard itself as bound by the claims of the Applicant.\n\nEven in proceedings instituted by Special Agreement, the Court has determined for itself, having examined all of the relevant instruments, what was the subject of the dispute brought before it, in circumstances where the parties could not agree on how it should be characterized [...].\n\nIt is for the Court itself, while giving particular attention to the formulation of the dispute chosen by the Applicant, to determine on an objective basis the dispute dividing the parties, by examining the position of both Parties [...]\n\nThe Court's jurisprudence shows that the Court will not confine itself to the formulation by the Applicant when determining the subject of the dispute.\n\nThe Court will itself determine the real dispute that has been submitted to it [...]. It will base itself not only on the Application and final submissions, but on diplomatic exchanges, public statements and other pertinent evidence [...].\n\nIn so doing, the Court will distinguish between the dispute itself and arguments used by the parties to sustain their respective submissions on the dispute [...].\n\nThe Court points out that the establishment or otherwise of jurisdiction is not a matter for the parties but for the Court itself. Although a party seeking to assert a fact must bear the burden of proving it, this has no relevance for the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction, which is a \"question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant facts\".\n\nThat being so, there is no burden of proof to be discharged in the matter of jurisdiction. Rather, it is for the Court to determine from all the facts and taking into account all the arguments advanced by the Parties, \"whether the force of the arguments militating in favour of jurisdiction is preponderant, and to 'ascertain whether an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer jurisdiction upon it\"20.\n\nJudgment No. 2 of the PCIJ *The Mavromatis Palestine Concessions,* 30 August 1924, Fifth (Ordinary) Session, Publications of the Permanent Court of International Justice Series A No. 2; Collection of Judgments, A.W. Sijthoff\u2019s Publishing Company, Leyden, pp. 12-16; also available at http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/cdecisions/ccpij/serie\\_A/A\\_02/06\\_Mavrommatis\\_en\\_Palestine\\_Arret.pdf. After having carefully considered this decision, the Tribunal was unable to discern the relevance of this decision in the present case.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, Judgment of 4 December 1998, *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v. Canada),* available at http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iec/iecjudgment(s)/iec\\_ijudgment\\_ 981204.htm, paras. 29-32 and 37-38, citations omitted.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal fails to see how these decisions could be interpreted as justifying a different approach than the one referred to above and described by the tribunal in *Impregilo.* That said, it is undisputable that the Tribunal determines its jurisdiction without being bound by the arguments of the parties.\n\n91.\n\nTo summarize, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to determine the meaning and scope of the provisions upon which Saipem relies to assert jurisdiction and to assess whether the facts alleged by Saipem fall within those provisions or would be capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the treaty obligations involved. In performing this task, the Tribunal will apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions. In doing so, the Tribunal will assess whether Saipem\u2019s case is reasonably arguable on its face. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.\n\n**4.** Jurisdictional objections under Article **25(1)** of the **ICSID** Convention\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nWith respect to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, Bangladesh objected that there is no legal dispute (a), that Saipem did not make an investment (b) and that the dispute does not arise directly out of the investment (c).\n\n**4.1 Is the dispute a legal dispute under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nAt the hearing, Bangladesh submitted that the existence of a legal dispute within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention presupposes the \"existence of a cause of action\" (Tr. J. II, 15-17). In the present case, according to Bangladesh, \"there is no valid cause of action because the ingredients of such a cause of action are not supported by any or any proper evidence [and] are not sufficiently clearly defined in the formulation of the claim\" (Tr. J. II 22:10-13).\n\n94.\n\nSpecifically, Bangladesh referred to the articulation of Saipem\u2019s claim in para. 13 of the Reply J. as repeated in para. 28 of the Rejoinder J., which reads as follows:\n\nAs is clearly set out in the Statement of Claim, the Claimant\u2019s claim relates to the expropriation by Bangladesh of (i) its right to arbitration of its disputes with Petrobangla; (ii) the right to payment of the amounts due under the Contract as ascertained in the ICC Award; (iii) the rights arising under the ICC Award, including the right to obtain its recognition and enforcement in Bangladesh and abroad; and therefore (iv) the residual value of its investment in Bangladesh at the time of the ICC Award, consisting of its credits under the Contract. All these matters are facets of the same issue.\n\nThe focus of the Claimant\u2019s case is that its right to payment under the Contract as ascertained by, and incorporated in the ICC Award has been expropriated by the unlawful decisions of the Bangladeshi courts that revoked the authority of the ICC arbitrators and declared the ICC Award null and void, thus precluding its enforcement in Bangladesh or elsewhere. The net result of all this was, obviously, to deprive the Claimant of the compensation for [the expropriation of] its investment.\n\n(Rejoinder J., p. 8)\n\n95.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the dispute before it is a legal dispute as it involves a disagreement about legal rights or obligations. Or, to use the words of the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank on the Convention, the present dispute is legal in nature because it deals with \"the existence or scope of [Claimants\u2019] legal rights\" and with the nature and extent of the relief to be granted to the Claimants as a result of the Respondent's alleged violation of those legal rights21.\n\n*See* Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 18 March 1965, para. 26; available at http://www.worldbank.Org/icsid/basicdoc/partB-section05.htm#03.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal fails to see how the alleged lack of clarity of Saipem\u2019s claim could change that conclusion. It will examine whether the claim is supported by evidence when discussing the substantiation of the claim (see below at 5).\n\n97.\n\nThe determination whether the rights asserted by Saipem do exist must await the proceedings on the merits. Subject to determining whether Saipem made an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which will be discussed below, the Tribunal holds that the assertion of such rights has given rise to a legal dispute which falls within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Centre as set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4.2 Has Saipem made an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nIn its relevant part, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\n99.\n\nTo determine whether Saipem has made an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal will apply the well-known criteria developed by ICSID tribunals in similar cases, which are known as the \"Salini test\". According to such test, the notion of investment implies the presence of the following elements: (a) a contribution of money or other assets of economic value, (b) a certain duration, (c) an element of risk, and (d) a contribution to the host State\u2019s development22.\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of 23 July 2001.42 ILM, 2003, *passim.* The need for the last element is sometimes put in doubt, *(L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v. R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne D\u00e9mocratique et Populaire,* Decision on jurisdiction of 12 July 2006, para. 72.)\n\n100.\n\nReferring to several decisions implementing this test23, Saipem submitted that the Contract was an investment, since \"Saipem invested substantial technical, financial and human resources in the project, which gave a substantial contribution to Bangladesh's economic development, and it assumed risks for a significant duration (the performance phase lasted two and a half years)\" (Response J., p. 8, para. 35).\n\n*L.E.S.I. - Dipenta v. Algeria* [Fn. 10], paras. 13-15 ; *Impregilo v. Pakistan* [Fn. 9]; *Bayindir v. Pakistan* [Fn. 11] paras. 104-138, *Jan de NulN.V. v. Egypt [Fn.* 14],\n\n101.\n\nBangladesh does not dispute the fact that Saipem made a significant contribution in terms of both technical and human resources. Nor does Bangladesh dispute that these resources contributed to its economic development. Bangladesh\u2019s objection relates to the duration of the project. While it agrees that two years are generally considered as a sufficient period of time under the Salini test, Bangladesh insists on the fact that the period during which works were actually performed was less than one year (Tr. J. II 84:10 *et seq.).*\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow this line of argument. Bangladesh did not put forward any particular reason why the actual duration of the work should be considered as the applicable criterion, nor did it point to any authority supporting that position. The time of the project during which the works are interrupted or suspended entails risks that may even be higher than those incurred while the works are being performed.\n\n103.\n\nAs a further line of argument, Bangladesh mainly disputed the existence of an investment on the ground that throughout the project Saipem never \"was a net creditor vis-\u00e0-vis Petrobangla in respect of the Pipeline Contract having actually put its own money into the project\" (C-Mem., p. 61). At the hearing, Bangladesh relied upon the following *dictum* of the Tribunal in *Soabi v. Senegal24.*\n\nThe Tribunal observes finally that the object of the general undertaking was limited to construction of a building to be paid for by the client as work progressed and could thus not be said to be an agreement concerning investments. Disputes arising thereunder could therefore not be investment disputes, as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(quoted in Tr. J. II 83:18-22 by reference to Bishop/Crawford/Reisman, p. 368)\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v. Senegal,* ICSID Case No. ARB82/1, Award of 25 February 1988, 2 ICSID Reports 190 at para. 219.\n\n104.\n\nSaipem refuted this objection with the argument that \"[i]n construction and similar contracts it is often the case that the foreign investor receives a part of the funds - by way of advances or partial payments - from the host State prior to completion of the project\" and that this fact \"has never been given any relevance in past case law which has characterized this type of contract as an investment\". More generally, Saipem submits that \"[t]he source of the funds whereby the investor funded the works is not of itself relevant\" to the Salini test for determining whether there is an investment (see also Tr. J. II 59:2-7).\n\n105.\n\nIn this debate, the Tribunal identifies two distinct issues, one about the origin of the funds and one about the commercial risk incurred by the investor.\n\n106.\n\nWith respect to the first one, it is true that the host State may impose a requirement that an amount of capital in foreign currency be imported into the country25. However, in the absence of such a requirement, investments made by foreign investors from local funds or from loans raised in the host State are treated in the same manner as investments funded with imported capital. In other words, the origin of the funds is irrelevant. This results from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention and is confirmed by several arbitral decisions relating to BITs.\n\nSee *Amco* v. *Indonesia,* Award, 20 November 1984, 1 ICSID Reports 413, paras. 481-489.\n\n107.\n\nDuring the elaboration of the Convention, an argument was made that the nationality of the investment was more important than the one of the investor. The Chairman, Dr. Broches, answered that he did not see how the Convention could make a distinction based on the origin of funds (History of the Convention, Vol. II, pp. 261, paras. 397-398). As a consequence, the idea of looking to the origin of funds was abandoned.\n\n108.\n\nCases do not consider the origin of the funds either. As an illustration in lieu of several others26 one may refer to *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* where both the Tribunal and the *ad hoc* Committee found the alleged origin of the funds from other investors who were not entitled to benefit from the applicable BIT irrelevant27.\n\n*See* *Tradex v. Albania,* Award, 29 April 1999, 5 ICSID Reports 70, at paras. 105, 108-111; *Olguin* v. *Paraguay,* Award, 26 July 2001, 6 ICSID Reports 164, at para. 66, Fn. 9. *See* also *Tokios Tokeles* v. *Ukraine,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, at para. 80, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Tokios-Ukraine-Jurisdiction-29Apr2004.pdf.\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* Award, 8 December 2000, 41 ILM 896 (2002) at para. 126, Decision on Annulment, 28 January 2002, 41 ILM 933 (2002) at para. 54.\n\n109.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s argument appears to refer more to the second issue identified above, *i.e.,* to the fact that the investor did not incur any commercial risk because it received an advance payment. The Tribunal cannot agree with this argument. In the present case, the undisputed stopping of the works which took place in 1991 and the necessity to renegotiate the completion date constitute examples of inherent risks in long-term contracts. Moreover, the contractual mechanism providing for Retention Money created an obvious risk for Saipem, which in fact materialised.\n\n110.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that for the purpose of determining whether there is an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it will consider the entire operation28. In the present case, the entire or overall operation includes the Contract, the construction itself, the Retention Money, the warranty and the related ICC Arbitration.\n\n*See,* from the very beginning of ICSID practice, *Holiday Inns v. Morocco,* Decision of jurisdiction of 12 May 1974, reported in Pierre Lalive, The First World Bank Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco) - Some Legal Problems, British Yearbook of International Law 1980, p. 159.\n\n111.\n\nApplying the Salini test to this comprehensive operation, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Saipem has made an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4.3 Does the dispute arise directly out of the investment?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nBangladesh claims that a dispute arising out of the ICC Award is not a dispute arising directly from the original investment, *i.e.,* from the Contract (Tr. J. II 28:21-29:2):\n\nany rights arising out of the contractual dispute [...] would not survive an award. So, if the award is a valid award, those rights would be replaced by rights arising out of the award itself.\n\n113.\n\nThis argument refers to the requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention that the dispute \"aris[e] directly out of an investment\". The Tribunal agrees with Bangladesh that the rights arising out of the ICC Award arise only *indirectly* from the investment. Indeed, the opposite view would mean that the Award itself does constitute an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which the Tribunal is not prepared to accept.\n\n114.\n\nHowever, as already mentioned, the notion of investment pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID must be understood as covering all the elements of the operation, that is not only the ICC Arbitration, but also *inter alia* the Contract, the construction itself and the Retention Money (see above No. 110). Hence, in accordance with previous case law29, the Tribunal holds that the present dispute arises directly out of the overall investment.\n\n*See,* for instance, *CSOB v. The Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999, ICSID Review 1999, p. 275.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes Bangladesh\u2019s point \"that Article 26 of the Washington Convention does not allow that these proceedings be run [...] accepting] the findings from the ICC Tribunal and us[ing] that for [this Tribunal\u2019s] findings\" (Tr. II, 82:15-18). To the extent that this may be interpreted as a jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal stresses that it is not requested to \"accept and use\" the ICC Tribunal\u2019s findings. It is requested to review whether the ICC Award was frustrated contrary to the protection provided in the BIT.\n\n**5.** Jurisdictional objections under the **BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIt is undisputed that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the BIT is limited to the scope of the dispute resolution clause contained in Article 9 of the BIT. Under the heading \"Settlement of Disputes between Investors and the Contracting Parties\", this provision states:\n\n1. Any disputes arising between a Contracting Party and the investors of the other, relating to compensation for expropriation, nationalization, requisition or similar measures, including disputes relating to the amount of the relevant payments shall be settled amicably, as far as possible.\n\n2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of a written application. The investor in question may submit the dispute, at his discretion, for settlement to:\n\na) the Contracting Party\u2019s Court, at all instances, having territorial jurisdiction;\n\nb) an ad hoc Arbitration Tribunal, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the \"UN Commission on International Trade Law\" (UNCITRAL),\n\nc) the \"International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes\" for the application of the arbitration procedure provided by the Washington Convention of 18th March 1965 on the \"Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States\", whenever, or as soon as both Contracting Parties have validly acceded to it.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n117.\n\nThis provision implicitly refers to Article 5 of the BIT, which speaks of expropriation of \"investments\". Under the heading \"Nationalization or Expropriation\", this provision reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n1. (1) The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment, save where specifically provided by law and by judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be directly or indirectly nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having similar effects in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes, or national interest, against immediate full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.\n\n118.\n\nIn turn, investments are defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT as follows:\n\n[1.] The term \"investment\" shall be construed to mean any kind of property invested before or after the entry into force of this Agreement by a natural or legal person being a national of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other in conformity with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term \"investment\" comprises:\n\na) movable and immovable property, and any other rights in rem including, insofar as they may be used for investment purposes, real guarantees on other property;\n\nb) shares, debentures, equity holdings and any other negotiable instrument or document of credit, as well as Government and public securities in general;\n\nc) credit for sums of money or any right for pledges or services having an economic value connected with investments, as well as reinvested income as defined in paragraph 5 hereafter; [...]\n\ne) any right of a financial nature accruing by law or by contract and any licence, concession or franchise issued in accordance with current provisions governing the exercise of business activities, including prospecting for, cultivating, extracting and exploiting natural resources.\n\n**5.1 Has Saipem made an investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is conditioned upon Saipem having made an investment within the meaning of the BIT (RA, p. 27, para. 118).\n\n120.\n\nAs already mentioned, the Tribunal is not prepared to consider that the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT is defined according to the law of the host State (see above IV, B). Accordingly, the question is whether Saipem made an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT, without reference to the law of Bangladesh.\n\n***5.1.1 The general definition of investment in Article 1(1) of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT gives a general definition of investment as \"any kind of property\". On its face, this general definition is very broad30.\n\nThe terms \"any kind of property\" correspond to \"every kind of asset\", which is generally acknowledged as *\"[p]ossibly the broadest [...] general definition\"* contained in a BIT(see Noah Rubins, International Investment, Political Risk and Dispute Resolution, 2005, p. 291)\n\n122.\n\nIn the light of the conclusion reached above according to which Saipem made an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal fails to see how the operation at issue could not be considered as a \"kind of property\" protected by the BIT.\n\n123.\n\nAt the hearing, Bangladesh modified its argumentation on the law governing the term \u2018property\u2019 which was referred to earlier (see above No. 81) as follows:\n\nWe do not say directly that Bangladesh law must apply to determine the meaning, we do not say that; but we say you get some help from the fact that this [i.e. \"property\"] is a concept well known in Bangladesh and it is probably the reason why this has happened.\n\n(Tr. J. II 18-22-25)31\n\nIn its last written submission, Bangladesh already put forward a similar argument: \"the types of property said to be included in the list must be considered in the light of the word \u2018property\u2019 itself\u2019 and of its alleged narrow meaning under Bangladeshi law (Reply J., p. 14, para. 3.10).\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by this amended argument either. To discard it, it suffices to imagine that the term \u2018property\u2019 (or its translation in Italian) could have a specific meaning under Italian law. If one were to follow Bangladesh\u2019s approach, this would lead to a different interpretation and thus a different scope of protection under the BIT depending on the country in which the investment is made. This cannot be the meaning of the BIT.\n\n***5.1.2 A \"credit for sums of money\" within Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIt Is Saipem\u2019s primary case that the Contract Is an Investment as defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT and that \"the rights accruing from the ICC Award fall squarely within the notion of \u2018credit for sums of money [...] connected with investments\u2019 set out in Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT\" (Response J., p. 10, para. 46).\n\n126.\n\nBangladesh objects that \"[t]hese words would normally include bank deposits or book debts on a running account\" (Rejoinder J., p. 14, para. 3.11). This may well be so. However, in their ordinary meaning, the words \u2018credit for sums of money\u2019 also cover rights under an award ordering a party to pay an amount of money: the prevailing party undoubtedly has a credit for a sum of money in the amount of the award.\n\n127.\n\nThis said, the rights embodied in the ICC Award were not created by the Award, but arise out of the Contract. The ICC Award crystallized the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the original contract. It can thus be left open whether the Award itself qualifies as an investment, since the contract rights which are crystallized by the Award constitute an investment within Article 1 (1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n128.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to make a final ruling on Saipem\u2019s additional argument that the arbitration agreement contained in the Contract constitutes a \"right of a financial nature accruing by law or by contract\" within Article 1(1)(e) of the BIT (Tr. J. II 58:20-23).\n\n**5.2 Are the facts alleged by Saipem capable of constituting an expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAccording to Saipem, its case is based on Petrobangla\u2019s alleged unlawful disruption of the ICC Arbitration, on the alleged interference by the domestic courts with the Arbitration, and on the *de facto* annulment of the ICC Award. These acts allegedly deprived Saipem of the sums awarded to it by the ICC Award, and thus amount to an illegal expropriation in breach of Article 5 of the BIT (Response J., p. 4, para. 15). At the hearing, Saipem further submitted that a State\u2019s disavowal of its undertaking to arbitrate a contractual dispute may have a \"confiscatory effect\" (Tr. J. II, 50:16-2332) and summarized its case as follows:\n\n[T]he claims which are brought before the tribunal are a claim for expropriation in violation of Article 5 of the BIT. It is an expropriation which has resulted from a complex behaviour of the whole state, which reneged on its obligations to enforce the arbitration award and to respect the proper conduct of the arbitration proceedings [...].\n\n(Tr. J. II 52:12-18)\n\nReferring to the developments in Saipem\u2019s letter to ICSID of 5 April 2005\n\n130.\n\nSalpem brings a claim for expropriation and the BIT provides for ICSID jurisdiction in case of expropriation. Bangladesh does not claim that the ICC Award and/or the rights determined by the Award are not capable of being expropriated. Rightly so, as it is widely accepted under general international law that immaterial rights can be the subject of expropriation33. Moreover, as the European Court of Human Rights unequivocally held, rights under judicial decisions are protected property that can be the object of an expropriation:\n\nIn order to determine whether the applicants had a \"possession\" for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Court must ascertain whether judgment no. 13910/79 of the Athens Court of First Instance and the arbitration award had given rise to a debt in their favour that was sufficiently established to be enforceable. [...] [T]he arbitration award, which clearly recognised the State's liability up to a maximum of specified amounts in three different currencies [...].\n\nAccording to its wording, the award was final and binding; it did not require any further enforcement measure and no ordinary or special appeal lay against it [...]. Under Greek legislation arbitration awards have the force of final decisions and are deemed to be enforceable. The grounds for appealing against them are exhaustively listed in Article 897 of the Code of Civil Procedure [...]; no provision is made for an appeal on the merits.\n\nAt the moment when Law no. 1701/1987 was passed the arbitration award of 27 February 1984 therefore conferred on the applicants a right in the sums awarded. Admittedly, that right was revocable, since the award could still be annulled, but the ordinary courts had by then already twice held - at first instance and on appeal - that there was no ground for such annulment.\n\nAccordingly, in the Court's view, that right constituted a \"possession\" within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1)34.\n\n*See* for instance *Phillips Petroleum Iran v. Islamic Republic of Iran et National Iranian Oil Company,* Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Case No. 39, Chamber Two, Award No. 425-39-2 of 29 June 1989, Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XVI (1991), pp. 298-321, para. 75.\n\n*Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece -* 13427/87 [1994] ECHR 48 (9 December 1994), paras. 59-62, cross-references omitted; also available at http://worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1994/48.html. *See* also *Brumarescu v. Romania* Source: Human Rights Case Digest, Volume 10, Numbers 10-12, 1999, pp. 237-241, also available at http://worldlii.Org/eu/cases/ECHR/1999/105.html.\n\n131.\n\nA further question relates not to the object, but to the subject or the author of the expropriation. Indeed, more often than not the expropriation results from an act of the executive power. By contrast, Saipem submitted at the hearing that the acts of a court, *i.e.* of the judiciary power, can effect an expropriation:\n\nIt is undeniable [...] that the interference by a State (including by the action of its courts) with an arbitration agreement with a foreign national constitutes a violation of international law. [...] [i]f such interference has the effect of confiscating the foreign national's investment as it does in the present case, it also constitutes an expropriation under the BIT and international law.\n\nThis is perfectly demonstrated in a very recent publication by Judge Schwebel dealing with the confiscatory effects of the interference by State courts with arbitration. Judge Schwebel makes it quite clear that \"[t]he contractual right of an alien to arbitration of disputes arising under a contract to which it is party is a valuable right, which often is of importance to the very conclusion of the contract.\" Therefore, any \" Iv]itiation of that right\" through court interference \"attracts the international responsibility of the State of which the issuing court is an organ\". Judge Schwebel refers to antisuit injunctions, but this statement clearly applies more broadly to all court interference, including that of the Bangladeshi courts in the present case, the effect of which is obviously identical. Such interference constitutes a \"ground of violation of customary international law\", and more specifically of\n\n\"the principle that a State is not entitled to take the property or contractual rights of an alien within its jurisdiction by actions that are arbitrary, tortious and confiscatory\" [Emphasis added],\n\n(Saipem\u2019s letter of 24 March 2005 submitted at the hearing, with the agreement of Bangladesh [Tr. J. II 88:8-13], as Exh. C-10235)\n\nReferring to S. M. Schwebel, Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Arbitration: An Overview, in Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Arbitration (E. Gaillard, editor), IAI (International Arbitration Institute) Series on International Arbitration, no. 2, Juris Publishing, 2004, p. 13.\n\n132.\n\nIrrespective of whether Judge Schwebel\u2019s opinion can be applied in the present context, the Tribunal considers that there is no reason why a judicial act could not result in an expropriation. Nothing in the BIT indicates such a limitation. Moreover, Bangladesh did not cite any decision supporting the opposite view. Quite to the contrary, the Tribunal notes that the European Court of Human Rights had no hesitation to hold that court decisions can amount to an expropriation36. Indeed, this is at least implicitly conceded by Bangladesh when it insists on the fact that consent to jurisdiction over the purported expropriation by acts of the judiciary is excluded by Article 5.1 of the BIT (Tr. J. II, 33:6-9; see section 5.3 below).\n\n*Allard v. Sweden,* no. 35179/97 (Sect. 4) (bil.), ECHR 2003-VII - (24.6.03), available at http://worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/310.html.\n\n133.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the facts alleged by Saipem would be capable of constituting an expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT if they were established.\n\n134.\n\nFor the sake of clarity it should be added that whether or not Petrobangla and the courts of Bangladesh actually breached the guarantees of the BIT is a question to be determined with the merits of the dispute. On the merits, Saipem will have to produce evidence and legal arguments to establish the alleged breach and Bangladesh will have the right to challenge such evidence and legal arguments.\n\n**5.3 Did Bangladesh consent to ICSID arbitration for claims based on decisions by its courts?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nBangladesh further asserts that even if *quod non* the Contract and the ICC Award were to qualify as investment, Saipem\u2019s claims would not fall within the scope of Bangladesh\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration:\n\nSince Saipem claims that its right to the ICC Award has been affected by the judicial acts in Bangladesh, as a matter of interpretation of the BIT, such rights cannot have any protection under Art. 5(1)(1) of the BIT. Bangladesh has expressly excluded consent in respect of *\"judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction\".*\n\n(C-Mem, p. 53, para. 4.11)\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Saipem, interpreting the last phrase of this provision as an exclusion of the consent to arbitrate with respect to judicial acts would result in negating the protection which the BIT grants investors. It stresses that \"in almost all instances expropriations occur as a result of actions which directly or indirectly derive from an action contemplated in a law or a judgment\" and that accepting the Respondent\u2019s position would render the State\u2019s actions immune from the rules of the BIT (Rejoinder J., pp. 21-22, para. 86).\n\n137.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Article 5(1)(1) *in fine,* which was quoted above (see above No. 117) cannot be understood as creating immunity in favour of the judiciary power. This provision merely affirms the principle that, \"in order to escape being considered an internationally wrongful act, a State measure limiting or excluding an investor's rights of ownership, control or enjoyment can only be considered legal if it has been adopted by law or by a judicial decision\" (Response J. p. 17, paras. 74-75, see also Tr. J. II, 61:10-12).\n\n138.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal does not have to make a ruling at this stage on whether in the present instance the courts of Bangladesh \"ha[d] jurisdiction\" within the meaning of Article 5(1)(1) *in fine* of the BIT.\n\n**5.4 Are Saipem\u2019s treaty claims in reality contract claims?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nIn Its Counter-Memorial, Bangladesh submitted that Saipem\u2019s \"claim is in reality a contractual claim dressed up as a treaty claim\" (C-Mem., p. 14, para. 1.43).\n\n140.\n\nSaipem opposes this submission with the following argument:\n\nThe focus of the Claimant's case is that its right to payment under the Contract as ascertained by, and incorporated in, the ICC Award has been expropriated by the unlawful decisions of the Bangladeshi courts that revoked the authority of the ICC arbitrators and declared the ICC Award null and void, thus precluding its enforcement in Bangladesh or elsewhere. The net result of all this was, obviously, to deprive the Claimant of the compensation for its investment.\n\n(Response J., p. 3, para. 13)\n\n141.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the essence of Saipem\u2019s case is that the courts of Bangladesh acted in violation of the New York Convention and in an \"illegal, arbitrary and idiosyncratic\" manner amounting to a violation of the protection afforded to foreign investors under Article 5 of the BIT. Saipem does not request relief under the Contract; it does not raise contract claims over which the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction.\n\n142.\n\nWhether Saipem\u2019s treaty claim is well-founded is a different issue which will be decided when dealing with the merits of the dispute. For instance, it is not for the Tribunal to rule at this stage on Bangladesh\u2019s submission that \"the Claimant is in essence asserting that the Bangladeshi court acted in a way to deny it justice\" and that such a breach of international law presupposes the exhaustion of local remedies (Reply J., pp. 17-18, para. 12), or on the allegation that the courts of Bangladesh actually breached the New York Convention or other principles of international law. These are matters which will have to be reviewed during the merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n**5.5 Are the disputed actions attributable to Bangladesh?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nSaipem submits that the expropriation was caused by the combined actions of Petrobangla and the courts of Bangladesh. Bangladesh does not dispute that the courts are \"part of the State\" (Tr. J. II 32:6) and, thus, that their actions are attributable to Bangladesh. Indeed, this cannot be seriously challenged in light of previous ICSID cases37. Hence, the only disputed question is whether Petrobangla\u2019s acts can be attributed to Bangladesh.\n\n*See,* for instance, *The Loewen Group Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of 5 January 2001, paras. 39 *et seq.,* also available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Loewen-US-Jurisdiction-5Jan2001.pdf; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award of 30 April 2004, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/WasteMgmt-Mexico-2-FinalAward-30Apr2004.pdf.\n\n144.\n\nAccording to the test set forth above (see above No. 84 *et seq.),* it is not for the Tribunal at the jurisdictional stage to examine whether the acts complained of give rise to the State\u2019s responsibility, except if it were manifest that the entity involved had no link whatsoever with the State. This is plainly not the case in the present dispute.\n\n145.\n\nIn fact, at first sight at least, Petrobangla appears to be part of the State under Bangladeshi law. Indeed, upon a specific question from the Tribunal at the hearing, Mr. Razzaq confirmed that \"Petrobangla is a statutory public authority\" within the meaning of the Constitution of Bangladesh and is thus \"included in the definition of the state, the same as Parliament\" (Tr. J. I 66:19-20 [Razzaq]).\n\n146.\n\nIn this context and still at first sight, the Tribunal fails to see the relevance of Bangladesh\u2019s emphasis on the fact that Petrobangla, as a part of the State, \"has its own legal personality\" (Tr. J. I 61:20-21 [Razzaq]) distinct and allegedly independent from the Government of Bangladesh (Tr. J. I. 60:1 *et seq:,* 66:20-21 [Razzaq]). In any event, these circumstances do not imply that Petrobangla has no link whatsoever with the State.\n\n147.\n\nSimilarly, the allegation that Petrobangla\u2019s actions were \"not acts of the State in a sovereign capacity\" (Tr. J. II 31:21-22) and that Petrobangla acted in front of the courts of Bangladesh \"as a contracting party which feared bias of the arbitrators they were facing at the time\" (Tr. J. II 31:25-32:1) does not make a difference at this jurisdictional stage.\n\n148.\n\nWhen assessing the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal will rule on the issue of attribution under international law, especially by reference to the Articles on State Responsibility as adopted in 2001 by the International Law Commission and as commended to the attention of Governments by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001 (the ILC Articles) as a codification of customary international law. The Tribunal will in particular consider the following provisions:\n\n\u2022 Art. 4 of the ILC Articles which codifies the well-established rule that the conduct of any State organ, according to the internal law of the State, shall be considered an act of that State under international law. This rule addresses the attribution of acts of so-called *de jure* organs which are empowered to act for the State within the limits of their competence.\n\n\u2022 Art. 5 of the ILC Articles which goes on to attribute to a State the conduct of a person or entity which is not a *de jure* organ but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority provided that person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n\u2022 Art. 8 of the ILC Articles which states that the conduct of a person or group of persons acting under the instructions of or under the direction or control of the State shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\n149.\n\nAt this jurisdictional stage, there is no indication that either the courts of Bangladesh or Petrobangla could manifestly not qualify as state organs at least *de facto.*\n\n**6.** Objections related to the admissibility of Saipem\u2019s claim\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.1 Does the requirement to exhaust local remedies apply?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIt is Bangladesh\u2019s submission that Saipem did not exhaust all the local remedies available against the court decisions issued in relation to the arbitration, in particular the decision to revoke the arbitrators\u2019 authority (see in particular Tr. J. II 32:11 *et seq.).* Moreover, Bangladesh submits that there is no evidence before the Tribunal that it would have been futile for Saipem to take such further judicial steps (Tr. J. II 32:22 *et seq.).*\n\n151.\n\nTo the extent that this submission is regarded as a bar to the admissibility of the claim and/or to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (Reply J., para. 3.25), the Tribunal cannot follow it. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention dispenses with the requirement to exhaust local remedies. It is true that such requirement does apply to claims based on denial of justice, but this is not a matter of the claim\u2019s admissibility but a substantive requirement38. As a matter of principle, exhaustion of local remedies does not apply in expropriation law39. Since Saipem\u2019s claim is brought on the ground of expropriation, there appears to be no ground to deny jurisdiction for the reason that Saipem did not exhaust the judicial remedies available in Bangladesh.\n\nJan Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law, pp. 100 *et seq.* (2005). See also *The Loewen Group, Inc, and Raymond Loewen* v. *United States of America,* Award, 26 June 2003, para. 153, 42 ILM 811,836 (2003).\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc.* v. *Ukraine,* Award, 16 September 2003, paras. 20.30 and 20.33.\n\n152.\n\nThat said, it is true that in the present case the alleged expropriating authority is a judicial body. This raises the question whether an analogy should be made between expropriation and denial of justice when it comes to exhaustion of local remedies. Bangladesh actually argues that Saipem \"is in essence asserting that the Bangladeshi courts acted in a way to deny it justice\" (Reply J., p. 17, para. 3.21).\n\n153.\n\nWhether the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies may be applicable by analogy to an expropriation by the acts of a court and whether, in the affirmative, the available remedies were effective are questions to be addressed with the merits of the dispute. The relevant test for jurisdictional purposes requires that the facts alleged may constitute a breach of Article 5 of the BIT. Saipem\u2019s contention that the courts of Bangladesh expropriated its investment and that the available remedies were futile meets this test. If they were proven, they may constitute breaches of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n**6.2 Does Saipem\u2019s claim constitute an abuse of process?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s second objection concerning admissibility is that Saipem\u2019s claim constitutes an abuse of process as it seeks in substance to \"enforce an invalid ICC award using the ICSID jurisdiction\" (Tr. J. II, 34:17-23). More specifically, according to Bangladesh:\n\nSaipem is asking the ICSID tribunal to rubberstamp the ICC award, thereby converting it into an ICSID award, in order to bypass the correct method of enforcement of an ICC award. Saipem is thereby trying to take advantage of:\n\n(1) the more favourable means of enforcement of an ICSID award;\n\n(2) trying to have a second attempt at enforcing the ICC award;\n\n(3) trying to mutate the Dhaka-ICC arbitration mechanism into a delocalised one to avoid any potential domestic Bangladesh annulment proceedings.\n\nIt is submitted that this would constitute an abuse of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Act 1940 of Bangladesh and the express will of the parties. In addition, this would be an abuse of the process of this Tribunal as the arbitral tribunal's duty is to adjudicate upon all issues before it for itself.\n\nFurther, ICSID is not an appeals facility: the appropriate appeals mechanism against the Bangladesh judgment was an appeal to the next court within the Bangladesh court hierarchy. This was not done on the express choice and election of Saipem.\n\n(C-Mem., p. 59, references omitted)\n\n155.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the present proceedings are not aimed at enforcing an award which is inexistent according to the courts of Bangladesh. The Tribunal understands Saipem\u2019s case to claim that Bangladesh has frustrated its rights by unlawfully interfering in the arbitration process. The fact that the indemnity claimed in this arbitration matches the amounts awarded in the ICC arbitration at least to some extent, does not mean in and of itself that this Tribunal would \"enforce\" the ICC Award in the event of a treaty breach. To avoid any ambiguity, the Tribunal stresses that Saipem\u2019s claim does not deal with the courts\u2019 regular exercise of their power to rule over annulment or setting aside proceedings of an award rendered within their jurisdiction. It deals with the court\u2019s alleged wrongful interference.\n\n156.\n\nFinally, Bangladesh invokes \"an abuse of process [...] because this whole claim goes against party autonomy\" (Tr. J. II, 34:17). In substance, Bangladesh insists that, by choosing a seat of the arbitration in Dhaka, Saipem has accepted the supervisory powers of the local courts and thus assumed the risk of such courts interfering. It argues that a determination by this Tribunal not recognizing the nullity of the ICC Award would be contrary to party autonomy.\n\n157.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, it is true that the choice of Dhaka as seat of the arbitration implied the acceptance of the jurisdiction of the local courts in aid and control of the ICC Arbitration and the acceptance of the related litigation risk (Tr. J. II 27:18-19). It is also true that - contrary to Saipem\u2019s submissions (Tr. J. II, 36:25-37:2) - the latter was not compelled to accept that risk (Tr. J. II 76:1 *et seq.).*\n\n158.\n\nBut this is not the question here. By accepting jurisdiction, this Tribunal does not institute itself as control body over the ICC Arbitration, nor as enforcement court, nor as supranational appellate body for local court decisions. This Tribunal is a treaty judge. It is called upon to rule exclusively on treaty breaches, whatever the context in which such treaty breaches arise.\n\n**7.** Costs\n------------\n\n159.\n\nHaving concluded that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute, the Tribunal reserves all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the parties for subsequent determination.\n\n160.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal has taken due note of Bangladesh\u2019s complaint that Saipem did not provide all the copies of the cited authorities thus creating additional costs for Bangladesh (Tr. J. II 1:11 *et seq.).*\n\n**V. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\na) Holds that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\n**b)** Dismisses all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the claims, the jurisdiction of ICSID, and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n**c)** By virtue of Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules will make the necessary order for the continuation of the proceedings on the merits;\n\n**d)** Reserves all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the parties for subsequent determination.\n\n**VI. DETERMINATION ON PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1.** Relevant facts and Saipem\u2019s request\n------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nIt is common ground that Petrobangla did not repay the Retention Money after the issuance of the Warranty Bond.\n\n163.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration and Statement of Claim, Saipem asked for provisional measures aiming at restraining Bangladesh and at preventing Petrobangla from pursuing any payment demand based on the Warranty Bond until the outcome of the present arbitration (see above No. 62).\n\n164.\n\nThe parties subsequently agreed to the Tribunal\u2019s proposal that a decision be deferred until after the submission of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n165.\n\nPointing out that Bangladesh acknowledged that \"it should have released the Retention Money against Receipt of the Bond\" (C-Mem., p. 27, para. 33), Saipem submitted that \"the natural follow-up of [this statement] would have been that the Respondent formally state its intention not to seek payment of, and to return, the Bond and to return the Retention Money and to take all the necessary steps needed to end the litigation in Bangladesh and in Italy relating to the Bond\". It then invited Bangladesh to \"provide a formal declaration to this effect by June 30, 2006\" (Response J., p. 31, para. 141). Saipem confirmed by letter of 31 May 2006 that its request for provisional measures was thus suspended.\n\n166.\n\nDuring the telephone conference held on 26 July 2006, the parties and the Tribunal agreed as follows in respect of Saipem\u2019s request for provisional measures:\n\nThe parties can further address the question of the Claimant\u2019s request for interim relief in their respective briefs and at the hearing. The Tribunal will decide this issue after the hearing.\n\n(PO#2, Section VII)\n\n167.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Bangladesh submitted *inter alia* that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to order any interim relief, since the Retention Money and the Warranty Bond were \"contractual breaches not amounting to a BIT claim\" (Reply J., p. 19, para. 4.4).\n\n168.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Saipem reiterated the request formulated in the Request for Arbitration and asked the Tribunal to issue a provisional measure recommending that Bangladesh refrain from calling on the Warranty Bond and return it to the Claimant together with the Retention Money without further delay.\n\n(Rejoinder, p. 28, para. 107(ii))\n\n169.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Saipem amended its original request for provisional measures as follows:\n\nClaimant respectfully submits the following requests for provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules:\n\n- to recommend that the Respondent cause (i) the return of the Bond to Claimant for cancellation and (ii) the immediate termination of the litigation pending in Bangladesh against former Banque Indosuez; in the subordinate, to cause the suspension of said litigation and to prevent or avoid encashment of the Bond by Petrobangla until final adjudication of these proceedings;\n\n- to recommend that the Respondent cause the Retention Money, in the amount of USD 869,903 plus Taka 10,391,605 plus interest at the rate of 3,375% per annum from 17 June 1992 to be paid to Claimant right away; in the subordinate, to recommend that the Retention Money be put in an escrow account in the name of ICSID or another neutral party with instructions that payment thereunder be made upon issuance of the ICSID award adjudicating in favour of Claimant.\n\n**2.** Relevant provisions\n--------------------------\n\n170.\n\nProvisional measures are governed by the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n171.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective interests of either party.\n\n172.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n(1) At any time during the proceedings a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n**3.** Tribunal\u2019s power to recommend provisional measures\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nHaving concluded that it has jurisdiction to hear the present dispute, there can be no doubt that this Tribunal has the power to recommend provisional measures.\n\n**4.** Relevant standard\n------------------------\n\n174.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that, by providing that the Tribunal may recommend any provisional measures \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\", Article 47 of the ICSID Convention requires that the requested measure be both necessary and urgent.\n\n175.\n\nFollowing *Pey Casado, Maffezini* and *CSOB,* the Tribunal considers that under Article 47 of the Convention a tribunal enjoys broad discretion when ruling on provisional measures, but should not recommend provisional measures lightly and should weigh the parties\u2019 divergent interests in the light of all the circumstances of the case40.\n\n\"[...] provisional measures authorized by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules-provisions which contain no indication or exact statement in this regard-can be extremely diverse and are left to the appreciation of each Arbitration Tribunal.\" *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/25), Decision on Provisional Measures (25 September 2001), para. 15, English translation of French and Spanish originals in 6 ICSID Reports 375 (2004), \"The imposition of provisional measures is an extraordinary measure which should not be granted lightly by the Arbitral Tribunal\" and that the party requesting the measures \"has the burden to demonstrate why the Tribunal should grant its application\" *(Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Request for Provisional Measures (October 28, 1999), p. 3, para. 10) and in *CSOB* that \"the provisional measures envisaged under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are not exceptional measures in the sense that they require more than a showing that they are necessary to preserve the rights of the parties\" (*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Procedural Order No. 3 (November 5, 1998), p. 2)\n\n**5.** Parties\u2019 positions\n-------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn support of its request, Saipem puts forward the following main arguments:\n\n(i) By sabotaging the ICC Arbitration and by rendering the ICC Award unenforceable, Bangladesh has deprived Saipem of its right to the Retention Money and to the restitution of the Warranty Bond which were both awarded by the ICC Award.\n\n(ii) Saipem is thus exposed to the risk of a call under the Bond (which was declared inadmissible by the ICC Tribunal) which would lead to a further expropriation.\n\n(iii) Bangladesh\u2019s actions in relation to the Bond and to the Retention Money are therefore in themselves direct breaches of the prohibition on expropriation.\n\n177.\n\nGiven that the proceedings in Italy and Bangladesh are still pending, Saipem claims to face the risk that if Petrobangla succeeds in the action in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh bank will have to pay and the Bangladesh bank obviously will ask the Italian bank to be paid by the Italian bank and the Italian bank will ask Saipem in the current proceedings already instituted in Italy to be paid the amount of money.\n\n(Tr. J. II 62:17-21).\n\n178.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Bangladesh submits in substance that its admissions on the Retention Money and on the Warranty Bond were based on an analysis of the parties\u2019 obligations under the Contract and have thus no bearing in an action for violation of the BIT (Reply J., p. 19, para. 19). Moreover, Bangladesh claims that it never called upon the Warranty Bond.\n\n**6.** Tribunal\u2019s determination\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s argument that its admissions on the Retention Money have no bearing in an action for violation of the BIT overlooks the fact that the ICC Award disposed of the Retention Money and of the Warranty Bond and that the claims in this treaty arbitration relate at least in part to the ICC Award.\n\n180.\n\nSimilarly, Bangladesh\u2019s assertion that Petrobangla never requested the payment of the Bond is difficult to reconcile with the content of the \"extend or pay\" letter of 18 April 1993 and with the fact that such a payment remains an issue in the pending litigation in Bangladesh.\n\n181.\n\nMoreover, at the hearing Saipem convincingly showed that there is a risk that it may be required to pay to the Italian bank the amount that the Bangladeshi bank may have to pay to Petrobangla.\n\n182.\n\nHence, in view of the pending litigation in Bangladesh, the Tribunal considers that there is both necessity and urgency. This finding is reinforced by the facts that, apart from denying that it called the Warranty Bond, Bangladesh does not contest Saipem\u2019s contentions and that there is a risk of irreparable harm if Saipem has to pay the amount of the Warranty Bond.\n\n**7.** Conclusion\n-----------------\n\n183.\n\nConsidering that under the current circumstances there is a risk that Petrobangla may draw on the Warranty Bond while keeping the Retention Money, that Bangladesh admitted that either the Retention Money should have been released or the Warranty Bond returned, and taking into account the parties\u2019 respective interests, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Bangladesh should take the necessary steps to ensure that Petrobangla does not proceed to encash the Warranty Bond.\n\n184.\n\nSuch a recommendation strikes a fair balance between the parties\u2019 interests. Saipem is protected from the risk of being required to effect payment to the Italian bank; Petrobangla is protected from the risks that are inherent in Saipem\u2019s requests to return the Warranty Bond for cancellation and to terminate or suspend immediately the litigation pending in Bangladesh.\n\n185.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Saipem\u2019s second request, *i.e.* the request for the return of the Retention Money, must be dismissed. Indeed, it is difficult to see how an immediate payment is necessary and urgent today. While the Tribunal is prepared to recommend measures preventing an increase of the harm allegedly suffered by one of the parties, the Tribunal is not inclined to recommend measures guaranteeing an award in favour of Saipem. Indeed, as correctly put by Bangladesh, this could be viewed as a *de facto* enforcement of part of the ICC Award.\n\n**8.** Recommendation\n---------------------\n\nOn the basis of the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal hereby recommends that Bangladesh take the steps necessary to ensure that Petrobangla refrain from encashing the Warranty Bond No. PG/USD/12/92 issued by Banque Indosuez.\n\nDone on March 21.2007,"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BAA | Bangladeshi Arbitration Act of 1940 |\n| BIT | Bilateral investment treaty; specifically \"Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Italy and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\" of 20 March 1990 |\n| Contract | Agreement of 14 February 1990 between Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation and Saipem S.p.A. for construction of North-South Pipeline [Work Order PIU/INF/13.52] |\n| Counter-Memorial | Bangladesh\u2019s \"Counter-Memorial\" of 14 May 2006, containing its objections to jurisdiction |\n| Exh.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis chapter sets forth the main relevant facts of this arbitration. Additional facts may be referred to as and when appropriate in the course of the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**1. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n**1.1 The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant, Saipem S.p.A. (\"Saipem\" or the \"Claimant\"), is a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Italy. Its principal office is situated at Via Martiri di Cefalonia, 67, 20097 San Donato Milanese, Milan, Italy.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Professors Antonio Crivellaro and Luca Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Andrea Carta Mantiglia, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo, Via Barozzi 1, 20122 Milan, Italy.\n\n**1.2 The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (\"Bangladesh\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Ajmalul Hossain QC, Syed Afzal Hossain, Syed Ahrarul Hossain and Md. Sameer Sattar, A. Hossain & Associates Law Offices, 3/B Outer Circular Road, Maghbazar, Dhaka-1217, Bangladesh as well as Mr. Richard Clegg, Selborne Chambers, 10 Essex Street, London, WC2R 3AA.\n\n**2. The project and the dispute**\n----------------------------------\n\n**2.1 The pipeline contract**\n-----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) is a State entity established under the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Ordinance of 1985 as amended by the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Act of 1989.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 February 1990, Saipem and Petrobangla entered into an agreement n. PIU/INF/13.52 to build a pipeline of 409 km to carry condensate and gas in various locations of the north east of Bangladesh (the \"Contract\"). The Contract price amounted to USD 34,796,140 and BDT 415,664,200 (Exh. C-4). The project was sponsored by the World Bank and financed to a large extent by the International Development Association (IDA)1.\n\nUnder a credit agreement between IDA and Bangladesh and a project agreement between IDA and Petrobangla both dated 2 May 1985. There was also a subsidiary loan agreement dated 3 October 1985 between Bangladesh and Petrobangla. It is Bangladesh\u2019s assertion that the Contract arises out of the agreements with IDA, without which the Contract would not have come into existence (Rejoinder, **p.** 4 at  \u00b6  111).\n\n8.\n\nClause 1.2.5 of the Contract afforded Petrobangla the right to retain 10% of each progress payment due to Saipem as Retention Money up to an amount equivalent to 5% of the total contract price, *i.e.,* USD 1,739,807 plus BDT 20,783,210 (the \"Retention Money\"). The Retention Money was to be released to Saipem in two tranches, half of it not later than 30 days from the issuance of the final taking over certificate (the \"First Taking Over Certificate\") by Petrobangla, and the remaining half not later than 30 days from the issuance of the final acceptance certificate (the \"Final Acceptance Certificate\") by Petrobangla.\n\n9.\n\nThe same Clause 1.2.5 of the Contract provided that Petrobangla could release the second half of the Retention Money prior to the Final Acceptance Certificate against a warranty bond of equal value from a bank acceptable to Petrobangla (the \"Warranty Bond\").\n\n10.\n\nThe Contract was governed by the laws of Bangladesh and contained the following arbitration clause (Clause 1.1.38):\n\nIf any dispute, question or difference should arise between the parties to this Contract with regard to rights and obligations hereunder which cannot be settled amicably, such dispute, question or difference shall be finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each party and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two arbitrators in accordance with the said Rules and if the arbitrators are unable to do so, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce under the said Rules. The venue of the arbitration shall be Dhaka, Bangladesh. The procedure in arbitration shall be in English.\n\n(Exh. C-22)\n\n**2.2 The origin of the present dispute**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***2.2.1 The delay in the project***\n------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to Article 1.1.14 of the Contract, the project was to be completed by 30 April 1991. It was, however, significantly delayed.\n\n12.\n\nThe parties disagree on the reasons for such delay. According to Saipem, the delay was mainly due to problems with the local population which rebelled against the project. By contrast, Bangladesh argues that the problems with the population were caused by Saipem itself (Quamaruzzaman First WS,  pp.  4-5) and that Saipem was already behind schedule before these problems began (Quamaruzzaman Second WS PP- 2-3).\n\n**2.2.2** ***The agreement to extend the completion date***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 6 April 1991, Saipem requested an extension of the completion date by one year and claimed USD 21,231,115 as compensation for delay (Exh. R-8). A few weeks later, on 19 May 1991, Petrobangla claimed compensation for Saipem\u2019s failure to complete the project in time in an amount of USD 91 million (Exh. R-12).\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 May 1991, Saipem and Petrobangla, with the approval of the World Bank, agreed to extend the completion date by one year, *i.e.,* to 30 April 1992. Thereafter, they started negotiations on the compensation payable as a result of the delay (see below \u00b6\u00b6 23 *et seq.).*\n\n***2.2.3 The completion of the project, the Retention Money and the Warranty Bond***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe project was completed and the pipeline taken over by Petrobangla with effect from 14 June 1992. Petrobangla issued the Final Taking Over Certificate on 17 June 1992 (Exh. R-29).\n\n16.\n\nShortly thereafter, Petrobangla returned the first half of the Retention Money.\n\n17.\n\nThe second half of the Retention Money was to be released by Petrobangla against a warranty bond in the same amount, *i.e.,* USD 869,903.50 and BDT 10,391,605.00. The bond was provided on behalf of Saipem on 27 June 1992 (Warranty Bond No. PG/USD/12/92 issued by Banque Indosuez; hereinafter, the \"Warranty Bond\") (Exh. R-33). Petrobangla agreed that such bond would be released no later than 30 days from the issuance of the Final Acceptance Certificate (see Counter-Memorial,  p.  26).\n\n18.\n\nOn 23 June 1993, Petrobangla sent an \"extend or pay letter\" in the following terms:\n\nThe validity of the captioned guarantee which was extended by you vide your letter No. CRDT/AU.-PG-12/92-551/93 dated 04-05-93, will expire on 30-06-93.\n\nWe have requested the Contractor to extend the validity of the said guarantee for further period up to 31-12-93 before its expiry.\n\nIf the Contractor does not give any extension of the validity of this guarantee before its expiry date i.e. 30-06-93, you will treat this letter as our encashment notice against the subject guarantee and in that event you will effect payment to us by a Demand-Draft drawn in favour of the Project Implementation Unit, Petrobangla.\n\n(Exh. R-67)\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 June 1993, Saipem obtained an injunction from the courts in Milan prohibiting Banque Indosuez Italy (the bank which had issued the Warranty Bond) to pay out on the Warranty Bond to Banque Indosuez Pakistan (the correspondent bank in Pakistan)2.\n\nThis injunction was confirmed on 19 July 1993 and subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal of Milan on 12 August 1993. The action on the merits, which was initiated to maintain the injunction was still pending at the time of the hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration (Transcripts of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, 22 September 2006, Day II, 63:22-64:3).\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 23 June 2003, Petrobangla requested Banque Indosuez Pakistan to pay out on the Warranty Bond. In these proceedings, Bangladesh has alleged that Petrobangla later withdrew that request. Saipem has not disputed such allegation.\n\n21.\n\nBeing exposed to the risk of a call on the Warranty Bond, on 12 February 1994, Banque Indosuez Pakistan filed an action before the Court of the 4th Sub-Judge of Dhaka for a declaration that no payment should be made in favour of Petrobangla under the Warranty Bond until the injunction of the courts of Milan was vacated. According to the court\u2019s order sheet, a further hearing was set on 4 June 2006. This action was still pending at the time of the hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration.\n\nSaipem was not a party to it.3 The Tribunal received no further information on such proceedings in the further course of the arbitration.\n\nSee Transcripts of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, 22 September 2006, Day I, 57:14-21.\n\n22.\n\nIt is undisputed that Petrobangla did not repay the second half of the Retention Money in spite of the issuance of the Warranty Bond.\n\n**2.2.4** ***Compensation for delay***\n--------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nFollowing the agreement to extend the time for completion of the project, the parties started negotiations on the amount of compensation due on account of the delays. Between January and May 1992, Petrobangla paid significant amounts to Saipem, allegedly \"under pressure from the World Bank\" (Quamaruzzaman First WS, I \u00b6  8, p. 3). A dispute arose between the parties with respect to Petrobangla\u2019s failure to pay the additional costs allegedly agreed. The parties have conflicting views on whether they agreed on such compensation or not. Bangladesh contends that they did not agree and that the issue of the responsibility for the delay was to be decided by a single arbitrator, who was never appointed. Specifically, Bangladesh raised the following arguments:\n\nA conditional settlement on the issue of compensation was eventually reached on the 9 July 1992 by exchange of telexes after the extension of time for completion was granted (\"the Compromise\"). Petrobangla stated in its letter dated 17 June 1992 that a committee specifically constituted by its Board had assessed Saipem\u2019s claim for compensation at US$11,438 million. [...]\n\nThe Compromise to pay US$ 11,438 million was thus made conditional upon two matters: first, the verification and examination of the genuineness of Saipem\u2019s claims by Government of Bangladesh / Petrobangla [which never occurred] [...].\n\nSecondly, the issue of whether Saipem or Petrobangla was liable for the delay that had occurred in the construction of the Pipeline had to be determined subsequently and such determination would be made by a single arbitrator suitable to both parties [who was never appointed] [...].\n\nAlthough US$10 million was paid by Petrobangla on account of compensation under the Compromise, there remained a disagreement as to the total amount of compensation to be paid and also as to whether Petrobangla should pay compensation. It is asserted that, contrary to the finding by the ICC Tribunal, there was never any agreement between the parties that Petrobangla should pay compensation to Saipem (whether conditionally or unconditionally) in the sum of US$14 million. In any event, it is contended that such a finding was perverse in the light of the material facts available before the ICC Tribunal.\n\n(Rejoinder, pp. 6-12, in particular  \u00b6\u00b6  16, 20, 21 and 34)\n\n24.\n\nSaipem agrees that an agreement was reached, which coincides with the findings of the arbitral tribunal constituted under the arbitration clause embodied in the Contract. According to the Claimant, the so-called Compromise was unconditional and the only reason why the payment was not made was a change in the Bangladeshi Government.\n\n**2.3 The ICC Arbitration and the intervention of the courts of Bangladesh**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in the Contract, Saipem referred the dispute so arisen to ICC arbitration by filing a request for arbitration on 7 June 1993. An arbitral tribunal composed of Dr. Werner Melis (Chairman), Prof. Riccardo Luzzatto and Prof. Ian Brownlie, QC, (the \"ICC Tribunal\" or the \"ICC arbitrators\") was constituted on 4 May 1994.\n\n26.\n\nPetrobangla challenged the jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal on several grounds, none of which related to the appointment of a sole arbitrator pursuant to the Compromise (Exh. C-6)4.\n\nPetrobangla\u2019s jurisdictional objection in relation to the additional compensation for time extension was that such claim \"is outside the scope of the Arbitration Clause and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal since it does not relate to rights or obligations under the Agreement as therein no clause in the Agreement which provides for such additional compensation for time extension\" (Petrobangla\u2019s submissions in the ICC Arbitration as quoted in the ICC Terms of reference [Exh. R-70, ******p.****** 81 and the ICC Award [Exh. C-6, ******p.****** 61). Petrobangla also opposed the admissibility of Saipem\u2019s claim on the ground that they were premature as they \"[wejre not matters which \u2018cannot be settled amicably\u2019 [as provided for by the arbitration agreement]\" (Exh. R-70, ******p.****** 8 and Exh C-6, **pp.** 6-7).\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 November 1995, the ICC Tribunal issued an award on jurisdiction dismissing Petrobangla\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction (Exh. C-7). It then addressed the merits of the case.\n\n28.\n\nIn substance, Saipem claimed compensation in excess of USD 11 million (USD 7,579,445 and BDT 123,350,330) and the return of the Warranty Bond. Petrobangla opposed these claims and raised several counterclaims in the total amount of USD 10,577,941.98.\n\n29.\n\nAfter the exchange of the written submissions in the ICC Arbitration, a witness hearing was held on 22-27 July 1997 in Dhaka (the ICC Hearing). It is the contention of Mr. Nassuato of Saipem that the situation in Bangladesh at the time of the hearing was hostile towards Saipem. In particular, the Italian ambassador wished to meet the members of Saipem\u2019s team before the hearing to warn them that the local press was portraying Saipem as an exploiter of Bangladeshi resources, to express worries about their safety, and to offer them protection during their stay in the country (WS Nassuato, PP- 4-5).\n\n30.\n\nAccording to Mr. Nassuato, Bangladesh took action to prevent Mr. Clark, a key witness on behalf of Saipem, to give testimony at the ICC hearing:\n\nMr. Clark was the Senior Engineer of Pencol Engineering Consultant in Bangladesh from March 1990 to April 1993. Pencol had been selected by the World Bank as the independent and impartial Engineer to supervise the performance of the North South Pipeline Project.\n\nMr. Clark monitored the performance of the contract between Saipem and Petrobangla and periodically reported to the World Bank on the major events relating to the Project, with particular reference to those which could have an impact on timing and costs. At the end of the Project, Mr. Clark left Bangladesh.\n\nBecause of Mr. Clark's thorough knowledge of all the events relating to the Project, he was named as a witness by Saipem in the ICC Arbitration. [...]\n\n[...] When Saipem's counsel informed him that his oral examination would be held in Dhaka, he told Saipem that he was unable to come to Bangladesh.\n\nThere followed many telephone conversations between myself and Mr. Clark to persuade him to attend the hearing in Dhaka. Mr. Clark declared his availability to be heard by the Tribunal anywhere except in Bangladesh. In particular, he offered to be heard in London, Vienna or Mombay. Since Petrobangla refused to accept that hearings be held anywhere other than in Dhaka, Mr. Clark could never be heard by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nIn one of our conversations, Mr. Clark revealed to me that the reason why he could not come to Bangladesh was that he feared being arrested immediately upon his arrival in the country.\n\nHe explained that at the end of the works in 1993 he was ordered by local officials not to issue opinions or to render testimony or other local officials not to issue opinions or to render testimony or other evidence in support of Saipem's claims, either in the arbitration or in direct negotiations with the Government. They knew that he had full knowledge of the file and that he had already advised Petrobangla to accept Saipem's request for monetary compensation and restitution of retention money and bonds. These officials let Mr. Clark clearly understand that, in the contrary case, he was exposed to the severe risk of being arrested for collusion with Saipem.\n\nIt is because of these threats that, as he reported to me, he was forced to leave the country soon after completion of the project in 1993.\n\n(WS Nassuato, pp. 4-5)\n\n31.\n\nDuring the ICC hearing, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal denied several procedural requests submitted by Petrobangla, in particular (i) a request to strike from the record the witness statement of Mr. Clark, (ii) a request that all witnesses be allowed to be present in the hearing room during the entire hearing, (iii) a request that a letter from Petrobangla which was not on record be filed during the cross-examination of a witness, (iv) a request to strike from the record a \"draft aide-m\u00e9moire\" of the World Bank and certain cost calculations prepared by Saipem, and (v) a request that transcripts be made of the tape recordings of the hearing.\n\n32.\n\nFollowing the ICC hearing, Petrobangla formally reiterated its requests on 26 August 1997. The ICC Tribunal denied Petrobangla\u2019s applications once again on 21 September 1997.\n\n33.\n\nIn August 1997, Petrobangla wrote to the ICC Arbitral Tribunal to request information regarding Saipem\u2019s insurance policy and claims made under it, which Saipem had refused to provide. The ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued an order that Saipem\u2019s refusal to provide the requested information would be assessed when appropriate at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n34.\n\nFollowing these adverse procedural decisions, Petrobangla sought the support of the local courts. In Mr. Ahmad\u2019s words:\n\nDuring the ICC proceedings, Petrobangla raised certain objections before the ICC Tribunal regarding the conduct of the proceedings. These objections being largely unsuccessful and fearing injustice, Petrobangla then approached the courts of Bangladesh seeking revocation of the ICC Tribunal's authority under Section 5 of the Arbitration Act 1940. [...]\n\nPlainly, it was Petrobangla\u2019s fear and grievance that the ICC Tribunal had or would commit a substantial miscarriage of justice and it had a reasonable apprehension that it would not get a fair trial before the ICC Tribunal.\n\n(Ahmad Second WS,  \u00b6\u00b6   7 and 10, p. 3)\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 November 1997, Petrobangla filed an action seeking the revocation of the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's in the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka (Exh. R-83)5. The action was based on the ICC arbitrators\u2019 alleged misconduct and breach of the parties\u2019 procedural rights when rejecting Petrobangla\u2019s procedural requests during the hearing of 22-27 July 19976.\n\nOn 23 June 1999, Saipem filed an application for \"rejection of the application\" on the merits (Exh. R-85), which was refused by an order dated 5 September 1999 (Exh. R-87). Saipem did not appeal from this order in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court.\n\nPetrobangla also sought an interim injunction pending the hearing of its application, which was dismissed by the Court by an order dated 16 November 1997 (Exh. C-10.1). On 17 November 1997, Petrobangla filed an appeal from this order (Exh. 0-10.2). By a judgment dated 2 May 1999, the High Court allowed Petrobangla\u2019s appeal, set aside the order dated 16 November 1997 of the lower court, and granted the interim injunction in respect of the proceedings of the ICC Tribunal (Exh. C-10.5). On 30 June 1999, Saipem appealed from this judgment in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and requested a stay of the operation of the Judgment of the High Court Division. The Appellate Division granted the stay and extended it by two separate orders dated 4 and 18 July 1999 until 22 July 1999. After having heard both parties, on 25 July 1999 the Appellate Division rendered a judgment upholding the High Court decision of 2 May 1999.\n\n36.\n\nOn 17 November 1997, Petrobangla applied to the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh \"to stay all further proceedings of the Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK pending before the arbitral tribunal and/or to restrain the opposite party and/or the tribunal by and from proceeding further with the said arbitration\" (Exh. C-10.2).\n\n37.\n\nA week later, on 24 November 1997, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh issued an injunction restraining Saipem from proceeding with the ICC Arbitration (Exh. C-10.3)7:\n\n[Saipem] is hereby restrained by an order of ad-interim injunction from proceeding with the said arbitration proceeding case No. 7934/CK for a period of 8 (eight) weeks from date.\n\n(Exh. C-10.3, p. 2)\n\nSaipem appealed from the judicial stay of the arbitration on the ground that the Bangladeshi courts had no jurisdiction to decide on Petrobangla\u2019s petition regarding the alleged misconduct of the proceedings by the arbitrators. Specifically, Saipem submitted that the ICC Arbitration Rules elected by the parties provided for an exclusive mechanism for disqualification of the arbitrators and that such an election had to be taken into consideration according to Section V of the Bangladeshi Arbitration Act of 1940. Pursuant to this provision, \"the authority of an appointed arbitrator is irrevocable except with the leave of the court, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement\".\n\n38.\n\nBecause of the measures just referred to, which Saipem viewed as punitive actions taken against it by the new government (see above \u00b6 24)8, Saipem felt that it was unsafe for its management to travel to Bangladesh (WS Galizzi,  p.  2). It also feared that its acting through a Bangladeshi lawyer may put such a lawyer at risk. It thus decided to act in Bangladesh through an Indian law firm:\n\nThis way of proceeding was imposed by the fact that we, Saipem's employees or officials, were prevented from going to Bangladesh because our physical presence in the country was extremely dangerous to our personal safety. Moreover, we were worried that a direct mandate from us to a Bangladeshi lawyer would constitute a cause of concern and risk also for such local lawyer.\n\n(WS Nassuato, p. 5)\n\nAccording to Mr. Nassuato, \"Saipem, considered the risky conditions in the country very seriously when the question arose of whether we were to appear before the Bangladeshi courts to contest the decisions interfering with the arbitration\" (Nassuato WS, p. 6).\n\n39.\n\nSeveral other court decisions confirmed and maintained the stay of the arbitration, including a decision of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh handed down on 23 March 1998 (Exh. C-10.4).\n\n40.\n\nOn 19 September 1999, Saipem filed a written objection to Petrobangla\u2019s action seeking the revocation of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's authority (Exh. R-88). A few weeks later, on 5 April 2000, the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka issued a decision revoking the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (the \"Revocation Decision\") on the following grounds:\n\nIn view of the submission of the lawyers for the parties and perusal of the documents filed by both sides I hold that the Arbitral Tribunal has conducted the arbitration proceedings improperly by refusing to determine the question of the admissibility of evidence and the exclusion of certain documents from the record as well as by its failure to direct that information regarding insurance be provided. Moreover, the Tribunal has manifestly been in disregard of the law and as such the Tribunal committed misconduct.\n\nTherefore, in the above circumstances, it appears to me that there is a likelihood of miscarriage of justice.\n\n(Exh. C-11, as quoted in SoC., p. 21,  \u00b6  92)\n\n41.\n\nAccording to Mr. Galizzi of Saipem, the Revocation Decision came as a shock and brought the collusion between Petrobangla and the courts of Bangladesh to light:\n\nIt became clear to us why Petrobangla had insisted on Dhaka as the seat of the arbitration. They evidently intended to use this as a means to allow their courts to interfere with the arbitration and to bring matters before their local courts. Had we suspected that the local courts would accept to play Petrobangla\u2019s game, we would never have accepted Dakha as the seat of the arbitration and would have refused to conclude the contract.\n\n(WS Galizzi p. 3)\n\n42.\n\nTwo degrees of appeals were available from the Revocation Decision and Saipem asserts that it then \"seriously weighed the option of contesting the [Revocation Decision]\" (Reply, p. 12,  \u00b6  43). It chose, however, not to do so. Indeed, as pointed out by Mr. Ahmad on behalf of Bangladesh:\n\nUpon the revocation of the authority of the ICC Tribunal, it [Saipem] ceased to take any part in the Bangladeshi cases and simply ignored the decisions and went ahead with the ICC arbitration.\n\n(Ahmad Second WS,  \u00b6   12, p. 4)\n\n43.\n\nAccording to Mr. Galizzi of Saipem, the latter decided not to file an appeal because any expectation to succeed appeared unsustainable under the circumstances:\n\nBecause of the hostile climate in Bangladesh and because we were firmly convinced that the revocation of the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal was completely illegal by all standards, we knew that we had no alternative but to proceed with the arbitration. Our Indian counsel advised us that an appeal against the injunction against the continuation of the arbitration was possible in theory, but unsustainable in substance. It was clear that we would not be in a position to defend ourselves before the local courts and that the climate was incompatible with a fair trial. As is confirmed by the witness statement of Mr. Nassuato, our witnesses, including the members of the arbitral tribunal, would have risked being in physical danger had they come to testify in Dhaka. Clearly the members of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal would have been key witnesses in those proceedings. The testimony of the Arbitrators would have been crucial, since the only reason for the revocation of the authority of the ICC tribunal was the alleged misconduct of the proceedings imputed to the Arbitrators. They could have demonstrated that no misconduct had ever been committed by them and that they had properly conducted the arbitration proceedings pursuant to the ICC Rules and even to the provisions of the Bangladeshi Arbitration Act.\n\n(WS Galizzi pp. 3-4)\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ahmad, who testified on behalf of Bangladesh, the fear that Saipem\u2019s witnesses and members of the Tribunal would have been in physical danger had they come to testify in Dhaka \"was baseless [and] not supported by evidence\" (Ahmad Second WS,  \u00b6 1 9, p.  5). Moreover:\n\nWhile Saipem was represented by Bangladeshi Counsel in the above cases no suggestion was ever made that there was any fear of bias or prejudice against Saipem or that the courts were leaning towards Petrobangla in order to let it \"off the hook\" in respect of a potential award in its favour.\n\n(Ahmad Second WS,  \u00b6   15, p. 4)\n\n45.\n\nOn 30 April 2001, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal decided to resume the proceedings \"on the ground that the challenge or replacement of the arbitrators in an ICC arbitration falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Court and not of the courts of Bangladesh\" and that \"the revocation of the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by the Bangladeshi courts was [thus] contrary to the general principles governing international arbitration\" (Exh. C-8).\n\n46.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 9 May 2001, Petrobangla brought an action before the First Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhaka to set aside the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s order resuming the arbitration arguing *inter alia* that Saipem was \"manifestly guilty of contempt of court\" having participated in the arbitration despite the court injunction (Exh. C-12).\n\n47.\n\nTwo weeks later, on 24 May 2001, it also filed a request for a declaration that the ICC Arbitration was unlawful on the ground that the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal was revoked by operation of the decision of the Dhaka Subordinate Judge. It also applied for an interim and a permanent injunction against the continuation of the arbitration. On the same day, the court refused to grant the interim injunction. On 27 May 2001, Petrobangla appealed against this refusal before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. On the same date, the High Court Division issued an injunction restraining Saipem from pursuing the ICC Arbitration. This decision was confirmed by the High Court Division on 23 October 2001, 16 January 2002, and 15 July 2002.\n\n48.\n\nIn the meantime, the ICC Arbitration proceeded and, on 9 May 2003, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal rendered an award holding that Petrobangla had breached its contractual obligations to compensate Saipem for the time extension and additional works and ordered Petrobangla to pay to Saipem the total amount of USD 6,148,770.80 plus EUR 110,995.92 (which included the Retention Money which remained unpaid) plus interest at 3,375% from 7 June 1993. It also ordered Petrobangla to return the Warranty Bond to Saipem (the \"ICC Award\"; Exh. C-6).\n\n49.\n\nOn 19 July 2003, Petrobangla applied to set aside the ICC Award before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh under Sections 42(2) and 43 of the Arbitration Act 2001 (Exh. C-13).\n\n50.\n\nThe High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh denied such application on 21 April 2004 because it was \"misconceived and incompetent inasmuch as there is no Award in the eye of the law, which can be set aside\" (Exh. C-21,  p. 11). In the most relevant passage, the High Court Division decision reads as follows:\n\n[...] On a perusal of materials on record and particularly Annexure-\"D\" that is the judgment passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, First Court, in Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997, it appears that the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to proceed with the Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK/AER/ACS/MS had been revoked on 5.4.2000. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded with the said arbitration case most illegally and without jurisdiction after the pronouncement of the judgment of Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997. Moreover, the Arbitral Tribunal was injuncted upon by the High Court Division not to proceed with the said arbitration case any further but in spite of that the Tribunal proceeded with the Arbitration Case and ultimately declared their Award on 9.5.2003. [...]\n\nThe applicable law of the agreement was set out in clause 1.1.1a of the agreement in the following terms: \"1.1.1a The contract shall be governed and construed with reference to the law in force in Bangladesh...\". Thus it is clear that the Bangladesh Court has the jurisdiction to entertain a suit/proceeding if initiated by a party to the Contract. Therefore the judgment passed by the First Subordinate Judge in Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 49 of 1997 and the injunction order dated 2.5.1999 passed by this Court in the Miscellaneous Appeal No. 25 of 1997 were binding upon the Arbitral Tribunal [...]\n\nIt is, thus, clear and obvious that the Award dated 9.5.2003 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal in Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK/AER/ACS/MS is a nullity in the eye of law and this Award can not be treated as an Award in the eye of law as it is clearly illegal and without jurisdiction inasmuch as the authority of the Tribunal was revoked as back as on 5.4.2000 by a competent Court of Bangladesh. [...]\n\nA non-existent award can neither be set aside nor can it be enforced.\n\n(Exh. C-21, pp. 8-11)\n\n51.\n\nIt is undisputed that Saipem did not appeal this decision.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Initial phase**\n--------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 5 October 2004, Saipem filed a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\" or \"RA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"), accompanied by 17 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to 17). In its Request, Saipem invoked the provisions of the BIT and sought the following relief:\n\n*6.1 Claim for Declaratory Decisions*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal declare that:\n\nBangladesh has expropriated Claimant of its investment without paying compensation;\n\nBangladesh has breached its international obligations under the BIT.\n\n*6.2 Monetary Claims*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal award it complete compensation for all the damages and losses it suffered as a result of Bangladesh's breaches of its obligations.\n\nAs the Claimant will substantiate at the proper stage of the proceedings, the loss suffered by the Claimant amounts to at least US$ 12,500,000.00, plus interest at the proper rate.\n\nThe Claimant also requests that the Arbitral Tribunal order Bangladesh to return or extinguish the Warranty Bond.\n\n*6.3 Interim Relief*\n\nIn light of Bangladesh's bad faith attempts to draw upon the Warranty Bond, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue a provisional order pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention ordering Respondent to refrain from pursuing -and to prevent Petrobangla from pursuing - any payment demand based on this Bond until the outcome of the present arbitration.\n\n*6.4 The Costs of the Present Arbitration*\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal order Respondent to reimburse Claimant for all the costs incurred and to be incurred by it in connection with the present arbitration, including legal fees.\n\n(RA, pp. 27-28,  \u00b6\u00b6   121-126, footnote omitted)\n\n53.\n\nOn 12 October 2004, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), transmitted a copy of the RA to Bangladesh.\n\n54.\n\nAfter a protracted exchange of correspondence (during which the Claimant filed additional exhibits to the Request - Exh. C-18 to 21) between the parties and the Centre, on 27 April 2005, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Saipem\u2019s Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n55.\n\nThe parties agreed on a Tribunal composed of three arbitrators with one arbitrator each to be appointed by the parties and the presiding arbitrator to be jointly nominated by the two party-appointed arbitrators. On 27 June 2005, Saipem appointed Prof. Christoph Schreuer, a national of Austria. On 4 July 2005, Bangladesh appointed Sir Philip Otton, a national of the United Kingdom. On 21 July 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties that the co-arbitrators had agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n56.\n\nOn 22 August 2005, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. The same letter informed the parties that Mrs. Eloise M. Obadia, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal. Mrs. Obadia was replaced as the Secretary of the Tribunal by Mrs. Martina Polasek, ICSID Counsel, from 23 August 2006 to 31 May 2007.\n\n57.\n\nBy decision of 11 October 2005, Sir Philip Otton and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler dismissed Bangladesh\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Prof. Christoph Schreuer concluding that the latter met the requirement of independence and impartiality, or, in the words of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, that he had the ability to \"exercise independent judgement\".\n\n58.\n\nOn 1 December 2005, the Tribunal held a preliminary session in London. At the outset of the session, the parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections in this respect. The remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda of the session were discussed and agreed upon, including a procedural calendar. An audio recording of the session was later distributed to the parties. Minutes were drafted, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and sent to the parties on 13 January 2006.\n\n**2. The jurisdictional phase**\n-------------------------------\n\n**2.1 The written phase on jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable agreed upon during the preliminary session, on 20 February 2006, Saipem submitted its Statement of Claim accompanied by two volumes of exhibits (Exh. C-21 to. C-84). Saipem did not append any witness statement or expert opinion.\n\n60.\n\nFollowing a short extension, on 14 May 2006, Bangladesh submitted its \"Counter-Memorial\" containing its objections to jurisdiction accompanied by five volumes of exhibits (Exh. R-1 to R-113) and four witness statements by Mr. Mohammed Quamaruzzaman (WS Quamaruzzaman), Mr. Abdul Monsur Md. Azad (WS Azad), Mr. Salahuddin Ahmad (WS Ahmad) and Mr. Abdur Razzaq (WS Razzaq). Mr. Razzaq\u2019s witness statement introduced a legal opinion on issues of Bangladeshi law, which was accompanied by ten annexes.\n\n61.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable agreed upon during the preliminary session, on 14 July 2006, Saipem submitted its Response on Objections to Jurisdiction accompanied by one volume of exhibits (Exh. C-85 to C-99). Saipem did not append any witness statement or expert opinion.\n\n62.\n\nIn line with the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, on 18 August 2006, Bangladesh submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction9.\n\nIn the cover letter, Bangladesh announced that a Supplemental WS by Mr. Razzaq would be filed \"over the week-end\".\n\n63.\n\nOn 14 September 2006, within the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, Saipem submitted its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction accompanied by one volume of exhibits (Exh. C-100 to C-101), without witness statements or expert opinions.\n\n**2.2 The hearing on jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on jurisdiction from 21 to 22 September 2006 in London. It heard witness evidence from Messrs. Abdul Monsour Azad, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdul Razzaq and Mohammed Quamaruzzaman. In addition, Mr. Hossain presented oral argument on behalf of Bangladesh and Messrs. Crivellaro, Radicati di Brozolo and Carta Mantiglia addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Saipem.\n\n65.\n\nAt the close of the jurisdictional hearing, it was agreed that the Tribunal would issue a reasoned decision on jurisdiction. If the decision were to be negative, the Tribunal would render an award terminating the arbitration. If the decision were affirmative, the Tribunal would render a decision asserting jurisdiction and issue an order with directions for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\n66.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction, according to which it:\n\na) H[e]ld that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\nb) Dismiss[ed] all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the claims, the jurisdiction of ICSID, and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\nc) By virtue of Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules, ordered] the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Section 15.2 of the Minutes of the First Session;\n\nd) Reserve[d] all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the parties for subsequent determination.\n\n67.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 March 2007, the Tribunal \"recommend[ed] that Bangladesh take the steps necessary to ensure that Petrobangla refrain from encashing the Warranty Bond No. PG/USD/12/92 issued by Banque Indosuez\" *(referred to* above at 17).\n\n**3. The written phase on the merits**\n--------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 25 May 2007, the Tribunal held a procedural telephone conference to discuss the further steps to be taken in this arbitration. On the basis of this consultation, the Tribunal issued a procedural order containing the following directions:\n\n3. Except where amended by this Order, the procedural directions contained in the Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal shall apply to this phase of the proceedings.\n\n4. The calendar for this phase of the proceedings shall be as follows:\n\ni. On 25 June 2007, each Party may request the production of documents from its opponent;\n\nii. On 16 July 2007, each Party shall respond to the request for document production, if any, by either producing the document sought or explaining the reasons for not producing such documents;\n\niii. The Arbitral Tribunal will endeavor to decide on the request(s) that remain outstanding around 10 August 2007;\n\niv. If the production of documents is ordered, then each Party shall produce such documents no later than 5 September 2007. The documents which the Arbitral Tribunal orders a party to produce, shall be communicated to the other party and will only be deemed part of the record if it is produced as an exhibit to the Reply or the Rejoinder;\n\nv. On 22 October 2007, the Claimant shall file its Reply on the Merits [...];\n\nvi. On 14 January 2008, the Respondent shall file its Rejoinder on the Merits [...];\n\nvii. On 25 January 2008, the Parties shall specify which of the witnesses of its opponent it wishes to cross-examine at the hearing;\n\nviii. On 31 January 2008 [or on 1 February 2008], a telephone conference will be held for the organization of the hearing. Such telephone conference will take place at 7:30 a.m. Washington time; 12:30 p.m. London time; 1:30 p.m. Milan time; and 6:30 p.m. Dhaka time;\n\nix. A hearing on the Merits for witness examinations and presentation of the Parties\u2019 oral arguments will be held on 11, 12 and 13 March 2008 and, if necessary, on 14 March 2008 in London.\n\n[...]\n\n69.\n\nOn 2 June 2007, Respondent submitted a letter addressed on 13 May 2007 by Petrobangla to the Commercial Bank of Ceylon withdrawing the letter of demand dated 23 June 1993.\n\n70.\n\nOn 25 June 2007, each party filed a request for production of documents.\n\n71.\n\nBy procedural order of 9 August 2007, the Tribunal (i) noted that in response to the Respondent\u2019s request for document production Claimant produced Exhibits C-103 to C-109 and (ii) denied all other or further reaching requests.\n\n72.\n\nOn 22 October 2007, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits entitled \"Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits\" (the \"Reply\"). The Reply was accompanied by 27 legal authorities (Exh. C-112 to C-139) and two witness statements by Mr. Lorenzo Nassuato (WS Nassuato; Exh. C-110) and Mr. Pietro Galizzi (WS Galizzi; Exh. C-111).\n\n73.\n\nOn 14 January 2008, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (the \"Rejoinder\"). The Rejoinder was accompanied and three additional witness statements by Mr. Mohammed Quamaruzzaman (second WS Quamaruzzaman), Mr. Abdul Monsur Md. Azad (second WS Azad) and Mr. Salahuddin Ahmad (second WS Ahmad) as well as 8 additional legal authorities.\n\n74.\n\nIn its Rejoinder and by letter of 25 January 2008, Bangladesh submitted that Saipem\u2019s witnesses should not be allowed to give evidence, which was immediately contested by Saipem. Upon a request by the Tribunal, by letter of 30 January 2008, Saipem filed an additional response to Bangladesh\u2019s objection as to the witnesses.\n\n75.\n\nOn 1 February 2008, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with counsel for the purpose of organizing the forthcoming hearing, the content of which was summarized in a procedural order dated 8 February 2008. In its relevant part, the procedural order reads as follows:\n\nWITNESSES [...]\n\n9. At the telephone conference, the President of the Tribunal informed the parties that the Tribunal had deliberated on the admissibility of Saipem's witnesses and decided to allow such witnesses to give evidence at the hearing. She added that the main reasons for this decision were (i) that the testimonies appeared to be in response to the argument raised in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial that Saipem had failed to exhaust the local remedies, and (ii) that such response was made on the first available occasion within the merits phase, i.e. in the Reply.\n\n10. As a result, the Tribunal will hear the following witnesses:\n\ni. Mr. Nassuato\n\nii. Mr. Galizzi\n\niii. Mr. Azad\n\niv. Mr. Quamaruzzaman\n\nv. Mr. Ahmad.\n\n11. The method of examination of the witnesses will follow the one adopted for the first hearing, i.e.:\n\ni. The Party having produced the witness statement will proceed with a brief direct examination (approximately 5 to 10 minutes);\n\nii. The other Party will then cross-examine the witness;\n\niii. The Parties may then proceed with re-direct and re-cross examination. The re-direct examination shall be limited to matters arising out of the cross-examination, and re-cross examination shall be limited to matters arising out of the re-direct examination;\n\niv. The Arbitral Tribunal may ask its questions at any time, but will most likely do so at the end of the examination;\n\nv. The Arbitral Tribunal will have control over the hearing and the witness examinations.\n\n12. All witnesses will be sequestered prior to their providing testimony at the hearing. Thus, witnesses will not be able to attend the hearing until after they have provided their testimony.\n\nORAL ARGUMENTS\n\n13. Following the examination of the witnesses, the Parties will present oral arguments. There will be a first round followed by a short second round.\n\n14. The first round will last between 2.30 and 6 hours maximum for each Party. The second round will last approximately 0.30 minutes each.\n\n15. If the Parties so wish, they may submit a skeleton of their oral arguments as well as any print out of PowerPoint slides, if any, at the time of starting their oral presentations.\n\n16. As a rule and subject to the Tribunal asking for written submissions on specific issues, there will be no post-hearing briefs.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\n17. March 11: all the witnesses will be heard on the first day. The hearing will start at 9:00 a.m. and last until the examinations are completed.\n\n18. March 12: the hearing will start at 11:00 a.m. and be devoted to the first round of oral arguments by Claimant.\n\n19. March 13: the hearing will start at 9:00 a.m. and be devoted to the first round of oral arguments by Respondent, and possible questions of the Tribunal to be addressed in the rebuttals.\n\n20. March 14: the hearing will start at 9:00 a.m. and be devoted to rebuttal arguments, answers to Tribunal questions, and any outstanding procedural issues.\n\n21. As a rule, the hearing will not end later than 5:30 p.m. on 12 and 13 March. It is anticipated that it will not end later than 12:00 on 14 March.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n22. The hearing will be tape recorded and a court reporter will be retained to provide verbatim transcripts with same day delivery.\n\n23. The parties agree that the secretary of the Tribunal need not be present during the hearing. They further agree that Mrs Silja Schaffstein, a doctoral student of the President residing in London, will be present during the hearing to give any practical assistance which may be needed. A CV of Mrs Schaffstein is attached.\n\n24. The hearing will take place at the International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC), 70 Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 1EU.\n\n25. The parties confirmed that they do not require interpretation for any of the witnesses.\n\n**4. The hearing on the merits**\n--------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe hearing on the merits (the \"Hearing\") was held in London from 11 to 14 March 2008. The Hearing was tape-recorded and a *verbatim* transcript was taken and delivered to the parties and the Tribunal (Tr.).\n\n77.\n\nAt the outset of the Hearing, Bangladesh submitted a motion to exclude sections 1 to 6 of Mr. Nassuato\u2019s WS and paragraphs 2 to 5 of Mr. Galizzi\u2019s WS. Having considered the parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal decided that, in conformity with Procedural Order No. 8, it would admit Messrs. Nassuato and Galizzi\u2019s evidence, oral and written only to the extent it is dealing with any facts and circumstances linked to exhaustion of remedies, including any facts and circumstances showing the local climate and the alleged hostility towards Saipem.\n\n(Tr. I 35:18-37:16)\n\n78.\n\nDuring the first part of the Hearing (Days I and II), the Tribunal heard oral testimony from the following witnesses:\n\n\u2022 On behalf of Saipem: (i) Mr. Nassuato and (ii) Mr. Galizzi;\n\n\u2022 On behalf of Bangladesh: (i) Mr. Azad, (ii) Mr. Quamaruzzaman and (iii) Mr. Ahmad.\n\n79.\n\nDuring the second part of the Hearing, the Tribunal heard oral arguments and rebuttal oral arguments by Profs. Crivellaro and Radicati di Brozolo on behalf of Saipem and by Dr. Hossain on behalf of Bangladesh.\n\n80.\n\nThroughout the Hearing, the parties filed written notes summarizing and/or completing their oral submissions and produced several documents which were admitted into evidence:\n\n\u2022 On behalf of Saipem, the Tribunal received the following documents:\n\n- A powerpoint presentation in support of Prof. Crivellaro\u2019s oral argument of 12 March 2008;\n\n- Pleading notes of Prof. Radicati di Brozolo of 12 March 2008 (\"RPN I\");\n\n- Pleading notes of Prof. Radicati di Brozolo of 14 March 2008 (\"RPN II\");\n\n- A copy of the Terms of Reference in the ICC arbitration dated 6th August 1994;\n\n- An article by Constantine Partasides entitled *\"Solutions offered by transnational rules in case of interference by the courts of the seat\",* TDM, Vol. 1- Issue 2- May 2004;\n\n- Pleading notes on rebuttal of Prof. Crivellaro of 14 March 2008.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the request to exclude parts of the Claimant\u2019s witness statements referred to above, Bangladesh handed over the following documents:\n\n- \"Oral submissions\" of Dr. Hossain (\"HPN\");\n\n- A binder accompanying Dr. Hossain\u2019s oral submissions including:\n\n\u2022 Excerpts of legal materials concerning \"Legal principles relied upon by Bangladesh\" and\n\n\u2022 Copies of \"further authorities relied upon by Bangladesh\";\n\n- Two binders containing Bangladesh\u2019s exhibits concerning the Bangladeshi litigation.\n\n- A binder containing Bangladesh\u2019s exhibits concerning the parties contractual relationship.\n\n- A general chronology of the dispute;\n\n- A chronology of the Bangladeshi litigation;\n\n- An excerpt from Poudret/Besson's \"Comparative Law of International Arbitration\", 2nd ed, London [etc] 2007.\n\n81.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the parties expressed that they were satisfied with the manner in which the procedure had been conducted (Tr. IV 125:16-126:4). Saipem reserved the right to file a request that the Tribunal order the filing of post-hearing briefs (Tr. IV 125:8-11), but eventually did not do so.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the record and will now first examine the positions of the parties (III), then analyse the issues deriving from those positions (IV), and set forth the operative part of its decision (V).\n\n83.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, the Tribunal closed the proceedings.\n\n**III. PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Saipem\u2019s position**\n------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Saipem has essentially put forward the following eight main contentions:\n\n(i) Petrobangla has resorted to the local courts which colluded with the State entity to sabotage the ICC Arbitration and deny the foreign investor\u2019s right to arbitrate under the Contract and to obtain satisfaction of its claims;\n\n(\u00a1\u00a1) Saipem\u2019s right to arbitrate and more specifically its right that disputes with Petrobangla be settled by arbitration is a contractual right or, in the words of Article 1(e) of the BIT, a \"right accruing by law or by contract\" having an economic value;\n\n(iii) The courts of Bangladesh acted without jurisdiction and/or illegally when revoking the ICC Tribunal\u2019s authority while the parties had agreed on ICC arbitration and thereby entrusted such power to the ICC Court of Arbitration and excluded the authority of the courts at the seat of the arbitration.\n\n(iv) The courts of Bangladesh acted illegally when revoking the ICC Tribunal on spurious grounds.\n\n(v) The actions of Petrobangla and of the courts of Bangladesh are attributable to the Republic of Bangladesh.\n\n(vi) The disputed actions amount to an illegal expropriation without compensation of Saipem's rights to arbitration and under the Award, in violation of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n(vii) The decision to revoke the ICC Tribunal\u2019s authority and the subsequent decision to declare the ICC Award non-existent precluded the enforcement of the award in Bangladesh or elsewhere and thus deprived Saipem of the compensation for the expropriation of its investment.\n\n(viii) Since the expropriation consisted foremost in rendering a perfectly valid arbitral award worthless and unenforceable, the loss suffered by the Claimant is the amount awarded in the ICC Award plus whatever additional cost or damage Saipem incurred as a consequence of the impossibility to enforce the Award immediately.\n\n85.\n\nOn the basis of these contentions, Saipem requests the Tribunal to:\n\ndeclare that the Respondent has violated its obligations under the BIT and international law;\n\norder the Respondent to compensate the damage caused to the Claimant in the amount quantified in Part V, including compound interest; [that is:\n\n(i) the amount awarded to it in the ICC Award, i.e. USD 5,883,770.80, plus interest at the rate set out in the Award of 3,375% per annum, from 7 June 1993 until 9 May 2003, *viz.* the date at which the expropriation was committed;\n\n(ii) the amounts of USD 265,000.00 and \u20ac 110,995.92 awarded to the Claimant in the ICC Award in respect of the costs of the ICC Arbitration and the related legal expenses plus interest;\n\n(iii) interest on the amounts in (i) and (ii) above at the rate provided for by Article 5 of the BIT, viz. six-month LIBOR, from 10 May 2003 to the date of payment;\n\n(iv) the costs, legal fees and all related expenses incurred by Saipem (a) to defend itself in the spurious litigation commenced by Petrobangla before the Courts of Bangladesh to derail the ICC Arbitration and to sabotage the ICC Award; (b) the costs, legal fees and all related expenses incurred by Saipem to defend itself in the litigation in Italy in connection with Petrobangla\u2019s abusive attempt to call the Warranty Bond; and (c) the costs related to maintaining the Warranty Bond since the date when it should have been returned to Saipem, all amounting to USD 1,120,000 (Exhibit C-29);\n\n(v) interest on the amount under (iv) above at the six-month LIBOR BIT rate from December 31, 2000. This date is the mid-point of the period starting from November 24, 1997 (the date of the first interference of the Bangladeshi judiciary) until today during which such costs were incurred,\n\n[...]\n\n([v]i) the return or cancellation of the Warranty Bond dated 27 June 1992 issued by Banque Indosuez in the amount of USD 869,903.50 and Taka 10,391,605.00 as established in the ICC Award;\n\nor, in the event that Petrobangla obtains payment of the Warranty Bond, the amount of the Warranty Bond, plus interest at the BIT Libor Rate from the date at which Saipem will have to pay the amount thereof to the Bank.]\n\nand\n\norder the Respondent to reimburse the Claimant for all the costs incurred and to be incurred by it in connection with the present arbitration, including legal fees.\n\n(Reply, p. 41,  \u00b6  151 and SoC., pp. 73-75, \u00b6\u00b6  272, 274 and 275)\n\n**2. Bangladesh\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Bangladesh has raised the following five main arguments:\n\n(i) Since the seat of the ICC Arbitration was Dhaka, the courts of Bangladesh had jurisdiction to revoke the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n(\u00a1\u00a1) The decision to revoke the authority of the ICC Tribunal was made in accordance with the applicable standards under Article 5 of the Arbitration Act 1940;\n\n(iii) Saipem elected not to lodge an appeal against the decision to revoke the authority of the ICC Tribunal. It has thus deprived Bangladesh of the opportunity to rectify alleged wrongdoings of its lower courts in connection with the ICC Arbitration, if any;\n\n(iv) The ICC Award was erroneous and could have been vacated on appeal;\n\n(v) By agreeing on ICC Arbitration in Dhaka, Saipem accepted any potential failure to enforce an ICC award in its favour in Bangladesh as a calculated business risk.\n\n87.\n\nIn reliance on these arguments, Bangladesh invites the Tribunal to find:\n\n(1) that Saipem had not made any investment in Bangladesh\n\n(2) alternatively, Saipem's alleged investment rights and in particular the ICC Award were not in fact expropriated\n\n(3) further or alternatively, those rights alleged to have been expropriated did not have any residual value at the date of expropriation\n\n(4) further or alternatively, no loss or damage was caused by any of the alleged actions of Petrobangla which can be attributed to Bangladesh or of the Courts of Bangladesh and for which compensation is payable\n\n[...] Bangladesh invites the Tribunal to dismiss the claim in its entirety and render an award in its favour.\n\n(Rejoinder, p. 44,  \u00b6\u00b6   145-146)\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**1. INTRODUCTORY MATTERS**\n---------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal wishes to address the relevance of prior decisions (1.1) and the significance of the Decision on Jurisdiction (1.2) as well as the applicable law (1.3). It will then address some further preliminary issues, in particular the relevance of mistakes allegedly made by the ICC Tribunal (1.4) and some evidentiary issues (1.5). Finally, for the sake of clarity, the Tribunal will set out some uncontroversial matters and list the issues to be analysed (1.6).\n\n**1.1 The relevance of previous decisions or awards**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn support of their positions, both parties relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions10. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law11.\n\n*See e.g.,* *AES Corporation v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on jurisdiction of 13 July 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/ decisions/AES-Argentina\\_Jurisdiction.pdf.\n\nOn the precedential value of ICSID decisions, *see* Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse?, Freshfields lecture 2006, Arbitration International 2007, pp. 368 *et seq.*\n\n**1.2 The relevance of the Decision on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it held *inter alia* that the present dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The operative part of the Decision on Jurisdiction is quoted in the part of this award setting out the procedural history (see above \u00b6 66). For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the findings and the analysis made in the Decision on Jurisdiction are hereby incorporated by reference into the present award.\n\n92.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held in particular on a *prima facie* basis that \"the facts alleged by Saipem would be capable of constituting an expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT if they were established\" during the merits phase of the arbitration. It expressly reserved its determination of the following matters for the present phase of the arbitration:\n\n(i) \"whether the rights asserted by Saipem do exist\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 97);\n\n(\u00a1\u00a1) \"whether or not Petrobangla and the Courts of Bangladesh actually breached the guarantees of the BIT\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134);\n\n(\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1) \"[w]hether Saipem\u2019s treaty claim is well-founded\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 142);\n\n(iv) whether the disputed actions are attributable to Bangladesh (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 148).\n\n93.\n\nBy contrast and contrary to Bangladesh\u2019s contention at the Hearing, the Tribunal did finally determine in the Decision on Jurisdiction \"1) that there was an investment by Saipem; and 2) that the present dispute arises directly out of such investment\" (Tr. Ill 47:3-6). Indeed, these matters were determinative of the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n94.\n\nWith respect to the other challenges made by Bangladesh in respect to the Decision on Jurisdiction (see in particular Rejoinder \u00b6 90), the Tribunal has found no indication on record likely to change the findings made and the conclusions reached in the Decision on Jurisdiction, assuming it had the power to make such a change.\n\n**1.3 Applicable law(s)**\n-------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe present proceedings are brought on the basis of the \"Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Italy and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\" of 20 March 1990 (the \"BIT\"), which entered into force on 20 September 1994 (Exh. C-1).\n\n96.\n\nSpecifically, Saipem relies upon the protection afforded by Article 5 of the BIT, which reads as follows:\n\nArticle 5\n\nNationalization or Expropriation\n\n(1) The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment, save where specifically provided by law and by judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be directly or indirectly nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having similar effects in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes, or national interest, against immediate full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.\n\n(3) The just compensation shall be equivalent to the real market value of the investment immediately prior to the moment in which the decision to nationalize or expropriate is announced or made public, and shall be calculated according to internationally acknowledged evaluation standards.\n\nWhenever there are difficulties in ascertaining the market value, the compensation shall be calculated on the basis of a fair appraisal of the establishment's constitutive and distinctive elements as well as of the firm's activities components and results. Compensation shall include interest calculated on a six-month LIBOR basis accruing from the date of nationalization or expropriation to the date of payment. In the event of failure to reach an agreement between the investor and the Contracting Party having liability, the amount of the compensation shall be calculated following the settlement of dispute procedure provided by Article 9 of this Agreement.\n\nOnce the compensation has been determined, it shall be paid promptly and authorization for its repatriation in convertible currency issued.\n\n97.\n\nAs already mentioned in the Decision of Jurisdiction, Article 9(1) of the BIT contemplates the possibility of recourse to the jurisdiction of ICSID with respect to\n\nAny disputes arising between a Contracting Party and the investors of the other, relating to compensation for expropriation, nationalization, requisition or similar measures including disputes relating to the amount of the relevant payments [...]\n\n98.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides the following choice of law rules:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n99.\n\nSince Saipem\u2019s claim is based on Article 5 of the BIT, the Tribunal will primarily apply the BIT as the applicable rule of international law. The Tribunal will also apply the general rules of international law that may be applicable, either because an issue of international law is not directly dealt with in the BIT or, if necessary, to interpret the BIT. Pursuant to Article 12(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal will also apply general international law where it may provide a more favourable solution than the one arising from the BIT:\n\nWhenever any issue is governed both by this Agreement and by another International Agreement to which both the Contracting Parties are parties, or whenever it is governed otherwise by general international law, the most favourable provisions, case by case, shall be applied to the Contracting Parties and to their investors.\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, national Bangladeshi law may also come into play in the present arbitration, in particular when Article 5 of the BIT itself refers to national law.\n\n101.\n\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal wishes to point out that it is undisputed that the ICC Arbitration was governed by the arbitration law of Bangladesh, the latter being the country of the seat of the arbitration.\n\n**1.4 Are the alleged mistakes contained in the ICC Award relevant?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nSaipem summarizes its case by indicating that the dispute before this Tribunal relates to the expropriation by Bangladesh of *(i)* its right to arbitration of its disputes with Petrobangla; *(ii)* the right to payment of the amounts due under the Contract as ascertained in the ICC Award; *(iii)* the rights arising under the ICC Award, including the right to obtain its recognition and enforcement in Bangladesh and abroad; and therefore *(iv)* the residual value of its investment in Bangladesh at the time of the ICC Award, consisting of its credits under the Contract. All these matters are facets of the same issue. The focus of the Claimant's case is that its right to payment under the Contract as ascertained by, and incorporated in, the ICC Award has been expropriated by the unlawful decisions of the Bangladeshi courts that revoked the authority of the ICC arbitrators and declared the ICC Award null and void, thus precluding its enforcement in Bangladesh or elsewhere. The net result of all this was, obviously, to deprive the Claimant of the compensation for [the expropriation of] its investment.\n\n(Reply, p. 8/9,  \u00b634)\n\n103.\n\nIt is Saipem\u2019s position that the dispute before this Tribunal is not concerned with the performance of the Contract nor with the conduct of the ICC Arbitration, but exclusively with the illegal interference of Petrobangla and of the courts of Bangladesh with the ICC Arbitration process and Award. Accordingly, Saipem argues that only the facts relating to this interference have a bearing in the present context and that \"the Tribunal here is called upon simply to take the Award as a given\" (RPN I,  p.  4 ; Tr. II 87:11-13).\n\n104.\n\nOn the other hand, in its written and oral submissions, Bangladesh argues that the ICC Tribunal acted wrongfully and that the ICC Award is \"clearly wrong\" and/or \"outside the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\", in particular as it misunderstood the implications of the Compromise. In substance, Bangladesh contends that\n\n[i]n respect of the claim for Additional Compensation, the ICC Tribunal [...] completely failed to properly consider the effect of this correspondence which established the Compromise as stated above. Further it failed to consider the impact of the Compromise upon the sums paid by Petrobangla to Saipem. Finally it failed in its deliberations to note and give effect to the *ad hoc* arbitration agreement contained therein. Indeed by so doing the ICC Tribunal went outside the scope of the arbitration agreement in the Pipeline Contract and had no jurisdiction to deal with the sum payable under the Compromise. This would have been another ground for revoking the authority of the arbitrators.\n\nIt should also be noted that as far as this claim is concerned the ICC Tribunal proceeded on the basis that there was an agreement between the parties in the sum of US$14 million. As stated above this is clearly wrong.\n\nThe Terms of Reference shows [s/c] clearly that there was no issue to be decided by the Tribunal as to whether Saipem or Petrobangla were responsible for the delay and whether the compensation paid to Saipem was unconditionally due under the Compromise to Saipem.\n\nIn respect of the other three claims found by the ICC Tribunal, no issue was raised as to why they were not paid except that in respect of the claim for the progress payments, it mentioned the injunction granted by the Bangladeshi court. Further, no findings were made as to the reason why Petrobangla did not make those payments except, as stated above, the injunction was mentioned in passing in dealing with the progress payments.\n\nTherefore, the ICC Tribunal did not go into the issue of why the payments were not made by Petrobangla.\n\n(Rejoinder, pp. 16-17,  \u00b6\u00b651-53, references omitted)\n\n105.\n\nAs already mentioned, it clearly appears from the Terms of Reference (Exh. R-70) and the ICC Award (Exh. C-6) (see above \u00b6 26), a copy of which was redistributed by Saipem at the Hearing, that the parties submitted the entire dispute to the ICC Tribunal, including the performance or non-performance of the so-called Compromise (Tr. II 14:10-15:15 and IV 6:7-7:16).\n\n106.\n\nMoreover, and most importantly, Petrobangla did not request (and the courts of Bangladesh did not order) the revocation of the ICC Tribunal\u2019s authority on these grounds. The revocation took place well before the issuance of the ICC Award. According to Bangladesh\u2019s own position, the request for revocation was due to the alleged misconduct by the Tribunal in the course of the arbitration:\n\nDuring the ICC proceedings, Petrobangla, raised certain objections before the ICC Tribunal regarding the conduct of the proceedings [...]. These objections being largely unsuccessful and fearing injustice, Petrobangla then approached the Courts of Bangladesh seeking revocation of the ICC Tribunal\u2019s authority under Section 5 of the Arbitration Act 1940.\n\n(Rejoinder, p. 17,  \u00b654, emphasis added)\n\n107.\n\nIndeed, the Revocation Decision, which was taken in the course of the arbitration well before the Award was rendered, was based on procedural grounds solely (see above, \u00b6 40). Likewise, the decision of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of 21 April 2004 stated that \"there is no Award in the eye of the law\" was exclusively based on the ground that \"it appears that the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to proceed with the Arbitration Case No. 7934/CK/AER/ACS/MS has been revoked on 5.4.2000\" (see above, 50). It did not make any reference to alleged deficiencies in the ICC Award in connection with the scope of its jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute.\n\n108.\n\nFor these reasons, the fact that some of the findings of the ICC Award \"would have been another ground for revoking the authority of the arbitrators\" (Rejoinder,  p.  16,  \u00b6  51) as well as the facts developed in paragraphs 15 to 34 of the Rejoinder (see above 23) are not directly relevant to determine whether the intervention of the courts was lawful.\n\n109.\n\nBangladesh further argues that Saipem\u2019s case \"assumes the validity of the ICC Award, which the Respondent strongly disputes\" (Rejoinder,  p.  25,  \u00b6  82 : Bangladesh had developed this argument in order to show that the ICC Award was not an investment). This argument echoes Bangladesh\u2019s position at the jurisdictional stage that\n\nSaipem is asking the ICSID tribunal to rubberstamp the ICC award, thereby converting it into an ICSID award, in order to bypass the correct method of enforcement of an ICC award. Saipem is thereby trying to take advantage of:\n\n(1) the more favourable means of enforcement of an ICSID award;\n\n(2) trying to have a second attempt at enforcing the ICC award;\n\n(3) trying to mutate the Dhaka-ICC arbitration mechanism into a delocalised one to avoid any potential domestic Bangladesh annulment proceedings.\n\n(Counter-Memorial, p. 59)\n\n110.\n\nAs already stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal understands Saipem\u2019s case to be that Bangladesh frustrated its rights by unlawfully interfering in the arbitration process. The fact that the reparation claimed in this arbitration is by and large equivalent to the amounts awarded in the ICC Arbitration, does not in and of itself mean that this Tribunal would \"enforce\" the ICC Award in the event of a treaty breach.\n\n**1.5 Evidentiary issues**\n--------------------------\n\n***1.5.1 Press clippings attached to Mr. Nassuato\u2019s*** **WS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Tribunal decided that \"the admissibility of the press clippings [attached to Mr. Nassuato\u2019s WS] [would] be dealt with in the award (Tr. IV 124:20-21). The issue will be addressed below when discussing Mr. Nassuato\u2019s testimony.\n\n***1.5.2 Burden and standard of proof***\n----------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), the Tribunal has full discretion in assessing the probative value of the evidence before it.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Bangladesh\u2019s position, based *inter alia* on *Tradex* v. *Albania12,* that \"[t]he burden rests upon Saipem to prove the necessary elements of its claim\" (Tr. Ill 50:11-121). It is a well-established rule In International adjudication that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact, whether it is the claimant or the respondent13. Indeed, Saipem did not take issue with this rule.\n\n*Tradex Hellas SA v. Albania,* ICSID No. ARB/94/2 Award of 29 April 1999, at \u00b6\u00b675, 91, 112 and 197.\n\n*Feldman* v. *Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 177; *Soufraki* v. *UAE,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 81; *Thunderbird* v. *Mexico* (UNCITRAL), Award, 26 January 2006, \u00b6 95; *Saipem* v. *Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 March 2007, \u00b6 83. See also the ICJ in: *Case concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals, (Mexico* v. **United States of America),** Judgment, 31 March 2004, ICJ Reports 2004, p. 41, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57; *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua* v. **United States of America),** Judgment, 26 November 1984, ICJ Reports 1984, p. 437, \u00b6 101, See also Article 24(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n114.\n\nWith respect to the standard of proof, it is Bangladesh\u2019s submission \"that the standard of proof is proof on a balance of probabilities\" (Rejoinder p. 21,  \u00b6  69), being understood that \"the standard for criminal acts, such as conspiracy and collusion of State judiciary, will be held to a higher standard [...] namely beyond reasonable doubt\" *(Id.* p. 33  \u00b6  107). Saipem did not dispute this submission. The Tribunal will dispense with making a final ruling on the allegedly more stringent standard to prove conspiracy and/or collusion, since such a finding is not necessary in the present context.\n\n**1.6 Uncontroversial matters and issues**\n------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nIt Is undisputed, and rightly so, that (I) the parties have freely agreed to the choice of Dhaka as the seat of the ICC Arbitration, (ii) Bangladeshi arbitration law is thus applicable to the arbitration, and (iii) as a matter of principle, the courts of Bangladesh have supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration.\n\n116.\n\nThe primary issue in the present arbitration is whether the intervention of the courts of Bangladesh remained within the limits of their supervisory jurisdiction and whether that intervention amounted to an expropriation (see below Section 2).\n\n117.\n\nTo answer this question in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal will have to address the following main sub-issues:\n\n(i) Did Bangladesh\u2019s actions meet the general conditions of an expropriation (see below Section 2.1)?\n\n(ii) Are the disputed actions of the courts of Bangladesh illegal (see below Section 2.2)?\n\n(iii) Did Saipem have to exhaust local remedies (see below Section 2.3)?\n\n(iv) Did Saipem accept the risk of the revocation of the arbitrators\u2019 authority by agreeing to Dhaka as the seat of the arbitration (see below Section 2.4)?\n\n(v) Are the disputed actions attributable to Bangladesh (see below Section 2.5)?\n\n118.\n\nShould the Panel find that the actions of the courts of Bangladesh constitute an illegal expropriation, the Tribunal will have then to determine the following additional issues:\n\n(i) What is the amount of the compensation due (see below Section 3)?\n\n(ii) Is there a causative link between the damages claimed by Saipem and the expropriation (see below Section 4)?\n\n119.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal will have to rule on costs (see below Section 5).\n\n**2. DO THE DISPUTED ACTIONS CONSTITUTE AN \"EXPROPRIATION\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nIt Is Saipem\u2019s case that the disputed actions amount to an expropriation without compensation of Saipem's rights to arbitration and to the Award, in violation of Article 5 of the BIT. More particularly Saipem contends that it is deprived of\n\n(i) its right to arbitration of its disputes with Petrobangla; (\u00a1\u00a1) the right to payment of the amounts due under the Contract as ascertained in the ICC Award; (\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1) the rights arising under the ICC Award, including the right to obtain its recognition and enforcement in Bangladesh and abroad; and therefore (iv) the residual value of its investment in Bangladesh at the time of the ICC Award, consisting of its credits under the Contract. All these matters are facets of the same issue. The focus of the Claimant's case is that its right to payment under the Contract as ascertained by, and incorporated in, the ICC Award has been expropriated by the unlawful decisions of the Bangladeshi Courts that revoked the authority of the ICC arbitrators and declared the ICC Award null and void, thus precluding its enforcement in Bangladesh or elsewhere. The net result of all this was, obviously, to deprive the Claimant of the compensation for its investment.\n\n121.\n\nUpon a direct question by the Tribunal at the Hearing, Saipem confirmed that its \"claim is for expropriation\" (Tr. II 136:12), although several references were made to fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice in the course of the proceedings. It explained that\n\nSaipem does consider that the misconduct of the domestic courts did also amount to a denial of justice, at least in the form of a \"Prevention from arbitrating\", or, \"Obstruction of the agreed mechanism for the settlement of the disputes arising from the contract\".\n\nHowever, Article 9.1 of the BIT does not confer to your Tribunal jurisdiction over a claim based on denial of justice, and restricts your jurisdiction to a claim for expropriation. This is why we did not bring a claim on the ground of denial of justice before you.\n\nSecond, Saipem does equally consider that through the misbehaviours of Petrobangla (a State organ) and its courts, Bangladesh has certainly, according to us, undoubtedly treated Saipem unfairly and inequitably, and in a manner that is below the standard required by international law. However, again, Article 9.1 of the BIT does not confer to your Tribunal jurisdiction over a claim based on breach of the standard of treatment, in particular of the fair and equitable treatment, restricts your jurisdiction to expropriation.\n\n(Tr. IV 18:25-19:23)\n\n122.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal has already held that the right to arbitrate and the rights determined by the Award are capable in theory of being expropriated. It added that \"whether or not Petrobangla and the courts of Bangladesh actually breached the guarantees of the BIT is a question to be determined with the merits of the dispute\".\n\n123.\n\nTo answer this question, the Tribunal will first set out the general conditions of expropriation (2.1) and then discuss the problematic conditions in the present case, *i.e.,* the so-called illegality of the expropriation (2.2), the need to exhaust local remedies (2.3), and whether Saipem had accepted the risk of revocation of the arbitrators\u2019 authority by agreeing to Dhaka as the seat of the arbitration (2.4). Finally, the Tribunal will discuss whether the exproriatory act can be attributed to Bangladesh and thus engage Bangladesh's responsibility under the BIT (2.5).\n\n**2.1 The general conditions of expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nIn its relevant parts, Article 5 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 5\n\nNationalization or Expropriation\n\n(1) The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment, save where specifically provided by law and by judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be directly or indirectly nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having similar effects in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes, or national interest, against immediate full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.\n\n125.\n\nIn other words, the guarantee against expropriation of Article 5(2) only comes into play if (i) there is an expropriation and (\u00a1\u00a1) that expropriation is not justified by \"public purposes\" or \"national interest\", does not conform to \"all legal provisions and procedures\", is not adequately compensated, or is discriminatory.\n\n126.\n\nIn the present case, the debate has hinged upon the existence of an expropriation in the meaning of the BIT. It has not focused on the conditions of a lawful or admissible expropriation. In particular, Bangladesh did not claim that the intervention of the local courts was driven by public purposes or national interest, and it is common ground that no compensation was paid. Hence, the question that the Tribunal must answer is whether the disputed actions constitute an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT. This presupposes that \"property\" has been \"taken\" by the State.\n\n127.\n\nIt is Saipem\u2019s position that \"an illegal action of the judiciary which has the effect of depriving an investor of its contractual or vested rights constitutes an expropriation which engages the State\u2019s international responsibility\" (SoC.,  p.  52,  \u00b6  196). This position relies on the presently prevailing view pursuant to which any interference with the exercise of property (or \"expropriable\" rights), however defined, can amount to an expropriation, including indirect and *de facto* expropriation, provided that the deprivation is irreversible (see the authorities quoted in SoC.,  pp.  61-65,  \u00b6\u00b6  230-244).\n\n128.\n\nTurning first to the identification of the property at stake, the Tribunal considers that the allegedly expropriated property is Saipem\u2019s residual contractual rights under the investment as crystallised in the ICC Award (see Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127). Bangladesh has not put forward convincing arguments that such rights should not be considered expropriable rights.\n\n129.\n\nIn respect of the taking, the actions of the Bangladeshi courts do not constitute an instance of direct expropriation, but rather of \"measures having similar effects\" within the meaning of Article 5(2) of the BIT. Such actions resulted in substantially depriving Saipem of the benefit of the ICC Award. This is plain in light of the decision of the Bangladeshi Supreme Court that the ICC Award is \"a nullity\". Such a ruling is tantamount to a taking of the residual contractual rights arising from the investments as crystallised in the ICC Award. As such, it amounts to an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n130.\n\nIt is true that one could object - Bangladesh did not - that in theory Saipem can still benefit from the ICC Award (or from the ICC arbitration agreement). Yet, Bangladesh itself acknowledges that Petrobangla has \"no assets outside Bangladesh\" (Counter-Memorial,  \u00b6  5.24,  p.  65). Hence, the perspective that the ICC Award could possibly be enforced under the New York Convention outside Bangladesh despite having been declared \"a nullity\" by the Bangladeshi courts has no realistic basis. Because, by the Respondent's own admission, the ICC Award could not be enforced outside Bangladesh, the intervention of the Bangladeshi courts culminating in the declaration of the Supreme Court that the ICC Award was \"non-existent\" substantially deprived Saipem of its rights and thus qualifies as a taking.\n\n131.\n\nIn contrast to the actions of the courts, the conduct of Petrobangla does not qualify as a \"taking\". Indeed, it is generally accepted that an act must be governmental in nature to constitute an expropriation. In other words, only acts of the government that cannot be performed by private parties can constitute an expropriation14. In the present case, it is undisputable that Petrobangla did not act in a governmental capacity in connection with the ICC proceedings. Therefore, Petrobangla\u2019s actions in the course of the ICC proceedings, whether justified or not, cannot amount to an expropriation.\n\n*See* for instance *Consortium R.F.C.C.* v. *Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award, 22 December 2003, available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/ConsortiumRFCC-Award\\_000.pdf.; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Republic of the Philippines* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, 8 ICSID Reports 518,\u00a0\u00b6 161; *Waste Management, Inc.* v. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, 43 ILM (2004) 967, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175; *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, 12 ICSID Reports 245, \u00b6 281\n\n132.\n\nAs a result, the only actions at stake in the present arbitration are those of the courts of Bangladesh. The parties\u2019 main disagreement with respect to these actions revolves around two questions, *i.e.,* whether the disputed actions were \"illegal\" (2.2) and whether they were \"irreversible\" (2.3).\n\n**2.2 Are the disputed actions illegal?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that according to the so-called \"sole effects doctrine\", the most significant criterion to determine whether the disputed actions amount to indirect expropriation or are tantamount to expropriation is the impact of the measure. As a matter of principle, case law considers that there is expropriation if the deprivation is substantial15, as it is in the present case (see above \u00b6\u00b6 129). That said, given the very peculiar circumstances of the present interference, the Tribunal agrees with the parties that the substantial deprivation of Saipem\u2019s ability to enjoy the benefits of the ICC Award is not sufficient to conclude that the Bangladeshi courts\u2019 intervention is tantamount to an expropriation. If this were true, any setting aside of an award could then found a claim for expropriation, even if the setting aside was ordered by the competent state court upon legitimate grounds.\n\n*See* for instance *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A.* v. *Republic of Costa Rica* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000, 5 ICSID Reports 153, at 77-78.\n\n134.\n\nIn effect, both parties consider that the actions of (or the actions attributable to) Bangladesh must be \"illegal\" in order to give rise to a claim of expropriation. They have devoted a major part of their submissions to the issue of illegality. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that the following analysis should not be understood as a departure from the \"sole effects doctrine\". It is due to the particular circumstances of this dispute and to the manner in which the parties have pleaded their case, both being in agreement that the unlawful character of the actions was a necessary condition.\n\n135.\n\nIt is Saipem\u2019s case that several illegal acts were performed by Petrobangla, and/or by the courts of Bangladesh, and/or as the result of collusion between Petrobangla and the courts. Having held that Petrobangla\u2019s actions did not involve the exercise of governmental authority, the Tribunal will limit its enquiry to the acts of the Bangladeshi courts.\n\n136.\n\nSaipem submits that the intervention of the courts with respect to the revocation of the arbitrators, was unlawful for two main reasons: the courts lacked jurisdiction to revoke the authority of the ICC Tribunal (2.2.1), and they decided the revocation on spurious grounds (Tr. IV 45:13-18) (2.2.2). The decision of the Supreme Court declaring the award inexistent \"built on an earlier patent and very serious illegality which would have been very easy to ascertain, thereby further compounding the illegality of the conduct of the judiciary as a whole\" (SoC.  p.  29,  \u00b6  117) (2.2.3).\n\n***2.2.1 The courts\u2019 jurisdiction to revoke the authority of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nAccording to Saipem, the first reason why the courts\u2019 intervention leading to the revocation of the ICC Tribunal was illegal is that the courts of Bangladesh violated the fundamental principle of party autonomy by asserting jurisdiction over the revocation (Tr. II 96:25-97:1)16.\n\n*See* also Reply, p. 12,  \u00b6\u00b641-42 : the \"scandalous decision of 5 April 2000 which revoked the ICC Tribunal's authority\" is \"plainly illegal under the principles of international arbitration, *the agreement of the parties* and Bangladeshi law itself\u2019 (emphasis added).\n\n138.\n\nAs already mentioned, it is undisputable that Article 2.8 of the ICC Rules required the parties to the arbitration to resort to the ICC for matters of revocation. That said, while binding on the parties, the ICC Rules are not binding upon national courts. Hence, the Tribunal fails to see how the assertion of jurisdiction by the courts of Bangladesh can be deemed illegal on this ground. Indeed, it is generally accepted that national arbitration law can provide for a solution which is different from the ICC Rules. For instance, as mentioned by both parties, Dutch arbitration law provides that the local courts have mandatory jurisdiction over a challenge and revocation of the authority of arbitrators and no one would think of claiming that the courts of the Netherlands breach international law by asserting jurisdiction over a request to challenge or revoke an ICC arbitrator.\n\n139.\n\nAnother question is whether the intervention of the courts of Bangladesh may be regarded as illegal because the courts did not have jurisdiction under the Bangladeshi Arbitration Act of 1940 (BAA). Article 5 BAA, which is the pertinent provision, reads as follows:\n\nThe authority of the appointed Arbitrator or umpire shall not be revocable except by leave of the court, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement.\n\n140.\n\nThe parties disagree on the interpretation of this provision and in particular on the meaning of the phrase \"unless a contrary intention is expressed\". Saipem asserts that \"a contrary intention is the one to confer jurisdiction on this matter to the body that the parties have chosen [here the ICC Court of arbitration]\" (Tr. II 97:13-16). By contrast, Bangladesh posits that \"the \u2018unless\u2019 provision would only apply to give the concurrent jurisdiction to someone else\" but \"would not exclude the jurisdiction of the Bangladesh courts\" (Tr. Ill 165:3-8). In other words, Saipem views the authority of the ICC Court as exclusive, while Bangladesh considers it to be concurrent with the jurisdiction of the courts at the seat of the arbitration.\n\n141.\n\nAt the Hearing, Saipem argued that even if the jurisdiction of the local courts is concurrent with the one of the ICC Court, as submitted by Bangladesh, \"the[ir] supervisory role is subsidiary, *i.e.,* it can be exercised only after the contractually agreed method has been exhausted\". According to Saipem, the exclusion of the recourse to the ICC Court of Arbitration - as it exists for instance under Dutch law -constitutes an exception to the paramount principle of party autonomy and thus needs to be \"spelled out clearly by the law\", which is not the case of Bangladeshi law (RPN II,  HIT  13-14, Tr. IV 42:17-25)17.\n\n*See* also SoC., p. 30,  \u00b6123.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal is sympathetic towards Saipem\u2019s position, in particular in light of the emphasis that the courts of Bangladesh usually put on party autonomy when dealing with arbitration in general and with challenges of arbitrators in particular. Indeed, as correctly pointed out by Saipem, the precedent quoted by Bangladesh in these proceedings seems to confirm that Bangladeshi courts acknowledge the principle of sanctity of contract including when it comes to disqualifying an arbitrator18.\n\n*See* for instance *Bhuwalaka* v. *Fathebobant,* attached to Mr. Razzaq\u2019s supplementary statement, in particular the passage at. p. 294, also restated in Reply, **\u00b6** 72, p. 20).\n\n143.\n\nThat said, Bangladesh is right that the interpretation of Article 5 BAA is a matter of Bangladeshi law and that Saipem has produced no expert opinion to rebut Mr. Razzaq\u2019s expert evidence pursuant to which19:\n\nThe Arbitration Act 1940 applies when the seat of arbitration is in Bangladesh. [...]\n\n[...] if in an arbitration proceeding taking place in Bangladesh under the ICC Rules, it appears to a party that the arbitrators are biased or otherwise guilty of misconduct, he may by an application under section 5 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 seek revocation of his authority. It does not matter whether the arbitration is being conducted according to the Rules of the ICC or any other law and whether parties had failed to specifically mention that the arbitration was to be conducted in accordance with the Act of 1940.\n\n(Legal Opinion on Issues on Bangladeshi Law accompanying Mr. Razzaq\u2019s WS, pp. 16-17,  \u00b6\u00b6 7.2 and 7.5)\n\nNor did Mr. Ahmad under cross-examination depart from his statement that there is an \"option\" to bring the question of the arbitrators\u2019 revocation either before the ICC or before the local courts (Tr. I 252:25-254:5).\n\n144.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that it is not established that the ICC Court\u2019s authority as regards revocation is exclusive under the applicable Bangladeshi law.\n\n**2.2.2** ***The \"merits\" of the courts\u2019 decision to revoke the authority of the arbitrators***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nSaipem further contends that, irrespective of whether the courts of Bangladesh were right in asserting jurisdiction to hear the challenge brought by Petrobangla, they acted in severe contrast with all universally accepted rules regarding international arbitration, the New York Convention and other principles of international law as well as the law of Bangladesh itself. Both parties accept that it would have been illegal for the Bangladeshi courts to conspire and collude with Petrobangla to sabotage the ICC Arbitration against Saipem (a). The Tribunal considers that, among the general principles of law that come into play, the principle of the prohibition of abuse of rights deserves special attention in the present instance (b). It will also discuss the merits of the court\u2019s decision to revoke the authority of the ICC Tribunal under the general principles of international arbitration (c) and the New York Convention (d).\n\n***a) Conspiracy and collusion***\n---------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal needs to deal with Saipem\u2019s allegation that Petrobangla acted in collusion with the Bangladeshi courts and/or conspired with them. The Tribunal notes that Saipem does not point to any specific evidence establishing such conspiracy or collusion. Ultimately, Saipem relies exclusively20 on the following chronology of events (Tr. I 43:6-44:11) :\n\n\u2022 Petrobangla raised its procedural motions at a very precise moment in time, namely between 22 and 25 July 1997. Following the ICC Tribunal\u2019s refusal, Petrobangla reiterated its applications on 26 August 1997.\n\n\u2022 The ICC Tribunal rejected these once again on 21 September 1997.\n\n\u2022 Less than two months later, on 16 November 1997, Petrobangla resorted to the local courts claiming misconduct and requesting a stay of the arbitration and/or the revocation of the arbitrators.\n\n\u2022 About one week later, Petrobangla obtained an injunction based on arbitral misconduct.\n\nAt the beginning of the Hearing, Saipem stated that it had \"several proofs, or at least strong indications [of collusion and conspiracy between Petrobangla and the courts]\". In addition to the \"chronology and timing\" discussed in this paragraph, Saipem evoked \"the absolute innocence of the Tribunal, [...] the lack of jurisdiction of the local judiciary [and] the[ir] biased conduct\" (Tr. I 43:20-44:5). It is unclear how these allegations can establish more than the mere fact that the courts were wrong.\n\n147.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this chronology only indicates that there is an obvious nexus between Petrobangla\u2019s dissatisfaction with the ICC Arbitration and its actions before the Bangladeshi courts. The fact that the Bangladeshi courts eventually ruled in favour of Petrobangla does not in and of itself constitute evidence of conspiracy or collusion. After all, as convincingly pointed out by Bangladesh, the courts refused the orders sought by Petrobangla on at least two occasions (Counter-Memorial,  \u00b6 2.81,  p.  39). In fact, at the end of the Hearing, Saipem was merely \"inclined to believe that there were both conspiracy and collusion\" (Tr. IV 27:13-15).\n\n148.\n\nIn conclusion, irrespective of the applicable standard of proof (see above \u00b6 114), the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Bangladeshi courts acted in collusion or conspired with Petrobangla.\n\n***b) Abuse of right***\n-----------------------\n\n149.\n\nSaipem argues that international law requires state courts to abide by \"generally accepted standards of the administration of justice\" and that \"grossly unfair [...] arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic\" court rulings constitute a violation of international law (SoC. pp. 54-55,  \u00b6\u00b6  207-209). Saipem has referred to a convincing line of cases and doctrinal opinions21 that confirm the emergence of such a general principle.\n\nIncluding in particular S. M. Schwebel, Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Arbitration: An Overview, in Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Arbitration (E. Gaillard, editor), IAI (International Arbitration Institute) Series on International Arbitration, no. 2, Juris Publishing, 2004; also E. Gaillard, L'interf\u00e9rence des juridictions du si\u00e8ge dans le d\u00e9roulement de l'arbitrage, in Liber Amicorum Claude Raymond, Paris 2004, p. 91; *Salini Costruttori Sp.A* v. *The Federal Republic of Ethiopia* (ICC Case No. 10623/AER/ACS), Award regarding the suspension of the proceedings and jurisdiction of 7 December 2001, 42 ILM 609 (2003) and 21 ASA Bulletin 82 (2003), \u00b6\u00b6 130-131.\n\n150.\n\nBangladesh did not contest being under such an international obligation but rather asserted that \"Saipem must prove on the facts that there was a \u2018clear and malicious misapplication of the law\u2019\" by the Bangladeshi courts (see for instance HPN  \u00b6  33) or, in other words, that Saipem has the burden \"to prove that the decision was manifestly abusive\" (Tr. Ill 83:14-15) \"to achieve an internationally unlawful end, such that the courts themselves are to be disavowed at international level\" (Tr. Ill 103:12-20).\n\n151.\n\nIt is Saipem\u2019s submission that the Revocation Decision violates international law as it applied a spurious standard (Tr. IV 121:11-122:2) and was rendered \"without making any proper investigation whether Petrobangla\u2019s accusation were founded\" (Tr. IV 24:18-22).\n\n152.\n\nThe analysis of the Revocation Decision shows that Petrobangla\u2019s counsel argued that the ICC Tribunal had \"committed manifest error of law\" that \"would detract from the fairness of the procedure\" (Exh. C-11. p. 22) and that the judge explicitly held that the ICC Tribunal had \"manifestly committed in disregard to [s/c] the law and as such the tribunal committed misconduct\" (Exh. C-11. p. 23). Specifically, the High Court of Dhaka was based on the ICC Tribunal\u2019s rejection of four of the procedural motions of Petrobangla referred to above (see above \u00b6 31):\n\n(i) Petrobangla\u2019s request \"for excluding from the record the witness statement of [Mr.] J.R. Clark on the ground that he would not be produced before the Tribunal for cross-examination\" (Exh. C-11,  p.  6), which request was rejected by the ICC Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 22 July 1997 (reproduced at \u00b6 48 of the ICC Award, Exh C-6,  pp.  19-20).\n\n(ii) Petrobangla\u2019s request \"that the Draft Aide Memoire of the World Bank and the appropriate calculations of costs and expenses [contained therein] may not be treated as part of the evidence in the proceeding\" because it was not \"proved by any witness\" and did not fall \"within the category of documentary evidence which does not require for a man proof\u2019 (Exh. C-11,  pp.  7-8), which request was denied by the ICC Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 26 July 1997 (reproduced at \u00b6 49 of the ICC Award, Exh C-6,  p. 20).\n\n(iii) Petrobangla\u2019s request to hear some questions regarding the insurance policy (Exh. C-11,  p.  8), which request was denied by the ICC Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 21 September 1997 (reproduced at \u00b6 53 of the ICC Award, Exh. C-6,  p.  22).\n\n(iv) Petrobangla\u2019s request that \"written transcripts of the evidence\" be taken during the hearing (Exh. C-11,  pp.  8-9), which request was denied by the ICC Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 28 July 1997 (reproduced at \u00b6 50 of the ICC Award, Exh. C- 6, pp. 21-22).\n\n153.\n\nIt is Saipem\u2019s position that the Revocation Decision is unacceptable under international law since the ICC Tribunal's procedural orders denying Petrobangla\u2019s objections \"were perfectly well reasoned and entirely justified in the light of the facts of the case and of international arbitration rules and practice\" (Reply, p. 10,  \u00b6  39).\n\n154.\n\nIt is clear from the wording of the Revocation Decision that Saipem made extensive submissions to the Bangladeshi court to show that the ICC \"arbitrators have acted within their jurisdiction and also in a correct manner\" (Exh. C-11, pp. 10-15 and 19-21, in particular 11).\n\n155.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the procedural orders referred to in the Revocation Decision as the cause of the ICC Tribunal\u2019s misconduct, the Tribunal did not find the slightest trace of error or wrongdoing. Under these circumstances, the finding of the Court that the arbitrators \"committed misconduct\" lacks any justification. As emphasized by Saipem at the Hearing, if one carefully studies the Revocation Decision of 2 April 2000, one fails to see any reference whatsoever to the law that was allegedly \"manifestly] disregarded]\". By way of consequence, it is unfounded to then infer from such an ill-founded finding of misconduct that \"there is a likelihood of miscarriage of justice\". Equally unfounded is the consequence drawn by the Court when declaring the revocation of the authority of the ICC Tribunal. This declaration can only be viewed as a grossly unfair ruling.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal is reinforced in that conclusion by the fact that Bangladesh does not criticize in these proceedings the conduct of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. As convincingly stressed by Saipem at the Hearing, Bangladesh does not even try to show that the ICC Arbitrators\u2019 conduct was somehow inappropriate, illegitimate or unfair. To the contrary, Bangladesh tries to justify the decision to revoke the authority of the ICC Tribunal exclusively on the ground that the test set forth in Article 5 of the BAA is not stringent and leaves the authority free to extrapolate that the arbitrators may be likely to commit a miscarriage of justice. In none of its submissions in the present arbitration did Bangladesh even attempt to show that the ICC Tribunal committed misconduct and that such alleged misconduct could reasonably justify the revocation of the arbitrators.\n\n157.\n\nFurthermore, inasmuch as the limited contents of the Revocation Decision allow to draw any conclusion as to the reasons of the Court, the Tribunal cannot but agree with Saipem that the judge \"simply took as granted what Petrobangla falsely presented\" (Tr. II 57:12-13).\n\n158.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that there is no indication in the record that the ICC Arbitrators were at any time consulted, let alone heard, by the courts of Bangladesh during the process leading to the decision revoking their authority.\n\n159.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Bangladeshi courts abused their supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration process. It is true that the revocation of an arbitrator\u2019s authority can legitimately be ordered in case of misconduct. It is further true that in making such order national courts do have substantial discretion. However, they cannot use their jurisdiction to revoke arbitrators for reasons wholly unrelated with such misconduct and the risks it carries for the fair resolution of the dispute. Taken together, the standard for revocation used by the Bangladesh courts and the manner in which the judge applied that standard to the facts indeed constituted an abuse of right.\n\n160.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged in international law that a State exercising a right for a purpose that is different from that for which that right was created commits an abuse of rights22. The same principle is expressed in another way by prominent commentators referred to by both parties (Reply, p. 25,  \u00b6  89 and Rejoinder p. 27,  \u00b6  88) :\n\nWe believe that the *lex arbitri* constitutes the primary legal basis for the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement and the arbitrators do not have a discretionary power to disregard injunctions issued by the courts at the seat of the arbitration. To the contrary, they should obey such decision, *unless they are manifestly abusive23.*\n\n*See* for instance Alexandre Kiss, \"Abuse of Rigths\", in Berhadt (Ed), *Encyclopedia of Public International Law,* Vol 1. at 5.\n\nPoudret/Besson, *op. tit.* at \u00b6 80, p. 117 [Exhibit C-1161, emphasis added.\n\n161.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Bangladeshi courts exercised their supervisory jurisdiction for an end which was different from that for which it was instituted and thus violated the internationally accepted principle of prohibition of abuse of rights.\n\n***c) Violation of the principles of international arbitration***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nSaipem contends that \"[t]he illegal decisions of the Bangladeshi judiciary are the most serious violations of general principles of international arbitration\" (Reply, p. 24,  \u00b6  86). That contention is based in particular on the doctrinal writings referred to above, according to which arbitrators are allowed to disregard decisions by the courts having supervisory jurisdiction if their intervention is \"manifestly abusive\"24. Hence, the Tribunal considers that Saipem\u2019s argument does not have an independent bearing in the present arbitration and has already been taken into account in the framework of the prohibition of the abuse of rights.\n\n*Id.*\n\n***d) Violation of the New York Convention?***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nAccording to Saipem, the intervention of the courts of Bangladesh \"amounted purely and simply to a flouting of the arbitration agreement in violation of Bangladesh\u2019s obligation under Article II of the New York Convention\" (SoC. p. 53,  \u00b6  200).\n\n164.\n\nIn response, Bangladesh essentially considers that the New York Convention is not applicable since the arbitration agreement is governed by the Arbitration Act 1940 (Rejoinder, p. 37,  \u00b6  122). At the Hearing, Bangladesh expanded on its argument and posited that the New York Convention does not directly apply to the arbitration since Bangladesh has not yet adopted national legislation incorporating the Convention into national law. Hence, according to Bangladesh, the New York Convention \"just remains a Treaty obligation between States\" (Tr. IV 90:10-13). The Respondent also stated that the New York Convention only deals with the intervention of the courts in respect of the merits of the dispute and expressly reserves the supervisory jurisdiction of Bangladeshi courts (Tr. IV 96:10-17 : see also \u00b6 172 below).\n\n165.\n\nBe this as it may, the Tribunal understands that Bangladesh does not dispute being bound by the New York Convention. The fact that the latter may not be applicable in domestic courts as a matter of national law Is Irrelevant. Indeed, a breach of the Convention would still engage Bangladesh's international responsibility. This is clear from Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides that \"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty\". It also follows from Article 3 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\"), pursuant to which \"[t]he characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law\". Both provisions are declaratory of customary international law.\n\n166.\n\nBangladesh is right that Article 11 (3) of the New York Convention requires courts of member states to refer the parties to arbitration \"when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an [arbitration] agreement\". However, Article 11(1) of the New York Convention imposes on Bangladesh a wider obligation to \"recognize\" arbitration agreements.\n\n167.\n\nBased on that obligation, it is for instance generally acknowledged that the issuance of an anti-arbitration injunction can amount to a violation of the principle embedded in Article II of the New York Convention. One could think that the present case is different, however, from an anti-arbitration injunction25. Technically, the courts of Bangladesh did not target the arbitration or the arbitration agreement in itself, but revoked the authority of the arbitrators. However, it is the Tribunal\u2019s opinion that a decision to revoke the arbitrators\u2019 authority can amount to a violation of Article II of the New York Convention whenever it *de facto* \"prevents or immobilizes the arbitration that seeks to implement that [arbitration] agreement\" thus completely frustrating if not the wording at least the spirit of the Convention26. This is indeed what happened here.\n\nAlong the same lines, one should point out that the Award in *Salini v. Ethiopia* [cited above Fn. 21] relied upon by Saipem relates to a different situation as it concerned an injunction by the local court to stay the arbitration itself (and not a revocation of the arbitrators) and relied only marginally on Article II of the New York Convention.\n\nS. M. Schwebel, Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Arbitration: An Overview, [cited above Fn. 21], pp. 3-4.\n\n168.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that in this case several Bangladeshi courts issued injunctions against the continuation of the ICC Arbitration (see above \u00b6\u00b6 46-47), thus *de facto* frustrating the arbitration agreement.\n\n169.\n\nFinally, one should mention that, as Saipem explicitly admits (RA, p. 10  \u00b644), the arbitration could in theory have been pursued with a new arbitral tribunal. Given the abusive way in which the courts of Bangladesh exercised their supervisory jurisdiction (see above \u00b6\u00b6 149 *et seq.) over* the first ICC Tribunal, the Tribunal finds this perspective unrealistic. There is every likelihood that Saipem would have been exposed to similar risks with a new arbitral tribunal.\n\n***e) Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n170.\n\nIn the light of these developments, the Tribunal concludes that the revocation of the arbitrators\u2019 authority was contrary to international law, in particular to the principle of abuse of rights and the New York Convention.\n\n***2.2.3 The Supreme Court decision declaring the ICC Award \"non-existent\"***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIt Is Saipem\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 21 April 2004 holding that the ICC Award was \"non-existent\" was \"devoid of any legal foundation\" (SoC., 28,  \u00b6  115).\n\n172.\n\nIn reply, Bangladesh argues that \"the Supreme Court had no duty or power under Bangladeshi law [...] to question the correctness of the Revocation case, nor had Saipem invited it to do so\" (Rejoinder,  \u00b6  37,  \u00b6  123). Since it is undisputed that Saipem did not appeal from the decision revoking the arbitrators\u2019 authority, one could argue that the Supreme Court could not disregard that decision. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. As it stated above, the New York Convention is binding upon Bangladesh as a State and Bangladesh would be responsible for any breach of that treaty.\n\n173.\n\nWhile the decision of the Supreme Court may appear understandable under domestic law, the fact remains that under international law it is flawed. Moreover, the fact that Petrobangla felt compelled to bring an action to set aside the ICC Award tends to demonstrate that the Revocation Decision did not finally dispose of the matter. As a matter of common sense, the Tribunal cannot but agree with Saipem that the Supreme Court's decision declaring the ICC Award \"non-existent\" constituted the \"coup de gr\u00e2ce\" given to the arbitral process, thus removing any doubt that might have remained about the effect of the courts' intervention.\n\n**2.3 Did Saipem have to exhaust local remedies?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nIt is undisputed that Saipem did not make use of its right to appeal the two key decisions, *i.e.,* the Revocation Decision (see above \u00b6 42) and the decision of the Supreme Court that the ICC Award was \"non-existent\" (see above \u00b6 51).\n\n175.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention reverses the position existing under traditional international law in that it presumes that States parties to the Convention waive the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies as a condition of consent to international adjudication. Yet, States are entitled to reintroduce such requirement when ratifying the ICSID Convention. In the present case, there is no indication that Bangladesh has elected to require prior exhaustion of local remedies as a precondition to the admissibility of claims according to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n176.\n\nHence, the question that arises is whether the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies which applies as a matter of substance and not procedure in the context of claims for denial of justice, may be applicable here by analogy. In other words, is exhaustion of remedies a substantive requirement of a valid claim for expropriation by actions of the judiciary? If the answer is affirmative, then the further question arises whether the conditions for exhaustion of local remedies are fulfilled in the present case. Because they deal with a substantive component of a treaty breach, these questions must be addressed as part of the merits of the dispute.\n\n177.\n\nIt Is Bangladesh\u2019s submission, that \"the only applicable or appropriate test for determining \u2018wrongful interference\u2019 by State courts is whether there has been a denial of justice\" (Rejoinder,  p. 33,  \u00b6  104). By contrast, Saipem contends that (i) the rule on exhaustion of local remedies does not apply here, and (\u00a1\u00a1) in any event the requirements of that rule are satisfied since Saipem made all reasonable attempts to obtain redress of the illegal decisions before the courts of Bangladesh.\n\n178.\n\nReferring to the decision of the *Loewen* tribunal, Bangladesh contends that local remedies shall be exhausted in any event:\n\nwhether characterized as a denial of justice or as an expropriation where the act which forms the basis of that complaint is a court decision, [...] the local remedies rule undoubtedly applies as a substantive requirement.\n\n(Tr. Ill 138:11-16)\n\n179.\n\nBy contrast, It Is Saipem\u2019s primary27 argument that exhaustion of local remedies does not apply at all in investor-State arbitration. Referring to leading commentators, Saipem argues that this requirement is \"inconsistent with the creation of a right to arbitration by investors directly\", even in cases of denial of justice (Reply, pp. 30-31,  \u00b6\u00b6  108-109)28.\n\nIn support of its position that the requirement does not apply, Saipem contends that the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies should be disregarded in the present proceedings \"because the highest court of Bangladesh had several opportunities to deal with this case, and to set right the wrongs which were committed by the lower courts, in particular in the decision of April 21, 2004\" (Tr. II 113:4-14). The Tribunal disagrees for the already indicated reasons that one fails to see how the Supreme court could act on its own motion failing any appeal/submission by Saipem *(see* above \u00b6 172).\n\nReferring to McLachlan/Shore/Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration,* Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 232-233, submitted as Exh. C-128.\n\n180.\n\nIn support of its position that the requirement does not apply, Saipem contends that \"as a matter of principle, exhaustion of local remedies does not apply in expropriation law\" (Reply, pp.  28-29,  \u00b6  102, quoting *Generation Ukraine* at \u00b6 20.30) and stating that the present case is precisely about expropriation:\n\nFor the Respondent's argument on local remedies to be pertinent, one would therefore have to postulate that an expropriation, albeit one carried out by the courts, and a denial of justice are one and the same illegality.\n\nThis is clearly not the case.\n\nAt least according to the more traditional notions (and leaving aside whether these are pertinent in an investment arbitration context), denial of justice relates as much to the process by which a certain result is reached as to the actual outcome. This explains why it is held by some that regard must be had to the overall functioning of the legal system and to a broad obligation of the State to maintain a functioning system of justice, without focussing on the requirement that justice, and a correct decision, be handed down in each individual case.\n\nThe situation is completely different for expropriation. Here the only issue is the final outcome, i.e. the illegal deprivation of the foreign investor's property, and not the way this was achieved. There is no requirement that the expropriation be carried out in a given way to qualify as illegal. There is no set moment when the expropriation becomes illegal. In particular, the BIT does not set any temporal or procedural requirement for there to be an expropriation. Therefore, regard must be had only to the net result, i.e. the taking of property.\n\n(Reply, p. 33,  \u00b6\u00b6116-118)\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees in substance with Saipem\u2019s analysis. Saipem\u2019s case is one of expropriation (see above \u00b6 121). While the Tribunal concurs with the parties that expropriation by the courts presupposes that the courts' intervention was illegal, this does not mean that expropriation by a court necessarily presupposes a denial of justice. Accordingly, it tends to consider that exhaustion of local remedies does not constitute a substantive requirement of a finding of expropriation by a court.\n\n182.\n\nBe this as it may, the Tribunal does not need to make a determination on this issue since it considers that, if the requirement applied, Saipem would be deemed to have satisfied it under the circumstances. The requirement of exhaustion of local remedies imposes on a party to resort only to such remedies as are effective. Parties are not held to \"improbable remedies\"29.\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A.* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award of 18 August 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 399-400 quoting Jan Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law, Cambridge, 2006, p.153-154\n\n183.\n\nIt is undisputed that Saipem had already litigated the issue of the arbitral misconduct for more than two and a half years in front of different courts in Bangladesh before being served with the decision revoking the power of the ICC Tribunal. It can thus be held to have exerted reasonable local remedies, having spent considerable time and money seeking to obtain redress without success although the allegation of misconduct was clearly ill-founded. Requiring it to do more and file appeals would amount to holding it to \"improbable\" remedies. This is even more true knowing that Saipem\u2019s case was precisely that the local courts should never have become involved in the dispute, since the parties had entrusted the ICC Court of Arbitration with the power to revoke the arbitrators\u2019 authority.\n\n184.\n\nUnder these circumstances, there is no need for the Tribunal to assess whether Saipem could reasonably have relied on its perception of hostility to justify its failure to exhaust the local remedies (Tr. Ill 142:6-14). This said, the Tribunal notes that, even without reference to the disputed press clippings, Mr. Galizzi\u2019s testimony on this question at the Hearing was indeed convincing (Tr. I 124:10 ef seq.). On this basis, had it been relevant, it would have been legitimate for Saipem to take any threats to its security into account when deciding whether or not to appeal from the two disputed court decisions.\n\n**2.4 Did Saipem accept the risk of the revocation of the arbitrator by agreeing to Dhaka as the seat of the arbitration?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn its initial submission, Bangladesh seemed to argue that the interference of the local courts was not illegal because, as a result of the parties' choice of Dhaka as the seat of the ICC Arbitration, Saipem had accepted the risk of interference by the local courts.\n\n186.\n\nAs Saipem stressed, such an argument is self-serving. It can not be disputed that \"the supervision of the courts of the seat must be exercised in good faith, in accordance with the rule of law, and with generally accepted principles of international arbitration\" (Tr. II 89:9-12).\n\n187.\n\nThere is no question that, under most legal systems including the Bangladeshi one, by choosing the seat of the arbitration the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts at the seat, which jurisdiction can be exercised in aid and in control of the arbitration process. That submission obviously implies that the courts exercise their jurisdiction to the ends for which it is created and do not abuse their powers. In the present case, it has been established above that the court's intervention was abusive (see above \u00b6\u00b6 149 *et seq.).* Hence, the choice of Dhaka as a seat cannot change the conclusions drawn earlier by the Tribunal.\n\n**2.5 Are the disputed actions attributable to Bangladesh?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nSaipem submits that the expropriation was caused by the combined actions of Petrobangla and the courts of Bangladesh.\n\n189.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that (i) it \"cannot be seriously challenged\" that the Bangladeshi judiciary is part of the State and that the acts committed by it are directly attributable to the State and (\u00a1\u00a1) the attributability of Petrobangla\u2019s acts to the State would be assessed in the merits phase by reference principally to Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC.\n\n190.\n\nIt is self-evident and Bangladesh does not dispute that the courts are \"part of the State\", *i.e.,* an organ of the State in the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles (see Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 143).\n\n191.\n\nWith respect to Petrobangla\u2019s actions, the Tribunal has found no treaty breach. Its actions in the context of the ICC Arbitration were not official acts of the government and hence could not have amounted to an expropriation. As a result, the issue of attribution does not arise in connection with Petrobangla.\n\n**3. Quantum**\n--------------\n\n192.\n\nSaipem argues that the Revocation Decision (and the subsequent decision to declare the ICC Award non-existent) precluded the enforcement of the ICC Award in Bangladesh or elsewhere, thus depriving it of any compensation (see above \u00b6 120). In essence, it thus claims in these proceedings the amount awarded by the ICC Tribunal (3.1 to 3.3) plus interest (3.4).\n\n193.\n\nIn support of its claim, Saipem relies on the standards to determine the amount of compensation set forth in Article 5(1)(3) of the BIT. It is undisputed that according to this provision:\n\n(i) The victim of an expropriation is entitled to a \"just compensation\" equal to \"the real market value of the investment\" and calculated \"according to internationally acknowledged evaluation standards\".\n\n(ii) The date of reference to assess the value of the expropriated investment is the date \"immediately prior to the moment in which the decision to nationalize or expropriate is announced or made public\";\n\n(iii) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the compensation must be paid \"in convertible currency\"; and\n\n(iv) Payment must be made immediately and any delay entails payment of \"interest calculated on a six-month LIBOR basis accruing from the date of nationalization or expropriation to the date of payment\".\n\n(SoC., p. 68,  \u00b6  254)\n\n194.\n\nIn particular, the parties agree on the applicability of \"internationally acknowledged evaluation standards\" (Rejoinder, p. 42,  \u00b6  139).\n\n**3.1 The amount of compensation according to Saipem**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nSaipem asserts that it is entitled to \"full compensation\", i.e., to compensation \"for all damages suffered [...] in order to restore the situation which would have existed in the absence of the illicit act\". Relying on previous expropriation cases30, Saipem further contends that:\n\n[w]hen the expropriation affects intangible property, the standard for compensation is the general principle of *restitutio in integrum,* i.e. an amount of compensation capable of restoring the injured party to the economic situation which this party enjoyed before or in the absence of the injury or expropriation.\n\n(SoC., p. 71,  \u00b6  264)\n\n*See* in particular *Antoine Biloune and Marine Drive Complex* v. *Ghana Investments Centre and Ghana Government,* Award on Damages, Interests and Costs of 30 June 1990, Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XIX (1994), pp. 11-32 and the quoted references.\n\n196.\n\nApplying these principles to the present case, Saipem considers that:\n\nthe calculation of the amount due to the investor is straightforward. Since the expropriation consisted foremost in rendering a perfectly valid arbitral award worthless and unenforceable, the loss suffered by the Claimant at the hands of Bangladesh the measure of the compensation is the amount awarded in the ICC Award plus whatever additional cost or damage incurred as a consequence of the impossibility to enforce the Award immediately.\n\n(SoC., p. 72,  \u00b6  269)\n\nAnd:\n\nThe Tribunal [in the OPIC case *MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company31]* went so far as to decide that *\"non-payment of the arbitral award is a violation of international law'.* It did so relying on the Harvard Draft and on Article II of the New York Convention. This [...] confirms that the award has to be respected by the State and that therefore the quantum of the damage is the entire amount of the Award.\n\n(RPN II,  \u00b6  4)\n\n*MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (formerly CalEnergy Company. Inc)* v. *Indonesia.* Decision of 1 November 1999, reported in Investment Claims - IIC 168 (1999). The Tribunal asked the Parties to comment on, and handed out copies of this case at the hearing.\n\n197.\n\nOn this basis, as mentioned earlier, Saipem claims the amount awarded by the ICC Tribunal32 plus interest33.\n\nSaipem claims that the date of the ICC Award, i.e. 9 May 2003, is relevant for the calculation according to Article 5(3) of the BIT: \"Prior to this date the amount of the investor's credit had not yet been quantified. At the date of the Award the arbitration had already been frustrated by Bangladesh and the Award had been rendered unenforceable by previous judicial decisions even before it was handed down. It is at this moment on that the State measure having the effect of expropriating the investment produced its effects\" (SoC, p. 68, p. 256).\n\nIn its last written submission, Saipem stated that it \"will provide the Tribunal with a detailed and updated calculation of interest and costs soon after the March 2008 hearing\" (Reply, p. 41,  \u00b6150), which it did not do.\n\n**3.2 The amount of compensation according to Bangladesh**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nIt is Bangladesh's submission that:\n\nthe date for assessing compensation (and from which interest will accrue) is the date of the alleged expropriatory act. The real or effective expropriatory act relied upon [by] the Claimant is the revocation of the authority of the arbitrators. The Claimant admitted this position in the Hearing on Jurisdiction. It should be noted that at this time there was no ICC Award.\n\nTherefore it follows that the evaluation of compensation should be made on the basis of what sums remained due under the Pipeline Contract and the Compromise at the date of revocation, 5 April 2000.\n\n(Rejoinder, p. 42,  \u00b6140)\n\n199.\n\nReverting to its arguments on the merits of the contractual dispute, and in particular on the interpretation of the so-called Compromise, Bangladesh submits that the outstanding amount would have to be determined by the sole arbitrator provided in the Compromise, not by the ICC Tribunal. It also argues that the amount so determined could be in favour of Petrobangla rather than Saipem.\n\n200.\n\nMoreover, Bangladesh contends that\n\nIndeed, the exhaustion of local remedies would, if not decisive on the question of a breach of the Treaty itself, later arise for consideration again as part of the causation and mitigation of loss.\n\n(Tr. Ill 139:8-12)\n\n**3.3 The Tribunal\u2019s determination**\n------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nArticle 5(1)(3) of the BIT which describes the just compensation due in case of an expropriation refers to \"the real market value of the investment [...] according to internationally acknowledged evaluation standards\". This provision is not applicable to determine the amount of compensation in the present instance because it sets out the measure of compensation for lawful expropriation which this one is not. Hence, the Tribunal will resort to the relevant principles of customary international law and in particular to the principle set out by the Permanent Court of Justice in the *Chorzow Factory* case:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it34.\n\n*Chorzow Factory case (Merits), Germany v. Poland,* Judgment of the PCIJ of 13 September 1928, PCIJ Series A. Vol 17 at 47 (Exh. C-69).\n\n202.\n\nAfter having carefully reviewed the arguments of the parties and having taken into account all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the fact that the expropriated rights at hand were Saipem\u2019s residual contractual rights under the investment as crystallised in the ICC Award (see above \u00b6 128), the Tribunal considers that in the present case the amount awarded by the ICC Award constitutes the best evaluation of the compensation due under the *Chorzow Factory* principle.\n\n203.\n\nFrom this point of view, Bangladesh\u2019s contention that \"[e]ven if the ICC Award had not been declared to be *non est* on the grounds of revocation of the authority of the ICC Tribunal, there were other valid reasons for annulling the award or for refusing enforcement under Bangladeshi arbitration law and the New York Convention\" (Rejoinder,  p.  39,  \u00b6  132) is unsubstantiated. The same applies to Bangladesh\u2019s arguments concerning the so-called \"Compromise\" (see above \u00b6  23), which, according to Bangladesh, might well have played a role in an application to set aside the award.\n\n204.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the expropriation of the right to arbitrate the dispute in Bangladesh under the ICC Arbitration Rules corresponds to the value of the award rendered without the undue intervention of the court of Bangladesh.\n\n205.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal considers that the amounts claimed in paragraph (iv) and (v) of Saipem\u2019s prayers for relief (/.e., the costs, legal fees and all related expenses incurred by Saipem in relation to the intervention of the Bangladeshi courts and other related costs, as well as interest thereon) are not part of Saipem\u2019s initial investment. Moreover, it is impossible to conclude that Saipem\u2019s costs, legal fees and other expenses in relation to the intervention of the Bangladeshi courts have been the object of an expropriation. It follows that these expenses cannot be part of the reparation for the illegal expropriation for which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.\n\n206.\n\nWith respect to Saipem\u2019s prayers for relief regarding the Warranty Bond, the Tribunal notes that Saipem did not dispute the fact that Petrobangla has withdrawn its letter of 23 June 2003, by which it requested Banque Indosuez Pakistan to pay out on the Warranty Bond. On the face of it, the Warranty Bond was to expire on 30 June 1993. It is not established that it was extended nor, if it was, for how long. Neither is there evidence on record that Petrobangla has or may still obtain payment under the Warranty Bond. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal must conclude that Saipem has not met its burden of proof with respect to this claim.\n\n207.\n\nHence, the Tribunal dismisses the first limb of Saipem\u2019s final request for relief claiming the return and cancellation of the Warranty Bond as well as the second limb of that prayer seeking \"in the event that Petrobangla obtains payment of the Warranty Bond, the amount of the Warranty Bond, plus interest at the BIT Libor Rate from the date at which Saipem will have to pay the amount thereof to the Bank\".\n\n208.\n\nAccordingly, the recommendation issued by the Tribunal on 21 March 2007 (see \u00b6 67 above) will cease to be in effect upon notification of this Award.\n\n**3.4 Interest**\n----------------\n\n209.\n\nSaipem claims interest on the awarded amounts \"at the rate provided for by Article 5 of the BIT, viz. six-month LIBOR from 10 May 2003 to the date of payment\".\n\n210.\n\nIn its final submission, Saipem added that, \"as consistently recognized by ICSID case-law, interest must be compounded to respect the principle of \"full recovery\" set out in Article 38(1) of the ILC Articles\" (Reply,  \u00b6  148, pp. 40-41 referring in particular to ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, *Vivendi Universal v. Argentina,* Award of 20 August 2007) and announced that it \"w[ould] provide the Tribunal with a detailed and updated calculation of interest and costs soon after the March 2008 hearing\" (Reply,  \u00b6  150, p. 41), which it did not do.\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need Saipem\u2019s calculations since the ICC Tribunal has already awarded interest at a rate of 3,375% per annum from 7 June 1993. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Saipem cannot at the same time ask the amount awarded by the ICC Award and interest going beyond that allocated by the ICC arbitrators.\n\n212.\n\nHence, the Tribunal will award simple interest at a rate of 3,375% per annum from 7 June 1993.\n\n**4. Causation**\n----------------\n\n213.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the parties that compensation can only cover losses caused by the acts attributed to the State (see also Article 31(2) of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility).\n\n214.\n\nIt cannot seriously be challenged that the actions of the Bangladeshi courts are the direct cause of the expropriation at issue. Hence, the Tribunal considers that there is a sufficient causative link between the loss assessed above and the breach of Article 5.1 of the BIT by Bangladesh. The same applies to the interest claim.\n\n**5. Costs**\n------------\n\n215.\n\nTaking into consideration all the circumstances of the case and in the exercise of its discretion in cost matters, the Tribunal decides that each party shall bear the expenses which it incurred in connection with the arbitration. The parties shall also bear the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the fees of ICSID, in equal shares.\n\n**V. AWARD**\n------------\n\n216.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following award:\n\n1. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant the sums of USD 5,883,770.80, and USD 265,000.00 and \u20ac 110,995.92 plus interest at a rate of 3,375% per annum from 7 June 1993;\n\n2. The recommendation issued by the Tribunal on 21 March 2007 in connection with the Warranty Bond No. 86/USD/12/92 shall cease to be in effect as of the notification of this Award.\n\n3. The costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the fees of ICSID shall be borne by the parties in equal shares;\n\n4. Each party shall bear the expenses it incurred in connection with the arbitration;\n\n5. All other requests for relief are dismissed."}]}
