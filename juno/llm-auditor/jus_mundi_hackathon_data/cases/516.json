The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\n***The Claimant***, Malicorp Limited (hereinafter the \"Claimant,\" the \"Concessionaire\" or \"Malicorp\"), is a company incorporated on 6 August 1997 and registered with Companies House in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under no. 3415415. Its registered office is at 72 Watling Street, Radlett, Hertfordshire WD7 7NP, United Kingdom. According to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Malicorp Limited of 30 July 1997 (Article 5), its share capital was 1,000 pounds sterling divided into 1,000 shares of one pound sterling each (Exhibit R-1, pp. 2 *et seq.* = R-2, p. 20).\n\n2.\n\n***The Respondent*** is the Arab Republic of Egypt (hereinafter the \"Respondent,\" the \"Grantor\" or the \"Republic\").\n\n**2. General chronology of events**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**2.1. From the call for tenders to the signing of the Contract**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 21 June 1999, the Respondent announced its intention to build the Ras Sudr\u00a0International Airport; it set the conditions that future investors had to satisfy (Exhibit R-2, pp. 28 *et seq*.).\n\n4.\n\nIn August 1999, the Egyptian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, acting on behalf\u00a0of the Republic, launched ***a call for tenders*** for the building of the Ras Sudr Airport on the basis of a \u201cBuild, Operate, Transfer\u201d type concession contract (hereinafter \u201cB.O.T.;\u201d Exhibit R-2, pp. 28 *et seq*.; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.1, p. 6; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.1, p. 8).\n\n5.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Malicorp alleges that it took various measures enabling it\u00a0to reply to this call for tenders (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.1, p. 7; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.1, p. 8). More particularly, it claims to have established contacts\u00a0with three companies:\n\na) *Nordic Engineering Resources Group A.S*. (hereinafter \u201cNERG\u201d), a\u00a0Norwegian company active in the civil aviation sector and a specialist in\u00a0equipping and managing airports, incorporated on 25 February 1999 in Oslo.\u00a0This company is a subsidiary of the Nordic Aviation Resources Group\u00a0(hereinafter \u201cNAR\u201d) (Exhibit C-44 = R-2, pp. 49 *et seq*.);\n\nb) *Joannou &amp; Paraskevaid, (Overseas)* (hereinafter \u201cJ&amp;P\u201d), a company active in\u00a0airport construction, incorporated in Guernsey in the United Kingdom under\u00a0no. 560 (Exhibit C-45 = R-2, pp. 52 *et seq*. ); and\n\nc) *General Mediterranean Holding* (hereinafter \u201cGMH\u201d), the holding company\u00a0of an international investment group based in the Grand Duchy of\u00a0Luxembourg, registered on 16 January 1997 under no. B16453 (Claim.\u00a023.07.2009, no. III-1.2, p. 7; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.2, p. 9). This group\u00a0has five main divisions: banking and finance, real estate and construction,\u00a0hotels and leisure, retail and pharmacy, as well as communications,\u00a0information technology and aviation.\n\n6.\n\nOn 15 September 1999, the Claimant amended the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Malicorp Limited, which amendments were registered with Companies House of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. According to\u00a0that document, the share capital of Malicorp was increased to 100 million pounds\u00a0sterling, divided into one million shares of 100 pounds (Exhibit R-1, p. 17 (21)).\n\n7.\n\nOn 1 October 1999, Malicorp submitted ***a bid*** in reply to the call for tenders by the Egyptian General Directorate of Civil Aviation (Exhibit C-17 = R-2, pp. 66 *et seq*. ; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 7; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1-3, p. 9; Respond.\u00a001.07.2009, no. 16; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 73). That bid stated that it was\u00a0Malicorp's intention to enlist the technical and financial support of NERG, J&amp;P, and\u00a0GMH (Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.2, p. 9; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. V-2.1, p. 37).\n\nThe following companies were also mentioned in the bid: ASMA Company for Trade and General Contracting, of Egypt, as well as Digitel Telecom Company for\u00a0Contracting and Technical and Electronic Establishment, of Egypt (Respond.\u00a008.01.2010, no. 77).\n\nThe bid submitted by Malicorp was accompanied by a *first demand guarantee* for one million Egyptian pounds (i.e., at 1999/2000 rates [1 Egyptian pound = 0.2923 dollars],\u00a0approximately 292.300 US dollars (hereinafter \u201cdollar\u201d)) issued by Banque Misr of\u00a0Cairo (Exhibit R-2, p. 65; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 7; Claim. 23.10.2009, no.\u00a0III-1.3, p. 10).\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 January 2000, Malicorp's representatives were called to a meeting with\u00a0representatives of the Government of the Republic in order to clarify certain aspects of\u00a0the bid, in particular the company's structure and capital (Exhibit R-2, p. 82; Respond.\u00a008.01.2010, no. 82).\n\nThe Parties differ as to what financial information was provided on that occasion:\n\n- According to the Respondent, Malicorp held itself out as a company with capital\u00a0of 100 million pounds sterling on that occasion it allegedly furnished a\u00a0certificate mentioning that figure (Exhibit R-1, p. 16/21). The Respondent relies\u00a0on the minutes of that meeting (Exhibit R-1, p. 47/48), which indicate that\u00a0Malicorp's representatives spoke of 100 million pounds sterling, referring to an\u00a0extract from the Companies Register. It should be pointed out that the content of\u00a0the exhibits produced differs: the extract of 6 August 2007 (Exhibit C-5)\u00a0mentions capital of 1.000 pounds sterling; the report of 24 October 2008 (Exhibit\u00a0R-2, p. 641) gives no indication; the extract pursuant to the Companies Act,\u00a0apparently drawn up on 15 September 1999 (Exhibit R-2, p. 91/94), shows a\u00a0capital of 100 million pounds sterling).\n\n- According to the Claimant, Malicorp submitted the extract from the Companies\u00a0Register one time only; it was provided to the General Authority for Investment\u00a0(hereinafter \u201cGAFI\u201d). It maintains that, on that occasion, the extract, which was\u00a0authenticated by the British and Egyptian authorities, showed a capital of 1.000\u00a0pounds sterling (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 10).\n\nAs to the amount of the company's capital, the Claimant asserts that there is a major difference between *issued* or *subscribed* capital, which constitutes the actual capital,\u00a0and the *authorised* capital, which is the amount up to which the Board of directors\u00a0may increase the capital without having to call an extraordinary general meeting\u00a0(Claim. 23.10.2009, no. II-1, pp. 4 *et seq*. ).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will discuss in greater detail the facts relating to that meeting and the information provided on that occasion (see below, no. 134).\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 February 2000, the Republic, represented by its Minister of Transport and the\u00a0Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (hereinafter \u201cECAA\u201d), informed Malicorp by letter\u00a0that *its bid had been selected* as being the best (Exhibit C-18 = R-2, p. 105; Respond.\u00a008.01.2010, no. 94; see, also, letter from the ECAA of 2 February 2000 to the\u00a0Minister, pointing out that Malicorp's offer was the best since it was wholly financed\u00a0by foreign capital, Exhibit R-2, pp. 101 *et seq*. ). In its letter, the ECAA asked\u00a0Malicorp to send one of its representatives to carry out the formalities required to\u00a0conclude the contract (Exhibit C-18 = R-2, p. 105; Claim. 23.07.3009, no. III-1.3, p.\u00a08; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 10; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 96).\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 February 2000, Malicorp received a letter from Swiss Re, informing it of its\u00a0interest in a possible collaboration between the two companies for the purpose of\u00a0financing the airport (Exhibit R-2, p. 107; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 98).\n\n11.\n\nOn 22 March 2000, Malicorp's board decided to cancel the resolution to increase the\u00a0share capital to 100 million pounds sterling and to replace it by a value of 1.000\u00a0pounds (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 32; Exhibit R-2, pp. 108 *et seq*. ).\n\n12.\n\nIn May 2000, the Egyptian General Security Agency sent a letter to the Egyptian\u00a0General Security Authority for Civil Aviation informing it that it had no objection to\u00a0approving the Malicorp project, provided that what the Respondent called the\u00a0\u201cAuthority\u201d took charge of all security measures (Exhibit R-2, p. 111; Respond.\u00a008.01.2010, no. 101).\n\nThe Parties differ as to the interpretation to be given to those phrases:\n\n- According to the Claimant, this amounted to approval of the project with respect\u00a0to all security issues (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 101).\n\n- According to the Respondent, the Egyptian General Security Agency did not\u00a0give any consent whatsoever by that communication (Respond. 08.01.2010, no.\u00a0100).\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 May 2000, the ECAA and Malicorp entered into a ***Preliminary Contract*** to put\u00a0in place the concession for the Ras Sudr Airport (Exhibit C-19 = R-1, pp. 49 *et seq*. =\u00a0R-2, pp. 113 *et seq*. ; Claim. 21.10.2008, no. 3.1.1, p. 6; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.3\u00a0p.8; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 11; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 17; Respond.\u00a008.01.2010, no. 103).\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 October 2000, Malicorp informed its contracting partner (the ECAA) that the\u00a0cost of the project would be 232 million dollars (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 104).\n\n15.\n\nOn 4 November 2000, Malicorp, on the one hand, represented by Dr. Abbe Mercer,\u00a0and the Government of the Republic, on the other, represented by Pilot Abdelfaatah\u00a0Mohamed Kato, acting on behalf of the Republic, itself represented by the ECAA,\u00a0entered into the ***final Concession Contract*** (hereinafter the \u201cContract\u201d) according to\u00a0the B.O.T. system, for the construction, management, operation and transfer of the Ras\u00a0Sudr International Airport (Claim. 21.10.2008, no. 3.1.1, p. 6; Respond. 01.07.2009,\u00a0no. 18; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 8; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 11;\u00a0Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 106).\n\nThat Contract was signed in the offices of the Egyptian Minister of Transport, who at the time was responsible for civil aviation, in the presence of the Ambassador of Great\u00a0Britain and the Ambassador of Norway serving in Cairo, the latter having been\u00a0officially invited by the Egyptian Minister (Exhibit C-20 = R-2, p. 122; Exhibit C-21 = R-2, p. 120: invitations. Exhibit C-22 = R-2, pp. 214 *et seq*. : photographs of the\u00a0signing ceremony) (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 9; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-1.3, p. 11).\n\nThe Contract allocated a site to Malicorp for the construction and management of the Ras Sudr Airport, as well as an \u201cannexed site\u201d consisting of land with full property\u00a0rights, on which Malicorp would have acquired the right to develop other projects\u00a0under its sole management (Claim. 21.10.2008, no. 3.1.1, p. 6).\n\nUnder the Contract Malicorp was obliged to furnish a series of guarantees. Section 23.1.7 of the Contract indeed provided that the Claimant would furnish a guarantee of\u00a02 million Egyptian pounds (i.e., at the 1999/2000 rate [1 Egyptian pound = 0.2923 dollars] approximately 584.600 dollars) (Exhibit C-4, p. 72 = R-2, p. 194; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 19; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 106 (6)).\n\nSection 23.1.6 of the Contract provided that the Concessionaire would set up a company limited by shares, under Egyptian law, the purpose of which would be to\u00a0construct, manage and operate the Ras Sudr Airport (Exhibit C-4, p. 72 = R-2, p. 194;\u00a0Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 9; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Respond.\u00a001.07.2009, no. 19). According to that same section, the incorporation documents\u00a0were to be made available to the Republic not later than 90 days following the signing\u00a0of the Contract (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 106 (5)).\n\n16.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will describe and discuss later those clauses in the Contract that\u00a0are important to the resolution of the dispute (see below, no. 96).\n\n**2.2. From the signing of the Contract to its rescission**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nUnder the Contract, Malicorp had to take a number of measures quickly, in particular setting up an Egyptian company. According to the Contract, it was to be a limited company with an authorised capital of 100 million Egyptian pounds (i.e., at the 1999/2000 rate [1 Egyptian pound = 0.2923 dollars], approximately 29,230,000 dollars), of which 10 million Egyptian pounds were to be subscribed immediately (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 9; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 12).\n\nFor this purpose, but at a date which has not been communicated, Malicorp instructed the firm of Mustapha Shawki, a major Egyptian firm of chartered accountants and auditors (hereinafter the \"founders' agent\"), and entrusted it with taking the necessary steps for setting up the company (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 9; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 12). That firm submitted the necessary documents, duly legally authenticated, as well as the draft articles of association, to the Investment Authority, the department with competence to register investment companies in accordance with Egyptian Law no. 8 of 1997 on investment incentives.\n\nThe Claimant's position concerning the obtaining by the Shawki firm of the approvals necessary for setting up the company from the competent authorities centralised around the GAFI is not clear. In its submission of 23 July 2009, it states that it obtained them, whereas in its submission of 23 October 2009 it states that those approvals were refused in a letter of 22 July 2001 (Exhibit C-52; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 10; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 12).\n\n18.\n\nOn 11 December 2000, the ECAA sent Malicorp a first notice concerning the nonperformance of the Contract, notably the obligation to provide a bank guarantee (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 111).\n\n19.\n\nOn 4 January 2001, Mr. Shaker, a representative of Malicorp who was an Egyptian national, submitted a land allocation request to establish a tourist centre on behalf of \"Malicorp Misr Company for construction of Ras-Sudr International Airport\" (Exhibit R-2, p. 223). The names mentioned in that request do not correspond either to those on the Certificate of Establishment of 1 October 2009 (Exhibit R-2, p. 79), or to those on the application dated 12 March 2001 (Exhibit R-2, p. 231, 286, 330; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 110).\n\n20.\n\nOn 20 January 2001, the ECAA notified Malicorp that it had not complied with its contractual obligations, to wit, Sections 23.1.6 concerning the establishment of an Egyptian company and 23.1.7 concerning increasing the bank guarantee to two million Egyptian pounds (Exhibit R-2, p. 225; Respond. 08.01.2010, nos. 111-112).\n\n21.\n\nOn 4 February 2001, the 90-day time limit granted to Malicorp to set up the company under the terms of the Contract (Exhibit R-2, p. 194) expired without the Egyptian company having been incorporated (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 118).\n\n22.\n\nOn 18 February 2001, the ECAA sent Malicorp a \"Third and Last Notice,\" threatening to take measures to end the Contract by the end of February 2001 if Malicorp did not comply with its contractual obligations (Exhibit R-2, p. 227; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 114).\n\n23.\n\nOn 12 March 2001, the founders' agent filed an application for approval of the Egyptian company. The application mentioned the names of three founders: Malicorp, Mibo Gawli and Sayed Hanafy Mahmoud (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 120).\n\n24.\n\nOn 12 May 2001, Mr. El Ela, one of Malicorp's founders, informed the Government of the Republic of certain problems concerning the Malicorp company and the information furnished by it (Exhibit R-1, pp. 59-61).\n\nThe Parties differ as to his position in relation to Malicorp. According to the Claimant, he was a former founder (Claim. 05.02.2010, no. I-6, p. 15 with reference to Exhibit R-2, p. 338); according to the Respondent, he was a shareholder and representative of the company (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 124).\n\nThe record shows that Mr. El Ela used Malicorp's letterhead for his letter and signed it stating that he was one of Malicorp's founders (Exhibit R-1, p. 61).\n\n25.\n\nOn 30 May 2001, following a letter from Dr. Shawki dated 27 May 2001 and a letter from Dr. Abbe Mercer dated 28 May 2001, the Government of the Republic, through Pilot Kato, invited Malicorp to provide it with complete and correct copies of various documents by 30 June 2001 (Exhibit R-1, p. 63; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 126).\n\n26.\n\nOn 19 June 2001, the shareholders of the Egyptian company in the process of being established deposited 10% of the issued capital with Banque Misr, namely one million Egyptian pounds (i.e., at the 1999/2000 rate [1 Egyptian pound = 0.2923 dollars] approximately 292,300 dollars), which was to remain blocked until registration of the company with the Commercial Register (Exhibit C-23; Respond. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 10; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 12).\n\nFollowing the deposit of the said amount with Banque Misr, Malicorp waited several months during which the founders' agent contacted the various authorities concerned or their key staff in order to obtain a clear reply concerning the incorporation and registration in the Commercial Register of Malicorp's Egyptian subsidiary (Exhibit C-25, Exhibit C-26; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 11, Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 13).\n\n27.\n\nOn 30 June 2001 the time limit for Malicorp to provide the information required in the letter from the Republic expired. According to the Claimant, the Commission received the information on 25 June 2001 (Malicorp letter of 13 August 2001 produced by the Respondent under Exhibit R-2, p. 399); according to the Respondent, that information never reached it (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 127; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 23).\n\n28.\n\nOn 1 July 2001, the Minister of Transport sent a letter to the General Commission for Investments, approving the incorporation of the Egyptian company following review of the documents received and confirmation by the Norwegian Embassy, the British Embassy and the Egyptian Embassy in Norway of the company's capability to carry out the project (Malicorp letter of 13 August 2001 produced by the Respondent under Exhibit R-2, pp. 399-400).\n\nAfterwards, Malicorp began to receive formal notices of breach of its contractual obligation to set up an Egyptian company (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 11; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 13). Malicorp objected that this delay had been caused by the failure of those same Egyptian authorities to register the last formalities for the setting up of the Egyptian company (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 11; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 13).\n\n29.\n\nOn 21 July 2001, a meeting of the Egyptian Special Commission for the Ras Sudr Airport was held to discuss the problems concerning the Contract and the setting up of the local company (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 128; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 24). The official minutes of this meeting held at the Cabinet of the Minister of Transport show that the decision to refuse incorporation of the Egyptian company was made on that day; fourteen agencies of the Government of the Republic took part (Exhibit R-1, pp. 64 *et seq.* ; Exhibit C-6; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2 p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III- 2, p. 14).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will revert later to the circumstances in which that decision was taken and the reasons on which it was based (see below, no. 128).\n\n30.\n\nOn 22 July 2001, a letter was sent to the Shawki firm, informing it that the competent security authorities had decided to refuse to approve the incorporation of the company (Exhibit C-27; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 11; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, pp.1314).\n\n31.\n\nOn 23 July 2001, Malicorp wrote to the Egyptian Prime Minister (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 25). In its letter it mentioned two former generals who had allegedly had links to the company and used unlawful methods in order to divert Malicorp from its objective, including by means of racketeering, extortion and threats: \" *There were among the company* *personnel two retired generals Adel Darwish and Sayed Aboul Alaa who were layed off for reasons related to their behavior towards the company which was concretized by threats, extortion and racketeer confirming their grip and proving that they were* *capable of some acts which were thereafter withdrawn or cancelled without anyhow forcing the company to abide by their extortion* [...]. *The above-mentioned retired* *generals threatened the company of cancelling the contract and not letting the* *company continue in Egypt* [...] *. The Company refused such cheap blackmail* (Exhibit C-28; Exhibit R-1, p. 69).\n\nMalicorp requested the support of the Prime Minister to resolve this matter: \" *We hope from your Excellency after studying and reviewing this short presentation to take the steps you deem appropriate in support of the investment and development,* \" (Exhibit C-28, Exhibit R-1, p. 69).\n\n32.\n\nOn 28 July 2001, Malicorp wrote to the President of the Republic asking him to personally intercede on its behalf with the persons who were preventing performance of the Contract (Exhibit C-26; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15). The Claimant once again described the practices of which it accused the two generals (cf. above, no. 31):\n\n*The company had sought the assistance of the retired generals Sayed Aboul Alaa and Adel Darwish to help in some matters. The first was put aside from the first day for having fought with persons in charge at the Aviation Authority and the proof of his lack of competence and his failure in carrying out his assignment. The second was also put aside for having adopted the style of arrangement, extortion, racketeering, death threats and thereafter pretending that he was a relative to the Head of the Aviation Authority* [...]. (Exhibit C-26, no. 3).\n\nIn that letter, Malicorp complained, among other things, of the methods allegedly used by General Kato, the President of Civil Aviation, who had allegedly sent a letter to the British Embassy containing insults and attacks against the representatives of Malicorp:\n\n*General Abdel Fattah Kato sent a letter to the British Embassy to which was attached a document in Arabic containing insults and attacks against the parties* [. ]. (Exhibit C-26, no. 6).\n\nHe had also allegedly written to the Norwegian Embassy in order to obtain information concerning the Claimant, though the Claimant was an English company (Exhibit C-26, no. 7).\n\nIn the same letter to the President, Malicorp raised questions about Dr Al Ghamrawy. He was alleged to have promised to assist in resolving the problem, which he had not done, but had even promised General Adel Darwish, previously accused of extortion, racketeering and threats, that he would prevent the Egyptian company from being incorporated:\n\n*Also during that conference Claimant's representative met with Doctor Al Ghamrawy who promised to terminate the subject matter of the Company upon his return to Cairo and that he was ready to meet with the representatives of the Company in Cairo to settle the problem* \" (Exhibit C-26, no. 10).\n\n*Doctor Al Ghamrawy refused to meet with the representatives of the company or to answer to the numerous letters sent to the Investment Authority* [\u2026] *.*\n\n*General Adel Darwish ascertained that Doctor Al Ghamrawy promised him not to have the company formed.* (Exhibit C-26, nos. 11 and 12).\n\n33.\n\nOn 12 August 2001, the \"Ministry of Transportation; Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation; A Joint partnership of Business Sector\" notified Malicorp of the ***termination of the Contract*** (Exhibit R-1, p. 73; Claim. 21.10.2008, no. 3.1.1, p. 7; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 132; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 26).\n\nThe Parties differ with respect to the reasons for termination:\n\n- According to the Claimant, the Contract was terminated for reasons connected to national security (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 133). That being so, such termination entitled it to compensation for the damage caused by unfair treatment and the expropriation of its investment (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 151; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 27).\n\n- According to the Respondent, the Contract was terminated for a reason contained in the Contract itself. Malicorp had allegedly produced false documents, had not fulfilled its obligation to set up an Egyptian company, had failed to provide the necessary guarantees and had failed to properly perform the Concession Contract (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 133; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 27).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will revert to these matters later (see below, no. 128).\n\n**2.3. Events subsequent to the rescission**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nOn 13 August 2001, in reaction to the termination of the Contract, Malicorp wrote to the ECAA (Exhibit R-2, pp. 397 *et seq.*, setting out a list of fourteen arguments why the rescission was void; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 134).\n\n35.\n\nOn 1 September 2001, the Egyptian Ministry of Transport notified the British Embassy that the Contract with Malicorp had been \"nullified\" (Exhibit R-2, p. 410; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 137).\n\n36.\n\nOn 4 September 2001, the Egyptian Ministry of Transport confirmed the \"cancellation\" of the Contract by the Egyptian Aviation Holding Company (Exhibit C-34 = R-2, p. 411; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 138).\n\n37.\n\nOn 12 December 2001, the First Under Secretary of the Minister of Transport wrote to Mrs. Jacqui Mullen, Head of the Commercial Sector of the British Embassy in Cairo, informing her that Malicorp could contact the Investment Authority and follow the formal procedure in order to establish the Egyptian company (Exhibit C-30 = R-2, p. 415).\n\n38.\n\nOn 3 January 2002, Malicorp wrote to the Minister of Transport (Exhibit C-29 = R-2, p. 416; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Respond. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15). In that letter it asked the Minister to write to the General Commission for Investments informing it that the Contract was going forward, and requesting its authorisation for the establishment of the Egyptian company as provided in the Contract.\n\n39.\n\nOn 23 January 2002, by letter to the Minister of Transport, Malicorp requested authorisation from the Investment Authority to establish the Egyptian company. That attempt nevertheless failed, as the President of the Civil Aviation Holding Company of the Ministry of Transport replied on 27 February 2002 confirming that National Security had renewed its refusal (Exhibit C-10 = R-2, p. 420; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 13; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p.15).\n\n40.\n\nThereafter, the matter was also raised via diplomatic channels; the British and Norwegian Embassies expressed their surprise and Mr. Jack Straw, who was then the British Minister of Foreign Affairs, discussed the matter with the President of the Republic, Mr. Mubarak, in the course of an official visit to Egypt (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15).\n\n41.\n\nOn 7 October 2002, the Minister of Civil Aviation confirmed to the Ambassador of Great Britain in Cairo that the project had been cancelled (Exhibit C-8 = R-2, p. 422). By that time the ECAA had already liquidated and cashed the bank guarantee deposited by Malicorp with Banque Misr (Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15).\n\n42.\n\nOn 15 January 2003, Baroness Symons, British Minister of State for International Commerce and Investment, wrote to Mr. Paul Towey, the representative of Malicorp, confirming that the Embassy in Cairo was continuing to press Malicorp's case and that the Ambassador was trying to arrange a meeting with Air Marshal Shafik, Minister of Civil Aviation (Exhibit C-31 = R-2, p. 424). In her letter, Baroness Symons also stated her intention to obtain a meeting with the Minister of Civil Aviation during her next trip to Egypt (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 13; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 16).\n\n43.\n\nIn the period prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings before the Cairo Centre (see below, no. 44), the ECAA was replaced by several holding companies, each managing a part of Egypt's civil aviation service (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1.2, p. 17; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1.2, p. 20).\n\n**3. The other proceedings brought by the Parties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.1. The arbitration proceedings before the CRCICA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***3.1.1. The arbitration proceedings***\n----------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 April 2004, Malicorp filed a request for arbitration with the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (hereinafter \"CRCICA\") (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 24; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 13; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 16). This request was registered on 28 April 2004 under no. 382/2004 based on the arbitration clause contained in the Contract (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 16; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 19; Respond. 08.01.2010, nos. 140, 148).\n\nThe CRCICA proceedings were between Malicorp as claimant and three respondents, namely the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airport Company (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 17; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 19; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 148); for simplicity's sake, the Arbitral Tribunal will, in what follows, refer only to the Republic.\n\nThe present Arbitral Tribunal has received only incomplete information on those proceedings, which is summarised here.\n\n45.\n\nOn 31 May 2004, the arbitral tribunal set up under the aegis of the CRCICA (hereinafter the \"CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal\") was constituted. It was made up of Dr. El Ahdab, co-arbitrator appointed by the Claimant, Mr. Gabr, co-arbitrator jointly appointed by the respondents and Ma\u00eetre Bernardo Cremades, as Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal appointed by the two co-arbitrators (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 149; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 17; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 19).\n\n46.\n\nOn 15 July 2004, the Minister of Civil Aviation applied for a stay of the arbitration proceeding as a criminal complaint had been lodged with the Egyptian courts. The Minister complained of fraudulent practices by the claimant and by civil servants with the Egyptian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (Exhibit C-37, p. 9). On 19 September 2004, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal refused to stay the proceedings and decided to continue with its examination of the case (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 9; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1.4, p. 19; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1.4, p. 22).\n\n47.\n\nOn 19 December 2004 the first hearing in the CRCICA arbitration proceedings was held (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 150). The CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal set the timetable for the proceedings in an order, which it modified on 3 February 2005.\n\n48.\n\nOn 19 February 2005, Malicorp filed its Statement of claim (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 24). It alleged that the respondents had wrongfully terminated the Contract thereby entitling Malicorp to claim damages for the losses sustained (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 152).\n\n49.\n\nOn 21 May 2005, the respondents filed their Statement of Defence. In it they asserted that Malicorp had breached its contractual obligations, that it had acted in bad faith and that the Contract was null and void due to the production of a falsified extract from the Companies Register (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 153).\n\n50.\n\nOn 26 July 2005, Malicorp filed its Reply (\"Claimant's Reply regarding the claim,\" reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 24), reiterating its submissions and arguments with respect to the liability of the respondents for the damage sustained (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 154).\n\n51.\n\nOn 21 September 2005, the respondents filed their Rejoinder (\"Rejoinder in Counter Evidence of the Republic to the Claimant concerning the Claim;\" reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 10).\n\n52.\n\nOn 11 and 12 February 2006, the parties submitted their post-hearing submissions (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 10).\n\n53.\n\nOn 19 February 2006, the Council of State Administrative Court of Cairo held that the arbitration clause contained in the Contract was void and ordered the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal to suspend the arbitration proceedings (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 12; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 156). That decision followed the filing by the Arab Republic of Egypt of a claim for the arbitration clause to be ruled null and void (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1.1, p. 18; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1.3, p. 21).\n\n54.\n\nOn 15, 16 and 17 November 2005, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing with the parties (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 11).\n\n55.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Malicorp filed its Post-Hearing Rejoinder (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 157); the respondents filed theirs on 25 and 27 February 2006 (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 157).\n\n56.\n\nOn 27 February 2006, Mr. Gabr, one of the co-arbitrators, gave notice by letter to Mr. Mohamed Aboul Einein, Director of the CRCICA, that he had decided to suspend his participation in the CRCICA proceedings because of the decision of the Council of State Administrative Court of Cairo finding the arbitration clause null and void (cf. above, no. 53; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 158).\n\n57.\n\nNotwithstanding that resignation, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal went ahead with the proceedings; it stated that it was doing so in reliance on (Egyptian) Arbitration Law no. 27/1994 (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1.3, p. 19; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1.3, p. 21).\n\n58.\n\nOn 7 March 2006, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal issued an arbitral award (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 163; R-2, p. 474). It held first of all that the arbitration agreement in the Contract was binding on the Republic (Exhibit C-37, Section 59). It went on to hold that the Republic had been the victim of a fundamental error in signing the Contract in that it had wrongly believed that the capital registered and paid by Malicorp was 100 million pounds sterling and that for this reason the Contract was void. It therefore dismissed the submissions of the Claimant claiming damages for the loss caused by the termination of the Contract.\n\nIt nevertheless decided to order the respondents to reimburse Malicorp for costs, invoices and the salaries of its employees. In this regard, it ordered the respondents to pay Malicorp the sum of 14,773,497 dollars, with interest (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 164; Exhibit C-37, sections 84 *et seq.* ; Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 17; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1, p. 20). According to the Respondent, in doing so it relied on a provision of the Egyptian Civil Code to which the parties had made no reference during the proceedings (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 164).\n\n59.\n\nThe respondents have applied to have the CRCICA arbitral award set aside (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 166). The Claimant has not applied for review and has not joined in the application for review filed by the respondents. This Arbitral Tribunal has not been informed of the outcome of this application to set aside, which appears to be still pending.\n\n***3.1.2. The attachment and enforcement proceedings***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nOn 9 August 2006, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Paris *Tribunal de Grande Instance* issued an *ex parte* order for the exequatur of the CRCICA arbitral award on the application of Malicorp (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 23; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 167). On 9 October 2006, the French enforcement order was served on the Respondent's Embassy in Paris (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 23; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 169).\n\n61.\n\nOn 10, 12 and 13 October 2006, assets of the Republic in the possession of Banque Misr, UBAF and LCL were attached on the application of Malicorp (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 23; Respond 08.01.2010, no. 168).\n\n62.\n\nOn 16 October 2006, the Republic appealed against the enforcement order issued on 9 August 2006 (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.1, p. 23; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 170).\n\n63.\n\nOn 20 October 2006, the Republic applied to the enforcement judge of the Paris *Tribunal de Grande Instance* to lift the attachment orders; it principally argued State immunity from execution and the absence of risk with respect to its solvency (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.2, pp. 23-24).\n\n64.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the enforcement judge of the Paris *Tribunal de Grande Instance* held a hearing. The Republic through its various agencies and bodies proposed a compromise solution to Malicorp: the delivery of a surety bond by Banque Misr in exchange for Malicorp's agreement to lift the attachment orders and its undertaking not to take any steps to enforce the CRCICA arbitral award (either in France or abroad) (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 24).\n\n65.\n\nThe agreement initiated at the hearing of 31 October 2007 was finalised on 16 November 2007 after Banque Misr proposed and delivered the original of the surety bond on behalf of the Republic in favour of Malicorp. Malicorp thereafter went before the enforcement judge to have the contested attachments lifted (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 21; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.2.2, p. 24).\n\n66.\n\nOn 19 June 2008, the Paris Court of Appeal granted the appeal filed by the Republic against the decision of the enforcement judge and dismissed the application for exequatur (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.4, p. 24; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.4, p. 27). It based its decision on one of the four arguments of the Respondent: it ruled that the issuing of an arbitral award by an arbitral tribunal on the basis of a provision that had not been previously submitted to the parties amounted to a denial of justice. It accordingly found that it was superfluous to examine the other arguments (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 171).\n\n67.\n\nOn 22 August 2008, Malicorp lodged its first *pourvoi en cassation* against the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, arguing the lack of sufficient reasons for the decision of 19 June 2008 (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 172).\n\n68.\n\nOn 16 September 2008, the Respondent attempted to serve the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal at the address in England that Malicorp is and was using, but the English authorities allegedly stated that it was not possible to do so at that address (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 173). According to the Respondent, this attempted service amounted to valid service. The Claimant disputes this (*ibidem*).\n\n69.\n\nOn 11 March 2009, the two Parties were informed that Malicorp's first **pourvoi** had been held inadmissible because it was procedurally flawed (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 174); Malicorp had, indeed, omitted to append to its **pourvoi** a copy of the judgment appealed against (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 172).\n\n70.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, Malicorp lodged a second *pourvoi en cassation* (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 174). Following the main hearing held by the present Arbitral Tribunal, it was informed by the Parties (see letters from Ma\u00eetre Yassin of 3 July 2010 and Ma\u00eetre Webster of 12 July 2010) that the *Cour de cassation* had dismissed the *pourvois* in a decision of 23 June 2010; it considered that the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal had violated the adversarial principle by basing its decision on provisions of the Egyptian Civil Code that had not been pleaded by the parties. It found, accordingly, \" *que la sentence ne pouvait \u00eatre reconnue ni ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en France.* \"\n\n**3.2. The criminal proceedings before the Cairo Court of Assizes2**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this document the Arbitral Tribunal will use the term \"the Cairo Court of Assizes,\" also used by the Parties, in spite of the use by the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal of the term \"the Court for Crimes of High Treason\" (Exhibit C-37).\n\n71.\n\nIn parallel to the CRCICA arbitration proceedings, criminal proceedings were instituted against individuals directly or indirectly connected with Malicorp. The information in the possession of this Arbitral Tribunal is based essentially on statements made in the written and oral pleadings. Here, too, such information has only an indirect bearing on these arbitration proceedings\n\n72.\n\nOn 17 August 2005, the Public Prosecutor's office issued an order remanding the case to the Cairo Court of Assizes (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 25). The order referred to various unlawful and fraudulent acts committed by individuals connected with the Claimant, as well as certain Egyptian civil servants involved in examining the bid that the Claimant had submitted (reference in Exhibit C-37, p. 25).\n\nA total of ten individuals were remanded for trial (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 141): five Egyptian civil servants, in particular, were charged with unlawful taking of interest and various unlawful acts in connection with the conclusion of the Contract. Five shareholders or alleged shareholders of Malicorp were charged, in particular, with having falsified the Companies Register with respect to Malicorp: they were Messrs. Mahmoud Chaker Ibrahim, Azmi Mahmoud Al-Tara\u00ef, Assaed Mohamad Aboul Ela, Adel Hamid Adel Malek and Abdel Khaqled Mersal.\n\nThe Cairo Court of Assizes also tried the five accused on charges of forgery of private documents (Article 215 of the Egyptian Penal Code) since that offence was connected to the offences before the Court in the principal case, although the normal procedure would have been to remand the matter to the Criminal Court (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-4.1.4, p. 19; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-4.1.4, p. 22).\n\n73.\n\nOn 2 September 2006, the Cairo Court of Assizes rendered its verdict: Messrs. Chabli and Mercer were found guilty of forgery and fraud and sentenced principally to three years' imprisonment (Exhibit R-1, pp. 85-88, Exhibit C-40; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 30; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 144). They appealed but were unsuccessful (Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 32.).\n\n**4. The arbitration proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nOn 21 October 2008, the Claimant, Malicorp, represented at the time by Ma\u00eetre JeanPierre Coutard, filed a Request for Arbitration in French (\" ***Requ\u00eate d'arbitrage*** \") against the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt with the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\").\n\nIt essentially alleges therein that the Republic violated its obligations under the Agreement of 11 June 1975 between the United Kingdom and Egypt for the promotion and protection of investments (hereinafter the \"Agreement;\" see below, no. 91); it relies on Article 5 in particular, and consequently requests that the Respondent be ordered to pay compensation covering, above all, the losses and lost earnings resulting from termination of the Contract.\n\nThe Claimant supplemented its Request by three letters of 12, 19 and 25 November 2008.\n\nThat Request was received by the ICSID Secretariat on October 27, 2008 and registered on 16 December 2008 under ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18.\n\n75.\n\nThe proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the rules of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter the \"ICSID Convention\") as well as with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules) (hereinafter the \"ICSID Rules\"), in force since 2006.\n\n76.\n\nThe Parties agreed to apply Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention with respect to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, by virtue of which each party appoints an arbitrator and the third, the President of the Tribunal, is appointed by agreement of the Parties. By letter of 13 March 2009, the Claimant appointed Prof. Luiz Olavo Baptista, a national of Brazil, as co-arbitrator, who accepted his appointment. By letter of 24 March 2009 to the ICSID Secretariat, the Respondent appointed Ma\u00eetre Pierre-Yves Tschanz, a national of Switzerland, as co-arbitrator, who accepted his appointment\n\nThe Parties gave the co-arbitrators the power to appoint the President of the Tribunal. By letter of 25 May 2009 to the ICSID Secretariat, the arbitrators proposed Prof. Pierre Tercier, a national of Switzerland, who accepted his appointment.\n\n77.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, the Parties were informed that the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have begun on that date.\n\n78.\n\nOn 1 July 2009, without having been invited to do so, the Respondent filed a submission in English in reaction to the Request (\" **Submission of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt on preliminary jurisdictional objections** \"). It essentially alleges that the Contract was entered into as a result of fraud and that the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to rule, as Egypt's consent to give the protection offered by the Agreement does not extend to fraud.\n\n79.\n\nOn 23 July 2009, the Claimant, henceforth represented by Ma\u00eetre Christian Br\u00e9mond and Ma\u00eetre Sylvie Morel, submitted, in French, its \" ***M\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la*** ***soumission du Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires juridictionnelles***.\" Replying to the objections raised, it invites the Arbitral Tribunal to find that the action is admissible and to grant it leave to prepare a memorial on the merits.\n\n80.\n\nOn 31 July 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held its first session in Paris with the representatives of the Parties. Minutes were drawn up following the hearing (see the Minutes of the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal). In addition to the usual procedural matters, which did not give rise to any discussion, two issues in particular were discussed and settled on that occasion, after the Parties had been given the opportunity to express their views thereon:\n\na) Concerning the language of the arbitration (see Minutes of 31.07.2009, no. 7):\n\n*Il est convenu entre les parties et le Tribunal que:*\n\n*Chaque partie pourra r\u00e9diger ses \u00e9critures et plaider en langue fran\u00e7aise ou anglaise sans qu'il soit besoin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une traduction.*\n\n*Tout document soumis en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais ne sera pas assorti d'une traduction. Les documents originairement r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en une autre langue que le fran\u00e7ais ou l'anglais devront \u00eatre traduits en fran\u00e7ais ou anglais.*\n\n*Les t\u00e9moins et/ou experts pourront s'exprimer en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais lors de leurs auditions.*\n\n*Les transcriptions verbatim des audiences seront faites en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais.*\n\n*Les ordonnances de proc\u00e9dure et la d\u00e9cision et/ou sentence seront rendues en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Les parties ont laiss\u00e9 le soin au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider quelle langue fera foi. Apr\u00e8s d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, le Tribunal indique que la langue qui fera foi sera la langue fran\u00e7aise. Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le Tribunal pourra dans sa d\u00e9cision et/ou sentence se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la position des parties expos\u00e9e en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais et aux textes juridiques en anglais sans qu'une traduction dans l'autre langue soit n\u00e9cessaire.*\n\n*Les correspondances du Centre seront r\u00e9dig\u00e9es en fran\u00e7ais sans traduction.*\n\n*Les parties acceptent que le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la session soit rendu en fran\u00e7ais uniquement.*\n\nb) Concerning the rest of the proceedings, following the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent (Minutes of 31.07.2009, no. 14, paragraph 4):\n\n*Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et apr\u00e8s en avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, le Tribunal d\u00e9cide de traiter les questions de la comp\u00e9tence et de la responsabilit\u00e9 ensemble dans la mesure o\u00f9 il appara\u00eet que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments factuels sont similaires et que cela ne rallongerait pas consid\u00e9rablement le calendrier proc\u00e9dural. Par contre, le Tribunal souhaite exclure \u00e0 ce stade la question du quantum, qui sera trait\u00e9e dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps si n\u00e9cessaire selon un calendrier qui sera convenu avec les parties.*\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal consequently set a timetable for the proceedings.\n\n81.\n\nOn 23 October 2009, the Claimant submitted its \" ***M\u00e9moire sur le Fond et son Contre-M\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la soumission du Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires juridictionnelles***.\" It reiterates therein its arguments concerning admissibility of the Request, and asks the Arbitral Tribunal to find that the Respondent breached Article 5 of the Agreement and must consequently be ordered to pay compensation that \" *sera fix\u00e9e \u00e0 la valeur de march\u00e9 de l'investissement expropri\u00e9 correspondant \u00e0 la valeur des droits conc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9* *Malicorp Limited par le contrat annul\u00e9 du 4 novembre 2000;* \" it furthermore requests that it be granted leave in the next phase \" *\u00e0 justifier du montant de cette compensation conform\u00e9ment au programme fix\u00e9 lors de la s\u00e9ance du Tribunal Arbitral du 31 juillet* *2009.* \"\n\n82.\n\nOn 8 January 2010, the Respondent submitted its \" **Reply Submission of the** **Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and initial submission on the merits**.\" It makes the following submission therein (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 468): \" *Malicorp's case should be dismissed with costs.* \" An expert's report from Professor Dr. Ahmed El-Kosheri was annexed to it.\n\n83.\n\nOn 5 February 2010, the Claimant submitted its \" ***M\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse sur le fond et*** ***M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique sur la comp\u00e9tence***.\" It reiterates its previous submissions, supplementing them on one point by invoking a breach of Article 2(2) of the Agreement.\n\n84.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, the Respondent submitted its \" **Reply Submission on the Merits**.\" It makes the following submission (Respond. 05.03.2010, no. 155): \" *The Respondent respectfully submits that Malicorp's claim should be rejected, promptly as an improper attempt to use BIT rights to profit from its own fraud and negligence and its own failure to perform the Concession Contract.* \"\n\n85.\n\nOn 19 and 20 April 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal held a **hearing** in Paris.\n\na) After hearing the opening statements of each Party, the Arbitral Tribunal heard Mr. El Torei, whom the Respondent had asked to cross-examine.\n\nb) Counsel for the Parties then had the opportunity to plead.\n\nc) Counsel for the Respondent had prepared a Powerpoint presentation for this purpose. Deeming its content to go beyond the framework of the oral pleadings, the Arbitral Tribunal invited Counsel for the Respondent to prepare a version adapted to the content of the oral pleadings (Letter to the Parties of 22 April 2010 via ICSID) and to submit the text thereof to the President for verification before forwarding it to the co-arbitrators. The document, forwarded by Ma\u00eetre Webster following corrections, was found admissible by the President and forwarded to the co-arbitrators. This decision was subsequently confirmed by letter of 18 May 2010, after a request from Ma\u00eetre Br\u00e9mont for it to be reconsidered.\n\nd) A verbatim transcript was made following that hearing, in French and English, depending on the language used in the oral pleadings. On 25 May 2010, Ma\u00eetre Yassin, Counsel for the Claimant, submitted comments concerning Egyptian law, as reported in the verbatim transcript. By letter of 1 June 2010, Counsel for the Respondent asked the Arbitral Tribunal to reject Ma\u00eetre Yassin's letter. By decision of 17 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal admitted Ma\u00eetre Yassin's submission, but gave Counsel for the Respondent the opportunity to reply, which he did on 28 June 2010.\n\n86.\n\nThroughout these proceedings, the Parties have had ample opportunity to put forward their arguments, both in writing and orally. Following the hearing of 19 and 20 April 2010, they confirmed that they had no objection to raise with regard to the procedure that had been followed (see Transcript F 19/20.04.2010, pp. 82 l. 6 *et seq.* and 29 *et seq.*).\n\n87.\n\nOn 13 July 2010, Mr. Chabli, acting on behalf of Malicorp, sent a letter to the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, in which he asked, in particular, for information concerning contacts that a member of the Arbitral Tribunal was alleged to have had with one of the Respondent's counsel. On 29 July 2010, the Parties were informed, in reply, that the information to which he had alluded was erroneous, and that no such contacts had taken place. No further request was made in this regard.\n\n88.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, each of the Parties forwarded to the Arbitral Tribunal details of the costs and expenses incurred in representing their respective interests (\"Submission on costs\"), in response to the request made by the Arbitral Tribunal on 20 August 2010.\n\n89.\n\nThe issuance of this award constitutes the closure of the proceedings.\n\n**II. THE LAW**\n---------------\n\n**A. IN GENERAL**\n-----------------\n\n**1. The basis of the arbitration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant bases its submissions on the Agreement between the United Kingdom and Egypt and on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It contends (1) that the Respondent wrongfully terminated the Contract, (2) that in so doing it breached its obligations under the Agreement, and that (3), consequently, the Claimant is entitled to an award against the Respondent of compensation for the losses it has suffered, from an Arbitral Tribunal acting under the aegis of ICSID.\n\nA brief overview is necessary of the three instruments on which the Claimant relies:\n\n91.\n\na) The Bilateral Investment Treaty. On 11 June 1975, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the one hand, and Egypt, on the other, signed a bilateral investment treaty. The authentic version is the English version, entitled \"Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments\" (Exhibit C-2 = Exhibit R-2, p. 3), but there is a French translation entitled *\"Accord tendant a encourager et prot\u00e9ger les investissement* s\" (Exhibit C-2 = Exhibit R-2, p. 11). In this award, the Arbitral Tribunal shall use the (official) English version of the Agreement. This instrument entered into force for both States on 24 February 1976 (Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 10).\n\nThis Agreement, which followed the classic model of treaties of that generation, begins with a statement of the objectives sought by the Contracting Parties (preamble), and definitions of the principal terms used (Article 1); the Arbitral Tribunal will revert to these as necessary, later in the award. Thereafter, it enumerates the principal obligations each State agrees to undertake: the promotion and protection of investments (Article 2), a most-favoured nation clause (Article 3), compensation for losses (Article 4), expropriation (Article 5), repatriation of investments (Article 6), and exceptions (Article 7). There follow two provisions for dispute resolution; one by a reference to ICSID (Article 8), which will be discussed later (see below, no. 100), the other a special clause for resolution of disputes between the Contracting Parties (Article 9). The Agreement ends with special provisions concerning the scope of its application in terms of persons (subrogation: Article 10), territory (Article 11) and time (Articles 12 and 13).\n\n92.\n\nb) The ICSID Convention. Article 8 of the Agreement makes express reference to the ICSID Convention. Both States have ratified it: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 19 December 1966 and Egypt on 3 March 1972. This text is sufficiently well known to need no introduction here. The Arbitral Tribunal will return later to the issues this case raises as to the interpretation of Article 25 (see below, no. 101).\n\n93.\n\nc) The Contract. The dispute between the Parties arises from the Contract for the Ras Sudr airport project (cf. above, no. 15; Exhibit C-4 = Exhibit R-2 pp. 123 *et seq.*). The text is in the English language only. A brief description is given here of certain clauses having potential significance for the reasoning that follows:\n\n- *The parties* : The Contract was entered into between \"[t] *he Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt,* \" on the one hand, and \" *Malicorp Ltd., a British registered Company (hereinafter called \u2018the Concessionaire'), Address - 6 Alders Lodge St. - London, SW6 - 6 NP, represented by Dr. Abbe Mercer, Company Director,* \" on the other. The cover page describes the Concessionaire more fully, stating that it is *'\"Malicorp Ltd*  *(and to be formed hereafter) Ras Sudr International Airport Ltd* *.\"* (emphasis by the Arbitral Tribunal).\n\n- *The preamble and general part*. These two passages describe the objectives sought, primarily the construction of an airport as part of the general policy of developing and extending airports, with a view to developing the neighbouring tourist region. The Concessionaire is called upon to contribute thereto and is to receive additional land so as to enhance the attractiveness of the region and therefore of the airport.\n\n- *The type of Contract.* The Contract is based on the B.O.T. model, which means, in practical terms, that the Concessionaire undertakes \" *to construct and operate the airport for a specific contract term, after which the airport is to be transferred to the State [free of charge]*. \"\n\n- *The content of the concession*. The rights and obligations arising from the Concession are described in Article 2, which grants the Concessionaire the exclusive right to operate the Concession (Article 2.1), imposes on it the obligation to carry out the project \" *at its own cost and risk* \" (Article 2.2:), sets the term, in principle, at forty-one years from Contract signature, subject to early termination or extension (Article 2.3) and specifies the payments to be made by the Concessionaire (Article 2.6). The undertakings of the Concessionaire (Article 3: \" *Concessionaire Covenants* \") include, primarily, the obligation to maintain an office in Egypt with a representative throughout the entire lifetime of the Contract (Article 3.1), to set up a company whose sole purpose is performance of the Contract, which must be mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of the Concessionaire (Article 3.4), and, on the financial level, to prevent any situation of indebtedness arising without the consent of the Grantor (Article 3.5).\n\n- *The transfer of the land for the airport and the site* (Article 7: \" *Delivery of Airport and the Site* \"). The Grantor undertakes to transfer the land for the airport within two months following the date of signature of the Contract and following delivery of the Performance Bond (Article 7.1); special measures are provided in the event of delay in the handing over of the land (Article 7.2).\n\n- *Performance of the project and construction works* (Article 8: \" *Design and Construction Works* \"). The Concessionaire must carry out the construction work or have it performed (Article 8.1), and do so within a time limit set out in a schedule. For that purpose, it must enter into \" *Associated Agreements* \" for all the services (including loan agreements) necessary for the performance of the work (Article 8.4).\n\n- *Modifications to the Contract.* Events that might influence the progress of the work or the operation are specially dealt with (Article 17: \" *Material Adverse Governmental Action,* \" Article 18: \" *Force Majeure* \"). There is also provision for early termination of the Contract (Article 19).\n\n- *Applicable law and dispute resolution clause*. As to the applicable law, Article 21.1 (\" *Governing Law* \") provides as follows: \" *This Concession Contract is deemed to be a civil law contract and governed by the civil laws of the Republic of Egypt.* \" Article 21.3 deals with the resolution of disputes and notably contains an arbitration clause submitting the proceedings to the Rules of the \" *Cairo Regional Arbitration Center* \" (Articles 21.3.3 **et seq.**): this was the basis for the proceedings before the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal (see above, no. 44 **et seq.**).\n\n- *Miscellaneous provisions*. The Contract ends with a series of \" *Miscellaneous Provisions.* \" Among those covering \" *Representations and Warranties by the Concessionaire,* \" the Arbitral Tribunal notes Article 23.1.6, which concerns the obligation to set up an Egyptian company (see below, no. 140).\n\n- *The signatures.* The Contract is signed on behalf of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority by Pilot Abdelfaatah Mohamed Kato, its President, and on behalf of Malicorp Ltd. by Dr. Abbe Mercer, its Managing Director.\n\n**2. The Parties' submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe most recent submissions of the Parties are the following:\n\na) **On jurisdiction**\n\n*-*For the Respondent (see Respond. 01.07.09, no. 106):\n\n*In holding that investments marked by fraud were not entitled to such protection [the benefit or the relevant treaties, (n\u00b0 105)] as a matter or jurisdiction, the Tribunals in Inceysa, Fraport and Phoenix Action were not developing new theories. Those Tribunals were applying well-known, accepted principles to interpret jurisdictional issues regarding investment arbitrations. The principles are so well known and obvious and no one would seek to ignore them in a normal civil case or arbitration. What is perhaps more novel is that* ***Tribunals are increasingly applying these principles of judicial common sense to deal with issues of jurisdiction at the outset of investment*** ***arbitrations. The Respondent respectfully submits that that is the course of action that this Tribunal should adopt*** *.* (Emphasis added).\n\n*-*For the Claimant (see Claim. 05.02.2010, p. 23):\n\n*D\u00e9clarer recevable la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd en son action, et dire que le litige soumis par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp contre la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte entre dans la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI et du Tribunal arbitral.*\n\nb) **On the merits**\n\n*-*For the Claimant (see Claim. 05.02.2010, p. 23):\n\n*Au fond,*\n\n*Constater la violation par la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte de ses obligations selon les articles 2(2) et 5 du Trait\u00e9 TBI du 11 juin 1975 au pr\u00e9judice de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd,*\n\n*Dire la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd bien fond\u00e9e en sa demande de compensation aux termes des articles 1, 2 et 5 du Trait\u00e9 TBI du 11 juin 1975 \u00e0 l'encontre de la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte,*\n\n*Dire que cette compensation sera au moins fix\u00e9e \u00e0 la valeur du march\u00e9 et de l'investissement expropri\u00e9 correspondant \u00e0 la valeur des droits conc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd par le contrat annul\u00e9 du 4 novembre 2000,*\n\n*Autoriser la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd \u00e0 justifier du montant de cette compensation conform\u00e9ment au programme fix\u00e9 lors de la s\u00e9ance du Tribunal Arbitral du 31 juillet 2009,*\n\n*En tout \u00e9tat de cause,*\n\n*Dire que la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte sera condamn\u00e9e dans la sentence finale aux entiers frais de proc\u00e9dure en ce compris le remboursement des avances, ainsi qu'au remboursement des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd conform\u00e9ment aux articles 28 et 47 du R\u00e8glement d'Arbitrage.*\n\n*-*For the Respondent (see Respond. 05.03.2010, no. 155):\n\n*The Respondent respectfully submits that Malicorp's claim should be rejected, promptly as an improper attempt to use BIT rights to profit from its own fraud and negligence and its own failure to perform the Concession Contract.*\n\n**3. The structure of the Award**\n---------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nFor the Arbitral Tribunal, these submissions require it to examine the issues in the following order:\n\n- The jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal (B below); and if it finds it has jurisdiction,\n\n- The alleged breaches of the Agreement (C below); and in any event,\n\n- The determination and allocation of the costs and expenses of the arbitration (D below).\n\n**B. THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The issue**\n----------------\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide this case, but the Claimant disputes that.\n\n97.\n\nTo this end, the Respondent argues (see also above, no. 94):\n\n*The Respondent respectfully submits that that* [denial of jurisdiction by virtue of the principle of good faith] *is the course of action that this Tribunal should adopt.*\n\nThe Claimant, in turn, requests the Arbitral Tribunal to\n\n*D\u00e9clarer recevable la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd en son action, et dire que le litige* *soumis par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp contre la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte entre* *dans la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI* [...].\n\nIn order to decide this issue, the Arbitral Tribunal will analyse the conditions required for the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in general, and in particular whether this is a dispute about a protected investment, a point on which the Parties' positions differ.\n\n**2. The decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nIt is not disputed that an arbitral tribunal seised of an objection to jurisdiction not only has the right but the obligation to rule on its own jurisdiction (the \" *Competenz-Competenz* \"). This is expressly confirmed in Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that: \" *The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.* \"\n\nIn this respect, the Parties, and the Respondent in particular, have centred all their arguments around the issue of the alleged fraud and its influence on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, without really discussing the other conditions on which such jurisdiction depends. The Arbitral Tribunal must nevertheless satisfy itself that all the conditions are in fact fulfilled.\n\nThat jurisdiction depends on the instruments on which it is based, making it necessary to begin with a presentation of these.\n\n**2.1. The bases of the Tribunal's jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant bases its claim on two instruments: Article 8 of the Agreement and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nIt is true that the Contract also contains a special provision dealing with dispute resolution (Article 21.3: \" *Resolution of Disputes;* \" see above, no. 93). This, however, covers only arbitration under private international law to resolve strictly contractual actions. The Claimant relied on this clause in order to bring an action under the auspices of the CRCICA before the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal (see above, no. 44 *et seq.*). It is not directly in point here since that system does not apply to these proceedings.\n\n100.\n\na) Article 8 of the Agreement. It is entitled *\"Reference to International Centre for Settlement of International Disputes.* \" In the present context, only the first paragraph is relevant. It is worded as follows:\n\n*Article 8. REFERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES*\n\n*1.) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as \"the Centre\") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former. Such a company of one Contracting Party in which before such a dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party. If any such dispute should arise and agreement cannot be reached within three months between the parties to this dispute through pursuit of local remedies, through conciliation or otherwise, then, if the national or company affected also consents in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention, either party may institute proceedings by addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre as provided in Articles 28 and 36 of the Convention. In the event of disagreement as to whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure the national or company affected shall have the right to choose.*\n\n*Article 8. RENVOI DEVANT LE CENTRE INTERNATIONAL POUR LE R\u00c8GLEMENT DES DIFF\u00c9RENDS RELATIFS AUX INVESTISSEMENTS*\n\n*1) Chaque Partie contractante accepte de soumettre au Centre international pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 \u00ab le Centre \u00bb) pour le r\u00e8glement par voie de conciliation ou d'arbitrage en vertu de la Convention pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d'autres Etats, ouverte \u00e0 la signature \u00e0 Washington le 18 mars 1965 tout diff\u00e9rend de caract\u00e8re juridique opposant cette Partie contractante \u00e0 un ressortissant ou \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'autre Partie contractante au sujet d'un investissement de ce ressortissant ou de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur le territoire de la premi\u00e8re Partie contractante. Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'une des Parties contractantes dans laquelle avant qu'un tel diff\u00e9rend ne se produise des ressortissants ou des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'autre Etat contractant d\u00e9tenaient la majorit\u00e9 des actions sera conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a b du paragraphe 2 de l'article 25 de la Convention assimil\u00e9e aux fins de la Convention \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'autre Partie contractante. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un tel diff\u00e9rend se produit et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d'un commun accord dans un d\u00e9lai de trois mois par les Parties au diff\u00e9rend par les voies de recours internes, par la conciliation ou tout autre moyen, si le ressortissant ou la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en cause* *consent \u00e9galement par \u00e9crit \u00e0 soumettre le diff\u00e9rend au Centre international pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements \u00e0 une conciliation ou \u00e0 un arbitrage en application de la Convention, chaque Partie peut engager une action en adressant une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cet effet au Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Centre comme le pr\u00e9voient les articles 28 et 36 de la Convention. En cas de d\u00e9saccord au sujet de la question de savoir si la conciliation ou l'arbitrage constitue la proc\u00e9dure la plus appropri\u00e9e, le ressortissant ou la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en cause aura le droit de trancher.*\n\n101.\n\nb) Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Article 8(1) of the Agreement expressly makes reference to the procedure established by the ICSID Convention for the resolution of disputes concerning investments. The relevant provision is Article 25(1), which is worded as follows:\n\n*Article 25*\n\n*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n102.\n\nThese two texts, which are clearly related, make the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal subject to a certain number of conditions, most of which - with the exception of one that will be discussed later - are not in dispute in the present case:\n\na) *The consent of the other Contracting State.* The respondent State must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre. By the first sentence of Article 8 of the Agreement, Egypt expressly and validly gave its consent to be subject to such an arbitration proceeding.\n\nb) *The consent of the investor.* The investor intending to take the action must also have consented in writing. Malicorp gave its consent, at the latest, by instituting this proceeding.\n\nc) *The nationality of the investor.* The investor must be a \" *national of the other Contracting State.* \" Malicorp is a company incorporated \" *under the law in force in* [a] *part of the United Kingdom* \" (Article 1(d) of the Agreement) and therefore a company of the other Contracting Party.\n\nd) *A legal dispute.* The dispute must be one that is legal and not political or other. This point is not in issue.\n\ne) *Relating to an investment*. This point is not discussed by the Parties as such, but only from the standpoint of its relationship to the requirements of good faith. The Arbitral Tribunal will return to this later.\n\ne) *In the territory of the other Contracting State.* The investment alleged to have been made by the party bringing the action must have been made in the territory of the other Contracting State. This is the case here with respect to the investments Malicorp claims to have made, since they were intended for the construction and operation of the Ras Sudr Airport in Egypt.\n\nf) *An alleged violation of the Treaty.* The party bringing the action must allege that it was the victim of a violation of the underlying Treaty. In the present case, Malicorp alleges that Egypt breached the obligations prescribed in Articles 2 (\" *Promotion and protection of investments* \") and 5 (\" *Expropriation* \") of the Agreement (Claim. 21.10.2008, pp. 8 **et seq.** ; Claim. 23.10.2009, pp. 28 **et seq.**), an allegation that cannot at this stage be rejected out of hand, subject to what will be said later with regard to the investment.\n\n103.\n\nAs to this, the Arbitral Tribunal nevertheless wishes to point out that the question might seriously have been asked (1) whether this was not *a purely contractual action*, not eligible for the special protection arising from the Agreement and above all, (2) whether the decision given on that basis by the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal is not an obstacle to these proceedings.\n\na) *The basis for the claims* that the Claimant raises in these proceedings rests solely, in the final analysis, on a breach of the Contract, which the Claimant alleges the Respondent rescinded without cause. Although entered into with the State, that Contract purports to be a purely civil law contract (Article 21.1. \"[...] *is deemed to be a civil law contract;\"* see above, no. 93); it is subject to Egyptian civil law (\"[...] *governed by the civil laws of the Republic of Egypt;\"* see above, no. 93) and contains an arbitration clause (above, nos. 93 and 99). It was, indeed, on that basis that the Claimant took action against Egypt by instituting the CRCICA arbitration proceedings as provided in the Contract (above, no. 44 *et seq.*) and it was on that basis that the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal decided the case.\n\nThe claims raised by the Claimant in both proceedings are the same since, in both cases, although for different reasons, it relies on what in its opinion constitutes an unjustified rescission of the Contract. The reasons given by the Respondent for deciding to rescind the Contract do not alter the fact that, for the Claimant, even in such a case, there would be a breach of contract.\n\nThroughout the hearings, Counsel for the Claimant furthermore expressly stated that the amounts that it might obtain under the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal award would be deducted from those it was aiming to obtain in the present proceedings (Transcript 19/20.04.10, p. 68/8-15).\n\nb) *The commercial arbitration proceeding*, in other words under private international law, was completed by the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal; the Claimant partially succeeded since the Republic was ordered, jointly with the two other official bodies sued, to pay it compensation of approximately 14 million dollars (see above, no. 58). By contrast with the Respondent, it did not appeal that award, nor join in the appeal filed by the Republic (see above, no. 59). It follows that, for the Claimant, that award was final. It moreover undertook the necessary steps to have it enforced in at least one country\n\nThe authority as *res judicata* of a decision given by another competent jurisdiction between the same parties, concerning the same claims and based on the same factual and legal bases, prohibits a party from reintroducing a new action that is similar on all points.\n\nc) *The protection afforded by investment treaties* does not necessarily cover purely contractual claims where the parties to the contract have agreed on another clause granting jurisdiction, provided the parties are the same (*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal on Jurisdictional Objections of 29 January 2004 in 8 ICSID Rep. 518 (2005)) *; Joy Mining Machinery Ltd. v. Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award of 6 August 2004 in 132 *Journal du droit international* 163 (2005)) *;* *LESI S.p.A and Astaldi S.p.A v. Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/03, Award of 12 July 2006 published on www.icsid.worlbank.org)). In principle, it is up to the party claiming to have been injured by the breach of a contract to pursue its contracting partner using the avenues laid down for this purpose. So long as a procedure of this type exists for protecting investment, it is not possible to resort to the special methods provided for by treaty if the commercial route, be it arbitration or the local courts, enables all submissions and arguments to be exhausted. It is hard to see how an investment treaty would be breached by the mere fact of a breach of contract, as long as the control mechanisms put in place by that contract are functioning normally. Investment arbitration was not set up to provide a substitute for contracting partners who refrain from following the ordinary procedure by which they have agreed to be bound, nor as a means of appeal for those who have failed to obtain satisfaction (or full satisfaction) by using that procedure. In order for a breach of contract to serve as the basis for jurisdiction of a tribunal in an investment arbitration, such breach must at the same time, and for reasons inherent in the investment protection treaty itself, amount to a violation of that treaty, one that could not be resolved by using the ordinary procedure. Among the matters falling within the scope of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of an arbitral tribunal in an investment case are acts by the host State in the exercise of its public powers (\" *actes de puissance publique* \") that deprive the foreign investor of its rights in violation of the guarantees offered by the Agreement. For example, a decision of the host State to which a commercial arbitral tribunal is bound to give effect, or a rule enacted by the host State which that tribunal must apply, can be brought before a tribunal in an investment arbitration as violating the substantive guarantees offered by the investment treaty.\n\nIt is true that this statement must be qualified:\n\n- The parties to a BIT may agree that all the disputes an investor might raise against the host State must be submitted to the tribunal (the \"umbrella clause\"). Here, again, the claimant must make its choice at the outset; it cannot first attempt a contractual procedure only to resort to the special procedure if it is not satisfied with the result, which is precisely the situation that has arisen in the present case.\n\nIn order to come within the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal, the claims the Claimant intends to derive from a breach of the Contract must be based on the provisions of the Agreement. If and to the extent that such claims are based on breach of the contractual obligations to which the host State agreed within the meaning of the umbrella clause, such claims cannot invalidate the operative conclusions of the CRCICA award (in particular as to the voiding of the Contract). That Award decided the contractual claims of the parties to the Contract, including the claims of and against the host State to the extent that it was acting in its capacity as party to the Contract. By virtue of the principle whereby a party may not contradict itself, and the authority of *res judicata*, the Claimant cannot at the same time both invoke a breach of the Contract on the basis of the Agreement and seek enforcement of the commercial award on the basis of the arbitration clause.\n\n- The reasoning would also be different if the investor pursued the host State on grounds based not on breach of contract, but on other acts: refusal by the State party to the contract to submit to the contractual procedure, the conditions under which the commercial proceedings were conducted, or obstacles placed by the host State in the way of enforcement of the commercial decision. No such acts have been alleged by the Claimant in the present case.\n\nd) The question might have been one for serious discussion in the present case, but the Arbitral Tribunal refrains from doing so for the following reasons:\n\n- At no time has the Republic availed itself of this objection. Moreover, in the CRCICA arbitration proceedings it firmly opposed arbitration as provided for in the Contract, a procedure whose validity it disputed; it appealed the decision of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal finding it had jurisdiction and won the case before the Egyptian state courts on first appeal, though that is the subject of a review currently (apparently) still pending before the Supreme Court (see above, no. 59).\n\nThe inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that by such attitude the Respondent has rejected recourse to the avenues provided for in the Contract. For the Arbitral Tribunal, this raises a degree of uncertainty concerning the outcome of the commercial procedure, which makes it acceptable for the party claiming to have been injured to use the remedies afforded by the Agreement. There can be no question, on the other hand, of reopening the commercial proceedings.\n\n- It is not for this Arbitral Tribunal to rule on the validity of the CRCICA arbitration award; it has not been asked to do so, and nor could the Respondent be held liable for a decision made by an autonomous tribunal. The Claimant has raised no such argument. It has waived any attempt to have the award set aside, but has accepted its conclusions and is seeking to have it compulsorily enforced. The fact that, to date, it has not been successful before a national court does nothing to change that.\n\nNevertheless, to take account of the fact that the CRCICA award has been criticised by the Respondent, this Tribunal shall later re-examine, in the context of the claim based on the umbrella clause, the conclusions reached by the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal in its award.\n\n104.\n\nNor has the Respondent raised any objection concerning the procedure that was followed, in particular in relation to the requirement in Article 8 of the Agreement for a preliminary process of informal settlement. In the light of the proceedings that have taken place, it is moreover hard to imagine that such a measure would have produced a solution.\n\n105.\n\nFrom this standpoint the only issues to be examined - but they are central - concern the notion of an investment dispute (below, 2.2) and above all, the objection based on breach of the principle of good faith (below, 2.3).\n\n**2.2. Is there a dispute arising out of an investment?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe question whether there is an investment protected by the Agreement is one, in principle, for the examination of the merits of the case. However, in order to determine the scope of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Arbitral Tribunal, a determination must be made as to whether the dispute, in particular as delimited by the Claimant's submissions, relates to such an investment. The first question therefore depends on the definition given to the \" *investment* \" that must be the subject of the dispute.\n\n107.\n\nEven though the point is not undisputed, in order for a proceeding based on breach of a treaty to be admissible, the investment to which the dispute relates must pass a double test (also known as the \"double keyhole approach\" or \"double-barrelled test;\" see in this regard C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary*, 2nd Ed., 2009, at Article 25 nos. 122 *et seq.* and the references). It must in practice correspond:\n\n- on the one hand, to the meaning given to the term by the treaty, which defines the framework of the consent given by the State, and also\n\n- on the other, to the meaning given in the ICSID Convention, which determines the jurisdiction of the Centre and the arbitral tribunals acting under its auspices.\n\n108.\n\na) Article 1(a) of the Agreement gives the following definition of an investment:\n\n*\u2018Investment' means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:*\n\n*i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges;*\n\n*ii) shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies;*\n\n*iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;*\n\n*iv) intellectual property rights and goodwill;*\n\n*v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including* *concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.*\n\nThis definition broadly corresponds to those found in numerous bilateral agreements, in particular Article 1 of the United Kingdom's Model Agreement (cf. Schreuer, *op. cit.*, no. 141).\n\nThis definition does not so much stress the contributions made by the party acting, as the rights and assets that such contributions have generated for it. In reality, the wording of other provisions of the Agreement clearly presupposes that there have been contributions, in particular Article 2(1), which makes it an obligation for each Party (to the Agreement) to \"[encourage] *and create favourable conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory* The definition given by Article 1 seems directly related to the measures a State can take to jeopardise them, in particular by expropriation.\n\n109.\n\nb) Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, on the other hand, contains no definition of the notion. The drafters intentionally refrained from doing so in order to leave the maximum freedom for its application in practice (see Schreuer, *op. cit.*, nos. 113 *et seq.*).\n\nA number of arbitral tribunals have suggested definitions, by reference, in particular, to the criteria enumerated in the *Salini v. Morocco* decision (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, *D\u00e9cision sur la competence,* 23 July 2011, para. 3 in 129 *Journal du droit international* 196 (2002); see, *eg.*, Schreuer, *op. cit.*, nos. 152 *et seq.*). Consequently, in its widest, albeit disputed, meaning, there must be (i) a contribution, (ii) of a certain duration, (iii) of a nature such as to generate returns, (iv) presenting a particular risk, and (v) such as to promote the economic development of the host country. Such criteria are not at all absolute and must be regarded as attempts to pin down the notion.\n\n110.\n\nAt first blush, the two definitions do not overlap since they come from different perspectives. In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal these two aspects are in reality complementary. Indeed, the notion of investment must be understood from the perspective of the objectives sought by the Agreement and the ICSID Convention. They are there to \" *promote* \" investments, that is to say, to create the conditions that will encourage foreign nationals to make contributions and provide services in the host country, but also, and to that end, to \" *protect* \" the fruits of such contributions and services. These objectives come from the Preamble to the ICSID Convention, which acknowledges, on the one hand, \" *the role* [\u2026] *of international private investments* \" in \" *international cooperation for economic development,* \" but which in parallel enshrines the need to develop appropriate mechanisms for dispute resolution. The objective of the Agreement is also to pursue \" *the encouragement and reciprocal protection* [\u2026] *of such investments* \" for the \"s *timulation of business initiative* \" and to \" *increase prosperity in both States* \" (preamble). The two aspects are thus complementary. There must be \" *active* \" economic contributions, as is confirmed by the etymology of the word \" *invest,* \" but such contributions must \" *passively* \" have generated the economic assets the instruments are designed to protect.\n\nBoth aspects are reflected in the two underlying texts, but in a complementary manner. Clearly Article 1(a) of the Agreement emphasises the fruits and assets resulting from the investment, which must be protected, whereas the definitions generally used in relation to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention lay stress on the contributions that have created such fruits and assets. It can be inferred from this that assets cannot be protected unless they result from contributions, and contributions will not be protected unless they have actually produced the assets of which the investor claims to have been deprived.\n\n111.\n\nIn the present case, both aspects exist, but in differing proportions:\n\n- It is not disputed that under the Contract the Claimant benefited from a long-term concession that could have generated significant returns, just as it is undisputed that the Grantor prematurely ended that Contract, thereby depriving the Claimant of the revenues it could have made. This is not the place to discuss whether that contract was valid or whether the termination was justified; the Arbitral Tribunal will return to that later. For the Claimant, the loss allegedly represented tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n- It is also not disputed that the relations of the Parties ended very rapidly without the Concessionaire having actually made any significant contributions. Undoubtedly it incurred expenses in preparing its bid and negotiating the Contract; it is also possible that it took other steps thereafter. Neither the file nor the pleadings mention this, but the decision of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal takes it into account. Nevertheless, there is nothing *per se* to prevent the view that the long-term contractual commitment of a party to thereafter perform services fulfilling traditional criteria also amounts to a contribution. It was envisaged that the construction alone would entail costs in excess of 200 million dollars, that the work and most of all the operation of the airport would continue for several years, that the investor would reap profits from it that it estimates in these proceedings at several hundred million dollars, that the project involved risk and that by its nature and size it would contribute to the development of the region's tourism and economy.\n\nIn other words, if proved, the expropriation concerns the expectations from a contract which, although signed, had not yet been performed in any way but which contained a basic commitment.\n\n112.\n\nIf one keeps to the definition given in Article 1 of the Agreement, it appears that the conditions of that definition are fulfilled. According to its statements, the Claimant is indeed claiming \" *assets,* \" in particular \" *claims* \" or \" *any performance under contract having a financial value* \" (iii), as well as asserting to have been deprived of a business concession conferred on it by law or under contract and which would have contributed to Egypt's economic development (v).\n\nFrom that standpoint, the necessary inference is that the condition is fulfilled, in spite of the fact that no mention is made of the underlying contributions.\n\n113.\n\nThe contribution aspect is, however, regularly mentioned in the definitions suggested in relation to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. There has to have been a contribution. The requirement appears reasonable since the basic objective is, indeed, to encourage the foreign national to take the risk of performing services in the host country. It is true that the protection will thereafter extend to the assets thus created by the contribution in the form of property, rights or claims. It will be admitted, therefore, that the host State also intended to commit to arbitrate disputes involving the type of contribution it wanted to encourage by entering into the Agreement.\n\nIn the case of a contract, it has been rightly held that the costs incurred during negotiations with a view to concluding a contract do not constitute an investment if in the end the State finally refuses to sign it (cf. Schreuer, *op. cit*., Article 25, nos. 175 *et*\n\n*seq.*). The situation in the present case is different since the Contract was indeed signed (see in support *PSEG v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award of 19 January 2007, para. 304, published on http://icsid.worldbank.org; and Schreuer, *op. cit*., *ad.* Article 25, no. 179). It is true that Malicorp does not appear to have performed many services in connection with it. Nonetheless, the fact of being bound by that Contract implied an obligation to make major contributions in the future. That commitment constitutes the investment; it entails the promise to make contributions in the future for the performance of which that party is henceforth contractually bound. In other words, the protection here extends to deprivation of the revenue the investor had a right to expect in consideration for contributions that it had not yet made, but which it had contractually committed to make subsequently.\n\n114.\n\nFor these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the dispute arises out of an investment. Thus, at the stage of deciding on jurisdiction, there is no need to examine whether the Contract that constitutes the investment was validly rescinded, with the result that there was, ultimately, no actual investment; that issue belongs specifically to the merits of the case.\n\n**2.3. The question of the alleged breach of the principle of good faith**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe second issue in this context is linked, in part, to the statement just made. It consists of verifying whether the Arbitral Tribunal would still have jurisdiction in the event the investor were seeking protection in a manner that was contrary to the principle of good faith.\n\nThe crux of the arguments put forward by the Respondent rests on this aspect. According to the Respondent, compliance with good faith is an essential principle of international law, which principle extends to the investment protection regime. It infers from this that such protection excludes the protection of investments made in violation of this principle. In the present case, it argues, the Respondent entered into the Contract on the basis of a forgery. In support of its thesis it cites two recent decisions (Respond. 01.01.09, nos. 71 *et seq.*, referring to *Inceysa v. El Salvador*, reference in Exhibit R-Lex, pp. 10-11 and to *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic*, reference in Exhibit R-Lex, pp. 20-21). The Claimant for its part mainly contests the facts alleged, in particular that the Contract was obtained on the basis of a forgery.\n\n116.\n\nIt is indisputable, and this Arbitral Tribunal can do no more than confirm it, that the safeguarding of good faith is one of the fundamental principles of international law and the law of investments. As in domestic law, the principle fulfils a complementary function; it allows for lacunae in the applicable laws to be filled, and for that law to be clarified by the specific application of existing principles.\n\nFor the Arbitral Tribunal, this can occur in at least two contexts:\n\n- Where protection is requested *in conditions* that are contrary to the principle of good faith. It does not seem to be open to challenge that the protection afforded by investment treaties does not extend to cases in which an investor has created the conditions therefor in a manner contrary to the principle of good faith, in particular by resorting to a veritable abuse of the law: for example, when one party, usually aware of the restrictive measures that a State can take, has artificially created the conditions for protection, alone or with the complicity of third parties. This would be the case where a party uses stratagems to give the impression that it has acquired or is acquiring the nationality of a contracting country, with the sole aim of benefiting from the protection afforded by a treaty (see *Cementownia v. Turkey,* ICSID Case ARB(AF)/06/2, Award of 17 September 2009; *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award of 15 April 2009 published on http://icsid.worldbank.org). In such hypotheses the defect not only undermines the rights of the investor on the merits, but also, *a priori*, his right to an arbitration of the related dispute. There is no need to examine these cases further in the present context, since the situation here does not fall within those hypotheses.\n\n- Where protection is requested *for an investment* alleged to have been made under conditions contrary to the principle of good faith. This is the case when the \"investment\" is the result of corruption, or has been obtained by deception or fraud. In such cases, the defect undermines not only the right to invoke the protection of an agreement, but also the investment alleged to have been made by the party seeking protection. The hypothesis central to the present decision falls within this context.\n\n117.\n\nWith respect to this latter hypothesis, arbitral tribunals that have had occasion to examine issues of this nature have addressed them from different angles. To simplify, they have mainly opted for one of the two following approaches (see Abby CohenSmutny and Petr Polasek, \" *Unlawful or Bad Faith Conduct as a Bar to Claims in Investment Arbitration* \" in A Liber Amicorum: Thomas W\u00e4lde (2009)):\n\n- Some have addressed the issue at the outset of the case, *from the standpoint of jurisdiction.* In order for the jurisdiction of an ICSID arbitral tribunal to be established, the State against which proceedings are brought must have validly given its consent. In such proceedings this presupposes that the party bringing the claim has made an investment that meets the requirements the State may have laid down, as well as the general conditions of validity (*Saba Fakes v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award of 14 July 2010, paragraph 108; denying however that good faith constitutes a precondition for jurisdiction, see paragraph 112). That is why questions of the possible application of the principle of good faith are approached from the standpoint of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as part of the examination of jurisdiction (in particular, *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic*, *op. cit.*).\n\n- Other tribunals have examined the issue at the second stage, *from the standpoint of the merits*, in relation to the validity of the investment. In order for an ICSID arbitral tribunal to be able to render an award against a State for breach of obligations concerning the protection of an investment, such investment must be valid. That is why the issue of the possible application of the principle of good faith is then considered as part of the issues on the merits.\n\n118.\n\nThe distinction between the two approaches is not of merely theoretical significance, if only because of the remedies available against the decision. Undoubtedly there are good reasons for choosing one or the other approach, and it is possible that the circumstances in which the issue arises can justify different solutions. It is not the intention of this Arbitral Tribunal to provide a general answer to the question.\n\n119.\n\nIn the present case, there are strong arguments in favour of the second solution, which consists in examining the issue of the validity of the investment at the merits stage.\n\na) The solution derives, first, from the *principle of autonomy of the arbitration agreement*, a principle so fundamental that it also has its place in investment arbitration. According to that principle, defects undermining the validity of the substantive legal relationship, which is the subject of the dispute on the merits, do not automatically undermine the validity of the arbitration agreement. Thus, an arbitral tribunal is competent to decide on the merits even if the main contract was entered into as a result of misrepresentation or corruption. Only defects that go to the consent to arbitrate itself can deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction. In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that the consent to arbitrate, as distinct from the consent to the substantive guarantees in the bilateral Agreement, was obtained by misrepresentation or corruption or even by mistake. The allegations of the Respondent relate to the granting of the Concession. However, it is not the Contract that provides the basis for the right to arbitrate, but the State's offer to arbitrate contained in the Agreement and the investor's acceptance of that offer. The offer to arbitrate thereby covers all disputes that might arise in relation to that investment, including its validity.\n\n*b) The hypotheses described* relate, in a general sense, to the possible grounds for invalidity of an investment. But such grounds are extremely numerous and varied: it is hard to find a basis for drawing distinctions between them in order to determine how and at what point they must be examined. All of them could be encompassed, *per se*, by the notion that the consent of the State applies only to valid investments. Undoubtedly certain grounds, in particular those that might be inferred from breach of the principle of good faith with regard to the investment, have a particular value but that does not justify creating a special category calling for priority treatment. There is even less justification in that, in the jurisdictional phase, it is often difficult to determine whether the ground derives from an act contrary to good faith, in relation to the conclusion of a contract, for example, from a threat or misrepresentation, or another related cause not involving bad faith, for example mistake. In those circumstances, it seems more appropriate to defer the examination until the merits phase.\n\nThis is surely so in the present case, where the Parties' opinions differ on whether or not the Contract was entered into as the result of fraud, misrepresentation or mistake.\n\n*c) The factual analyses of these hypotheses* most often requires an in-depth examination, which is difficult to separate out as the facts may be closely interwoven. The existence, nature and value of the investment are in large part verified through the same process of inquiry, thus it is preferable to examine and deal with all aspects simultaneously. It was, moreover, for these reasons that, at the start of the proceedings, this Arbitral Tribunal rejected the Respondent's request to deal separately with issues of jurisdiction (see above, no. 80 b)) and that its examination of the case has also covered the merits\n\n**2.4. First conclusion**\n-------------------------\n\n120.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing reasoning, it shall be decided that:\n\n***(1) The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on the claims of the Claimant.***\n\n**C. THE ALLEGED BREACHES OF THEAGREEMENT**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The issue**\n----------------\n\n121.\n\nOn the question of the Respondent's breaches of its obligations to the Claimant, the two Parties also make opposing submissions:\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant submits as follows:\n\n\" *Constater la violation par la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte de ses obligations selon les articles 2(2) et 5 du Trait\u00e9 TBI du 11 juin 1975 au pr\u00e9judice de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Malicorp Ltd.* \"\n\nWhile the Respondent submits as follows:\n\n\" *The Respondent respectfully submits that Malicorp's claim should be rejected, promptly as an improper attempt to use BIT rights to profit from its own fraud and negligence and its own failure to perform the Concession Contract.* \"\n\nIt will be recalled (see above, no. 80 b)) that the Arbitral Tribunal has decided in this phase of the proceedings to decide only the question whether there was a violation of the obligations under the Agreement, and, if it finds in the affirmative, to examine at a later stage the amount to which the Claimant might be entitled as a result.\n\n122.\n\nThe starting point must be an examination of the bases for the Claimant's claim (below, 2.), followed by an analysis of the reasons relied upon by the Respondent in support of its decision to end the Contract, as they relate to the conclusion of the Contract, on the one hand (below, 3.) and its performance, on the other (below, 4.).\n\n**2. The bases of the claim**\n-----------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimant relies on Article 2 and Article 5 of the Agreement (Claim. 21.10.08, p. 10; Claim. 05.02.10, p. 23).\n\na) Article 2 of the Agreement is entitled *\"Promotion and protection of investment.* \" The first paragraph deals with promotion; the second, the only one of interest to us in this context, is worded as follows (for the sake of clarity, the Arbitral Tribunal has added the references in brackets):\n\n[sentence 1] *Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n[sentence 2] *Each Contracting Party shall ensure that the management,* *maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party is not in any way impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.* [sentence 3] *Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.*\n\nb) Article 5 of the Agreement is entitled *\"Expropriation;\"* The second paragraph is not relevant to the present situation; the first is worded as follows (for the sake of clarity, the Arbitral Tribunal has added the references in brackets):\n\n[sentence 1] *Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018expropriation') in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.* [sentence 2] *Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation itself or before there was an official government announcement that expropriation would be effected in the future, whichever is the earlier, shall be made without delay, be effectively realisable and be freely transferable.* [sentence 3] *The national or company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of whether the expropriation is in conformity with domestic law and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.*\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that in the present case the Respondent breached each of the two provisions concurrently.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal accepts that there is no reason *per se* why a State cannot both breach the prohibitions enumerated in Article 2 and take expropriatory measures within the meaning of Article 5. Nevertheless, when an investor bases its action principally on the fact that it has been the victim of an expropriation, that measure necessarily implies treatment that was, precisely, neither fair nor equitable. In order to rely on both provisions, the investor must be able to establish that it has also been the victim of other measures, different from expropriation.\n\nThis condition has not been fulfilled in the present case since the Claimant's sole but essential complaint concerns the rescission of the Contract. Nowhere in its pleadings does it explain in what way it was also the victim of unfair or inequitable treatment, giving rise to additional consequences.\n\n125.\n\nFor the Claimant, the Republic breached these obligations by unilaterally deciding to rescind or terminate the Concession Contract without compensation, for reasons it says were connected to public security; in so doing, it breached its contractual obligations and took a measure formally amounting to an expropriation (Claim. 23.10.2009, p. 29). In this regard, the Claimant refers, among others, to the case of *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Egypt* (Claim. 23.10.2009, pp. 32 *et seq.*).\n\nThe signature of the Contract conferred on the Claimant the right to operate the airport to be built for 41 years, to use the 30 square kilometres of allocated lands around the construction, and benefit from the transfer, free of charge, of ownership of 300 square kilometres of land around the area under concession (Claim. 23.10.2009, p. 32). By ending the Contract without just cause, the Defendant is consequently said to have breached Article 5 of the Agreement (*ibidem*).\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, considers that it was entitled to rescind the Contract, and that therefore there was no breach of its obligations or, consequently, any measure of expropriation. In order to benefit from Article 5 of the Agreement, an investment must be made in good faith and must be within the scope of application of the Agreement (Respond. 01.07.09, no. 97).\n\n126.\n\nThe first question, therefore, is whether the Republic had the right to discharge itself from the Contract pursuant to the private law rules governing it (see above, no. 93). If that is the case, it is unnecessary to examine whether the Respondent also took a measure under its public powers (\" *measures de puissance publique* \"), not as a party to the Contract but as a State, the effectiveness and conformity with the Agreement of which would have to be examined. Indeed, the rescission of the Contract would not leave any subsisting breach of the umbrella clause nor, moreover, in the absence of a protected investment, of other clauses of the Agreement.\n\n127.\n\nIn order to decide whether the Contract was validly rescinded by the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal must first turn to the letter that the Ministry of Transport sent to the Respondent on 12 August 2001 (Exhibit C-33 = R-2, pp. 393 and 396), by which the Respondent discharged itself from the Concession Contract. That letter, sent in Arabic in its original version and in English, is worded as follows (the Arbitral Tribunal has added the numbers in brackets for ease of reference):\n\n*Gentlemen,*\n\n*With reference to the concluded contract with your company for the construction, operation and transfer of the Ras Sudr Airport (BOT concession) and regardless of the repeated warnings to you on the dates of December 2000, January 2001 and the ultimatum on 18/2/2001 to complete the establishment papers of the Egyptian company according to law no. 8 for 1997 and to send the project's plan of work and amendment of the letters of guarantee to be final then giving you another grace period until 28/2/2001, nothing has been accomplished;*\n\n[1] *And whereas the company has submitted to the Authority doubtful papers,* *a matter that forced the Authority to send you a letter on 30/5/2001 asking you to bring the authentic and real documents and gave you a grace period until 30/6/2002 then extended to 31/7/2001;*\n\n[2] *And whereas the company submitted invalid papers to the security* *departments about the names of the partners in the English company 'Malicorp Ltd.';*\n\n[3] *And whereas the company has forsaken in establishing and founding the Egyptian company according to the Egyptian law and whose date according to* *the contracting was fixed until 3/2/2001 and in addition to other breaches committed by the company;*\n\n[4] *And whereas it has been proven that you are not serious in executing the contracting provisions which has been concluded on 4/11/2001 and until this very date which led to non starting of the project until this very date and has not exceeded nine months;*\n\n*THEREUPON the above mentioned it has been decided to terminate the contract signed with your company and to confiscate the amount of the letter of guarantee, with preserving the right to revert to you by the indemnification for the resulting damages which are borne by our company and the Egyptian Government due to the non-starting of the execution of one of the vital and important projects included in the State's plan for economic development.*\n\n*Very truly yours,*\n\n*The Chairman of the board of directors Abdel Fattah M. Kato.*\n\n128.\n\nIt will be seen from reading the letter that the Respondent invokes two types of grounds, which the Arbitral Tribunal will examine in turn:\n\n- The first (numbers 1 and 2) are based on reasons having to do with the *conclusion of the Contract*, above all the fact that the Respondent allegedly submitted *\"doubtful papers\"\"* and *\"invalid papers about* [...] *the English company.* \" This goes to the validity of the Contract itself.\n\n- The others (numbers 3 and 4) relate to the fact that after signature of the Concession Contract, the Claimant *breached certain of its obligations*, primarily the provision of certain required documents, its slowness in setting up a company under Egyptian law, its lack of commitment and failure to carry out the first steps as expected. This goes to the performance of the Contract.\n\n129.\n\nIt is true that the Claimant takes the view that these grounds are mere pretexts, and that the real reason lies in a change of government policy concerning the development of the airports network. Evidence of that, allegedly, is that no other airport has been built since, and that another project suffered the same fate as that of Ras Sudr, with the Arab Republic of Egypt agreeing in that case to indemnify the Concessionaire (Transcript 19/20.04.10, p. 39/25-40).\n\nIt is possible that the Government did later modify its policy. It was entitled to do that, but, in so doing, it breached obligations it had validly undertaken: it was bound to respect them or, if it did not, to fully indemnify the other party. That still presupposes, however, that those obligations were valid. A contracting party cannot be prohibited from discharging itself from a contract where it has legitimate reasons for doing so, even if, indirectly, the measure suits its convenience and enables it to go back on choices made earlier. Put another way, the first question to ask is whether the reasons given by the Respondent in its letter of termination justify the termination.\n\n**3. The reasons relating to the conclusion of the Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe first question with respect to the first two grounds is whether the Contract was validly entered into, whether it was void from the outset because the circumstances in which it was concluded contravened the principle of good faith, or whether it was capable of being rescinded because of a defect in consent, namely misrepresentation or mistake. The answer depends, in the first place, on the rules applicable to it, in this case Egyptian civil law.\n\nAs has been seen (see above, no. 44 *et seq*.), these issues have already been examined and decided in the CRCICA arbitration proceedings instituted by the Claimant pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Contract. In its award of 7 March 2006, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal held, in particular, that there was no proof of forgery or fraud, but that it had, on the other hand, been established that the Respondent had entered into the Contract while labouring under a mistake, and that, therefore, it had the right to discharge itself from it. That said, since it bore part of the responsibility for that mistake, it was only fair that it should be made to bear part of the costs incurred by the Claimant.\n\nHaving decided not to re-examine that decision, this Arbitral Tribunal could have limited itself to basing its ruling on the said decision. However, as has been seen (see above, no. 59) the Respondent refuses to submit to that decision or to accept its conclusions. The uncertainty that persists, therefore, justifies the Arbitral Tribunal in verifying, as a matter ancillary to the guarantees offered by the Agreement, that, even if that award were to be set aside, the conclusions arrived at by this Arbitral Tribunal would be no different from those of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal. The fact is that, if the only conclusion to be drawn is that there were sufficient grounds for rescinding the Contract, there would be nothing left to protect.\n\n131.\n\nThe first reason given by the Respondent for discharging itself from the Contract was that it had allegedly been misled by the submission of inaccurate documents concerning the Claimant's financial capacities.\n\n132.\n\na) *In the call for tender documents* (see above, no. 4), the Respondent had clearly indicated the importance it attached to the financial capacities of the company to be selected, as under a B.O.T. contract, that company would have to bear all the costs of construction (Exhibit R-2, p. 46, item 2: \" *Investor must bear all the costs of studies,* *design, construction and preparations of all the constituent to operation, services, security requirements and others under the supervision of the Authority* \"). That was why each bidder was obliged to clarify, in its bid, the legal form of the company that would be responsible for performing the Contract, and in particular \" *its own and its company's financial capability and the sources of financing* \" (Exhibit R-2, p. 48, item 11). That was the reason for the specific requirement that documents be included stating the *\"qualitative of finance and*  *the issued capital* \" (Exhibit R-2, p. 48, item 15; emphasis by the Arbitral Tribunal).\n\nThat requirement is easy to understand, because this was not a straightforward construction contract, financed by the project owner, but a B.O.T. contract in which it was the contracting partner who, initially, bore the entire burden of financing.\n\n133.\n\nb) *In its bid*, the Claimant submitted its Memorandum of Association, which showed that it had a capital of 1000 pounds sterling divided into 1,000 shares of one pound sterling each (see above, no. 7; Exhibit R-2, p. 23, no. 5: \" *The Company's share capital is \u00a3 1000 divided into 1000 shares of \u00a3 1 each* \"). It is true that Malicorp decided on 15 September 1999 to increase its capital to 100 million pounds sterling, but that was not subscribed capital, but authorised capital (see above, no. 6). The difference is substantial, because in the first case there are shareholders who have made a firm commitment to pay it, while in the second, there is only a power given to the company's organs to decide when they will look for shareholders willing to commit.\n\nThe bid apparently contained agreements entered into with three companies which had expressed an interest, in principle, in being part of the project, but none of them clearly stated that they agreed to be responsible for all or part of the financing (Exhibit R-2, p. 49 *et seq*.). What is clear, on the other hand, from the Claimant's statements is that the estimated cost of the construction according to J&P was 232,000,000 dollars.\n\nBriefly put, this meant that Malicorp had to be in a position to finance at least that amount itself, or to secure financing; furthermore, that sum covered only the construction, but not the first years of operation, which no one could sensibly expect to be profitable from the start. However, in the light of the evidence on the record, none of the founding members of Malicorp could produce such large sums of money, either from their own resources or from partners prepared to take a risk of that magnitude.\n\n134.\n\nc) At a date that is not established, the representatives of Malicorp were *summoned to a meeting* with the representatives of the Respondent (see above, no. 8). According to the invitation (Exhibit R-2, p. 82), the purpose was to answer certain questions and provide certain clarifications. The first (see above, no. 1) specifically concerned \" *the details of the capital (issued and licensed).* \" As can be seen, this did not refer merely to the authorised capital, but also the issued and paid-up capital.\n\nThe meeting took place on 3 January 2000 (see above, no. 8). Those attending on the Claimant's side were: Messrs. El Sayed Mohamed Abu El Ela, Mahmoud Shakir Ibraim, Azmi Mohamed El Teraee and Kateen Beshara. A minute was drawn up, which states that Mr. Mahmoud Shakir Ibraim began by producing written authority from Malicorp to answer questions at that meeting. That written authority (or \" *assignment* \") was annexed to the minutes of the committee. On the question concerning Malicorp's capital, the minutes state the following:\n\n\" *Upon their question* [that of the Respondent's representatives] *concerning the first point details of the capital he responded by the following \u2018The Original Company with which the contracting shall be concluded and which submitted the offer is the British Company*  ***Malicorp Ltd,***  *a company established under the British law and its residence is in London with its capital of one hundred million Sterling pounds according to the attached commercial register which was reviewed by the Committee's members.* \"\n\nThe statement would have been correct if it had made it clear that it referred not to the issued and paid-up capital as stated in the question, but to the authorised capital, which is obviously meaningless as long as the sources of financing of this capital are not given. Given its decisive importance, it would have been consistent with the principle of good faith and the reasonable expectations of the contracting partner for Malicorp's representatives to make that clear. In practice, it could be said that in business dealings, the mention of \" *capital* \" refers at the least to capital that is subscribed if not paid-up, and not merely to authorised capital, this being only a measure prior to subscription.\n\n135.\n\nd) *Annexed to the minutes of the meeting* was an official statement concerning Malicorp Ltd. This was allegedly an extract made on 15 September 1999 of the \" *Register of companies for England and Wales,* \" certifying that the company had been incorporated on 6 August 1997 (Exhibit R-2, p. 90 *et seq*.). The item numbered 5 in that document states: \" *The Company's share capital is \u00a3100 million divided into one million shares of \u00a3100 each* \" (Exhibit R-2, p. 94). Nowhere does the text make it clear which type of capital this is.\n\nThis is the document that lies at the root of most of the proceedings and disputes that have taken place:\n\n- The Cairo Court of Assizes took the view, based among other things on the pre-hearing interrogatories, that this was in fact a forgery. It nonetheless finally acquitted most of those charged with that offence, with the exception of two persons tried in their absence, against whom the judgment appears not to be final.\n\n- The CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal left undecided the question whether or not it was a forgery; it deemed it sufficient to find that the Respondent had been led to enter into the Contract while labouring under an essential mistake, since the civil law consequences of an inaccurate and fraudulent statement under the Egyptian Civil Code are the same as those for a mistake.\n\n- The pleadings before the present Arbitral Tribunal have not enabled it to reach a clear conclusion, especially since it was not possible for the Respondent to produce the original of the suspect document, but only a photocopy taken from a fax. Even though serious indications do exist, they are not enough to support a clear conclusion on a matter of such capital importance.\n\n136.\n\nIt is neither the intention of the present Arbitral Tribunal, nor within its terms of reference, to conduct a detailed investigation into the authenticity of the suspect document. It suffices to find that the nature and content of the information supplied to the Respondent by Malicorp's representatives was such as to give rise to an essential mistake; for a project as monumental as that of the Ras Sudr airport, knowing whether the company awarded the project is an empty shell or a company with exceptional resources is obviously fundamental, and any error on that point justifies calling the Contract into question. That, moreover, as has been seen (see above, no. 58), is the conclusion reached by the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n137.\n\nIn these circumstances, the present Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the principal reason given by the Respondent in its letter rescinding the Contract was sufficiently well founded, and gave the Respondent the right to withdraw from the Contract. It follows that the rescission of the Contract cannot be considered as a form of expropriation under international law.\n\nThat same letter alludes, moreover, to other circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the Contract, notably in relation to the composition of the company. Without wishing, or needing, to enter into a detailed discussion, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that, in fact, the entire legal, financial and even technical set-up leaves a sense of insecurity and vagueness, incompatible with the dimensions of the project at stake. In this regard it is enough to point to the existence and content of the letter from Mr. El Ala (Exhibit R-2, p. 336 *et seq*.); whatever the veracity of the accusations it contains, it is evidence in itself of a pernicious climate among the people who were to bear responsibility for the project. This can only be an aggravating factor.\n\n**4. The reasons relating to performance of the Contract**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nQuite different is the question whether, as the Respondent has contended, Malicorp failed, after signature of the Contract, to comply with the obligations it had agreed to carry out at once, namely the steps necessary to put the project into practice. Even if the answer to the previous question is enough in itself to enable it to rule on the submissions before it, the Arbitral Tribunal deems it appropriate, out of an excess of caution, to briefly review these.\n\n139.\n\nIt seems in fact that, very shortly after the signing of the Contract, the Respondent issued a formal notice to the Claimant to comply with its obligations. It seems doubtful to the Arbitral Tribunal whether, just a few weeks after signing a contract of such magnitude, the Egyptian authorities would have been able to set in motion a process designed to free themselves from the Contract for reasons that had nothing to do with the project - unless it accepts that in the space of just a few weeks there was a radical turnaround in security policy, though there is nothing in the record to support that theory. After that, several other formal notices were issued (see above, nos. 18, 20, 22).\n\n140.\n\nThe first obligation concerned the setting up of the Egyptian company. It is not disputed that the incorporation did not take place in the time allowed. One primary reason is that the Claimant delayed in taking the necessary steps to set it up. Admittedly, for the Respondent, the incorporation of that company was critical. First, because the Contract had also been entered into in the name of the company to be formed (see above, no. 15); next, and most of all, because it had to show sufficient financial capacity to guarantee the solidity and reliability of the operation. The capital was subscribed by Malicorp, which, however, had not yet significantly increased its own capital. It is possible that the application was delayed by the Respondent's own procrastination, but that situation, while clearly the case, arose only later during the process of termination, by which time the project was already faltering.\n\nThe Claimant has criticised the Respondent for not having made available to it the additional land promised in the Contract for its own use. That criticism is correct, but bears no direct relation to the breach of the obligation to set up the company, unless, as has been suggested, that land could have served as security for the company's founders to obtain loans for funds they did not have.\n\n141.\n\nThe second criticism set out in the letter of rescission relates to the performance of the Contract. True, the Arbitral Tribunal has indeed decided that the issue of damages and thus, indirectly, of lost investments would be dealt with in a second phase, in the event it found initially in the Claimant's favour. The fact remains, though, that at no time has the Claimant attempted to persuade the Arbitral Tribunal that it actually did, at the outset, take the significant legal, financial and most of all technical steps required to launch such a project. The delays in taking the first steps and the absence of any practical progress, especially where the potential partners were concerned, could well have added to the doubts and concerns of the Egyptian authorities. At no time, in fact, has the Claimant attempted to show that this last criticism was unfounded. Such a situation could have been explained by internal problems and the dissent that surfaced within the group of promoters, as is shown by the letter from Mr. El Ala, among other things. Briefly put, the project never got off the ground, or if it did, it got off to a bad start.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal cannot simply disregard this criticism. While it is true, as it has accepted (see above, no. 114), that the mere conclusion of a contract of the same type as the one that was signed can of itself amount to an investment, there must still be a realistic prospect that its beneficiary can perform it. The conditions surrounding the initial performance of this Contract give rise to serious doubts.\n\n142.\n\nIt follows that, to the Arbitral Tribunal, the criticisms levelled by the Respondent in its letter of rescission concerning the performance of the Contract appear sufficiently plausible for it to reject the complaint that they were merely a pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory measure.\n\n**5. Second conclusion**\n------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing analysis that, to the Arbitral Tribunal, the reasons on which the Respondent relied in order to bring the Contract to an end appear serious and adequate; the termination, justified in fact and in law, could not be interpreted as an expropriatory measure.\n\nConsequently, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide that\n\n***(2) The Claimant's submissions based on the principle of compensation for*** ***expropriation are rejected.***\n\nThis conclusion calls for an additional comment. The CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal decided (see above, no. 58) that, even though it was entitled to discharge itself from the Contract, the Respondent must bear part of the costs and damages its decision generated for the Claimant. In so doing, it accepted that the representatives of the Arab Republic of Egypt were indeed mistaken, but that they bore some share of the responsibility, in that they had not made adequate inquiries into the position. Even if that argument does not seem unreasonable, it is outside the scope of these proceedings, as the Claimant has not formally made any additional submissions on the subject.\n\n**D. DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF THEARBITRATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nEach of the Parties has submitted that the other should be ordered to bear all the costs of the arbitration and reimburse the amounts incurred for its representation in this case.\n\n145.\n\nWhen invited by the Arbitral Tribunal to submit a list of their expenses (see above, no. 88):\n\n- The Claimant submitted that it had expended a total of 239,734.14 euro;\n\n- The Respondent submitted that it had expended 489,773.60 dollars.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal must make a final determination, since the claim is dismissed.\n\n**2. The Arbitral Tribunal's position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\n*The principle* is that the Arbitral Tribunal has broad discretion in this regard.\n\n147.\n\n*The outcome of the proceedings* is undoubtedly the first factor the Arbitral Tribunal can and must take into account. In the present case, the outcome is shared, since the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction is rejected, but the Claimant's claim is dismissed on the merits. There are good reasons, therefore, to decide that the costs and expenses should be shared.\n\n148.\n\n*The decision on the merits* seems to support this conclusion, in the light of the facts. True, the Claimant's attitude in the way it presented, and later embarked on, the project has carried particular weight in the outcome of the proceedings. Nonetheless -and in this respect it concurs with the assessment of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal -this Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Respondent was not itself completely beyond reproach in the phase leading to the conclusion of the Contract.\n\n**3. Third and fourth conclusions**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn the light of the foregoing arguments, the Tribunal will decide that\n\n***(3) Each Party shall bear one half of the costs of the arbitration proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the fees of ICSID, as subsequently determined and notified to the Parties by the Centre;***\n\n***(4) Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees and expenses of representation incurred in the present proceedings.***\n\n**III. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n**For these reasons, it is decided that:**\n\n***1. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on the claims of the Claimant;***\n\n***2. The prayer for relief of the Claimant aimed at the principle of a compensation for expropriation is rejected;***\n\n***3. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the costs of ICSID, as subsequently determined and notified to the Parties by the Centre, shall be borne by both Parties in equal shares;***\n\n***4. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees and expenses of representation incurred in the present proceedings;***\n\n***5.

Introduction and Procedural History**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 1, 2011, Malicorp Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"Malicorp,\" \"Applicant,\" or \"Claimant\"), filed an Application for Annulment (the \"Application\") with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"). Malicorp sought annulment of the award rendered on February 7, 2011, in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18 between the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"Egypt\" or \"Respondent\" or the \"Republic\") and Malicorp (the \"Award\"). The Application was submitted within the time period provided for by Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute arose under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of June 11, 1975 (the \"BIT\").1 It related to the termination of a \"Build-Operate-Transfer\" contract, entered into by Egypt, then represented by the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, and Malicorp, for the construction, management, operation and transfer of the *Ras Sudr* International Airport (the \"Contract\").2\n\n*See* Award, para. 74.\n\n*See* Award, paras. 15 and 33.\n\n3.\n\nThe Award summarized as follows the views of Malicorp and Egypt (collectively, the \"Parties\") as to why the Contract was terminated:\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Contract was terminated for reasons connected to national security (Claim. 23.07.2009, no. III-2, p. 12; Claim. 23.10.2009, no. III-2, p. 15; Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 133). That being so, such termination entitled it to compensation for the damage caused by unfair treatment and the expropriation of its investment (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 151; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 27).\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Contract was terminated for a reason contained in the Contract itself. Malicorp had allegedly produced false documents, had not fulfilled its obligation to set up an Egyptian company, had failed to provide the necessary guarantees and had failed to properly perform the Concession Contract (Respond. 08.01.2010, no. 133; Respond. 01.07.2009, no. 27).3\n\nAward, para. 33.\n\n4.\n\nWhile Applicant argued that Egypt had acted in violation of the BIT's provisions on fair and equitable treatment and expropriation,4 Respondent contended that \"Malicorp's claim should be rejected, promptly as an improper attempt to use BIT rights to profit from its own fraud and negligence and its own failure to perform the Concession Contract.\"5\n\n*See* Award, para. 121.\n\nAward, paras. 84, 94, and 121.\n\n5.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal, comprised of Professor Pierre Tercier (a national of Switzerland) (presiding), Professor Luiz Olavo Baptista (a national of Brazil), and Mr. Pierre-Yves Tschanz (a national of Switzerland), decided, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(i) it had jurisdiction to rule on Applicant's claims;6 and\n\n(ii) \"[...] the reasons on which the Respondent relied in order to bring the Contract to an end appear[ed] serious and adequate; the termination, justified in fact and in law, could not be interpreted as an expropriatory measure.\"7\n\n(iii) Therefore, Applicant's submissions based on \"the principle of compensation for expropriation [were] rejected.\"8\n\n*See* Award, para. 120, p. 47.\n\nAward, para. 143.\n\nAward, para. 143, p. 47.\n\n6.\n\nAs indicated above, Malicorp filed its Application on June 1, 2011.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and notified the Parties of the registration in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2)(a) and (b).\n\n8.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov (a national of Bulgaria), Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero (a national of Colombia and France), and Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (a national of Spain), as President, was constituted. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee (the \"Secretary\").\n\n9.\n\nOn December 5, 2011, the Committee held a first session with the Parties. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006.9 The Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted and had no objections with regard to the declarations by its Members.10 The Parties also agreed on a number of other procedural matters reflected in the Minutes of the First Session (the \"Minutes of the First Session\"), including the procedural language. The Parties and the Committee thus agreed that:\n\nEach party may file its submissions, including correspondence, and plead in French or English without the need for translation.\n\nDocuments filed in French or English shall not be accompanied by a translation. Documents originally written in a language other than French or English must be translated into French or English.\n\nThe verbatim transcripts of the hearings shall be in French and English.\n\nThe procedural orders and the decision shall be given in French and English. As in the arbitration proceeding, the authentic language shall be French. It is specified that the Committee may refer in its decision to positions expressed by the Parties in French or English or to legal instruments in English without the need for translation into the other language.\n\nThe Centre shall correspond in French or English without translation.\n\nThe Parties agree that the minutes of this session shall be drawn up in French and English.11\n\n*See* Minutes of the First Session of the Annulment Proceeding, held on December 5, 2011, para. 5 (\"Minutes of the First Session\").\n\n*See* Minutes of the First Session, para. 1.\n\nMinutes of the First Session, para. 7.\n\n10.\n\nThe French and English versions of the Minutes of the First Session signed by the President of the Committee and the Secretary were circulated to the Parties on January 9, 2012.\n\n11.\n\nOn March 5, 2012, Applicant submitted its Memorial (the \"Memorial\") requesting the annulment of the Award.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial (the \"Counter-Memorial\"), dated June 5, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nOn August 1, 2012, Applicant submitted its Reply (the \"Reply\").\n\n14.\n\nOn October 3, 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu would henceforth replace Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n15.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder (the \"Rejoinder\"), dated October 5, 2012.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing telephone conference with the Parties and the Secretary. The Parties agreed during the conference that PowerPoint presentations should be exchanged one week prior to the hearing if the Committee wished for such presentations to be made available. The President indicated that the Committee would revert to the Parties very soon to let them know whether it did wish for PowerPoint presentations to be made available.12 On November 7, 2012, the Secretary circulated a Report on the Telephone Conference on the Organization of the Hearing of November 6, 2012 (the \"Report\") to the Parties.\n\n*See* Report on the Telephone Conference on the Organization of the Hearing of November 6, 2012, para. 4.\n\n17.\n\nBy email from the Centre of November 12, 2012, the Committee informed the Parties that they could use PowerPoint presentations if they so wished. While the Committee did not consider it essential that PowerPoint presentations be submitted, it requested that the Parties exchange their presentations within the time limit agreed at the pre-hearing telephone conference, if the Parties did contemplate using such presentations.\n\n18.\n\nBy email of November 27, 2012, Applicant submitted an electronic copy of its PowerPoint presentation (\"Malicorp's PowerPoint Presentation\"), in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Report.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 6 and 7, 2012, a hearing was held at the World Bank's offices in Paris, France.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 19, 2013, the Committee closed the proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers necessary to review briefly the history of the proceedings before the Tribunal and the related contractual arbitration. Malicorp filed a request for arbitration with the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (\"CRCICA\") on April 20, 2004.13 The proceedings were between Malicorp as claimant and three respondents (the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation, and the Egyptian Airport Company).14 The CRCICA Tribunal was formed in May 200415 and issued its award on March 7, 2006.16 It held that: (i) the arbitration agreement in the Contract was binding on the Republic; (ii) the Republic had been the victim of a fundamental error in signing the Contract in that it believed that Malicorp had a capital of \u00a3100 million; therefore (iii) the Contract was void; and (iv) respondents were ordered to reimburse Malicorp for certain costs in the amount of $14.8 million.17 The Tribunal found that the CRCICA Award was dispositive as far as Applicant's contract claims were concerned, while it retained jurisdiction over the BIT (*i.e.* international) claims.18\n\n*See* Award, para. 44.\n\n*See* Award, para. 44.\n\n*See* Award, para. 45.\n\n*See* Award, para. 58.\n\n*See* Award, para. 58.\n\n*See* Award, para. 103.\n\n**II. Overview of the Positions of the Parties**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nApplicant requests that the Award be annulled under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention on the grounds that: (i) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; (ii) the award failed to state the reasons on which it is based; and (iii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.19\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 2.\n\n23.\n\nApplicant reviews the facts of the dispute, the previous proceedings, and the arguments submitted to the Tribunal by the Parties.20 On that basis, Applicant argues that the Tribunal (i) violated the *principe du contradictoire* by allowing Respondent, over Applicant's objections, to submit a hard copy of its PowerPoint slides to the Arbitral Tribunal during the April 20, 2011 hearing while denying Applicant the opportunity to file its *dossier de plaidoirie* ;21 (ii) contradicted itself on several occasions in the Award thereby failing to state reasons;22 and (iii) manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law and by unduly relying on a prior CRCICA Award on the same matter to reach its decision.23\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapters I-II. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 4:22 - 14:29.\n\n*See* Memorial Chapter III. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 14:30 - 29:29.\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter IV. *See also* Annul. Tr.

F., Dec. 6, 38:9 - 46:32.\n\n24.\n\nAfter reviewing the structure and content of the Award,24 Respondent contends that: (i) granting Applicant's claims would require the Committee to exceed the limits of its mandate by reviewing the facts of the case and the merits of the Award;25 (ii) the use of modern methods such as PowerPoint Presentations in support of oral arguments does not *per se* constitute a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, let alone a serious one;26 (iii) the Tribunal neither failed to state reasons nor exceeded its powers because it rightfully considered that the contract issues addressed before the CRCICA Tribunal were *res judicata* and thus were not to be adjudicated *de novo* ;27 and (iv) the Tribunal's mandate was limited to ruling on Applicant's expropriation claim under the BIT.28\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 8-40.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 1-7, 97. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 2.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 41-71. *See also* Annul.

E., Dec. 6, 24:11 - 25:6.\n\n25.\n\nThe Committee will first consider the legal framework applicable in this case before turning to a more detailed review of the Parties' arguments.\n\n**III. The Applicable Legal Framework: Article 52 of the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides for the annulment of an award on the five specific grounds listed in its first paragraph. In the instant case, and as already noted, Applicant invokes three of the five grounds: serious departure from a fundamental procedural rule, failure to state reasons, and manifest excess of powers. The Committee will now consider the legal framework applicable to each of the grounds in the order in which Applicant raised them.\n\nA. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAdherence to proper procedures is of utmost importance because it ensures the \"preservation of the integrity and legitimacy of the arbitration process.\"29 Accordingly, the ICSID Convention provides for annulment of an award where \"there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"30\n\nChristoph Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY 979 (2009) (2d Ed.).\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(d).\n\n28.\n\nFor an award to be annulled on this ground, it must meet two tests: (i) there must be a violation of a \"fundamental rule of procedure\"; and (ii) the departure from that rule must be \"serious.\"31 As is clear on the face of this provision, both criteria are mandatory.32\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(d).\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 980.\n\n29.\n\nBy referring to \"fundamental rule[s] of procedure,\" the drafters of the Convention intended to restrict annulment on this ground to violations of those principles that are essential to a fair hearing.33 This is because, no matter how serious, a violation of a non-fundamental rule would not call into question the validity of an award and thus should not result in annulment.34 Examples of such fundamental principles include the requirement that \"both Parties must be heard and that there must be an adequate opportunity for rebuttal.\"35\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 980.\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 980.\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 980 (*citing* HISTORY OF THE ICSID CONVENTION, Vol. II, p. 480).\n\n30.\n\nThe *Wena ad hoc* Committee further interpreted the requirement that the procedural rule(s) in question be \"fundamental\" as referring \"to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\"36 Thus, the key question in annulment proceedings with respect to this ground is whether the procedure allegedly violated falls within the category of fundamental rules necessary to ensure a full and fair hearing.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 57 (\" *Wena* Annulment Decision\").\n\n31.\n\nApplicant submits that the Award should be annulled because the Tribunal violated the *principe du contradictoire*, which it defines as the concept that \"chaque partie b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des m\u00eames droits et des m\u00eames obligations.\"37 According to Malicorp, this includes the concept of \"\u00e9galit\u00e9 des armes.\"38 In support of its claim, Applicant quotes the *Fraport ad* *hoc* Committee, which held that the \"right to present one\u2018s case\" is a fundamental rule for the purposes of annulment proceedings under Article 52(1)(d).39\n\nMemorial, p. 44.\n\nMemorial, p. 44.\n\nMemorial, p. 44, *quoting* *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, para. 202 (citations omitted) (\" *Fraport* Annulment Decision\").\n\n32.\n\nRespondent does not specifically disagree with the claim that the *principe du contradictoire* is a fundamental rule of procedure. Its argument, instead, is that the alleged violation of this rule, if any, was not sufficiently serious to merit annulment in this case.40\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 53\n\n33.\n\nThe second requirement for an award to be annulled due to a \"departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is that the violation be considered \"serious.\"41 The *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* stated:\n\nIn order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.42\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(d).\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 5.05 (\" *MINE* Annulment Decision\").\n\n34.\n\nRelying on this definition, the *Wena ad hoc* Committee further concluded:\n\nIn order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.43\n\n*Wena* Annulment Decision, para. 58.\n\n35.\n\nBoth Parties highlight this requirement. Applicant does so by stating that \"\u2018 *l'inobservation grave'* est n\u00e9cessairement une violation consciente qui engendre des cons\u00e9quences.\"44 Respondent relies on the *MINE* standard as set out by the *Continental Casualty ad hoc* Committee that, to be serious, the departure must cause a substantially different result or must \"deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"45\n\nMemorial, p. 42 (emphasis in original).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 43, quoting *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, paras. 95-96 (\"*Continental Casualty* Annulment Decision\").\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Parties agree on the substance of the *principe du contradictoire* and on the fact that it is a rule of procedure that ensures equality of the parties in an adversarial proceeding. The Committee further notes that this principle is closely related to the right to be heard. This right of parties to present their case has been recognized as part of that \"set of minimal standards\" considered fundamental for a fair hearing.46 The Committee thus concludes that the *principe du contradictoire* is a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 987-91.\n\n37.\n\nThe Committee also concludes that, to be serious, the departure from the procedural rule must have the consequences set out by the *ad hoc* Committees in *MINE*, *Wena*, and *Continental Casualty*. It is also the Committee's view that the assessment of the seriousness criterion above should always be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nB. Failure to State Reasons\n---------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAn award can also be annulled if it \"has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"47 This ground for annulment is rooted in the understanding that \"[a] statement of the reasons for a judicial decision is widely regarded to be a pre-requisite for an orderly administration of justice.\"48 This requirement is so fundamental that it cannot be waived:\n\nA statement of reasons is a valuable element of the arbitration process. The Committee has noted that the Committee of Legal Experts, which was to advise the Executive Directors of the World Rank on the draft Convention, by a vote of 28 to 3 rejected a proposal which would allow the Parties to dispense with the requirement of a reasoned award (History of the Convention, Vol. II, p. 816). A waiver of the requirement in an arbitration agreement would therefore not bar a party from seeking an annulment for failure of an award to state reasons.49\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(e)\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 996.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision, para. 5.10. *See also* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 996.\n\n39.\n\nThe fundamental nature of this requirement does not mean, however, that it is an onerous one. In fact, \"[t]he duty to state reasons refers only to a minimum requirement.\"50 As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* :\n\nIn the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.51\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 997.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision, para. 5.09.\n\n40.\n\nRelying on this reasoning, the *Wena ad hoc* Committee added:\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE*, this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the Parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).52\n\n*Wena* Annulment Decision, para. 79.\n\n41.\n\nIn this case, Applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons because it contradicted itself.53 It is accepted that \"contradictory reasons amount to a failure to state\n\nreasons\" and thus can be grounds for annulment under Art. 52(1)(e).54 For instance, the\n\n*ad hoc* Committee in *Klockner I* stated:\n\nAs for \"contradiction of reasons,\" it is in principle appropriate to\n\nbring this notion under the category \"failure to state reasons\" for the very simple reason that two *genuinely* contradictory reasons cancel each other out. Hence the failure to state reasons. The arbitrator's obligation to state reasons which are not contradictory must therefore be accepted.55\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter IV.\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 1011.\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, para. 116 (\" *Klockner* Annulment Decision\") (italics in original).\n\n42.\n\nThus, although an award may be annulled based on contradictory reasoning, applicants face a high burden to prove that different parts of the tribunal's analysis are so contradictory as to cancel each other out entirely. The *Klockner I ad hoc* Committee, for instance, went on to reject the annulment petition in so far as it was based on allegedly contradictory reasons because:\n\nIn reality, the two reasons are not contradictory, despite certain ambiguities in language. In neither case is the decision based on the existence or non-existence of the result, a deception, or on its possibility or impossibility. The complaint must therefore be rejected.56\n\n*Klockner* Annulment Decision, para. 123.\n\n43.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have urged caution when considering annulment on this ground. The *Vivendi I ad hoc* Committee, for example, emphasized that the contradictions must be \"genuine\" and recommended restraint for all committees considering annulment on this basis:\n\n[A]nnulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.57\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. (Formerly Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des* *eaux) v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 65 (\" *Vivendi I* Annulment Decision\").\n\n44.\n\nLikewise, the *CDC ad hoc* Committee urged that:\n\nIn construing awards, as in construing statutes and legal instruments generally, one necessarily should construe the language in issue, whenever possible, in a way that results in consistency...58\n\n*CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 81 (\" *CDC* Annulment Decision\").\n\n45.\n\nThus, when dealing with an annulment request based on an alleged failure to state reasons, an *ad hoc* committee must look beyond what may, at a first glance, appear to be a contradiction and seek to follow the logic and the reasoning of the award. In other words, an award must be upheld unless the logic is so contradictory as to be \"as useful as no reasons at all.\"59\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 1011.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the fact that contradictory reasoning may lead to annulment, but strongly disagrees with Applicant's contention that the Tribunal \"erred by formulating three \u2018contradictory motifs.'\"60\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 75-76.\n\nC. Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n47.\n\nApplicant's third and last basis for seeking annulment is that the Tribunal allegedly exceeded its powers. Under the ICSID Convention, an arbitral award may be annulled if \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\"61 The most significant excess of powers, and the one at issue in this case, occurs when the Tribunal exceeds the limits of its jurisdiction.62 This may be the case where a tribunal \"exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, read together, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments.\"63 This is because \"[i]t is not within the tribunal's powers to refuse to decide a dispute or part of a dispute that meets all jurisdictional requirements of Art. 25.\"64\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(b).\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 938.\n\n*Vivendi I* Annulment Decision, para. 86.\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 947.\n\n48.\n\nMoreover, \"[t]here is widespread agreement that a failure to apply the proper law may amount to an excess of powers by the tribunal.\"65 In their interpretation of this ground for annulment, *ad hoc* committees concur in that \"a Tribunal's complete failure to apply the proper law or acting *ex aequo et bono* without agreement of the Parties to do so as required by the ICSID Convention could constitute a manifest excess of powers.\"66 In the words of the *Soufraki ad hoc* committee:\n\n[O]ne must also consider that a tribunal goes beyond the scope of its power if it does not respect the law applicable to the substance of the arbitration under the ICSID Convention. It is widely recognized in ICSID jurisprudence that failure to apply the applicable law constitutes an excess of power. The relevant provisions of the applicable law are constitutive elements of the Parties' agreement to arbitrate and constitute part of the definition of the tribunal's mandate.67\n\nSchreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 955.\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, para. 94. *See also* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 938.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 45 (\" *Soufraki* Annulment Decision\").\n\n49.\n\nIncorrect interpretation of the law, however, does not normally rise to the level of an excess of powers.68 As the *Soufraki ad hoc* Committee noted, \"ICSID *ad hoc* committees have commonly been quite clear... that a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment.\"69 Allowing annulment committees to overturn incorrect applications of the law was specifically rejected by the drafters of the ICSID Convention because some delegates feared that this would call into question the finality of awards.70 Incorrect application of the law is thus not a basis for annulment except in the most egregious cases where such misapplication \"is of such a nature or degree as to constitute objectively (regardless of the Tribunal's actual or presumed intentions) its effective non-application.\"71\n\n*See* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 956, 959-964.\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision, para. 85\n\n*See* Antonio Parra, THE HISTORY OF ICSID 87 (2012).\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Resubmitted Case: Decision on Annulment, December 3, 1992, para. 7.19.\n\n50.\n\nThe ICSID Convention requires that an excess of power be \"manifest\" in order to qualify for annulment. Annulment committees have differed somewhat in interpreting the meaning of this term.\n\n51.\n\nSome, such as the *Repsol ad hoc* Committee, have found that \"exceeding one's powers is \u2018 *manifest'* when it is \u2018 *obvious by itself* ' simply by reading the Award, that is, even prior to a detailed examination of its contents.\"72 The *Wena ad hoc* Committee likewise understood \"manifest\" to imply that the excess should be obvious or evident:\n\nThe excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.73\n\nFollowing suit, the *CDC ad hoc* Committee held that:\n\n[I]f a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \"one way or the other,\" is not manifest.74\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 36 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Wena* Annulment Decision, para. 25.\n\n*CDC* Annulment Decision, para. 41.\n\n52.\n\nOthers, such as *Vivendi I*, have concluded that a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers if the excess of powers has clear and serious consequences:\n\n[T]he Committee concludes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims, failed to decide those claims. Given the clear and serious implications of that decision for Claimants in terms of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and the surrounding circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that that excess of powers was manifest.75\n\n*Vivendi I* Annulment Decision, para. 115.\n\n53.\n\nThe *Soufraki ad hoc* committee found that both approaches had merit and should apply:\n\n[A] strict opposition between two different meanings of \"manifest\" - either \"obvious\" or \"serious\" - is an unnecessary debate. It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.76\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision, para. 40.\n\n54.\n\nApplicant agrees with the standard as set out above. It cites the *Sempra ad hoc* Committee (\"[an excess of power] must be quite evident without the need to engage in an elaborate analysis of the text of the Award\"), and concludes that \"pour \u00eatre manifeste, l'exc\u00e8s de pouvoirs [sic] ne doit pas \u00eatre discutable.\"77\n\nMemorial, p.107, *quoting* *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010, para. 123.\n\n55.\n\nRespondent likewise agrees with the legal standard, but accuses Applicant of seeking appellate review of the Tribunal's decision in violation of the limited scope of annulment proceedings.78 In support of this proposition, Egypt cites the *ad hoc* Committee in *Compagnie d'Exploitation du Chemin de Fer Transgabonais:*\n\nLe Comit\u00e9 tient... \u00e0 insister f\u00e9rmement [sic] sur le fait que l'annulation n'est certainement pas un moyen selon lequel une partie \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage peut chercher \u00e0 renverser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fond de la sentence arbitrale qui lui d\u00e9plaisent.79\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 4-5.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 5 *quoting* *Compagnie d'Exploitation du Chemin de Fer Transgabonais v. Gabonese Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/5), Decision on Annulment, May 11, 2010, para. 19.\n\n56.\n\nThe Committee concurs with the *Soufraki* Annulment Decision and understands \"manifest\" to mean both obvious and serious. The Committee does not believe that these two terms are inconsistent to the extent that what has serious and substantial implications is also clear and obvious.\n\n57.\n\nHaving set out the legal framework applicable in this case, the Committee next turns to Applicant's specific claims.\n\n**IV. Serious Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions on the alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure are summarized below.\n\nA. Applicant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n59.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal violated the *principe du contradictoire*, thus seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50(1)(iii).80\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 2.\n\n60.\n\nAccording to Applicant, a \"serious departure\" is a deliberate violation that entails consequences.81 A \"fundamental rule of procedure,\" meanwhile, is one that goes to the essence of the procedure.82 Without such a rule, equal right of access to a judge or an arbitrator would not be guaranteed.83 Applicant further argues that the *principe du contradictoire* is universally seen as a fundamental rule of procedure84 and applies to ICSID proceedings.85 Relying on the *ad hoc* committee's decision in the *Fraport* case, Applicant further argues that:\n\nLe principe du contradictoire ne se r\u00e9sume pas \u00e0 la prise en compte par les membres du Tribunal arbitral de l'argumentation de chacune des parties.\n\nLe principe du contradictoire va bien au-del\u00e0, puisqu'il suppose que chaque partie b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des m\u00eames droits et des m\u00eames obligations et ce, dans le moindre d\u00e9tail, afin qu'aucune des parties ne puisse prendre un avantage sur l'autre.86\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 42.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 42.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 41-42.\n\n*See* Application, p. 4. *See also* Memorial, p. 43.\n\n*See* Application, p. 4. *See also* Memorial, p. 43. Applicant refers to ICSID Arbitration Rules 29-38 which in its view are designed to uphold the *principe du contradictoire*.\n\nApplication, p. 5 (*citing* *Fraport* Annulment Decision, para. 202). *See also* Memorial, p. 44; Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 16:1 - 16:5.\n\n61.\n\nApplicant contends that by admitting into evidence the PowerPoint slides used by Respondent at the April 2011 hearing and yet refusing to admit Applicant's *dossier de plaidoirie*, the Tribunal violated the *principe du contradictoire*, which includes the principle of equality of arms.87\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 44. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 18:15 - 18:31.\n\n62.\n\nApplicant's concerns regarding the admission of the PowerPoint slides are twofold. First, Malicorp argues that the slides and the **dossier** are equivalent advocacy documents, so that the Tribunal should have accepted both or neither.88 According to Applicant, admitting the PowerPoint slides but not the **dossier** was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because it gave Respondent an additional opportunity to present its arguments. Applicant claims that this is a clear violation of the right to equality of arms.89\n\n*See* Application, pp. 9-10. *See also* Memorial, pp. 49 and 71.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 49-50.\n\n63.\n\nSecond, Applicant also objects to the admission of the slides because it believes that they were intended to mislead the Tribunal with regard to a key document, and that the arbitrators were in fact confused by them.90 At issue specifically is slide 42, entitled \"The Articles of Association of Malicorp.\"91 This slide shows two excerpts of scanned documents: (i) the signature block of a Mrs. M. JEYA, Registrar of Companies, showing that the document was executed at Companies House in Cardiff on September 15, 1999; and (ii) a single sentence, \"5) The Company's share capital is \u00a3100 million divided into one million shares of \u00a3100 each.\"92 The slide cites the source of the images as pages 91 and 94 of Respondent's second exhibit.\n\n*See* Application, pp. 39-40. *See also* Memorial, pp. 83-84.\n\nClosing Submission of Respondent (PowerPoint presentation), Exh. DA-23, slide 42.\n\nClosing Submission of Respondent (PowerPoint presentation), Exh. DA-23, slide 42.\n\n64.\n\nAccording to Applicant, this slide presents purposefully truncated quotations meant to deceive the Tribunal and lead it to conclude that the two excerpts originate from the same document.93 The error, in Applicant's view, was the Tribunal's mistaken conclusion that Malicorp's Articles of Association, as attested by the Registrar, Mrs. M. Jeya, stated that the company's share capital was \u00a3100 million.94 In reality, there were two separate documents.95 The paragraph with the signature of the Registrar was extracted from the \"Certificate of Registration,\" which does not make any reference to Malicorp's capital; the reference to the company's share capital came from a different, unsigned document that does not specifically refer to Malicorp.96 Applicant refers to the combination of these extracts from two different documents on a single slide as \" *montages photocopiques.* \"97\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 24:8 - 24:15; Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 7, 9:48 -10:41.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74. *See also* Malicorp's PowerPoint Presentation, slides 25-29, 46, 132-133.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 72. **See also** Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 24:8 - 24:15. **See also** Malicorp's PowerPoint Presentation, slide 46.\n\n65.\n\nMalicorp focuses on slide 42 because of the critical importance of this document for the Tribunal's decision in this case. At issue is what happened between the Parties on January 3, 2000.98 Both sides agree that a meeting took place between them on that day.99 Applicant contends that it did not provide any document setting out its share capital on that day and that any such document produced by Egypt was a forgery.100 Applicant focuses on these alleged deceptions because it argues that the Tribunal ultimately found against Malicorp by relying on a forged document that was presented as genuine through those \" *montages*.\"101\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 6.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 6. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 33 (*citing* Award, paras. 134-136).\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 89. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 21:9 - 22:26.\n\n*See* Reply, pp.16-18\n\n66.\n\nApplicant insists that it repeatedly drew the Tribunal's attention to Respondent's procedural maneuvers during the arbitral proceeding and that it objected on numerous occasions to the admission of the PowerPoint slides.102 In addition, Applicant points to its numerous letters to the Tribunal in which it highlighted the various \" *montages photocopiques* \" contained in Respondent's PowerPoint presentation.103 However, according to Applicant, the Tribunal neither addressed nor took into account these objections in the Award.104\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter III-3.2. *See also* Reply, pp. 13-14.\n\n*See* Application, pp. 30-37. **See also** Memorial, pp. 51-52, 71-80. **See also** Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 27:7 - 27:12. Applicant argues that its letter of May 25, 2010, was held to be admissible by the Tribunal while those of May 26, June 14 and July 2, 2010, were not (Application, p. 38; Memorial, p. 81.).\n\n*See* Application, p. 37. *See also* Memorial, pp. 80-81.\n\n67.\n\nApplicant claims that the admission of Respondent's PowerPoint slides gave it an undue advantage by granting it an additional opportunity to convince the Tribunal, thus violating the principle of equality of arms.105 Malicorp argues that this placed it at a procedural disadvantage, thus deeply undermining its trust in the Tribunal.106\n\n*See* Application, pp.9-10. *See also* Memorial, pp. 49-50.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 45.\n\n68.\n\nApplicant further argues that if the Committee finds that the **principe du contradictoire** was violated, it need not consider whether the Tribunals' outcome would have been different had the slides not been admitted.107 This is because, according to Malicorp, \"\u2018[ *l]'inobservation grave* ' est n\u00e9cessairement une violation consciente qui engendre des cons\u00e9quences. Il ne peut y avoir d'inobservation grave sans cons\u00e9quence concr\u00e8te.\"108 In support of this proposition, Applicant refers to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, according to which, where there was a violation of the principle of equality of arms or the **principe du contradictoire**, the Court held the State liable, regardless of the consequences of this violation.109 Citing the *Rumeli* annulment decision, Applicant also argues that the Committee clearly has no discretion to decline to annul the Award because the *principe du contradictoire* is absolute and its violation in this case is flagrant.110\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 42. *See also* Annul.

F., Dec. 6, 29:14 - 29:20.\n\n69.\n\nApplicant claims further prejudice resulting from having been forced to respond to Respondent's request for the admission of the slides at the hearing without preparation.111 Applicant asserts that it was unprepared to defend itself against Respondent's sudden request and thus was not given the chance to properly plead its case, which once again violated the *principe du contradictoire*.112\n\n*See* Application, pp. 38-39. *See also* Memorial, pp. 81-82.\n\n*See* Application, pp. 38-39. *See also* Memorial, pp. 81-82.\n\n70.\n\nApplicant finally contends that Respondent's suggestion that it should have requested a revision of the Award is surprising since the relevant facts, namely the \"montages\" meant to deceive the Tribunal, were discovered during the arbitral proceeding, so that they were not new evidence that might have led to a different result on revision.113\n\n*See* Reply, p. 14.\n\nB. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n71.\n\nRespondent submits that Applicant aims its attack at \"the ways and means used by the Parties in pleading their case,\" and not at the Tribunal's Award.114 Respondent further contends that such an approach is inconsistent with the limited and extraordinary nature of annulment, which is designed to \"assure compliance with fundamental requirements of due process without interfering in the merits of the Arbitral Tribunal's ruling as stated in its Award.\"115\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 42.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 44.\n\n72.\n\nRelying on the decision rendered in *Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, Respondent defines the concept of serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and emphasizes, *inter alia*, that in order to be \"serious,\" a departure from a rule of procedure \"must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded has [sic] such a rule been observed,\" or must have been \"such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"116\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 43 (*citing* *Continental Casualty* Annulment Decision, para. 96) (emphasis in original). *See also* Rejoinder, para. 21.\n\n73.\n\nRespondent also distinguishes this case from the award in *Fraport*, which was annulled because of the \"Tribunal's failure to permit the parties to make a fresh submission to it in the light of the new material introduced during the period after the closing of the proceeding [,..].\"117 Respondent affirms that the present case can be distinguished because it merely relates to \"an incident that took place throughout the oral hearing due to the difference in the methods of pleading [...],\" that is pleading with or without electronic visual aids such as PowerPoint presentations.118 Respondent emphasizes that when ICSID inquired whether counsel would make PowerPoint presentations at the hearing, counsel for Malicorp responded that he would not while counsel for Egypt indicated that he would.119 This put Applicant on notice that opposing counsel planned to use visual aids in the form of a PowerPoint presentation at the hearing.120\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 60.\n\nCounter-Memorial *,* para. 50.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 52.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 52.\n\n74.\n\nIn addition, Respondent clarifies that it did not file any new documents after the hearing.121 Rather, it submitted printed copies of a presentation that had already been made before the Tribunal during the hearing and which contained only previously admitted documents.122 Respondent argues that allowing one party to use PowerPoint slides while the other does not is not *per se* a departure from the rule of equal treatment of the Parties and right to be heard as long as the other party was given the chance to comment and raise objections.123 Moreover, Applicant was given an equal opportunity to present its own PowerPoint presentation or to use other visual aids, but decided against it.124\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 51 and 61.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 61. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 47:28 - 48:13.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 19.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 52 *. See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 47:19 - 47:27.\n\n75.\n\nRespondent also rejects Applicant's allegations that it submitted truncated or falsified documents during the proceedings in order to mislead the Tribunal.125 According to Respondent, had Applicant's accusations had the slightest degree of veracity, it should have filed a request for revision upon obtaining proof of fraud or falsification.126 Respondent claims that there is no proof to this day that the document presented at the January 3, 2000 meeting has been forged.127\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 55.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 55.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 16.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent further insists that Malicorp ignores the Tribunal's statement at paragraph 86 of the Award that \"[d]urant cette proc\u00e9dure les Parties ont eu amplement l'occasion d'exposer leurs moyens par \u00e9crit et oralement. \u00c1 l'audience des 19 et 20 avril 2012, elles ont confirm\u00e9 qu'elles n'avaient aucune objection \u00e0 formuler \u00e0 l'encontre de la proc\u00e9dure qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie (cf. Transcript F 19/20.04.2010, p. 82 1.6 ss. et 29 ss).\"128 Respondent also points out that Applicant made no formal request for a new round of pleadings before the Award was rendered.129 According to Respondent, \"a simple \u2018protest', either oral or written, even if repeated hundred times, does not amount from Egypt's point of view to a formal request that generates the need to issue a given formal decision by the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal *.* \"130\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 58\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 52 and 61.\n\nRejoinder, para. 11.\n\n77.\n\nOn the basis of ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, Respondent argues that Applicant waived its claim of alleged violation of the *principe du contradictoire* :\n\n[A] party that has failed to protest against a perceived procedural irregularity before the tribunal is precluded from claiming that this irregularity constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for purpose of annulment.131\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 62 (*citing* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 995). *See also* Rejoinder, para. 24.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent submits that, in any event, Applicant has not proven that the Tribunal would have reached a substantially different result were it not for the alleged violation.132 According to Respondent, the Tribunal carefully separated the \"contract claims,\" already decided by the CRCICA Award of March 7, 2006, and the \"treaty claims,\" *i.e.* those to be decided under the BIT, such as expropriation.133 According to Egypt, in part because the Tribunal's mandate was rather narrow given that the contract claims had already been decided, there is no indication that the Tribunal would have reached a substantially different result had the PowerPoint slides not been admitted into the record.134 In the view of Respondent, the admission of Malicorp's *dossier de plaidoirie* would likewise not have substantially changed the Tribunal's conclusions because arguably it would not have added new material to the record.135\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 62-63.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 64.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 13 and 67. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 13.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 25.\n\n79.\n\nRespondent concludes that Malicorp's decision not to use a PowerPoint presentation \"was its own choice, and consequently it has to bear the consequences thereof without trying to use its negative attitude to imply that the Tribunal departed from the equality of treatment between the two Parties.\"136 Respondent therefore submits that Applicant's petition for annulment of the Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must be rejected.137\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 69.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 71.\n\nC. The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee will first turn to the question whether the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. Only if it so finds will the Committee consider whether such departure was serious.\n\n81.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal breached the fundamental principle of equality of arms (*principe du contradictoire*) by admitting into the record the set of slides presented at the hearing by Respondent while denying Applicant's request to also admit its *dossier de plaidoirie*.138\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 44.\n\n82.\n\nEgypt responds that there was no due process violation because its PowerPoint slides did not introduce new evidence into the record and thus there was not \"rupture de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des armes.\"139\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, paras. 51 and 61.\n\n83.\n\nIn deciding whether the Tribunal violated the *principe du contradictoire*, it is useful to review the exchanges between the Parties on this point to understand the context in which the Tribunal made its decisions.\n\n1. Timeline of Relevant Events\n\n84.\n\nOn March 10, 2010, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to enquire, *inter alia*, whether they would be using PowerPoint presentations during the hearing.140 By letter of March 24, 2010, counsel for Respondent indicated that he would use a PowerPoint presentation during the hearing.141 The next day, counsel for Malicorp indicated that he would not do so.142 Respondent's counsel once again confirmed his intent to use a PowerPoint presentation at the hearing during a March 29, 2010, conference call between the Parties and the President of the Tribunal.143\n\n*See* Letter from the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Parties, March 10, 2010, p. 10, Exh.

DA-7.\n\n85.\n\nRespondent used a PowerPoint presentation as planned during the hearing in Paris on April 19-20, 2010. Towards the end of the last day of the hearing, Counsel for Respondent, Mr. Webster, asked whether a copy of his presentation could be admitted. The following exchange took place:\n\n. 32 Me Webster.- Non, pas du tout. Je voulais juste proposer de donner le PowerPoint avec\n\n. 33 les diapositives \u00e0 supprimer. Je le donne \u00e0 tout le monde en m\u00eame temps...\n\n. 34 Me Br\u00e9mond.- Non, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.\n\n. 35 J'ai pos\u00e9 la question et j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Me Webster d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent quand je vous posais\n\n. 36 la question hier. J'ai bien demand\u00e9 si un dossier de plaidoirie \u00e9tait remis au Tribunal.\n\n. 37 Tout le monde m'a dit : non, pas de dossier de plaidoirie. Vous le remettez, bien\n\n. 38 entendu, si vous voulez, aux dames qui ont pris votre plaidoirie -comme nous l'avons\n\n. 39 fait pour ce qui nous concerne-, mais je ne vois pas que cela puisse \u00eatre remis au\n\n. 40 Tribunal. Nous-m\u00eames n'avons donc pas pr\u00e9vu de le remettre parce que vous m'avez\n\n. 41 r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement hier.\n\n. 1 Me Webster.- Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, je ne suis pas d'accord. Vous avez demand\u00e9 s'il y avait un\n\n. 2 dossier de plaidoirie. Si mes souvenirs sont bons, le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu : il n'y a pas de\n\n. 3 dossier de plaidoirie, mais il y a un PowerPoint. Et nous avons fait un PowerPoint,\n\n. 4 c'est absolument habituel. Nous avons syst\u00e9matiquement suivi le PowerPoint et nous\n\n. 5 avons supprim\u00e9, parce que je n'avais pas le temps, tout ce qu'il y avait \u00e0 supprimer. J'ai\n\n. 6 m\u00eame pris sur mon temps le temps de lire ce qu'il y avait dans le PowerPoint. Mais je\n\n. 7 crois que c'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on, cela a pris pas mal de travail, c'\u00e9tait organis\u00e9\n\n. 8 comme cela.\n\n. 9 Me Br\u00e9mond.- Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, peut-on revenir en arri\u00e8re une seconde ? Lorsque\n\n. 10 nous avons eu la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 29 mars, vous vous \u00eates fait pr\u00e9ciser par les. 11 avocats qu'il n'y aurait plus de documents produits, et Me Webster a dit : il y aura une\n\n. 12 pr\u00e9sentation PowerPoint. Il y a eu une pr\u00e9sentation PowerPoint. Il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vu une\n\n. 13 remise du PowerPoint. J'ai, moi aussi, un dossier de plaidoirie que j'ai fait, qui est\n\n. 14 \u00e9norme, avec quantit\u00e9 de documents. J'ai pris la pr\u00e9caution de vous poser la question\n\n. 15 hier pour qu'il n'y ait pas de doute. Je pense qu'il n'y avait pas de doute hier qu'il n'y\n\n. 16 avait pas de documents remis au Tribunal arbitral.\n\n. 17 M. le Pr\u00e9sident.- Je crois que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 la fin, mais c'est tr\u00e8s bien,\n\n. 18 d'un probl\u00e8me d'interpr\u00e9tation qui est en partie li\u00e9 \u00e0 la position prise par le Tribunal\n\n. 19 arbitral.\n\n. 20 Il est exact que lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit qu'il n'y aurait pas de\n\n. 21 nouveaux documents. Il est exact \u00e9galement qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 par Me Webster -j'ai\n\n. 22 pos\u00e9 la question aux deux et vous aviez dit non- qu'il utiliserait une pr\u00e9sentation\n\n. 23 PowerPoint.\n\n. 24 Maintenant, la question est celle de savoir si un dossier de plaidoirie avec cotes \u00e0 la\n\n. 25 fran\u00e7aise \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une pr\u00e9sentation PowerPoint ou non, si ce sont deux choses\n\n. 26 diff\u00e9rentes.\n\n. 27 Pour ne pas ternir le bel esprit de cette audience, je vous propose de garder au Tribunal.\n\n. 28 l'occasion de se d\u00e9cider \u00e0 ce sujet. Il est vrai qu'en pratique, la pr\u00e9sentation PowerPoint\n\n. 29 qui est faite est accompagn\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la remise simultan\u00e9e du document, en tout\n\n. 30 cas dans la pratique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la mienne.\n\n. 31 Je comprends les h\u00e9sitations qui sont formul\u00e9es du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Demanderesse. Je me\n\n. 32 propose, tranquillement, avec mes deux coarbitres -je suis peut-\u00eatre responsable en\n\n. 33 partie du malentendu-, que l'on vous r\u00e9ponde gentiment. On aura le temps pour le faire\n\n. 34 tranquillement.\n\n. 35 Me Br\u00e9mond.- Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.\n\n. 36 Me Webster.- Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.144\n\nArb. Tr., 83-84, Exh.

Cependant et afin de s'assurer que celle-ci ne comprend pas de nouveaux documents et ne d\u00e9passe pas la plaidoirie de Me Webster, la partie d\u00e9fenderesse est pri\u00e9e d'en adresser une copie \u00e0 la partie demanderesse et une copie par avance au Pr\u00e9sident (par l'interm\u00e9diaire du Centre) qui s'assurera que les conditions en sont remplies.

DA-10.\n\n88.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Counsel for Applicant, Me Yassin, addressed a letter to the Tribunal on the application of Egyptian law and on the issue of the truncated and allegedly misleading slide for the first time. According to Me Yassin, the letter was necessary because:\n\n[L]a lecture des transcripts des audiences de 19 et 20 avril 2010 ainsi que celle des \"Power Ponts\" [sic] remis par la D\u00e9fenderesse au Tribunal Arbitral nous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 vouloir confirmer certains concepts du droit \u00e9gyptien, applicable sur le Contrat de Concession objet du litige; concepts qui avaient toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s dans les plaidoiries de la Demanderesse.\n\nOr d'un cot\u00e9, les transcripts n'ont probablement pas donn\u00e9 une id\u00e9e assez pr\u00e9cise que compl\u00e8te [ *sic* ] de ces concepts juridiques admis en droit \u00e9gyptien.\n\nD'autre part, les \"Power Points\" remis nous semblent comporter une certaine manipulation des textes et des concepts de ce m\u00eame droit \u00e9gyptien, de telle sorte que nous pensons devoir \u00e9claircir cette ambig\u00fcit\u00e9 pour \u00e9viter tout malentendu sur les r\u00e8gles que le Tribunal appliquera sur le pr\u00e9sent arbitrage.147\n\nLetter from Applicant to the Tribunal, May 25, 2010, p. 2, Exh. DA-15.\n\n89.\n\nThe next day, Applicant filed another letter with the Tribunal, this time from Me Br\u00e9mond, once again highlighting the issue of the misleading documents:\n\nCes pr\u00e9misses \u00e9tant rappel\u00e9s, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MALICORP souligne qu'elle a eu \u00e0 se plaindre dans ses m\u00e9moires aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal de ce que des citations qui \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es par la R\u00c9PUBLIQUE ARABE D'\u00c9GYPTE dans ses propres m\u00e9moires \u00e9taient tronqu\u00e9es, sans qu'un signe typographique mentionne le ou les passages supprim\u00e9s.\n\nCette pratique inusuelle, contraire aux r\u00e8gles habituellement pratiqu\u00e9es, avait provoqu\u00e9 la m\u00e9fiance des Avocats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MALICORP, raison pour laquelle je m'\u00e9tais pr\u00e9muni de tout d\u00e9p\u00f4t de document entre les mains des Arbitres post\u00e9rieurement aux m\u00e9moires, en posant des questions pr\u00e9cises au Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal Arbitral le 29 mars et en r\u00e9it\u00e9rant \u00e0 l'issue de la premi\u00e8re audience le 19 avril.\n\nJ'ai donc \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ablement surpris de constater qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9 la remise des slides Power Point \u00e9tablis par Ma\u00eetre WEBSTER, alors que ces slides concr\u00e9tisent des montages photocopiques, des citations extraites de leur contexte o\u00f9 certains passages sont supprim\u00e9s, des photocopies opportun\u00e9ment mal faites de certains documents, etc.148\n\nLetter from Applicant to the Tribunal, May 26, 2010, pp. 1-2, Exh. DA-13.\n\n90.\n\nOn June 1, 2010, Respondent's counsel objected to the letters of Messrs. Yassin and Br\u00e9mond. In his letter, Respondent complained that the Tribunal had not provided for post-hearing submissions and thus that Applicant's letters were not proper.149 Respondent went on to say that Applicant had been on notice that it would use a PowerPoint presentation since the March 29, 2010, telephone conference, that the presentation included only previously admitted documents, and that the slides had been deemed admitted by the President on April 22, 2010, thus closing the matter.150 Finally, Respondent noted that Me Br\u00e9mond had not objected to the contents of the slides prior to the Tribunal's decision to admit them.151\n\n*See* Letter from Respondent to Tribunal, June 1, 2010, para. 1, Exh. DA-16.\n\n*See* Letter from Respondent to Tribunal, June 1, 2010, paras. 3-5.\n\n*See* Letter from Respondent to Tribunal, June 1, 2010, para. 6.\n\n91.\n\nIn his June 14, 2010, reply, Me Br\u00e9mond wrote, *inter alia*, that he had not objected to the admission of any slides during the hearing because he did not know what Respondent would argue and did not have the time to respond adequately:\n\n[\u2026] je ne vois pas non plus au nom de quel principe mon Confr\u00e8re veut nous emp\u00eacher de soulever telle r\u00e9plique \u00e0 ce que nous avons entendu [\u2026] lors de sa propre r\u00e9plique dans laquelle il [Me Webster] a ajout\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses que nous ne connaissions pas et qu'il nous a fallu analyser, ce que nous n'avons pu faire dans les quelques secondes entre le moment o\u00f9 il a termin\u00e9 et le moment o\u00f9 le Pr\u00e9sident nous a demand\u00e9 si nous avions quelque chose \u00e0 ajouter.152\n\nLetter from Claimant to Tribunal, June 14, 2010, p. 1, Exh. DA-17.\n\n92.\n\nOn June 17, 2010, the Tribunal rejected Claimant's request to reconsider its decision to admit the PowerPoint slides.153 It reminded the Parties that no post-hearing briefs were to be filed and held that it did not consider the slides to be a post-hearing submission.154\n\n*Cited in* Letter from Claimant to Tribunal, July 2, 2010, p. 1, Exh. DA-19.\n\n*See* Letter from Claimant to Tribunal, July 2, 2010, Exh. DA-19.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal invited Respondent's counsel to reply to Me Yassin's letter of May 25, 2010, which Mr. Webster did on June 28, 2010.155 In that letter, Respondent argued that Applicant's opposition to the admission of the slides was not genuine and was nothing more than \"a last-minute attempt to invent a new argument.\"156\n\n*See* Letter from Respondent to Tribunal, June 28, 2010, Exh. DA-18.\n\nLetter from Respondent to Tribunal, June 28, 2010, para. 48, Exh. DA-18.\n\n94.\n\nOn July 2, 2010, Me Br\u00e9mond objected to the Tribunal's June 17 decision to reject his request for further pleadings, once again arguing that he had not had the chance to properly object to the slides at the hearing because of time constraints.157\n\n*See* Letter from Claimant to Tribunal, July 2, 2010, p. 3, Exh. DA-19.\n\n95.\n\nOn July 6, 2010, the Tribunal acknowledged that it had received a new request from Applicant to revisit its prior decision to admit the slides. It asked Respondent to weigh in on whether further briefing should be ordered.158 In its response, Egypt made its views quite clear: \"Malicorp's problem is not with the procedure. Malicorp's problem is with the substance.\"159\n\n2. Analysis\n\n*See* Letter from President of the Tribunal to the Parties, July 6, 2010, p. 1, Exh. DA-21.\n\nLetter from Respondent to Tribunal, July 12, 2010, para. 28, Exh. DA-22.\n\n96.\n\nDuring the hearing of April 19-20, 2010, the President of the Tribunal stated that it was customary for printed copies of PowerPoint slides used at the hearing to be admitted into the record.160 The Committee agrees. Printed copies of slides or visual aids used at the hearing are routinely submitted to tribunals for ease of reference, provided they contain only information that is already in the record. There is no reason to believe that such printed copies would unduly influence the Tribunal or have any persuasive impact beyond the effect of the initial presentation. This is especially true given that the President ensured that slides not shown to the Tribunal because of the time constraints of the hearing were deleted prior to Counsel's submission of the hard copies of the PowerPoint.161 The admission of the PowerPoint slides was simply meant to facilitate the Tribunal's work in preparing the Award.\n\nArb. Tr., 84:28-30 (\"Il est vrai qu'en pratique, la pr\u00e9sentation PowerPoint qui est faite est accompagn\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la remise simultan\u00e9e de ce document.\").\n\nLetter from the President of the Tribunal to the Parties, May 18, 2010, Exh. DA-10 (\"La version propos\u00e9e ne sort pas du cadre fix\u00e9, apr\u00e8s qu'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9s, \u00e0 la demande du Tribunal arbitral, les passages qui en exc\u00e9daient le cadre.\").\n\n97.\n\nBecause the President properly ensured that the PowerPoint presentation only contained previously admitted evidence,162 the Committee is satisfied that Respondent was not given an unfair advantage by the admission of the printed copies of the slides into the record after the hearing.\n\n*See* Letter from the Tribunal's Secretary to the Parties, April 22, 2010, Exh. DA-9. *See also* Letter from the President of the Tribunal to the Parties, May 18, 2010, Exh. DA-10.\n\n98.\n\nApplicant's claim that its *dossier de plaidoirie* should also have been admitted does not advance its argument for annulment. Unlike a PowerPoint presentation, a *dossier de plaidoirie* is not meant to be a visual aid. Its purpose is to assist counsel in making his or her presentation.\n\n99.\n\nMoreover, while a PowerPoint presentation is a visual aid that only includes previously admitted documents, the Tribunal had no way of knowing what was in Me Br\u00e9mond's **dossier**.163 Indeed, Me Br\u00e9mond himself referred to his **dossier** as voluminous.164 The Committee thus finds that it was well within the Tribunal's discretion to admit Me Webster's PowerPoint slides, which it had already seen, while refusing to admit Me Br\u00e9mond's *dossier de plaidoirie.* It is undisputed that both Parties had the opportunity to use visual aids during the hearing. Applicant chose not to do so; it cannot complain now that it was placed at a disadvantage because of the choice it made.\n\n*See* Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal, July 12, 2010, para. 22, Exh. DA-22 (\"More generally, the Respondent's Power Point contains no new documents. All documents were submitted with the Respondent's memorials. Therefore, as regards the documents, there can be no issue as to due process.\").\n\nArb. Tr., 84:13-14 (\"J'ai, moi aussi, un dossier de plaidoirie que j'ai fait, qui est \u00e9norme, avec quantit\u00e9 de documents.\").\n\n100.\n\nApplicant further claims that the presentation should not have been admitted because it contained truncated and misleading documents. As previously discussed in Section A above, Applicant objects specifically to slide 42, entitled \"The Articles of Association of Malicorp.\" This is because the slide shows two excerpts of scanned documents: (i) the signature block of a Mrs. M. JEYA, Registrar of Companies, showing that the document was executed at Companies House in Cardiff on 15 September 1999; and (ii) a single sentence, \"5) The Company's share capital is \u00a3100 million divided into one million shares of \u00a3100 each.\"165 The slide cites as the source of the images pages 91 and 94 of Respondent's Exhibit R2. Applicant argues that this presentation could have led the Tribunal to conclude that the two excerpts came from the same document, while in fact the signature was extracted from the \"Certificate of Registration,\" which does not make any reference to Malicorp's capital, and the second sentence came from an unsigned document that does not specifically refer to Malicorp.166 Applicant refers to the combination of these two documents on a single slide as a \" *montage photocopique.* \"167\n\nClosing Submission of Respondent (PowerPoint presentation), slide 42, Exh. DA-23.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 73-74.\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee agrees that one might be confused by placing the excerpts from two separate documents on a single slide. It is the Committee's view, however, that the confusion arises out of the fact that what was designated as Exhibit R2 included many different documents. Respondent displayed on one slide excerpts from Exhibit R2 and properly indicated the source as Exhibit R2. Applicant is correct that Respondent did not indicate that the excerpts came from two different documents. However, the Tribunal and the Parties must have been well aware that Exhibit R2 contained multiple documents (and Claimant never raised any objection to such designation). Respondent also clearly indicated the page numbers where the relevant excerpts could be found in Exhibit R2. Whether the Tribunal or Claimant nonetheless mistakenly concluded that the two excerpts came from the same document is a matter of fact that is beyond the scope of an annulment review.\n\n102.\n\nApplicant's counsel also argues that the Tribunal should not have admitted Respondent's PowerPoint presentation because Me Br\u00e9mond could not react swiftly enough during the hearing to properly register his objections to the slide. The Committee appreciates the pressure on counsel and the time constraints of an oral hearing. However, counsel's failure to react or object quickly does not result in a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Further, Applicant had known well in advance of the hearing that Respondent would use a PowerPoint presentation. There is, however, no record of Applicant asking for an advance copy of the slides.\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee likewise finds no ground for annulment on the basis that the Tribunal did not properly address Applicant's grievances because there is no reference in the Award to the post-hearing correspondence of the Parties with respect to the slides. The correspondence itself makes it clear that the Tribunal carefully considered the positions of the Parties when making the decision to admit the slides. That the Tribunal did not discuss in the Award the correspondence with respect to the slides does not detract from this conclusion. Given the extensive correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal after the hearing, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal took into account Applicant's arguments.\n\n104.\n\nFurther, Applicant's request that the Committee second guess the Tribunal's conclusion to admit the PowerPoint presentation but not the *dossier de plaidoirie* is well outside of the Committee's mandate in an annulment proceeding. The concern of the Committee is the integrity of the process and whether the Parties had equal opportunity to present their case. The Committee is satisfied that the integrity of the process was preserved in this case. The Committee concludes that the Tribunal heard Applicant's objections, gave each Party a chance to fully explain its position, and ensured that no new evidence was placed into the record by virtue of admitting the slides.\n\n105.\n\nTherefore, the Committee holds that no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure occurred in this case. Having reached that conclusion, there is no need for the Committee to address Applicant's allegation that the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is prejudicial *per se* and mandates annulment. Similarly, there is no need for the Committee to consider Respondent's argument that Applicant waived its right to object to the slides by failing to make \"any formal request to exclude Ma\u00eetre Webster's Slides from the record of the oral hearing.\"168\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 54.\n\n**V. Failure To State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal engaged in contradictory reasoning, which amounts to a failure to state reasons.169 Applicant points to three contradictions in the Tribunal's reasoning and argues that they amount to a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50(1)(iii).170 Respondent sees no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter IV.\n\n*See* Application, pp. 45-54. *See also* Memorial, pp. 93-103.\n\nA. First Alleged Contradiction\n------------------------------\n\n1. Applicant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n107.\n\nAccording to Applicant, the Tribunal made a contradictory finding with respect to certain financial information Egypt claims to have received from Malicorp's representatives.171 As described above in the discussion of the PowerPoint presentation, one of the central issues in this case was whether, during the January 3, 2000 meeting, Egypt received a document setting out Malicorp's capital.172 In Malicorp's submission, this document was crucial for the Tribunal's analysis.173\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 93-99. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 31:16 - 35:4.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 94 (*quoting* Award, para. 135) *.*\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 95.\n\n108.\n\nApplicant asserts that the minutes of the January 3, 2000 meeting were not signed and no annex was included.174 It is therefore very difficult, if not impossible, to know exactly what happened during the meeting or which documents, if any, Respondent received.175 The document Egypt claims to have received stated that Malicorp's \"share capital is \u00a3100 million divided into one million shares of \u00a3100 each.\"176 Applicant argues that there is no evidence that it was Malicorp that gave this document to Egypt, and that the document submitted by Egypt in the arbitration was forged.177\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 96.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 96.\n\nAward, para. 135. *See also* Closing Submission of Respondent (PowerPoint presentation), Slide 42, Exh. DA-23.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 96.\n\n109.\n\nApplicant further argues that the Tribunal made contradictory findings relating to this document, on the one hand, deciding that it could not establish \"l'authenticit\u00e9 du document incrimin\u00e9,\"178 while, on the other hand, concluding that this document had sufficiently misled Respondent so as to justify Respondent's rescission of the Contract.179\n\nMemorial, pp. 96-97 (*citing* Award, para. 136).\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 97-98 (*citing* Award, para. 136).\n\n110.\n\nIn Applicant's opinion, the Tribunal had three options: it could have concluded that Malicorp never gave the document to Egypt, that the document was forged, or that it did not have enough information and should have taken affirmative steps to obtain more evidence on this issue.180 According to Applicant, the Tribunal's finding that the authenticity of the key document could not be established (because \"[m]\u00eame s'il existe de s\u00e9rieux indices, ils ne sont pas suffisants pour aboutir \u00e0 une claire conclusion d'une importance aussi capitale\"181) cannot be reconciled with its ultimate decision that \"le motif principal avanc\u00e9 par la D\u00e9fenderesse dans sa lettre d'annulation du Contrat avait un fondement suffisant et autorisait la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 se d\u00e9partir du Contrat.\"182 In Applicant's view, this represents an obvious contradiction; either (1) the document is authentic and capable of supporting Respondent's argument that it rescinded the Contract because it was misled, or (2) it is unknown whether the document is authentic, and thus Respondent cannot credibly rely on it.183 Applicant thus argues that the Tribunal contradicted itself by finding both (1) and (2).\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 95-99.\n\nMemorial, pp. 94-95 (*citing* Award, para. 135).\n\nMemorial, pp. 94-95 (*citing* Award, para. 137).\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 98-99.\n\n2. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRespondent argues that the *MINE*,184*Vivendi I*,185 and *Continental Casualty186* annulment decisions support the position that failure to state reasons should only be a ground for annulment where a tribunal does not state any reason for reaching its decision, not where it simply does not state convincing reasons.187 Respondent further relies on the holding of the *Continental Casualty ad hoc* Committee, which stated:\n\n[F]or genuinely contradictory reasons to cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision....\n\nIn cases where it is merely arguable whether there is a contradiction or inconsistency in the tribunal's reasoning, it is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument. Nor is it the role of an annulment committee to express its own view on whether or not the reasons given by the tribunal are logical or rational or correct.188\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision.\n\n*Vivendi I* Annulment Decision.\n\n*Continental Casualty* Annulment Decision.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 74. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 26.\n\n*Continental Casualty* Annulment Decision, para. 103.\n\n112.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the Tribunal did not base any of its conclusions regarding the termination of the Contract on the contested document.189 According to Respondent, the Tribunal's reasoning was concerned with the \"inter-relationship between the CRCICA arbitration proceedings and the ICSID proceedings.\"190 Respondent explains that:\n\nWhat the ICSID Tribunal did in its Award of February 7th, 2011, was in final analysis taking into consideration the outcome of the CRCICA arbitral proceeding, and undertook its mission under the BIT to decide that no expropriation was undertaken by the Host State in the exercise of its sovereign power, but simply a termination of a contract which lead to compensation by the proper forum contractually agreed upon by the Parties themselves to adjudicate their contractual disputes, and which has to be recognized as such.191\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 77.\n\nRejoinder, para. 28. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 79; Annul. Tr. E. Dec. 6, 38:15 - 38:23.\n\nRejoinder, para. 29.\n\n113.\n\nRespondent considers the above reasoning to be perfectly sound.192\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 32.\n\n3. The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe first alleged contradiction relates to the principal reason put forward by Respondent for its decision to rescind the Contract: the fact that \"it had allegedly been misled by the submission of inaccurate documents concerning Claimant's financial capacities.\"193\n\nAward, para. 131 (emphasis in original).\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the call for tender documents specifically required the submission of documents stating the \"qualitative of finance and the issued capital.\"194 The Tribunal next looked at the Memorandum of Association Applicant submitted as part of its bid for the Contract. That document showed that Malicorp's capital was \u00a31,000 divided into 1,000 shares of \u00a31 each. Malicorp was then asked to attend a meeting with Respondent to answer a number of questions, including \"the details of the capital (issued and licensed).\"195\n\nAward, para. 132 (emphasis in original).\n\nAward, para. 134.\n\n116.\n\nNext, the Tribunal noted that the minutes of that January 3, 2000 meeting recorded that Applicant was a British company \"with its capital of one hundred million Sterling pounds according to the attached commercial register which was reviewed by the Committee's members.\"196 The Tribunal observed that \"the statement would have been correct if it had made it clear that it referred not to the issued and paid-up capital as stated in the question, but to the authorised capital, which is obviously meaningless as long as the sources of financing of this capital are not given.\"197\n\nMinutes of the January 3, 2000 meeting, as quoted in the Award, para. 134.\n\nAward, para. 134.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to analyze the key document allegedly given to Egypt by representatives of Malicorp during the meeting. It found that this document was \"allegedly an extract made on 15 September 1999 of the \u2018 *Register of companies for England and Wales*,' certifying that the company had been incorporated on 6 August 1997.\"198 Item number 5 in that document stated: \" *The Company's share capital is \u00a3100 million divided into one million shares of \u00a3100 each*.\"199 The Tribunal noted that \"[n]owhere does the text make it clear which type of capital this is.\"200 Previously, the Tribunal had referred to the meaning of the term \"capital\": \"In practice, it could be said that in business dealings, the mention of \u2018 *capital'* refers at least to capital that is subscribed if not paid-up, and not merely to authorised capital, this being only a measure prior to subscription.\"201\n\nAward, para. 135 (emphasis in original).\n\nAward, para. 135 (emphasis in original).\n\nAward, para. 135.\n\nAward, para. 134 (emphasis in original).\n\n118.\n\nApparently, the Tribunal did not believe it necessary to determine \"the authenticity of the suspect document\" in order to reach its decision.202 Instead, it first decided that, regardless of the exact knowledge gained by Respondent during the January 3, 2000 meeting, \"the nature and content of the information supplied to the Respondent by Malicorp's representatives was such as to give rise to an essential mistake.\"203 Next, the Tribunal found that the financial strength of Malicorp was of utmost importance given the large scale of the project: \"for a project as monumental as that of the Ras Sudr airport, knowing whether the company awarded the project is an empty shell or a company with exceptional resources is obviously fundamental.\"204 Finally, The Tribunal concluded that:\n\nIn these circumstances,... the principal reason given by the Respondent in its letter rescinding the Contract was sufficiently well founded, and gave the Respondent the right to withdraw from the Contract.205\n\nAward, para. 136.\n\nAward, para. 136.\n\nAward, para. 136.\n\nAward, para. 137.\n\n119.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal made findings of fact that did not depend on the authenticity of the disputed document. To reach its factual conclusions, the Tribunal had to balance conflicting considerations submitted by the Parties. Whether these findings of fact are correct or not is outside the scope of the Committee's review. That Applicant disagrees with the factual findings and legal analysis of the Tribunal is not sufficient to annul the Award. Applicant must persuade the Committee that the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for its conclusions or that the Tribunal's reasons are so contradictory as to cancel each other. Applicant has not met that standard. Whether the Committee would follow the same logic or reach the same conclusion in this case is of no consequence. The Committee thus holds that Applicant's first alleged contradiction does not constitute sufficient basis for annulment.\n\nB. Second Alleged Contradiction\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Applicant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n120.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal also contradicted itself in paragraph 141 of the Award, where it stated that Malicorp had failed to prove that it took the necessary steps to establish a local Egyptian company as required under the Contract.206 Applicant claims that this statement is in direct contradiction with the Tribunal's prior findings in paragraphs 17 through 29 of the Award that Malicorp had in fact taken a number of concrete steps to set up the company.207\n\n*See* Application, pp. 50-52; Memorial, pp. 99-102. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 35:5 - 36:39.\n\n*See* Application, p. 50. *See also* Memorial, p. 99.\n\n121.\n\nApplicant also asserts that the Tribunal's failure to understand Malicorp's position on this issue is explained by \"l'absence de travail du Tribunal Arbitral sur les pi\u00e8ces produites.\"208 Finally, Applicant claims that the Tribunal \"invented\" its reasoning instead of reviewing Malicorp's exhibits.209\n\nMemorial, p. 102.\n\n*See* Reply, pp. 20-21.\n\n2. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n122.\n\nAccording to Respondent, there is no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning on this point.210 It was enough for the Tribunal to indicate that \"there were multiple reasons which prevented the due incorporation of the local entity subject to [Egypt's] Investment Law, and the blame cannot be exclusively attributed to either party.\"211\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 84.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 83. *See also* Annul. Tr. E., Dec. 6, 38:24 - 39:22.\n\n123.\n\nRespondent argues that Applicant ignores the distinction between the treaty claim - *i.e.* expropriation - at stake in this case and the contract claims already decided by the CRCICA Tribunal.212 Respondent also notes that Applicant has not acknowledged the fact that the Tribunal was justified to decline jurisdiction to adjudicate the factual and legal arguments pertaining to the Contract's termination that had already been decided in the CRCICA arbitration.213\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, p. 77\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 32.\n\n3. The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe second alleged contradiction refers to the grounds for termination of the Contract based on the non-performance by Applicant. The Committee first observes that, according to the Tribunal, \"[e]ven if the answer to the previous question [regarding Malicorp's financial status] is enough in itself to enable it to rule on the submissions before it, the Arbitral Tribunal deems it appropriate, out of an excess of caution, to briefly review these.\"214 Thus the Tribunal considered the non-performance of the Contract by Applicant only subsidiarily and could have decided the dispute without ruling on that question. Therefore, even if the Committee were to agree with Applicant's argument, an annulment of this part of the Award would not affect the rest of the Award and the outcome of the arbitration.\n\nAward, para. 138.\n\n125.\n\nNevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Committee will proceed to review whether the Tribunal contradicted itself in its analysis of the grounds invoked by Respondent to terminate the Contract. Applicant considers contradictory the reasoning of the Tribunal in paragraph 141 of the Award and the findings of fact in paragraphs 17-29. Paragraph 141 in relevant part reads as follows:\n\nThe fact remains, though, that at no time has the Claimant attempted to persuade the Arbitral Tribunal that it actually did, at the outset, take the significant legal, financial and most of all technical steps required to launch such a project. The delays in taking the first steps and the absence of any practical progress, especially where the potential partners were concerned, could well have added to the doubts and concerns of the Egyptian authorities. At no time, in fact, has the Claimant attempted to show that this last criticism was unfounded....\n\n126.\n\nIn paragraphs 17 to 29 of the Award, the Tribunal started by pointing out that \"[u]nder the Contract, Malicorp had to take a number of measures quickly.\"215 The Tribunal also noted that at an unknown date, Applicant instructed a major accounting firm to take the necessary steps for setting up the company.216 The Tribunal listed the numerous notices of Respondent reminding Applicant of its obligation to set up the company and provide bank guarantees.217\n\nAward, para. 17.\n\n*See* Award, para. 17.\n\n*See* Award, paras. 18-33.\n\n127.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence, the Tribunal was not persuaded that Applicant had taken the necessary steps as required under the Contract. This is a factual determination to be made by the Tribunal and it is not the Committee's role to review that determination.\n\n128.\n\nApplicant also claims that the Tribunal failed to adequately consider two of its exhibits, namely a letter dated May 2000 from the Intelligence Service National Security stating that it did not object to Malicorp's proposed project and another dated July 22, 2001, in which the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), citing national security concerns, refused to grant Malicorp permission to build the airport.218 Malicorp thus claims that the Tribunal did not make every effort to understand its position.219 There are several difficulties with Applicant's argument. First, Applicant cannot reliably demonstrate that the Tribunal did not consider those exhibits. Second, whether the Tribunal \"adequately\" considered the exhibits is a matter of fact-finding within the discretion of the Tribunal and beyond the scope of this Committee's review. Third, this argument does not assert any contradictory reasoning; it relates to an alleged failure to consider specific documents.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 101.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 101.\n\n129.\n\nApplicant further contends that the following sentence is contradictory: \"Il est possible que la demande ait \u00e9t\u00e9 par la suite retard\u00e9e par les atermoiements de la D\u00e9fenderesse, mais cette situation, si elle est av\u00e9r\u00e9e, n'est intervenue que tardivement dans le processus de r\u00e9siliation, alors que le projet vacillait d\u00e9j\u00e0.\"220 Applicant affirms that the motivation of the Tribunal is \"pure invention\" and explains that the project did not progress precisely because of the procrastination of Respondent.221\n\nAward, para. 140. (English version of the Award: \"It is possible that the application was delayed by the Respondent's own procrastination, but that situation, while clearly the case, arose only later during the process of termination, by which time the project was already faltering.\")\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 99.\n\n130.\n\nIt will be useful to consider the whole paragraph from which this sentence has been extracted. The following reasoning of the Tribunal precedes the allegedly contradictory sentence:\n\nThe first obligation concerned the setting up of the Egyptian company. It is not disputed that the incorporation did not take place in the time allowed. One primary reason is that the Claimant delayed in taking the necessary steps to set it up. Admittedly, for the Respondent, the incorporation of that company was critical. First, because the Contract had also been entered into in the name of the company to be formed (see above, no. 15); next, and most of all, because it had to show sufficient financial capacity to guarantee the solidity and reliability of the operation. The capital was subscribed by Malicorp, which, however, had not yet significantly increased its own capital.222\n\nAward, para. 140 (first sub-paragraph, emphasis in original).\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to find that:\n\nIt is possible that the application was delayed by the Respondent's own procrastination, but that situation, while clearly the case, arose only later during the process of termination, by which time the project was already faltering.223\n\nAward, para. 140.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee does not find these two conclusions - that Applicant breached its duties to incorporate the Egyptian company from the beginning and that Respondent also delayed matters - to be contradictory, let alone to cancel each other out.\n\nC. Third Alleged Contradiction\n------------------------------\n\n1. Applicant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n133.\n\nApplicant's third claim of alleged contradiction relates to the Tribunal's rejection of Malicorp's request for compensation for expropriation. The Tribunal concluded that Respondent had not expropriated Malicorp's property.224 The Award notes that the CRCICA Tribunal had similarly dismissed Applicant's expropriation claim, but had nonetheless awarded it some damages, finding that \"Respondent must bear part of the costs and damages its decision generated for the Claimant.\"225 The ICSID Tribunal, however, refused to award damages. Applicant calls attention to the Tribunal's reasoning in doing so: that \"[e]ven if [the CRCICA Tribunal's damages] argument does not seem unreasonable, it is outside the scope of these proceedings, as the Claimant has not formally made any additional submissions on the subject.\"226\n\n*See* Award, para. 143.\n\nAward, para. 143.\n\nAward, para. 143.\n\n134.\n\nApplicant finds the following contradiction: (1) it was denied damages because it did not make any submissions on damages; and (2) it was denied the opportunity to make such submissions because the Tribunal had decided that claims for damages would be heard and decided at a second phase of the arbitration if liability was established.227 Applicant thus argues that the Tribunal's decision-making process was arbitrary and contradictory because it prevented Applicant from pleading damages while at the same time holding it against Applicant that it had not done so.\n\n*See* Memorial, pp. 102-04. *See also* Transcript of the First Session, July 31, 2009, para. 80.\n\n135.\n\nApplicant thus concludes that:\n\nIl n'est donc pas possible, sauf \u00e0 contredire le cadre dans lequel le Tribunal a voulu que les parties d\u00e9posent leur m\u00e9moire et plaident, de reprocher \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MALICORP de n'avoir pas conclu \u00e0 une indemnisation partielle, d\u00e8s lors que le quantum devait relever d'une seconde phase de la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale, et que le Tribunal n'a pas sp\u00e9cialement interrog\u00e9 les parties de ce chef.228\n\nMemorial, p. 104. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 36:40 - 37:44.\n\n2. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the alleged contradiction ignores two fundamental factors: (i) the only cause of action that would have given rise to Egypt's responsibility under the BIT is expropriation so that once this claim is dismissed, there was no other cause of action under which to award damages, and (ii) the Tribunal indicated that the CRCICA Award which dealt with the \"contract claims\" and awarded partial compensation to Applicant was *res judicata* and Applicant explicitly requested that such partial compensation be taken into consideration by the Tribunal to prevent double recovery.229 Respondent finds no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning arising out of a decision to divide the arbitration proceeding into two phases and not following through with the compensation phase once all substantive claims were dismissed.230\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 86. *See also* Annul. Tr. E., Dec. 6, 39:23 - 41:6.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 33. *See also* Annul. Tr. E., Dec. 6, 41:7 - 41:18.\n\n137.\n\nIt is Respondent's view that, in the final analysis, the Committee must establish whether it is impossible to understand the decision of the Tribunal, and none of the alleged contradictions raised by Applicant passes this test.231\n\n*See* Rejoinder, paras. 31-33.\n\n3. The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Committee finds no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning. It was within the discretion of the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceedings and hear jurisdiction and liability first, while hearing damages at a second phase, if necessary. It is thus obvious that if Claimant lost on liability, as it did, there would be no opportunity to put forward claims and arguments on damages.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that \"Claimant's submissions based on the principle of compensation for expropriation are rejected.\"232 By dismissing Applicant's substantive claim, the Tribunal never reached the damages phase. Thus, the Tribunal never heard Claimant's arguments on damages because it found no violation of the BIT, for which compensation would be owed. Whatever the conclusions of the CRCICA Tribunal were with respect to liability for breach of the Contract and contractual damages, the BIT Tribunal could not have awarded any damages to Malicorp in the BIT arbitration because it found no violation of the BIT.\n\nAward, para. 143.\n\n140.\n\nIn sum, having considered and rejected each of the contradictions alleged by Applicant in support of its allegation that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, the Committee concludes that there is no basis for annulment for failure to state reasons.\n\n**VI. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------\n\nA. Applicant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n141.\n\nAccording to Applicant, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power by failing to apply the proper law - *i.e.* Egyptian law and the terms of the Contract.233 Applicant refers to the following statement in the Award:\n\nThe first question, therefore, is whether the Republic had the right to discharge itself from the Contract pursuant to the private law rules governing it (see above, no. 93). If that is the case, it is unnecessary to examine whether the Respondent also took a measure under its public powers (\" *measures* [sic] *de puissance publique* \"), not as a party to the Contract but as a State, the effectiveness and conformity with the Agreement [the BIT] of which would have to be examined. Indeed, the rescission of the Contract would not leave any subsisting breach of the umbrella clause nor, moreover, in the absence of a protected investment, of other clauses of the Agreement.234\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter V.\n\nAward, para. 126.\n\n142.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal examined the facts and decided on the issues of law in a subjective manner and without any reference to the provisions of the Contract or Egyptian law. According to Applicant, the reference to the law of the Contract is not sufficient by itself \"\u00e0 supporter la totalit\u00e9 du raisonnement d\u00e8s lors que celui-ci suppose que le droit \u00e9gyptien autorise, dans de telles circonstances, l'invocation d'un vice du consentement.\"235 Applicant asserts that the Tribunal should have invoked specific provisions of Egyptian law to reach its conclusions.236\n\nMemorial, p. 109.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 109. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 39:46 - 41:20.\n\n143.\n\nApplicant further argues that the Tribunal exceeded its powers when it applied a sanction that is not permitted by Egyptian contract law. The Tribunal determined that the misunderstanding, on the basis of which Respondent proceeded with the Contract after the January 3, 2000 meeting, was sufficient ground for the subsequent rescission of the Contract.237 However, Applicant claims that the Tribunal did not have the power to reach such conclusion because, under Egyptian law, this may only be done by a competent court within three years from the date on which the grounds for rescission became known. Applicant contends that Respondent never requested a court to rule on the validity of the Contract and that the three years had expired. Applicant concludes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers under Egyptian law.238\n\n*See* Award, para. 137.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 110. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 42:34 - 45:23.\n\n144.\n\nApplicant also considers that the Tribunal exceeded its powers when it determined that Respondent had the right to terminate the Contract on grounds of non-performance. According to Applicant, under Egyptian law, only a judge may decide the rescission of a contract on grounds of non-performance not foreseen in the contract.239 Applicant argues that, since the Contract did not include any clause related to the grounds advanced by Respondent to terminate the Contract, Respondent was obliged to request a competent court, in this case the CRCICA Tribunal, to terminate the Contract pursuant to Article 147 of the Egyptian Civil Code. Applicant alleges that Respondent did not comply with Article 147 and terminated the Contract unilaterally in violation of that provision.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 109. *See also* Annul. Tr. F., Dec. 6, 45:38 - 45:46.\n\n145.\n\nAccording to Applicant, the Tribunal determined that Malicorp's non-performance was sufficient to justify Egypt's rescission of the Contract without examining Egyptian law. Malicorp admits that the Tribunal identified the correct law, but argues that in fact it did not apply that law, which constitutes a manifest excess of powers.240\n\n*See* Memorial, p. 109.\n\n146.\n\nApplicant invokes as an example of the Tribunal's failure to apply Egyptian law the fact that the Tribunal did not know what concept to apply: annulment, rescission, or invalidation of the Contract. Applicant claims that the Tribunal used the term \" *d\u00e9partir* \" because:\n\n[Les arbitres] n'ont pas concr\u00e8tement v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le contenu du droit \u00e9gyptien, et ne savaient donc pas quel terme appliquer, *\"annulation\", \"r\u00e9solution\" ou \"r\u00e9siliation* \", \u00e0 l'acte par lequel la REPUBLIQUE ARABE D'\u00c9GYPTE avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 12 ao\u00fbt 2001 de rompre les relations contractuelles avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MALICORP, d'autant que les diverses correspondances de la REPUBLIQUE ARABE D'\u00c9GYPTE ont utilis\u00e9s les trois concepts.241\n\nReply, p. 24 (emphasis in original).\n\n147.\n\nApplicant concludes that the Tribunal simply \"made up\" Egyptian law in reaching its decision:\n\n[D]\u00e8s lors que les Arbitres ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 vouloir appliquer le droit interne \u00e9gyptien, et n'ont v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 ni le droit pour une partie de rompre unilat\u00e9ralement le contrat, ni l'incidence du manquement de la partie rompant le contrat \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses propres obligations, ni les cons\u00e9quences d'une rupture non judiciairement prononc\u00e9e, les Arbitres ont invent\u00e9 la loi \u00e9gyptienne, et ont n\u00e9cessairement statu\u00e9 par voie d'exc\u00e8s de pouvoir.242\n\nReply, p. 24 *.*\n\nB. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n148.\n\nRespondent recalls in its Counter-Memorial that the Tribunal was only competent to consider treaty claims and that international law is the applicable law for such claims. Further, the contractual dispute was resolved by the CRCICA Tribunal, is *res judicata*, and was recognized as such by the Tribunal.243 It is thus Respondent's contention that the Tribunal deliberately chose to avoid using domestic law concepts, and\n\nwithin the exercise of its controlling power in appreciating what took place, the Tribunal use the wording \" *d\u00e9partir du contrat* \" in its process of analyzing the measure which took place to evaluate to what extent this measure can be considered justifiable from an International Law point of view; i.e. whether or not the termination would or would not amount to an \"expropriation\" engaging the State responsibility and requiring indemnification for a violation of an international obligation arising under the Egypt/United Kingdom BIT.244\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 95.\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Respondent, what Applicant is requesting amounts to\n\na tacit request calling the ICSID Tribunal to act as a Court of Appeal revising what the CRCICA Arbitration decided in application of the domestic legal system it was entrusted to apply, and at the same time explicitly requesting the *Ad hoc* Committee to re-arbitrate the case through a new trial focusing on *Malicorp* 's own points of view in its pleadings in front of the two previous jurisdictions, and at the same time to substitute the International Law applicable to the \"Expropriation Claim\" by a selective reading of the Egyptian Civil Law which is claimed accordingly to acquire legal standing to be considered the \"applicable law\" governing \"Treaty Claims\", in contradiction to all established precedents since *AAPL/Sri Lanka*.245\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\n150.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent emphasizes that, pursuant to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, the law to be applied is the law agreed between the Parties with\n\nthe compelling result that it is absolutely clear that MALICORP filed its case in front of the ICSID Tribunal in reliance on the BIT between Egypt and the United Kingdom, which absolutely means the applicability of the rules contained in that Treaty creating international law obligations on the Host State of the investment (in our case Egypt), and [ **sic** ] necessarily recognizing the international liability of Egypt in case the ICSID Tribunal declared itself competent and decides [ **sic** ] that a given treaty obligation has been violated.246\n\nRejoinder, para. 37. *See also* Annul. Tr. E., Dec. 6, 42:3 - 42:18.\n\n151.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Committee has to approach its task with caution by\n\ndistinguishing primarily failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal, and at the same time by ensuring that the misapplication of the Law once identified should be so egregious as to constitute, in practice, non-application of the proper law.247\n\nRejoinder, para. 40.\n\n152.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal stated it was applying Egyptian law and that, therefore, the inquiry should stop there.248 According to Respondent, there is no reason to believe that the Tribunal would identify the proper applicable law only to proceed to apply a different law.249 Respondent concludes that Applicant's manifest excess of powers claim must necessarily fail because the Committee is not empowered to review whether the Tribunal correctly applied Egyptian law.250\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\n153.\n\nRespondent concludes that it is impossible to envision the annulment of the Award when Applicant has been unable to establish any failure to apply the relevant rules governing the international liability of Egypt for violation of its obligations under the BIT.251\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 42.\n\nC. The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Committee agrees that it is not within its mandate to review whether the Tribunal correctly applied Egyptian law. However, the Committee cannot agree with Respondent's argument that the Tribunal's statement that it was applying Egyptian law is dispositive. The Committee must proceed to verify whether indeed the Tribunal applied Egyptian law. This is because it is possible that a tribunal would state that it is applying one law while in fact applying another. In this case, the Committee must examine whether the Tribunal identified Egyptian law as the proper law but went on to apply some other law instead. This is in fact the crux of Applicant's argument. Applicant asserts that even though the Tribunal identified Egyptian law as the proper law and claimed to apply it, it in fact did not do so because its legal analysis does not refer to any provisions of Egyptian law or jurisprudence.252\n\n*See* Memorial, Chapter V-1.\n\n155.\n\nOnce the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal in fact applied the proper law, however, the Committee need not examine whether the Tribunal applied that law correctly. As the *Soufraki ad hoc* Committee stated, it would be sufficient if the Tribunal in its Award \"strive[d] in good faith to apply [Egyptian] law as it would have been applied by [Egyptian] courts.\"253 As set forth below, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal applied Egyptian law in good faith by relying on the analysis of Egyptian law in the CRCICA Award.\n\n*See* *Soufraki* Annulment Decision, paras. 99, 101-02. *See also* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 963.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal had before it two types of claims based on the same facts: contractual claims and treaty claims. The Tribunal decided the treaty claims, *i.e.*, the claims for violation of the BIT, by applying international law. There is no dispute between the parties that the Tribunal applied the proper law with respect to the BIT claims. However, to decide the BIT claims, the Tribunal had to decide a critical question: whether the Contract was properly rescinded. To resolve that question, the Tribunal had to interpret and apply Egyptian law. The Tribunal correctly identified Egyptian law as the proper law to be applied; the matter in dispute is whether the Tribunal actually applied it.\n\n157.\n\nThe same question - whether the Contract was rescinded in compliance with Egyptian law - had already been heard and resolved by the CRCICA Tribunal. There is no disagreement between the Parties that the CRCICA Tribunal resolved that question by applying Egyptian law. It was therefore perfectly reasonable for the BIT Tribunal to rely on, and accept, the CRCICA Tribunal's analysis and conclusions. By doing so, the Tribunal in fact applied Egyptian law without performing *de novo* the entire review and analysis of Egyptian law performed by the CRCICA Tribunal.\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal relied on the analysis and conclusions of the CRCICA Tribunal with caution. It stated that it was not its task to rule on the validity of the CRCICA Award. The Tribunal noted that Applicant had waived \"any attempt to have the award set aside, but has accepted its conclusions and is seeking to have it compulsorily enforced. The fact that, to date, it has not been successful before a national court does nothing to change that.\"254 On the other hand, the Tribunal referred to the fact that Respondent challenged the CRCICA Award:\n\n[...] in the CRCICA arbitration proceedings [Respondent] firmly opposed arbitration as provided for in the Contract, a procedure whose validity it disputed; it appealed the decision of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal finding it had jurisdiction and won the case before the Egyptian state courts on first appeal, though that is the subject of a review currently (apparently) still pending before the Supreme Court (see above, no. 59).\n\nThe inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that by such attitude Respondent has rejected recourse to the avenues provided for in the Contract. For the Arbitral Tribunal, this raises a degree of uncertainty concerning the outcome of the commercial procedure, which makes it acceptable for the party claiming to have been injured to use the remedies afforded by the Agreement. There can be no question, on the other hand, of reopening the commercial proceedings.255\n\nAward, para 103 d).\n\nAward, para 103 d).\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, did not simply adopt the conclusions of the CRCICA Tribunal. It examined the CRCICA Tribunal's analysis, identified the questions arising under Egyptian law, reviewed the CRCICA Tribunal's conclusions and, on that basis, reached its own conclusions:\n\nThe first question with respect to the first two grounds is whether the Contract was validly entered into, whether it was void from the outset because the circumstances in which it was concluded contravened the principle of good faith, or whether it was capable of being rescinded because of a defect in consent, namely misrepresentation or mistake. The answer depends, in the first place, on the rules applicable to it, in this case Egyptian civil law.\n\nAs has been seen (see above, no. 44 *et seq*.), these issues have already been examined and decided in the CRCICA arbitration proceedings instituted by the Claimant pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Contract. In its award of 7 March 2006, the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal held, in particular, that there was no proof of forgery or fraud, but that it had, on the other hand, been established that Respondent had entered into the Contract while labouring under a mistake, and that, therefore, it had the right to discharge itself from it. That said, since it bore part of the responsibility for that mistake, it was only fair that it should be made to bear part of the costs incurred by Applicant.\n\nHaving decided not to re-examine that decision, this Arbitral Tribunal could have limited itself to basing its ruling on the said decision. However, as has been seen (see above, no. 59) the Respondent refuses to submit to that decision or to accept its conclusions. The uncertainty that persists, therefore, justifies the Arbitral Tribunal in verifying, as a matter ancillary to the guarantees offered by the Agreement [the BIT], that, even if that award were to be set aside, the conclusions arrived at by this Arbitral Tribunal would be no different from those of the CRCICA Arbitral Tribunal. The fact is that, if the only conclusion to be drawn is that there were sufficient grounds for rescinding the Contract, there would be nothing left to protect.256\n\nAward, para. 130.\n\n160.\n\nThere is thus no question that the Tribunal applied Egyptian law in deciding whether the Contract was properly rescinded. The Tribunal followed the analysis of the CRCICA Tribunal, which undoubtedly also applied Egyptian law. It was fully within the Tribunal's power and discretion to rely on the CRCICA Award and accept its interpretation of the applicable Egyptian law. Whether the Tribunal should have subjected specific provisions of Egyptian law to closer scrutiny and analysis, or whether the Tribunal should have invoked and examined different provisions of Egyptian law, is not a question that should be dealt with in an annulment proceeding. The Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal applied the proper law and finds no errors committed by the Tribunal in that context that were \"so egregious as to amount to a failure to apply the proper law.\"257\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision, paras. 99, 101-02. *See also* Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION at 963.\n\n**VII. Costs**\n--------------\n\n161.\n\nEach Party has pleaded that the fees and expenses of its legal representation, those of the Committee members and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre be borne by the other Party. Under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) read together with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has discretion in deciding the apportionment of fees and expenses of the parties, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n162.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Committee considers that each of the Parties shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses and that Applicant shall bear the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre258, the exact amount of which shall be subsequently notified by the Centre.259\n\nDr. Eduardo Silva Romero is of the view that, given that the Annulment Application was groundless, Applicant should have been ordered by the Committee to bear the entirety of Respondent's costs incurred as a result of the annulment proceedings.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as the account has been finalized.\n\n**VIII. Decision**\n------------------\n\n163.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Committee rejects in its entirety Malicorp's Application for Annulment and declines to annul the Award."}]}
