PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 15, 2015 Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. **[\"Lion\" or \"Claimant\"]** filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **[\"ICSID\"]** a Request for Arbitration against the United Mexican States **[\"Mexico\"]** pursuant to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules **[\"Arbitration AF Rules\"]** and Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement **[\"NAFTA\"].**\n\n2.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on July 27, 2016, in accordance with the Arbitration AF Rules. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that no party had any objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal. The Members of the Tribunal timely submitted their signed declarations pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules.\n\n3.\n\nOn September 26, 2016 the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session by teleconference under Art. 21(1) Arbitration AF Rules, in order to deal with as many case management issues as possible. Before and during the session it became apparent the Parties could not reach an agreement as to the place of the arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nOn September 30, 2016 the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit within one week their arguments with regard to the selection of a seat.\n\n5.\n\nBy October 4, 2016 the Parties submitted their statements on this issue.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 14, 2016 the Tribunal issued the Procedural Order No. 1. Its Clause 11.1 provides that \"[a]fter receiving the parties\u2019 positions on the matter, the Tribunal shall establish the place of arbitration in a separate order.\" Pursuant to such provision the present order is hereby made.\n\n**II. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nMexico, the Respondent, proposes Toronto (Canada) to be the place of this arbitration, while Lion, the Claimant, proposes Washington, D.C. (United States of America).\n\n**A. Lion\u2019s position**\n----------------------\n\n8.\n\nLion considers Washington, D.C. to be \"the ideal place\" for this arbitration1. In its view, \"this choice respects the requirements of neutrality and experience in international arbitration matters that a seat must have, particularly in a case such as this one2.\" Lion makes the following arguments:\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 2.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 2.\n\n9.\n\nFirst, Washington, D.C. is in a jurisdiction that is neither that of the nationality of the investor (Canada) nor that of the host State (Mexico)3.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 6.\n\n10.\n\nSecond, Washington, D.C. is located in the United States of America, the only NAFTA state that is not that of the Parties. This is relevant because in most arbitrations against Mexico under NAFTA the parties or the tribunal have selected a seat in a jurisdiction that was not that of either party to the arbitration. In the 12 previous NAFTA cases - brought by U.S. investors against Mexico - 10 had a seat in Canada (the third NAFTA state)4. In the other two, the seat was in fact Washington, D.C. despite the fact the claimant was a U.S. national5. In the five known non-NAFTA arbitration cases where Mexico was, or currently is, a respondent, the seat has always been Washington, D.C.6 with Mexico having consented in two of these cases7.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 7, citing to *Archer Daniels Midland and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/5); *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2); *Bayview Irrigation District and others v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/l); *Cargill, Incorporated v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2); *Corn Products International, Inc. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/1); *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l); *Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1); *GAMI Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States', KBR, Inc. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case. No. UNCT/14/1); and *Metalclad Corporation v*. *The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l).\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 12, citing to *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation* v. *The United Mexican States* (UNCITRAL) and *Waste Management v*. *United Mexican States (II)* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3).\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 13, citing to *Telef\u00f3nica S.A. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/4); *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed v.

V. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3); *Talsud, S.A. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/4); and *Abengoa, S.A. y COFIDES, S.A.* v. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/2).\n\n*Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A., and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C. V. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3); *Talsud, S.A. v*. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/4).\n\n11.\n\nThird, Washington, D.C. is typically regarded as a neutral forum, even in cases when one of the parties is a national of the United States8. Washington, D.C. was selected in eight out of 10 cases where the United States was the respondent in an arbitration under NAFTA brought by a Canadian investor9. In the two other cases, the seat was in New York10.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, paras. 11 and 16.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 14, citing to *ADF Group Inc. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1); *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1)(III); *Apotex Inc.* v. *The Government of the United States of America (II); The Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade (formerly Consolidated Canadian Claims) v*. *United States of America; Canfor v*. *USACanfor Corporation v*. *United States of America; Glamis Gold Ltd. v*. *United States of America; Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3); *Methanex Corporation* v. *United States of America; Mondev International Ltd. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2); and *Softwood Lumber Consolidated case v. United States of America.*\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 14, citing to *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1) (III); and *Apotex Inc. v*. *The Government of the United States of America (II),* respectively. In the latter, according to Lion, there is no evidence if it was agreed or decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nFourth, there is no doubt, and nothing to the contrary is even alleged by Mexico, that the courts in Washington, D.C. are independent and experienced in international arbitration matters, including investor-State disputes11.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 20.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, Lion observes that, regardless of whether the company has ties to the United States of America, this does not change the fact that its nationality is Canadian for all legal purposes12.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 9.\n\n**B. Mexico\u2019s position**\n------------------------\n\n14.\n\nMexico submits that Toronto should be the place of this arbitration in preference to Washington, D.C. The reasons advanced by Mexico are twofold:\n\n15.\n\nFirst, Toronto is located in the province of Ontario (Canada). Ontario has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law. Thus the rules of this seat regarding support, revision, and setting aside of decisions from international arbitral tribunals are equivalent to those in force in over a hundred jurisdictions across the world13.\n\nMexico\u2019s letter, paras. 10 and 11.\n\n16.\n\nSecond, Mexico makes a case for the experience, quality, and independence of the Ontario courts in dealing with the enforcement of awards issued under NAFTA14.\n\nMexico\u2019s letter, paras. 12 through 14.\n\n17.\n\nMexico opposes Lion\u2019s suggestion to fix the seat in Washington, D.C. on the following grounds:\n\n18.\n\nFirst, Washington, D.C. has not adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law and uses a federal statute, which demands from the Tribunal and the Parties specialized knowledge15.\n\nMexico\u2019s letter, paras. 10 and 11.\n\n19.\n\nSecond, the United States of America is not a neutral territory in this arbitration because Lion is *de facto* a U.S. investor:\n\n- Lion admits that its main place of business and unified domicile for notifications is Dallas (Texas, U.S.A.).\n\n- Lion is a subsidiary of Clarion Partners, a U.S. company with offices in seven locations across the United States of America, and only two overseas (in Brazil and United Kingdom).\n\n- Lion, although incorporated in Quebec (Canada), has in fact no real presence or commercial interests in Canada: there is no publicly accessible evidence that Lion does business in Canada, deals with Canadian investors or that it is associated with any Canadian person or entity.\n\n- Clarion Partners, Lion\u2019s parent company, has no offices in Canada16.\n\nMexico\u2019s letter, paras. 7 and 9.\n\n20.\n\nMexico thus concludes that Lion is a Canadian entity only *de iure,* incorporated in Quebec (Canada) merely for reasons of tax efficiency or regulatory considerations. Its genuine place of business is in the United States, which should not be the seat of this arbitration17.\n\nMexico\u2019s letter, para. 8.\n\n**III. APPLICABLE STANDARD**\n----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nNAFTA, the treaty under which this arbitration arises, imposes under Art. 1130 only two requirements on the Tribunal in selecting, absent the parties\u2019 agreement, the place of an arbitration:\n\n- First, it has to choose a NAFTA country that is party to the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; and\n\n- Second, the choice has to be made in accordance with the Arbitration AF Rules.\n\n22.\n\nThe language of the provision is the following:\n\n\"Article 1130: Place of Arbitration\n\nUnless the disputing parties agree otherwise, a Tribunal shall hold an arbitration in the territory of a Party that is a party to the New York Convention, selected in accordance with:\n\n(a) the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if the arbitration is under those Rules or the ICSID Convention; or\n\n(b) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules if the arbitration is under those Rules.\"\n\n23.\n\nAs for the Arbitration AF Rules, Art. 20(1) requires only that the place of an arbitration be \"determined by the Arbitral Tribunal after consultation with the parties and the Secretariat\" among those States that are party to New York Convention (Art. 19). The article reads as follows:\n\n\"Article 19. Limitation on Choice of Forum.\n\nArbitration proceedings shall be held only in States that are parties to the 1958 UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n\nArticle 20. Determination of Place of Arbitration.\n\n(1) Subject to Article 19 of these Rules the place of arbitration shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal after consultation with the parties and the Secretariat.\n\n(2) The Arbitral Tribunal may meet at any place....\"\n\n**IV. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n24.\n\nLooking at the legal standard, Article 1130 restricts the Tribunal\u2019s choice, absent the Parties\u2019 agreement, to a NAFTA country that is party to the New York Convention. The three NAFTA countries - Canada, the United States, and Mexico - are parties to the Convention, and consequently, Washington, D.C. and Toronto meet both these legal requirements. As Mexico says, \"el territorio de cualquiera de ellas puede ser seleccionado como Tugar del arbitraje18.\u2019\"\n\nMexico\u2019s letter of October 3, 2016, para. 5.\n\n25.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that both Toronto and Washington are, generally speaking, perfectly suitable seats for an investment arbitration. The Parties in fact concur that the courts in both locations are amenable to arbitral proceedings and show a long and well-established record in this regard.\n\n26.\n\nIn their submissions, both Parties have quoted *Gallo* as a relevant guideline, which describes the optimal seat as a neutral location with a high quality, independent and experienced judiciary19:\n\n\"the perfect place of arbitration in an international investment arbitration is a jurisdiction which is neither that of the investor nor that of the host State, which has high quality, independent judiciary, with experience in providing support to, and reviewing and setting aside decisions from international arbitral tribunals, and which had the capability of handling disputes in the language of the arbitration, in this case English\".\n\n*Vito G. Gallo v*. *The Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 55798, letter A-9 from the tribunal to the parties of June 4, 2008, para. 15, available at http://www.uncitral.org/res/transparency-registry/registry/data/can/v\\_g\\_\\_gallo\\_html/gallopo-07.pdf. *See* Mexico\u2019s letter of October 3, 2016, para. 6, and Lion\u2019s letter of October 3, 2016, para. 3.\n\n27.\n\nThe first requirement established by *Gallo* is neutrality. Since Mexico is the Respondent in this arbitration, and Lion, the investor, is incorporated in Canada, the natural, neutral choice should be Washington, D.C. a location within the third NAFTA state. This is Claimant\u2019s position.\n\n28.\n\nMexico, however, is asking the Tribunal to disregard Washington, D.C. and select Toronto, a Canadian city, based on a double assumption: the Tribunal should presume,\n\n- first, that Lion\u2019s business is actually located in the United States, not in Canada; and,\n\n- second, that Lion is a shell company with no real ties to Canada.\n\nOn these assumptions the United States would not be a neutral place, while Canada would be.\n\n29.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings the Tribunal is not ready to make these assumptions, and therefore it cannot agree with Mexico\u2019s arguments. The Tribunal cannot determine at the present moment the actual ties between Lion and Canada, much less to conclude that Lion is a shell company. Furthermore, the Tribunal is not presently prepared to find that Lion has no real business in Canada.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, in its Request for Arbitration, Lion has stated that its main place of business is in the United States of America, specifically, Dallas, Texas20. The Tribunal, however, is not convinced that this circumstance is of so much weight as to disqualify Washington D.C. as a neutral venue. This is so because the neutrality requirement focuses on the nationality of the disputing Parties, and the Tribunal accepts for current purposes that Lion is validly incorporated under the laws of Quebec, Canada.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 2.\n\n31.\n\nIn addition, as Lion points out, Mexico\u2019s objection is somewhat at odds with Mexico\u2019s practice of having agreed to a seat in Washington, D.C. on several occasions21.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 25.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Washington, D.C. has been the seat of two NAFTA arbitrations brought by U.S. nationals against Mexico22. Furthermore, Washington, D.C. was selected in eight out of 10 cases where the United States was the respondent in an arbitration under NAFTA brought by a Canadian investor23.\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 12, citing to *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v*. *The United Mexican States* (UNCITRAL) and *Waste Management v*. *United Mexican States (II)* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3).\n\nLion\u2019s letter, para. 14, citing to *ADF Group Inc. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1); *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1)(III); *Apotex Inc. v. The Government of the United States of America (II); The Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade (formerly Consolidated Canadian Claims) v*. *United States of America; Canfor v*. *USACanfor Corporation v*. *United States of America; Glamis Gold Ltd. v*. *United States of America; Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3); *Methanex Corporation v*. *United States of America; Mondev International Ltd. v*. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2); and *Softwood Lumber Consolidated case v. United States of America.*\n\n33.\n\nThere is no question, moreover, that Washington, D.C. is widely regarded as a neutral forum, appropriate to serve as seat of international arbitrations, sometimes even in cases where one of the parties is a national of the United States.\n\n34.\n\nWashington, D.C. does satisfy the test described in *Gallo,* i.e., the existence of\n\n\"high quality, independent judiciary, with experience in providing support to, and reviewing and setting aside decisions from international arbitral tribunals....\"\n\n35.\n\nFinally, whether a country has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law is not decisive of this issue. As beneficial as it is, the Model Law has not been adopted by countries such as France, Switzerland, the United States, or England, which are regularly chosen as major seats of international arbitrations, as Lion points out24. Last but not least, all the actors involved in these proceedings are sophisticated enough to deal at ease with either a UNCITRAL-based law or U.S. law.\n\nLion's letter, paras. 21 through 24.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n36.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the place of this arbitration is Washington, D.C. (United States of America)."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection Under Art. 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2016-12-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection Under Art. 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe following factual background summarily describes the facts that are necessary to understand and adjudicate this Preliminary Objection, and is based on Claimant\u2019s statement of the facts in support of its claims. These facts are accepted for the purposes of this decision only, and without prejudice to a final determination of the facts by the Tribunal at a later stage.\n\n**1. The Loans**\n----------------\n\n14.\n\nLion is a Canadian company that for the last decade has invested over $1 billion in real estate projects throughout Mexico. From February to September 2007 Lion made three loans [collectively **\"Loans\"],** for a total amount of $32 million, to three Mexican companies: Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. **[\"Bains\"],** C&C Ingenieria y Proyectos, S.A. de C.V. **[\"C&C Ingenieria\"]** and C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V. **[\"C&C Capital\"].** The three corporations are controlled by the same Mexican citizen.\n\n15.\n\nThe purpose of the Loans was to provide funds to develop three real estate projects in the Mexican states of Nayarit and Jalisco2.\n\nRequest for institution of arbitration proceedings, para. 33\n\n16.\n\nThe loans were structured through three loan agreements [the **\"Loan Agreements\"],** secured by certain *pagar\u00e9s* (promissory notes) and *hipotecas* (mortgages).\n\n17.\n\nThe Loan Agreements present certain common features, including:\n\n- short-term maturities (ranging from 90 days to 18 months);\n\n- ordinary interest at an annual rate of 18% compounded quarterly; and\n\n- default interest at an annual rate of 25%, to be charged in addition to ordinary interest.\n\n18.\n\nEach loan was not only formalized in a loan agreement, but also secured by a *pagar\u00e9* and by one or more *hipotecas.*\n\n**1.1** The First Loan\n----------------------\n\n19.\n\nA loan agreement dated February 28, 2007 was executed by and between Lion as Lender, Bains as Borrower and C&C Ingenieria as Joint and Several Obligor **[\"First Loan\"]3.**\n\nExhibit C-008.\n\n20.\n\nThe First Loan had the following features4:\n\n- principal amount of $ 15 million;\n\n- original maturity of 18 months;\n\n- it was documented by and conditional upon the execution and delivery of a $ 15 million *pagar\u00e9* in favor of Lion;\n\n- it was secured by an *hipoteca* granted by Inmobiliaria Bains in favor of Lion over lots of land located in the state of Nayarit, Mexico.\n\nExhibits C-008, C-009, and C-010.\n\n21.\n\nThe First Loan was amended on four occasions5. Each of those amendments extended the loan for time periods ranging from 60 to 156 days, and left the other terms of the loan largely unchanged. Every time the First Loan was amended, the *pagar\u00e9* was cancelled and replaced with a new one that reflected the new due date.\n\nExhibit C-011.\n\n22.\n\nTaking all the amendments into consideration, the First Loan had an ultimate maturity of 945 days (or 2.6 years)6.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 28.\n\n**1.2 The Second Loan**\n-----------------------\n\n23.\n\nAnother loan agreement dated June 13, 2007 was executed by and between Lion as Lender, C&C Capital as Borrower and Bains as Joint and Several Obligor **[\"Second Loan\"]7.**\n\nExhibit C-012.\n\n24.\n\nThis Second Loan had the following features8:\n\n- principal amount of $ 12.45 million;\n\n- original maturity of 90 days;\n\n- it was documented by and conditional upon the execution and delivery of a $12.45 million *pagar\u00e9* in favor of Lion;\n\n- it was secured by an *hipoteca* granted by a company called \"Bansi S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple\" as trustee as per the instructions of C&C Capital, as founder and beneficiary of the trust in favor of Lion over a property located in Guadalajara, Jalisco9.\n\nExhibits C-012, C-013, C-014, and C-015.\n\nExhibit C-041.\n\n25.\n\nThe Second Loan was amended on seven occasions10 in order to extend the due date.\n\nRequest for institution of arbitration proceedings, para. 34.b). *See* Exhibit C-015.\n\n26.\n\nTaking all the amendments into consideration, the Second Loan had an ultimate maturity of 839 days (or 2.3 years)11.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 35.\n\n**1.3** The Third Loan\n----------------------\n\n27.\n\nAnother loan agreement dated September 26, 2007 was executed by and between Lion as Lender, C&C Capital as Borrower, and Bains as Joint and Several Obligor **[\"Third Loan\"]12.**\n\nExhibit C-016.\n\n28.\n\nThis Third Loan had the following features13:\n\n- principal amount of $5.35 million;\n\n- original maturity of 18 months14;\n\n- it was documented by and conditional upon the execution and delivery of $5.35 million promissory note in favor of Lion;\n\n- it was secured by an *hipoteca* granted by a company called \"Bansi S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple\" as trustee as per the instructions of C&C Capital as founder and beneficiary of the trust in favour of Lion over a property located in Guadalajara, Jalisco15.\n\nExhibits C-016 to C-019.\n\nNee Clause 1.1(6), Exhibit C-016.\n\nExhibit C-018.\n\n29.\n\nThe Third Loan was amended six times to extend the due date16.\n\nExhibit C-019.\n\n30.\n\nTaking all the amendments into consideration, the Third Loan had an ultimate maturity of 735 days (or two years)17.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 42.\n\n**2. Lion has not recovered the loans**\n---------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn September 30, 2009 and after several extensions, the total amount of the Loans became overdue. No additional extensions were granted.\n\n32.\n\nFor the next two years Lion tried and failed to recover the outstanding debt. Eventually, in February 2012, Lion decided to sue the three debtor companies, demanding immediate payment of the Loans, plus ordinary and default interest18.\n\nThis is the Claimant\u2019s version as per Request for institution of arbitration proceedings, paras.36-38.\n\n33.\n\nLion says that in December 2012, it chanced to learn from third parties that, a few months earlier, a commercial judge in Jalisco - without Lion\u2019s knowledge -had ordered the cancellation of the *hipotecas* and the return of the *pagar\u00e9s* that secured the Loans.\n\n34.\n\nSince then, Lion has pursued several legal actions to collect the outstanding debt or to reverse the cancellation of the *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s.* Lion alleges to have been the victim of a series of fraudulent actions and judicial errors that the Mexican judicial system has proved unable to address or remedy to this day19.\n\nRequest for institution of arbitration proceedings, paras. 42-50.\n\n35.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, on December 11, 2015 Lion commenced the present proceedings against Mexico, claiming that the State has violated Arts. 1110 and 1105 NAFTA, on the following grounds:\n\n- Mexico has expropriated Lion\u2019s investment by unlawfully cancelling the *pagar\u00e9s* and *hipotecas* issued in favor of Claimant, and\n\n- Mexico has not guaranteed fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security of Lion\u2019s investment by failing to guarantee an adequate legal 20 system to protect Lion\u2019s rights20.\n\nRequest for institution of arbitration proceedings, paras. 51-64.\n\n36.\n\nLion seeks to recover over $223 million in damages resulting from these violations, together with interest and costs21.\n\nRequest for institution of arbitration proceedings, para. 16, footnote n. 7.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 24, 2016 Mexico filed a Preliminary Objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules, on grounds that Lion\u2019s claims are manifestly without legal merit22.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 6.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Mexico\u2019s Position**\n------------------------\n\n38.\n\nMexico\u2019s application is straightforward: it submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because Lion has no investment in Mexico under Chapter 11 NAFTA23.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 6.\n\n39.\n\nMexico contends that, pursuant to Art. 1139(d) NAFTA, a loan to an enterprise can be considered an \"investment\" for the purposes of Chapter 11 NAFTA only if\n\n- it is a loan to an affiliate of the investor or\n\n- the original maturity of the loan is at least three years.\n\n40.\n\nOtherwise, loans and debt securities fall outside the scope of Chapter 11 NAFTA.\n\n41.\n\nIn this case - Mexico argues - the three Loans made to Mexican borrowers do not qualify as an investment under Chapter 11, because they do not meet the three-year original maturity requirement. The longest loan was the First Loan, which had an original maturity of 18 months.\n\n42.\n\nAs the Claimant does not dispute this fact, it is \"plainly obvious\" - Mexico submits - that the Claimant\u2019s Loans do not qualify as a protected investment under Chapter 11 NAFTA24.\n\nPreliminary Objection, paras. 49, 50, and 51.\n\n43.\n\nFinally, Respondent says that if the Tribunal dismisses the objection because Lion\u2019s claims are not \"manifestly without legal merit,\" or for any other reason, Mexico still reserves its right to raise this objection under Art. 45(2) Arbitration AF Rules. Mexico states25:\n\n**\"97.** *Si el Tribunal no considera satisfecha la objeci\u00f3n preliminar con respecto a que la reclamaci\u00f3n carece manifiestamente de m\u00e9rito legal, o concluye que los escritos de las partes son muy extensos y elaborados, o considera que los aspectos controvertidos de derecho mexicano que se expusieron en los escritos son importantes para la decisi\u00f3n, o si es de la opini\u00f3n que existe ambig\u00fcedad en el Art\u00edculo 1139 y ello requiere considerar la historia de negociaciones del Tratado y/o del punto de vista de las otras Partes del TLCAN, y decide desechar la solicitud de la Demandada presentada al amparo del Art\u00edculo 45(6), esto ser\u00e1 sin perjuicio del derecho de la Demandada a plantear la objeci\u00f3n al amparo del Art\u00edculo 45(2). \"*\n\nReply to Lion\u2019s Response, para. 97.\n\n44.\n\nMexico requests that the Tribunal dismiss the claims pursuant to Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules and order Lion to reimburse Mexico for its costs of the arbitration and costs of legal representation.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent in its Preliminary Objection sought further relief in the nature of suspension of the proceedings. This request has been superseded by Procedural Order No. 1 and does not need to be further considered26.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para 77; Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras 168-169.\n\n**2. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n46.\n\nClaimant rejects Mexico\u2019s objection as an attempt to mischaracterize Lion\u2019s claims. Claimant submits that its claims are not based on the Loans themselves, but on the **hipotecas** and **pagar\u00e9s** that secured and formalized the Loans and that the Mexican judicial authorities unlawfully cancelled27. These **hipotecas** and **pagar\u00e9s** do meet the definition of *investment* as required by Arts. 1139(g) and (h) NAFTA.\n\nRejoinder on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, para. 11.\n\n47.\n\nFirst. Lion says that Mexico is incorrect as a matter of Mexican and international law. The three-year requirement in Art. 1139(d) NAFTA and other subparagraphs do not apply to subparagraphs Arts. 1139(g) or (h) NAFTA. The duration of the investment is not relevant for property or interests that fall within the meaning of Arts. 1139(g) or (h) NAFTA.\n\n48.\n\nSecond, Lion argues that *hipotecas* and **pagar\u00e9s** under Mexican law provide different and additional rights to their holders and are enforced in a different way than the Loans. *Hipotecas* and **pagar\u00e9s** are intended to furnish additional certainty and predictability in commercial transactions, which promote investment - NAFTA objectives as described in its Preamble.\n\n49.\n\nThe conduct of the Mexican courts in this case highlights that the *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s* are separate from the loan agreements, since the judicial authorities ordered the cancellation of those property interests separately, as they represented property interests in addition to the loan agreements28.\n\nResponse to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras. 5.c), f), and g).\n\n50.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant requests the Tribunal:\n\n- to reject Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection since the claims are not \"manifestly without legal merit\", and\n\n- to declare that the *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s* are indeed investments under Art. 1139(g) and (h) NAFTA and, consequently, that the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims brought by Lion.\n\n51.\n\nLion finally contends that, at any rate, Mexico\u2019s arguments should be adjudicated by the Tribunal after offering Claimant full procedural opportunities - including an evidentiary hearing - in an ordinary arbitral proceeding29.\n\nRejoinder on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras. 128 and 129.\n\n**VI. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objection Mexico requests, pursuant to Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules, that the Tribunal dismiss Lion\u2019s claims, and order the company to reimburse all of Mexico\u2019s costs30.\n\n[...]\n\n53.\n\nLion asks the Tribunal to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection in its entirety.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Preliminary Objection should be dismissed because the Claimant\u2019s allegation that its *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s* constitute protected investments under Art. 1139 (g) and (h) NAFTA is not \"manifestly without legal merit\".\n\n**1. The applicable standard**\n------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nArticle 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules describes the present application as follows:\n\n(6) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (2) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\n\n56.\n\nArticle 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules contains effectively the same language as Rule 41(5) ICSID Arbitration Rules. Thus, the Tribunal draws guidance, as to the applicable standard, from the jurisprudence developed in the interpretation of Art. 45(6).\n\n57.\n\nThe relevant provisions of NAFTA are Art. 1101 and 1139:\n\n\" **Article 1101** **:** *Scope and Coverage.*\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 1139** **:** *Definitions.*\n\nFor purposes of this Chapter:\n\n[...]\n\n**investment** means:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n(b) an equity security of an enterprise;\n\n(c) a debt security of an enterprise (i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or (ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least three years, but does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity, of a state enterprise;\n\n(d) a loan to an enterprise\n\n(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or\n\n(ii) where the original maturity of the loan is at least three years,\n\nbut does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state enterprise;\n\n(e) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise;\n\n(f) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution, other than a debt security or a loan excluded from subparagraph (c) or (d);\n\n(g) real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes; and\n\n(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor's property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise;\n\nbut investment does not mean,\n\n(i) claims to money that arise solely from (i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of another Party, or (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing, other than a loan covered by subparagraph (d); or\n\n(j) any other claims to money,\n\nthat do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) through (h).\"\n\n58.\n\nThe general rule of interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **[\"Vienna Convention\"]** requires that a treaty be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"31.\n\n*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,* United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 1155, p. 331 (23 May 1969), Article 31.\n\nPreliminary objection\n---------------------\n\n59.\n\nUnder Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules the respondent in an arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules may raise, at the outset of the proceedings, a preliminary objection that the claims brought by the claimant should be dismissed for being \"manifestly without legal merit\".\n\n60.\n\nThe tribunal, after giving claimant an opportunity to be heard, must promptly adopt a decision:\n\n- If the tribunal accepts the respondent\u2019s objection, it will partially or totally dismiss claimant\u2019s claims;\n\n- If the tribunal rejects the objection, the main proceedings are resumed and respondent may raise the objections again in the normal course of the arbitration.\n\n61.\n\nFor an objection to succeed in this special procedure, respondent must prove that it refers to a claim that is \"manifestly without legal merit.\" If the threshold is not reached, the Tribunal dismisses the objection *pro tem.*\n\n\" Manifestly \"\n--------------\n\n62.\n\nThe term \"manifestly\" generally means something that is \"evident\", \"clear\" or \"obvious\" to the observer. The word appears not only in Art. 45(6) ICSID Arbitration AF Rules, but also in Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which has been interpreted by a number of arbitral tribunals.\n\n63.\n\nFor example, the Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules of the tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25 ***[\"Trans-Global Petroleum\"]*** analysed the use of the expression \"manifestly\" in other articles of the Convention and the opinion of legal authorities, and arrived to the following conclusion:\n\n\"the ordinary meaning of the word requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch. The standard is thus set high [...] The exercise may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult32.\"\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum,* \u00a7 88.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that \"the special procedure imposed by Rule 41(5)\" confirmed that meaning and went further to state that \"as a basic principle of procedural fairness, an award under Rule 41(5) can only apply to a clear and obvious case, [...] [to] \u2018patently unmeritorious claims\u2019\"33.\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum,* \u00a7 89, 92.\n\n65.\n\nThis conclusion was later endorsed in *Global Trading Resource Corp, and Globex International, Inc.* v. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11 [\"Globex\"]34, *RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6 [\" **RSM** \"]35 and *Brandes Investment Partners, LP* v. *The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/03 ***[\"Brandes\"]36*** In *Brandes,* the Tribunal also made the following consideration37:\n\n\"[T]he new procedure of the preliminary objections under Rule 41(5) is intended to create the possibility to dismiss at an early stage such cases which are clearly unmeritorious\".\n\n*Globex,* \u00a7 35.\n\nRSM, \u00a76.1.3.\n\n*Brandes,* \u00a7 62.\n\n*Brandes,* \u00a7 62.\n\n66.\n\nThe procedure established by Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules is an expedited procedure. It is directed to cases that are \"evident\", \"clear\" or \"obvious\", not those which entail a greater degree of difficulty or which require a more thorough and extensive analysis of the legal and factual issues to dispose of the claim. Article 45(6) is thus intended to capture cases that are clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious, not those which are novel, difficult, refer to disputed legal issues or where claimant has a tenable or arguable case. The standard is demanding and rigorous38.\n\n*PNG,* \u00a7 88.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore sees no reason to depart from the interpretations rendered under Rule 41(5) ICSID Arbitration Rules, and adopts the same approach in this case.\n\n\" Without legal merit \"\n-----------------------\n\n68.\n\nAccording to the language of Art. 45(6), the issue to be determined (i.e. what must be \"manifest\") is that a claim is \"without legal merit\". The term \"legal\" is used in Rule 41(5) ICSID Arbitration Rules (and by analogy in Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules) in opposition to \"factual,\" as shown by the drafting history of the provision: the Secretariat\u2019s Working Paper of May 2004 made reference to claims \"manifestly without merit\"39. The term \"legal\" was added thereafter in order to avoid inappropriate discussion on the facts of the case at that stage40. A preliminary objection must therefore relate to \"legal\" issues, not to matters of fact.\n\nWorking Paper of the ICSID Secretariat, *Suggested Changes to the ICSID Rides and Regulations* (May 21.2005), p. 7.\n\nAur\u00e9lia Antonietti, *The 2006 Amendments of the ICSID Rules and Regulations and the Additional Facility Rules,* 21 ICSID Rev. - FILJ 427, 439, p. 440.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum* emphasized the same idea:\n\n\"The tribunal considers that the adjective \"legal\" in Rule 41(5) is clearly used in contradistinction to \"factual\" given the drafting genesis of Rule 41(5)\n\n[...] Accordingly, it would seem that the tribunal is not concerned, *per se,* with the factual merits of the Claimant\u2019s three claims. At this early stage of these proceedings, without any sufficient evidence, the Tribunal is in no position to decide disputed facts alleged by either side in a summary procedure41.\"\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum,* \u00a7 97\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore of the view that the expression \"without legal merit\" in Article 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules limits the issues that can be addressed by the panel to legal considerations as opposed to factual.\n\nObjections to jurisdiction v. objections to the merits\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nArticle 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules does not specifically state whether objections must refer to the merits of the case, or whether jurisdictional objections are also admissible. The standard required by the Rule - that \"a claim is manifestly without legal merit\" - is ambiguous.\n\n72.\n\nMexico is submitting a jurisdictional objection: that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because Claimant does not hold an investment in Mexico. Claimant has not disputed that Mexico is entitled to submit jurisdictional objections by way of the Art. 45(6) procedure.\n\n73.\n\nThe arbitral tribunals that have considered this question have arrived at the conclusion that jurisdictional objections are admissible under the Art. 45(6) procedure.\n\n74.\n\nFor example, the Tribunal in *Brandes* was the first to decide the issue and it came to the following conclusion42:\n\n\"The Tribunal first of all notes that Rule 41(5) does not mention \u2018jurisdiction\u2019. The terms employed are \u2018legal merit\u2019. This wording, by itself, does not provide a reason why the question whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to hear and decide a claim could not be included in the very general notion that the claim filed is \u2018without legal merit\u2019.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nUntil 2006 the Rules therefore did not provide for any possibility to terminate the proceedings at an early stage in the case of requests which are patently unmeritorious. There exist no objective reasons why the intent not to burden the parties with a possibly long and costly proceeding when dealing with such unmeritorious claims should be limited to an evaluation of the merits of the case and should not also englobe an examination of the jurisdictional basis on which the tribunal\u2019s powers to decide the case rest.\"\n\n*Brandes,* \u00a7\u00a7 50-52.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunals in *Globex, RSM* and *PNG* were confronted with the same question, and all explicitly agreed with the findings of *Brandes43.*\n\n*Globex,* \u00a7 30; *RSM,* \u00a7 6.1.1. and 6.1.2; *PNG* \u00a7 91.\n\nAdditional requirements\n-----------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe additional requirements established in Art. 45(6) Arbitration AF Rules are met in this case. It is undisputed that the Parties have not agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections and that Respondent submitted its Preliminary Objection within the timeframe of 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. Application of the standard to the Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nUnder the Preliminary Objection Mexico alleges that **hipotecas** and **pagar\u00e9s** do not qualify as an investment under any of the categories defined in Art. 1139 NAFTA. The key question in order to adjudicate this Objection is whether Lion\u2019s claim - that the **pagar\u00e9s** and **hipotecas** qualify as protected investments under Art. 1139 (g) and (h) NAFTA - is manifestly without legal merit.\n\n78.\n\nBoth Mexico and Lion have made extensive submissions and have marshalled significant evidence and legal authority in support of their respective positions. Lion\u2019s submissions cover almost a hundred pages, accompanied by over 130 legal exhibits, on the legal characterization of *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s* as investments according to NAFTA and international law; Mexico\u2019s submissions, shorter than those of Lion, include, quote, and cite to a similar wealth of legal authorities and case law.\n\n79.\n\nThe amount of evidence and the length and detail of the arguments shows the complexity of the underlying legal question.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the issue of whether *pagar\u00e9s* and *hipotecas* that formalize and secure loans with a maturity of less than three years can be considered as investments under Art. 1139 (g) and (h) NAFTA - separately from contemporaneous loan transactions - seems to be a novel issue, which has never been addressed in previous decisions.\n\n81.\n\nAfter studying each Party\u2019s submissions, and examining carefully the evidence presented, the Tribunal considers that the question whether the *pagar\u00e9s* and *hipotecas* constitute an investment pursuant to Art. 1139 (g) and (h) NAFTA, or whether their status must be considered exclusively pursuant to Art. 1139 (d) NAFTA, raises complex interpretative issues and requires a greater degree of consideration and a more thorough analysis of Mexican law and international legal principles. The Tribunal requires further legal argument on these issues within the context of the full development of the Parties\u2019 cases.\n\n82.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of what constitutes precisely an investment under NAFTA is relevant, not only to the Parties involved in the present proceedings, but also to other countries signatories of NAFTA - and Art. 1128 permits that the position of other NAFTA Parties be heard.\n\n83.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant\u2019s claims cannot be described as \"manifestly without legal merit\". This is not an appropriate case for the expedited Art. 45(6) procedure and therefore the Preliminary Objection must be dismissed.\n\nOther requests\n--------------\n\n84.\n\nLion has also sought a declaration that the *hipotecas* and *pagar\u00e9s* are investments under Art. 1139(g) and (h) NAFTA and, consequently, that the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims brought by Lion. It is not appropriate under the expedited procedure of Art. 45(6) for a claimant to seek a final declaration of rights with *res judicata* effects. Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s application to this effect is also dismissed.\n\n85.\n\nFinally, Mexico has sought an award of costs. The Tribunal considers that costs on the complex issue of whether the Claimant has an investment for the purposes of NAFTA should be reserved.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection is dismissed;\n\n2. All questions as to the costs of the Preliminary Objection are reserved;\n\n3. All other requests are dismissed;\n\n4. The further procedure for this arbitration will be according to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Non-Disputing Party\u2019s Application", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2017-05-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Non-Disputing Party\u2019s Application\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nI write to you as instructed by the President of the Tribunal. Within the past year Mr. Iv\u00e1n Mercado has addressed the following letters to this Tribunal and ICSID, seeking the Tribunal's leave to participate as a non-disputing party in this arbitration: letter of May 30, 2016; letter of June 20, 2016; letter of August 24, 2016; and letter of April 20, 2017. These communications include certain legal arguments with regard to these proceedings, inform of the existence of a number of ongoing judicial procedures in Mexico, and attach a few exhibits in support of his contentions.\n\nAt the Tribunal's request, on May 17, 2017, the Parties submitted their positions on whether this Tribunal should allow Mr. Mercado's applications, the procedural treatment they should receive, and any other contention they wished to make in this regard.\n\nThe Parties agree that, in this case, the Tribunal should apply to Mr. Mercado's request the procedure and requisites described in the *Statement of the Free Trade Commission on Non-Disputing Party Participation*, of October 7, 2003 [the \"**Statement**\"]. The Tribunal concurs with the Parties' common position. The Statement suggests an effective and well-balanced procedure to deal with this kind of petitions. In fact, most NAFTA tribunals have followed its recommendations in the past, at the Parties' request or on its own motion.\n\nFurthermore, the Parties agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that Mr. Mercado's petitions have not fulfilled the requisites set out in the Statement. For instance, Mr. Mercado's communications do not clarify many particulars regarding his identity and background, as the Statement demands.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects Mr. Mercado's applications to file a written submission as a non-disputing party in this arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Bifurcation", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2017-05-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Bifurcation\n-----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis decision rules on the \"*Solicitud de bifurcaci\u00f3n y s\u00edntesis de las excepciones jurisdiccionales*\" [the \"**SdB**\"] that Mexico filed on April 4, 2017. Additionally, Mexico requests the Tribunal to change the seat of this arbitration from Washington (USA) to Toronto (Canada).\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal will first rule on the SdB, bifurcating the proceedings with respect to one of the objections.

Mexico alleges that NAFTA Chapter 14 (\"Financial Services\"), rather than Chapter 11 (\"Investment\") might govern this dispute [\"**Objection 2**\"]2. Chapter 14 does not include the minimum standard of treatment among its protections.\n\nSdB, paras. 5 and 7-9.\n\nSdB, para. 5 and 10-28.\n\n4.\n\nFor these reasons, Mexico urges a bifurcation of the case3.\n\nSdB, para. 38.\n\n5.\n\nLion submitted its Response to Mexico's SdB [the \"**Response**\"] on May 4, 2017, opposing the SdB and demanding that Mexico's objections to jurisdiction be heard together with the merits of the dispute4.\n\nResponse, para. 68.\n\n6.\n\nIn the procedural calendar attached as Annex A to Procedural Order [\"**PO**\"] No.1, the Arbitral Tribunal established a period of one month after Claimant's Response to issue its decision on bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal now issues its decision on Mexico's SdB within the established time period.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully analyzed the arguments Mexico and Lion have submitted. It finds that, for the following reasons, Objection 1, but not Objection 2, should be bifurcated.\n\n9.\n\nFirst, Objection 1 may potentially extinguish all the claims. In addition, the objection raised is not intertwined with the merits of the dispute.\n\n10.\n\nSecond, Objection 2 is not dispositive of the case. If Mexico prevails, the dispute would still go forward, with fewer claims and different scope. Besides, Objection 2 may require opening a document production phase within the jurisdictional phase so that Mexico may gather evidence in support of its allegation. As Mexico admits, \"[E]*sta objeci\u00f3n no se puede resolver sobre la base del expediente en su**estado actual, sin embargo, es posible hacerlo de manera eficiente... siempre**que la Demandante coopere revelando hechos y documentos relevantes durante la etapa de jurisdicci\u00f3n*\"5. This means that, even if the objection is eventually upheld, this document production phase would not spare the Parties either the merits phase or a second document production exercise. And that would undoubtedly cause a significant delay in the proceedings.\n\nSdB, para. 27.\n\n11.\n\nTherefore, in order to abide by the principles of procedural economy and cost efficiency, the Tribunal decides to bifurcate the proceedings in respect of Objection 1 exclusively.\n\n12.\n\nThe procedural calendar established as Annex A to PO No. 1 provides that, in case of bifurcation, the Tribunal \"shall establish a separate calendar for the exchange of pleadings on jurisdiction after consultation with the Parties\".\n\n13.\n\nIn the meantime, as Annex A to PO No. 1 also provides, \"the proceedings on the merits shall remain suspended until the Tribunal decides otherwise\".\n\n14.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal asks the Parties to confer and submit, by June 7, 2017, a joint proposal of a procedural calendar for this jurisdictional phase. If the Parties are unable to agree on a common proposal, they are kindly requested to submit simultaneously its own proposal by June 14, 2017.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal may decide at any time after the presentation of the last submission on the jurisdictional issues to join the jurisdictional issues to the merits and decide on both issues in the same award.\n\n16.\n\nIf the Tribunal decides to opt-out of the bifurcated proceedings, the case will continue in accordance with the calendar for the merits phase. If the Tribunal decides not to opt-out of the bifurcated proceedings, it shall issue an Award on Jurisdiction.\n\nRequest to change the seat of the arbitration\n---------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nMexico includes an additional petition in its SdB, asking the Tribunal to change the seat of this arbitration from Washington (USA) to Toronto (Canada). Mexico argues it is now clear that Lion is a \"*veh\u00edculo de inversi\u00f3n*\" created by US entities to invest in Mexico and with no real ties with Canada6. Lion opposes this request7.\n\nSdB, paras. 16\u201328 and 38.\n\nResponse, paras. 61\u201367 and 69.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Mexico's application. The request is untimely and has no direct connection with the issue at this procedural stage: the Tribunal already fixed the seat of the arbitration in its PO No. 2. The facts and legal basis for the Tribunal's decision remain unchanged, and do not warrant reconsideration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2018-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS** |\n|  |  |\n| **Am\u00e9ricas I** | One of the two high-end mixed-use skyscrapers planned under the Guadalajara Project to be built in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco |\n| **Am\u00e9ricas II** | One of the two high-end mixed-use skyscrapers planned under the Guadalajara Project to be built in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco |\n| **Borrowers** | Two Mexican companies, Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V and C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V., the borrowing party in three loans made by Lion |\n| **CC Jalisco** | Civil Code of Jalisco |\n| **CC Nayarit** | Civil Code of Nayarit |\n| **C&C Capital** | C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V., a company owned or controlled by Mr. C\u00e1rdenas |\n| **C&C Ingenier\u00eda** | C&C Ingenier\u00eda y Proyectos, S.A. de C.V., a company owned or controlled by Mr. C\u00e1rdenas |\n| **Clarion** | Clarion Partners, L.P., a real estate investment management company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real estate investments for institutional investors |\n| **Credit Agreements** | Three contracts signed by Lion with companies owned or controlled by Mr. C\u00e1rdenas in February, June and September 2007, making and governing the Loans. |\n| **First Loan** | Loan, in the form of a \"Credit Agreement\", between Lion (as Lender), Inmobiliaria Bains (as Borrower) and C&C Ingenier\u00eda (another company of Mr. Cardenas) as joint and several obligor.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. The Request for Arbitration and access to ICSID Additional Facility**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn December 11, 2015, ICSID received Lion\u2019s RfA against the United Mexican States, together with 20 factual exhibits3.\n\nExhs. C-1 to C-20.\n\n13.\n\nThe RfA was made pursuant to Arts. 1116, 1120, and 1122 NAFTA4. It included a request for approval of access to the Additional Facility of the Centre.\n\nRfA, para. 7.\n\n14.\n\nOn December 23, 2015 the Secretary-General registered the RfA and approved access to the Additional Facility pursuant to Art. 4 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. In accordance with Article 5(e) ICSID AF Rules, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed as soon as possible to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n**2. The constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nArticle 1123 NAFTA specifies the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment to constitute a Tribunal: unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 10, 2016 the Claimant appointed Mr. David J. A. Cairns, a national of the United Kingdom and New Zealand, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Cairns accepted his appointment and provided his *curriculum vitae*.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 10, 2016 the Respondent appointed Mr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez, a national of Mexico, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez accepted his appointment and provided his *curriculum vitae.*\n\n18.\n\nAfter the Parties failed to reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator, in accordance with Article 1124 NAFTA, the Secretary-General served as appointing authority. On July 20, 2016, the Secretary-General appointed Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of Spain, as President of the Tribunal. Pursuant to Arts. 11(2) and 13 ICSID AF Rules, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto accepted the appointment by letter of 27 July 2016, attaching his declaration of independence and impartiality.\n\n19.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, the Secretary-General confirmed the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted and the proceedings were deemed to have begun. The Parties confirmed at the first session\u2014held on September 26, 2016\u2014that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and neither had any objection to the appointment of its members5. Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal Counsel was appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n*See* PO 1, paras. 2.1.\n\n**3.

RLA-1 to RLA-10.\n\n22.\n\nOn August 31, 2016 after receiving the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal issued a procedural schedule for the Parties to exchange rounds of pleadings on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection.\n\n23.\n\nOn September 26, 2016 the Parties and the Tribunal held the first session by telephone conference, during which the terms of the Procedural Order No. 1 were discussed.\n\n24.\n\nOn the same day, Lion submitted its **Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection**, attaching 4 factual exhibits7 and 108 legal authorities8.\n\nExhs. C-21 to C-24.\n\nExhs. CLA-1 to CLA-108.\n\n25.\n\nOn October 13, 2016 Mexico submitted its **Reply to Lion\u2019s Response on the Preliminary Objection**.\n\n26.\n\nOn October 14, 2016 the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, after receiving the Parties\u2019 comments9. The Order covered some procedural matters for the management of this case, *inter alia*, that the procedural language would be English and Spanish, basic rules on submission of pleadings and evidence, that the place of the proceeding would be determined in a separate order, and that Dr. Luis Fernando Rodr\u00edguez would serve as the Assistant to the Tribunal. Annex A to the Order set out the Procedural Calendar for this arbitration.\n\nLion\u2019s and Mexico\u2019s communications of September 12, 2016, and Lion\u2019s communication of September 25, 2016.\n\n27.\n\nOn October 31, 2016 Lion submitted its **Rejoinder on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection**, attaching 7 factual exhibits10 and 27 legal authorities11.\n\nExhs.

CLA-337 to CLA-356.\n\n33.\n\nOn May 29, 2017 the Tribunal issued its **Decision**, bifurcating the proceedings in respect of only one of the objections raised, namely: that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because Lion did not make an investment in Mexico within the terms required by Arts. 1101 and 1139 NAFTA16.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras. 5 and 7-9.\n\n**6. Jurisdictional Phase**\n---------------------------\n\n34.\n\nOn June 30, 2017 the Tribunal issued **Procedural order No. 3**, setting the procedural calendar for the jurisdictional phase, based on the Parties\u2019 comments and agreements17.\n\nCommunications of June 14, 2017.\n\n35.\n\nOn July 13, 2017 the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the governments of USA and Canada of the deadline for NAFTA signatories to make submissions on the interpretation of the treaty under Art. 1128 NAFTA.\n\n36.\n\nOn August 28, 2017 Mexico submitted a Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with 19 legal authorities18 and an expert report on Mexican law by Ren\u00e9 Irra Ibarra (which attached 20 authorities).\n\nExhs.

The following day Mr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto and Mr. David J.A. Cairns considered the reasons for and consented to his resignation under Art. 14(3) ICSID AF Rules. By communication of the same date the Secretary of the Tribunal declared the suspension of the proceedings until Mexico appointed another arbitrator pursuant to Art. 16(2) ICSID AF Rules.\n\n44.\n\nOn February 2, 2018 Mexico designated Prof. Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, a French and Swiss national, as arbitrator in accordance with Art. 1123 NAFTA and Art. 17(1) ICSID AF Rules.\n\n45.\n\nOn February 6, 2018 Prof. Boisson de Chazournes accepted the appointment and submitted her declaration under Art. 13 ICSID AF Rules.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThis section describes the factual background of the transactions carried out by Lion in Mexico. The Tribunal has made no independent enquiry or investigation into the facts. The summary is based on Claimant\u2019s account, which Mexico does not dispute: \"*Los hechos en s\u00ed mismos*\", Mexico points out in its last submission, \"*no se encuentran en disputa*\"24. It is the legal assessment of these facts that is at issue.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 14.\n\n**1. Lion meets Mr. C\u00e1rdenas**\n------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nClaimant, Lion Mexico Consolidated LP, is a limited partnership constituted under the laws of Quebec (Canada), with its main place of business in Texas (USA). Lion was created and is managed by Clarion Partners, L.P. [\"**Clarion**\"], a real estate investment management company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real estate investments for institutional investors25.\n\nExh. C-32.\n\n54.\n\nLion has been making investments in Mexico for over ten years. Over that period, Lion has provided more than US $800 million of capital to entities doing business in Mexico, to be used in developing a wide array of real estate properties, such as hotels, office buildings, residences, warehouses, and resorts26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 6.\n\n55.\n\nClarion engaged Real Capital Investment Management to identify and present investment opportunities in Mexico27, and through this channel Mr. H\u00e9ctor C\u00e1rdenas Curiel, a Mexican businessman, was introduced to Lion and Clarion28. Mr. C\u00e1rdenas was presented as a developer seeking funding for the development of two real estate development projects: the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Jos\u00e9 Javier Arechederra Tovar, para. 6.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Jos\u00e9 Javier Arechederra Tovar, para. 9.\n\n**2. Mr. C\u00e1rdenas\u2019s Projects**\n------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Nayarit Project [\"**Nayarit Project**\"] included an ocean-front residential and resort development in Bah\u00eda de Banderas, State of Nayarit29. The development plan called for a mixed-use high-end resort to be anchored by a Ritz Carlton hotel, 1,500 luxury residential units, extensive amenities offerings, and two ocean-front golf courses, among other features to be developed on 855 hectares (2,100 acres) with 2.8 miles of ocean frontage30.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of James Hendricks, para. 7.\n\nExh. C-33.\n\n57.\n\nThe Guadalajara Project [\"**Guadalajara Project**\"]31 consisted of two high-end mixed-use skyscrapers [\"**Am\u00e9ricas i**\" and \"**Am\u00e9ricas ii**\"], which were to be built on approximately 15,000 m\u00b2 (3.74 acres) in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco32.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of James Hendricks, para. 7.\n\nExh. C-35 and Exh. C-36.\n\n58.\n\nMr. C\u00e1rdenas\u2019s plans for the development of the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project were preliminary and incomplete at the time he requested capital from Lion to acquire land and begin limited infrastructure development33. Lion was willing to provide capital for the development of these projects subject to requirements including the following:\n\n- The granting of mortgages to Lion over the land acquired by Mr. C\u00e1rdenas and on the subsequent improvements made on that land34; and\n\n- The issue of promissory notes to Lion as unconditional commitments to repay the money owed to Lion, with certain procedural privileges under Mexican law35.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of James Hendricks, para. 9, and Claimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 17 and 18.\n\nExh. C-33 and Exh. C-35.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of James Hendricks, para. 9.\n\n**3. The three sets of transactions**\n-------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn February, June, and September 2007, Lion made three loans for financing the purchase of the properties for the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project [\"**the Loans**\"], as well as working capital. Lion provided the Loans to two Mexican companies owned or controlled by Mr. C\u00e1rdenas [\"**the Borrowers**\"]:\n\n- Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. [\"**inmobiliaria Bains**\"],\n\n- C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V. [\"**c&c capital**\"].\n\n60.\n\nThe three Loans, with a principal amount of approximately US $32.8 million, were secured by three mortgages and the issue of three promissory notes.\n\n61.\n\nThe three promissory notes [the \"**Notes**\"] were all issued under Mexican law, drafted both in English and Spanish (with the Spanish version governing) and submitted to the exclusive and irrevocable jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico, D.F.\n\n62.\n\nThe three mortgages [the \"**Mortgages**\"] were signed before a notary public, in Spanish language and subject to Mexican law, namely, the applicable laws of the States of Jalisco **[\"Guadalajara Mortgages 1 and 2\"]** and Nayarit **[\"Nayarit Mortgage\"]**36.\n\nZamora II, paras. 144 and 147.\n\n**3.1. THE FIRST SET OF TRANSACTIONS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe first loan took the form of a \"Credit Agreement\" between Lion (as Lender), Inmobiliaria Bains (as Borrower) and C&C Ingenier\u00eda (another company of Mr. Cardenas) as joint and several obligor. It was signed on February 27, 2007. The loan was for the amount of US $15,000,000, plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [the \"**First Loan**\"].\n\n64.\n\nThe contract provided for the granting of a mortgage (clause four) and the issue of a nonnegotiable promissory note (clause two, 2.2(5)) to secure the loan. It enclosed an Exhibit A (with the \"Form of Mortgage\") and an Exhibit B (with the \"Form of Note\").\n\n65.\n\nThe Credit Agreement was written in English and governed by the laws of Mexico37.\n\nExh. C-8.\n\n**A. The First Note**\n---------------------\n\n66.\n\nOne day after the signing of the Credit Agreement, on February 28, 2007, Inmobiliaria Bains issued the first promissory note in favor of Lion for US $15,000,000, plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [\"**First Note**\"].\n\n67.\n\nThe original maturity date of the First Note was August 28, 2008. The First Note was substituted four times, resulting in a final maturity date as of September 30, 200938.\n\nExh. C-153 (Versions of the First Note dated February 28, 2007; August 28, 2008; January 20; 2009; March 31, 2009; and July 7, 2009. The initial version of the First Note was signed in two separate promissory notes for US$9,177,020.25 and US$5,822,979.75 (totaling US$15 million), respectively, with the same original maturity date for both of them (August 28, 2008). All subsequent versions of the First Note were issued in a single promissory note for US$15 million.\n\n**B. The Nayarit Mortgage**\n---------------------------\n\n68.\n\nAbout one month after the signing of the Credit Agreement, on April 2, 2008, Inmobiliaria Bains granted in favor of Lion the Nayarit Mortgage over the Nayarit Project property, located in the Municipality of Bah\u00eda de Banderas39.\n\nExh. C-10.\n\n69.\n\nThe Nayarit Mortgage in its final form secured all the three Loans, including both principal and interest.\n\n70.\n\nThe Nayarit Mortgage was recorded at the Office of the Public Property Registry of Bucer\u00edas, Nayarit, on May 19, 200840.\n\nThe Nayarit Mortgage replaced two previous mortgages in favor of Lion, which were subsequently cancelled: a mortgage issued on February 28, 2007, and another on June 13, 2007. While on February 28, 2007, the mortgage only secured the First Loan, it was subsequently replaced to also cover the Second Loan (on June 13, 2007) and Third Loan (on April 2, 2008), respectively, Protocol Mortgage No. 92,496 of April 2, 2008, recorded under Book 285, section II, A-13 of the Public Property and Commercial Registry of Bucer\u00edas, Nayarit on May 19, 2008 / April 2, 2008. *See* Exh. C-10.\n\n**3.2. THE SECOND SET OF TRANSACTIONS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe second loan also took the form of a \"Credit Agreement\", between Lion (as Lender), C&C Capital (as Borrower) and Inmobiliaria Bains (as joint and several obligor). It was signed on June 13, 2007, around three months after the first set of transactions. The loan was for the amount of US $12,450,000 plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [the \"**second Loan**\"]41.\n\nExh. C-12.\n\n72.\n\nThe contract provided for the granting of a mortgage (clause four) and the issue of a nonnegotiable promissory note (clause two, 2.2(2)) to secure the loan. It also enclosed an Exhibit A (with the \"Form of Mortgage\") and an Exhibit B (with the \"Form of Note\").\n\n73.\n\nThe Credit Agreement was again written in English and governed by the laws of Mexico42.\n\nExh. C-8.\n\n**A. The Second Note**\n----------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe day after the signing of the Credit Agreement, on June 14, 2007 C&C Capital issued the second note [\"**second Note**\"] in favor of Lion for US$12,450,000 plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25%43.\n\nExh. C-12.\n\n75.\n\nThe original maturity date of the Second Note was September 14, 2007. The Second Note was substituted seven times, leading to a final maturity date of September 30, 200944.\n\nExh. C-154 (Copy of the versions of the Second Note dated June 14, 2007; September 12, 2007, December 25, 2007; March 30, 2008; September 30, 2008; January 20, 2009; and July 7, 2009). The 6th modified version of the Second Note (issued on March 31, 2009 and cancelled on July 7, 2009) is not available.\n\n**B. The Guadalajara Mortgage 1**\n---------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Guadalajara Mortgage 1 secured the Second Loan, including both capital and interest. It was granted on June 13, 2007, the date of execution of the Credit Agreement, by Bansi S.A., as trustee, as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as founder and beneficiary of the trust, in favor of Lion, over one of the properties pertaining to the Guadalajara Project45.\n\nExh. C-14 (Protocol Mortgage No. 7,820 of June 13, 2007 over a property located in Guadalajara, Jalisco, recorded under Sheet 117,850 of the Public Property Registry of the City of Guadalajara, Jalisco on November 23, 2007 / June 13, 2007).\n\n77.\n\nThe Guadalajara Mortgage 1 was recorded at that Public Property Registry about five months later, on November 23, 2007.\n\n**3.3. THE THIRD SET OF TRANSACTIONS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe third loan again took the form of a \"Credit Agreement\" between Lion (as Lender), C&C Capital (as Borrower) and Inmobiliaria Bains (as joint and several obligor). It was signed on September 26, 2007. The loan was for the amount of US $5,355,479 plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [the \"**Third Loan**\"]46.\n\nExh. C-152 (Third Loan agreement for US$5,355,479 granted by LMC to C&C, September 26, 2007). This Exh. C-152 contains the signature of Lion and the correct original \"Due Date\" of 90 days at Clause 1.1(7) complements Exhibit C-16. There is no dispute between the Parties on this maturity date of 90 days: it is the one indicated at the RfA, para. 34(c), and was acknowledged by Mexico at Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras. 40 and 41.\n\n79.\n\nThe contract provided for the granting of a mortgage (clause four) and the issue of a nonnegotiable promissory note (clause two, 2.1(5)) to secure the loan. It again enclosed an Exhibit A (with the \"Form of Mortgage\") and an Exhibit B (with the \"Form of Note\").\n\n80.\n\nThe Credit Agreement was written in English and governed by the laws of Mexico47.\n\nExh. C-16.\n\n**A. The Third Note**\n---------------------\n\n81.\n\nC&C Capital issued the Third Note [\"**Third Note**\"] on September 26, 2007, the date of execution of the Credit Agreement, in favor of Lion for US $5,355,479 plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25%. Inmobiliaria Bains signed as joint and several obligor48.\n\nExh. C-152 (Third Loan agreement for US$5,355,479 granted by Lion to C&C, September 26, 2007). Exh. C-152 contains the signature of Lion and the correct original \"Due Date\" of 90 days at Clause 1.1(7) complements Exhibit C-016. There is no dispute between the Parties on this maturity date of 90 days: it is the one indicated at the RfA, para. 34(c), and was acknowledged by Mexico at Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras. 40 and 41.\n\n82.\n\nThe original maturity date of the Third Note was December 25, 2007. The Third Note was substituted six times, resulting in a final maturity as of September 30, 200949.\n\nExh. C-155 (Copy of the versions of the Third Note dated December 25, 2007; March 30, 2008; September 30, 2008; January 20, 2009; and July 7, 2009). The initial (issued on September 26, 2007 and cancelled on December 25, 2007) and 5th modified version (issued on March 31, 2009 and cancelled on July 7, 2009) of the Third Note are not available.\n\n**B. The Guadalajara Mortgage 2**\n---------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Guadalajara Mortgage 2 secured the Third Loan, including both capital and interest. It was granted on the day of execution of the Credit Agreement, September 26, 2007, by Bansi S.A., as trustee, as per the instruction of C&C Capital as founder and beneficiary of the trust, in favor of Lion, over one of the properties pertaining to the Guadalajara Project50.\n\nExh. C-156 (Protocol Mortgage No. 7,895 over a property located in Guadalajara and recorded under Sheet 2,000,954 of the Public Property Registry of the City of Guadalajara, Jalisco on December 6, 2007 / September 26, 2007). Exh. C-156 complements Exh. C-18, which did not include the annexes of the protocol.\n\n84.\n\nThe Guadalajara Mortgage 2 was recorded at that Property Public Registry on 6 December 2007.\n\n**4. The defaults**\n-------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe initial deadlines for repayment of all three Loans were not met. Mr. C\u00e1rdenas requested and obtained a series of time extensions: from March 2008 through July 2009, Lion signed maturity date extensions on the First Loan four times51, on the Second Loans seven times52, and on the Third Loan six times53.\n\nExh. C-11.\n\nExh. C-15.\n\nExh. C-19.\n\n86.\n\nThe last payment date on the three transactions was, ultimately, September 30, 2009, and the debtors failed to satisfy the outstanding amounts by that date. All three Loans were declared in default and interest at the default rate began to accrue on October 1, 2009.\n\n87.\n\nLion sent its first invoice to Mr. C\u00e1rdenas for the outstanding principal and interest payments due on April 16, 201054. The amounts due on that invoice, calculated and dated as of March 31, 2010, totaled US $26,618,972 for the Nayarit Project and US $29,649,835 for the Guadalajara Project.\n\nExh. C-37.\n\n88.\n\nSubsequent invoices were sent on July 14, 201055; October 11, 201056; February 14, 201157; April 12, 201158, and July 29, 201159.\n\nExh. C-38.\n\nExh. C-39.\n\nExh. C-40.\n\nExh. C-42.\n\nExh. C-42.\n\n89.\n\nThe amounts due on the latest invoices sent, calculated and dated as of June 30, 2011, were US $36,041,328.45 for the Nayarit Project and US $40,065,210.38 for the Guadalajara Project.\n\n90.\n\nAccording to Lion, no payments were ever made.\n\n**5. Later developments**\n-------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn view of the defaults, in February 2012 Lion sought to enforce its rights judicially. In the following years Lion repeatedly filed legal actions before the Mexican courts. Lion submits that the Mexican courts and public registries engaged in improper conduct, allowing a fraud based upon a forged loan restructuring agreement, which resulted in the unlawful cancellation of Lion\u2019s Mortgages and Notes. In its words at the hearing60.\n\n\"Unfortunately, C\u00e1rdenas failed to move forward with these Projects as planned and didn't repay the capital as required under the Contract with [Lion]. As you know, [Lion] has alleged that it was wrongfully stripped off its Mortgages and Notes by the fraudulent conduct of various Mexican courts and public registries over a period of three years...\"\n\nHT, Day 1, 38:14 - 38:21.\n\n92.\n\nLion has brought this arbitration against Mexico under NAFTA to address the unlawful taking of its property (allegedly, a violation of Art. 1110 NAFTA) and Mexico\u2019s failure to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security (Art. 1105 NAFTA). Lion is asking the Tribunal to issue an award for damages representing the value of its investment, lost as a result of Mexico\u2019s breach of NAFTA.\n\n**V. RELIEF SOUGHT**\n--------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn its Memorial, Lion submitted the following request for relief61:\n\n\"The Claimant respectfully request the Tribunal:\n\na) To declare that Mexico has breached its obligations under Articles 1110 and 1115 of NAFTA and international law;\n\nb) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the loss caused by the cancellation of the Mortgages in the amount of US $76,343,347.00 or, alternatively, US $74,706,873;\n\nc) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the additional loss caused by cancellation of the Notes in an amount to be determined at a later stage;\n\nd) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the legal fees incurred in the Mexican court proceedings in an amount of US$ 1,262,650;\n\ne) To order Mexico to pay interest on the amounts under (b) to (d) at the Mexican Legal rate provided by Article 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code compounded monthly, through the date of full and effective payment of those amounts or, alternatively, at the monthly interest rate of the 28-day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE);\n\nf) To order Mexico to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees in connection with this arbitration; and\n\ng) Any other remedies that the Tribunal consider appropriate in the circumstances given Mexico\u2019s breaches\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 495.\n\n94.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief62:\n\n\"140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection and declaring that the Mortgages and Notes are indeed investments under NAFTA Article 1139; and, consequently that it has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims brought by the Claimant; thus ordering the proceedings to continue and the Respondent to file the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial in the period remaining, according with the Amended Timetable.\n\n141. The Claimant also requests the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay all of the costs of the arbitration including the costs of representation associated with the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation and with the jurisdictional phase\".\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 140 and 141.\n\n95.\n\nMexico presented its Memorial, requesting the Tribunal the following relief63:\n\n\"174. A la luz de lo anterior, la Demandada solicita al Tribunal que desestime esta reclamaci\u00f3n en virtud del Art\u00edculo 45(2) del Reglamento del Mecanismo Complementario, sobre la base de que la Demandante no ha demostrado haber realizado una inversi\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico conforme a la definici\u00f3n del Art\u00edculo 1139 del TLCAN y, por lo tanto, carece de competencia *ratione personae* y *ratione materiae*.\n\n175. La Demandada solicita al Tribunal que ordene a la Demandante reembolsar totalmente los costos de arbitraje y costos de representaci\u00f3n legal de la Demandada\".\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 174 and 175.\n\n96.\n\nMexico ended its Reply on Jurisdiction with the following request64:\n\n\"152. La Demandada solicita al Tribunal desechar la reclamaci\u00f3n de conformidad con el Art\u00edculo 45(2) de las Reglas de Arbitraje del Mecanismo Complementario del CIADI sobre la base de que la Demandante no ha establecido haber hecho una inversi\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico conforme a la definici\u00f3n del Art\u00edculo 1139 del TLCAN y, por lo tanto, que este Tribunal carece de jurisdicci\u00f3n *ratione personae* y *ratione materiae*.\n\n153. La Demandada solicita, adem\u00e1s, que el Tribunal ordene a la Demandante indemnizar por completo a la Demandada por los costos del arbitraje y los costos de representaci\u00f3n legal, incluyendo los honorarios de sus expertos y vi\u00e1ticos de los testigos y abogados que participen en la audiencia\".\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 152 and 153.\n\n**VI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nUnder Art. 45 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules \"the Tribunal shall have the power to rule on its competence\".\n\n98.\n\nMexico asks the Tribunal to rule that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae,* arguing that Lion never made an investment in Mexico within the terms required by Art. 1139 NAFTA and consequently failed to qualify as a protected investor under the Treaty.\n\n99.\n\nThe definition of investment under Art. 1139 NAFTA reads as follows65:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Article 1139: Definitions** | **Art\u00edculo 1139: Definiciones** |\n| For purposes of this Chapter: | Para efectos de este cap\u00edtulo: |\n| [...] | [...] |\n| **investment** means: | **inversi\u00f3n** significa;

C-20.\n\n100.\n\nIt is undisputed that the three Loans that Lion made to Inmobiliaria Bains and to C&C Capital, two companies not affiliated with the investor (Lion), do not qualify as investments under the NAFTA: Art. 1139(d) requires that loans to unaffiliated enterprises have an original maturity of \"at least three years\"66. And none of the Loans meets this threshold.\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n101.\n\nClaimant\u2019s argument is different. The Loans, documented in the Credit Agreements, were additionally secured by the Mortgages and formalized in the Notes (*pagar\u00e9s no negociables*). Lion says that the Mortgages and the Notes by themselves qualify as protected investments:\n\n- the Mortgages under Art. 1139(g), as \"intangible real estate\", and\n\n- the Notes under Art. 1139(h), which extends coverage to \"interests arising from the commitment of capital\"67.\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n102.\n\nMexico disagrees and avers that Lion only made three short-term Loans, which constitute a single economic transaction that does not meet the three-year maturity threshold for the inclusion of loans as an investment within the meaning of Art. 1139(d). The fact that Lion chose to secure the Loans by the issue of the Notes, and the granting of the Mortgages does not, in Mexico\u2019s submission, change the conclusion: there is one single economic transaction and one single investment.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize Respondent\u2019s (**1.**) and Claimant\u2019s (**2.**) positions, and then briefly address the experts\u2019 opinions (**3.**).\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n104.\n\nMexico says that Claimant made no valid investment under Art. 1139 NAFTA and therefore the Tribunal lacks *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to hear Lion\u2019s claims.\n\n105.\n\nMexico\u2019s position turns on the following arguments:\n\n- Lion\u2019s actual investment was to lend three short-term loans only (**1.**);\n\n- The Notes, Mortgages, and Loans are part of a single legal transaction (**2.**);\n\n- The Mortgages and Notes do not qualify as investments under Art. 1139 NAFTA (**3.**).\n\n**1.1. LION's ACTUAL INVESTMENT WAS TO MAKE THREE SHORT-TERM LOANS ONLY**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe sole economic operation carried out by Lion was to make three short-term loans to Mexican entities, an operation that does not qualify as a protected investment under Art. 1139 NAFTA, as acknowledged by Claimant68. The three Loans were documented through three instruments, with the sole purpose of securing payment of the debt - this is their *raison d\u2019etre*69 - and they cannot be considered as separate investments70. The definition of \"loans\" in Art. 1139(d) NAFTA includes loans documented in notes and secured by mortgages. Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity date of less than three years, they do not constitute investments. This should be the end of the analysis71.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 8.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 83.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 3.\n\nHT, Day 1, 27:13 - 28:17\n\n107.\n\nThe following facts and legal arguments support this conclusion:\n\n108.\n\nFirst, Lion did not intend to invest in promissory notes or mortgages. The language of the Credit Agreements makes clear that the Notes and the Mortgages were an express condition to grant each Loan72. In fact, each Loan was implemented through a Credit Agreement, a Note, and one or more Mortgages73.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 14 to 20 and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 4 and 8.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 21 to 30 and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\n109.\n\nSecond, the definition of \"Credit Documents\" under the Credit Agreements expressly includes not only the Credit Agreements, but also the Mortgages and the Notes74. Each Loan was subject to the conditions set out in the Credit Agreements, and \"any other applicable conditions... under any other Credit Documents\", which include its respective Note and Mortgage - Credit Agreements, Notes and Mortgage are therefore deemed to be part of the same operation75.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\n110.\n\nThird, the terms of the Notes and of the Mortgages just mirror the terms of the Credit Agreements as to their parties, date of execution, amount of principal, due date, ordinary interest rate, default interest rate, etc. These Notes and Mortgages provide Lion with an additional mechanism to recover the debt generated by the Loans. Accordingly, the Notes cannot constitute a separate or independent debt76.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 11 and 16.\n\n111.\n\nThe several extensions granted by Lion to their debtors confirm the fact that the Notes only document the debt created by the Loans. Each extension was implemented through the amendment of the Credit Agreements, which required the cancellation and delivery of the Notes to the creditor and the execution of a new Note in the terms established in the relevant Credit Agreement77.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\n**1.2. MORTGAGES, NOTES, AND LOANS: ONE SINGLE LEGAL TRANSACTION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIf the Loans did not exist, the Notes and the Mortgages would not exist either, as their existence and economic value depends on the Loans78. The validity and enforceability of a promissory note or a mortgage depends on the existence of the debt or obligation guaranteed. Once the loans are paid back, the security right of mortgage and the promissory note lose their purpose and become unenforceable79. In this case, the Mortgages were mere on accessory contracts80.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 83.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 24 and 66. Irra II, paras. 19, 20, 55 and 64.\n\nIrra II, para. 48 and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\n113.\n\nIn fact, the subject matter of the debtor\u2019s obligation is the same in the three legal acts: formalizing or securing the repayment of the Loans. This confirms the link between the three legal acts in such a way that it is not possible to talk about three independent transactions or *negotia* with independent economic value. The fact that each legal act is governed by a different legal regime does not change this conclusion. To find otherwise would amount to conclude that three different debts exist81.\n\nIrra II, para. 15; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 26 and 27; and Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 69.\n\n114.\n\nFurthermore, the mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never delivered to or owned by the creditor82, the only right conferred by the mortgage is a preferential right to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property83. This conclusion is not different even if, as in this case, the Civil Codes of Nayarit and Jalisco consider the mortgage as real property84.\n\nArt. 2264 C\u00f3digo Civil de Nayarit and C\u00f3digo Civil de Jalisco (Docs. 127 and 128 submitted with the Second Expert Report on Mexican Law of Rodrigo Zamora Etcharren; the First, Second, and Third Expert Reports on Mexican Law of Rodrigo Zamora Etcharren are collectively referred to as the **Zamora Reports**); and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 44.\n\nIrra II, paras. 52 and 60 and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 45 and 68.\n\nIrra II, para. 57 and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 56.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, the fact that mortgages and promissory notes have each its own legal features is irrelevant; it just means that payment of the one debt can be obtained through different avenues before the courts in case of the debtor\u2019s default85. But it does not turn the Notes, the Mortgages, and the Loans into independent operations86.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 69, 71, 76 and 78. Irra II, paras. 38 to 41.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 72.\n\n116.\n\nConsequently, as part of a single legal transaction, the Notes and the Mortgages are subject to the same legal requirements as the Loans to become a protected investment under Art. 1139(d); hence, the requisite of the three-year duration also applies to the Notes and Mortgages, as the instruments securing the Loans87.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 86.\n\nCorrect interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA\n-----------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nA correct interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA further reinforces the above conclusion:\n\n118.\n\nFirst, if the Notes and the Mortgages could be considered separately, that would allow protection of any loans - regardless of their original maturity - by just adding a security or an instrument. This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories88. The parties to NAFTA sought to restrict the protection to those loans that fulfill the requirements of Art. 1139(d) NAFTA89. Claimant\u2019s interpretation would cause an absurd anomaly: unguaranteed loans would be subject to the three-year requirement, while guaranteed loans would not; and it would also allow the protection of loans to State enterprises (which are expressly excluded), provided they are guaranteed by a mortgage or another security right90.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 88 and 90.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 85.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 151, and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 90 to 95.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, a consistent, comprehensive interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA under the principles of Art. 31.1 the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [\"**vCLT**\"] demands to read the provision and its paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) jointly and therefore, to link and apply the three-year requirement to the Mortgages and the Notes as well91. This interpretation gives meaning collectively to the three paragraphs, whilst Lion\u2019s interpretation suggests that paragraph (d) only refers to non-guaranteed loans, which is wrong as it adds language to the text92.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 150.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 127, and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 80 to 85\n\n120.\n\nSumming up, a correct interpretation leads to the conclusion that the three-year restriction of paragraph (d) of Art. 1139 NAFTA also applies to security rights and promissory notes that guarantee loans. If a mortgage or promissory note is not linked to a loan, the three-year requirement is not relevant; but if the guaranteed asset is a loan, the correct interpretation requires that a consistent meaning is given to Art. 1139 NAFTA as a whole93.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 118 and 123, and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 99-110.\n\n**1.3. MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE NOT INVESTMENTS UNDER ART. 1139 NAFTA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nEven if the Mortgages and the Notes were considered as separate investments from the Loans, neither of them fits within the definitions of Arts. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA: the ordinary meaning of paragraphs (g) and (h) exclude the Mortgages and the Notes from their scope94.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 8 and 85, and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 111-150.\n\n122.\n\nAs for the Mortgages, they are not property but rights *in rem*. Due to its own nature, a mortgage cannot be considered \"*bienes ra\u00edces u otra propiedad tangible o intangible*\" under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. Their purpose is to secure the payment of the loan up to the secured amount, and they are activated after the debtor\u2019s default only. They are thus contingent rights95.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 95 and 96.\n\n123.\n\nLion wrongly argues that the definition of \"property\" must be established under Mexican law96. Yet the local law of a signatory cannot be used to interpret the Treaty: the interpretation must be carried out from the language itself of NAFTA, taking into account the ordinary meaning of the text and taking into account the context, object, and purpose of NAFTA and the principle of *effet utile*, as demanded by Art. 31 of VCLT97.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 14-16.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 99 and 100, and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 151 to 166.\n\n**2. Claimant\u2019s position**\n--------------------------\n\n124.\n\nLion contends that the Mortgages and the Notes constitute valid investments under Art. 1139(g) and Art. 1139(h) NAFTA, respectively. Therefore, the Tribunal has both *ratione materiae* jurisdiction and *ratione personae* jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute.\n\n125.\n\nLion\u2019s position can be summarized as follows: under Mexican law, the Loans, the Notes, and the Mortgages constitute three different *negotia* (**1.**). It follows that Mortgages and Notes are \"investments\" under Art. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA (**2.**).\n\n**2.1. LOANS, NOTED, AND MORTGAGED CONSTITUTE THREE DIFFERENT** ***NEGOTIA***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThree different *negotia* were concluded in this case: the Loans, the Notes, and the Mortgages98. The three *negotia* are related but still different and separate99. Mexico\u2019s reasoning is flawed for various reasons100:\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 19.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 20.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 22.\n\n127.\n\nFirst, independence does not mean that notes or mortgages must each create a new obligation. The Notes and the Mortgages are separate *negotia* from the Loans, with different objects and different parties (in the case of the Mortgages) and separate legal regimes101. In fact, mortgages are a right *in rem*, effective *erga omnes*, which allows the creditor to follow the asset even if owned by a third party; this entirely transcends the personal obligation of the loans102.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 18, and 36 to 38.\n\nZamora II, paras. 160, 169, 170, and 173; and Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 22.\n\n128.\n\nClaimant does not dispute the fact that whenever there is a mortgage there is a loan (or any other underlying obligation), or that a guarantee is intended to secure a principal transaction. Whenever there is accessoriness, there are two assets: the principal and the accessory103, as acknowledged by the Supreme Court and the Mexican legal authorities104. And these interests require separate treatment for purposes of Art. 1139 NAFTA105.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 157.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 44 and 46, Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 246, and Zamora III, para. 105.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 43.\n\n129.\n\nSecond, Loans, Mortgages, and Notes do not have the same object, even if they refer to the same debt. A mortgage creates different property rights and economic interests compared to a loan. While loans have as their object a payment obligation, mortgages provide the possibility for the creditor to be paid from the sale of the mortgaged asset106. But mortgages provide the creditor with much more than just a different procedural avenue to claim the underlying debt: mortgages create substantive rights that go beyond the right under a loan, because they allow the creditor to use a specific asset to obtain payment with full priority, regardless of the solvency of the debtor; they also limit the powers of the owner over the asset and they grant the creditor power to protect the value of the asset107.\n\nZamora III, paras. 26-32; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 67 to 72 and 74.\n\n130.\n\nTherefore, mortgages are autonomous and confer separate economic value108. In contrast with the value of the loan, the economic value of the mortgage is unaffected by the debtor\u2019s solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset, as a consequence of the preference granted over the asset109.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 25.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para.14.\n\n131.\n\nThird, while the debtor under a loan undertakes a \"debt\", the owner of a mortgaged asset (which can be different from the debtor) assumes a \"liability\" under the mortgage: if the debtor breaches the guaranteed obligation, the owner will suffer the sale of the asset for the benefit of the creditor. No duplication or unjust enrichment takes place110.\n\nZamora III, para. 32; and Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 22.\n\n**2.2. MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE \"INVESTMENTS\" UNDER ARTS. 1139 (G) AND 1139(H)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Mortgages and the Notes can be characterized as \"investments\" under Art. 1139 NAFTA, separately and independently from the Loans111. The Mortgages squarely fall within the categories \"real estate or other property\" provided by Art. 1139(g) NAFTA112 (**A.**). The Notes fall within the category of \"commitment of capital\" under Art. 1139(h) NAFTA113 (**B.**). Furthermore, Mexico\u2019s proposed interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is mistaken (**C.**).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 49.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 134; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 54.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Section IV.C; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 54.\n\n**A. The Mortgages are \"real estate\" and \"property\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nNAFTA does not define the terms \"real estate\" or \"property\". Therefore, and unless Mexico shows that the NAFTA State parties intended to refer to an autonomous understanding of the terms \"real estate\" and \"property\", it is necessary to refer to municipal law where the property is located114.\n\nHT, 45:19 - 48:1. Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 56.\n\nUnder Mexican law\n-----------------\n\n134.\n\nConsistent with the above, NAFTA State parties and authors, opine that it is appropriate to look at the law of the host State (in this case, Mexico) for a determination of the definition and scope of \"real estate\" and \"property\"115. Other international tribunals have seconded this view by holding as follows116:\n\n\"In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law. Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection pursuant to Article 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, para. 95; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 10(c).\n\n*Emmis International Holding BV v.

Thus under Mexican law, mortgages are considered \"real estate\", which is a protected category of \"asset\" under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA118. The Claimant notes that even Mexico and its expert have acknowledged so119.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection pursuant to Article 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, paras. 96-99; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 56-59.\n\nHT, Day 1, 48:2 - 48:16.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 52, referring to the Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 36 and 40.\n\n136.\n\nMexico\u2019s NAFTA-based treaty practice shows that, with only one exception, mortgages are not considered as \"related property rights\", but interchangeably as either \"other tangible or intangible property\", \"other rights *in rem*\", \"*autres droits r\u00e9els*\" or \"*derechos reales*\", \"other rights\", \"other property rights\" or \"*otros derechos de propiedad*\" or, as in NAFTA, as an example of \"tangible or intangible property\"120.\n\nArticle 1(4)(e) of the Mexico-Spain BIT (10 October 2006) (\"movable or immovable property, as well as mortgages, pledges, usufructs or other tangible or intangible property\"). *See* Annex I to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n137.\n\nTwelve out of the twenty-one investment treaties concluded by Mexico with an express mention of mortgages as investments characterize them as \"rights *in rem*\"121. Other treaties refer to \"property rights\" (\"*derechos de propiedad*\")122 when referring to rights *in rem* such as usufructs and mortgages123. Conversely, the expression \"related property rights\" is found primarily in the treaties concluded by the United States and only in one of the Mexican bilateral investment treaties: the Mexico-Singapore BIT124.\n\nTreaties concluded with Greece, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Iceland, Czech Republic, Korea, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Cuba. *See* Annex I to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 43. The use of the plural shall be emphasized. It shows that Mexico\u2019s strict understanding of \"property\" as referring solely to full ownership or \"el derecho real de propiedad\" as the necessary addition of the *iura possidendi*, *utendi*, *abutendi* and *fruendi* is wrong.\n\nTreaties concluded with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Panama, Central American countries, Australia. See Annex I to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial.\n\nTreaties concluded with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Panama, Central American countries, Australia. See Annex I to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial. Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\nUnder international law\n-----------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe term \"property\" has a broad meaning under international law and includes rights in and over a property, i.e., *in rem* rights125.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 75.\n\n139.\n\nInternational tribunals that adopt an autonomous understanding of the term \"property\" have explained that126:\n\n\"[p]roperty can be defined as those material things which can be possessed, as well as any right which may be part of a person\u2019s patrimony; that concept includes all movable and immovable, corporal and incorporeal elements and any other intangible object capable of having value\".\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 64 and 65. The Case of the *Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community v. Nicaragua*, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Series C no. 79 (Judgment) (31 August 2001), para. 144 (Exh. CLA-061).\n\n140.\n\nHence, the term \"property\" used in investment treaties may be understood to refer to both things and rights over such things. \"Property\" refers to a bundle of *in rem* rights127. In contrast, Mexico seems to understand \"property\" as limited to the right of full ownership, implying that the words \"related property rights\" cover rights over things other than full ownership128.\n\nExh. CLA-165 (*Jahangir Mohtadi and Jila Mothadi v. Iran*, Iran-US Tribunal Award (2 December 1996), 32 Iran-USCTR 158, para. 103: \"the Tribunal first turns to the so-called \"bundle of rights\" that make up the right of ownership. [...] the elements of this right traditionally are regarded to include: the right to use the property; the right to enjoy the fruits of it; the power to possess the property; the right to exclude others from the possession or use of the property; and the right to dispose of it. [\u2026] Ownership is thus a comprehensive right\".)\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para.76.\n\n141.\n\nHowever, the ordinary meaning of \"property\" in the international arena encompasses or is inherently associated with the \"rights\" over a property, which includes mortgages129:\n\n\"Property\" may be broadly defined under international law as an entitlement of a person that is related to a thing. It consists of certain rights with regard to the thing that are usually effective against all other persons, that is, in rem rights\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 77, and Exh. CLA-063 (John G. Sprankling, *The International Law of Property*, Oxford, 2014, p. 23).\n\n142.\n\nTherefore, \"property\" cannot reasonably mean just the thing, nor its full ownership. Full ownership of a thing is one such legal interest. There are other *in rem* legal interests, including mortgages130.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 80.\n\n143.\n\nThe term \"property\" in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA was used generically by the NAFTA Parties. It operates as an umbrella, covering, in addition to real estate, \"other property\" (tangible or intangible) recognized as such in the respective domestic laws of the NAFTA Parties, which, in the case of Mexico, include mortgages131.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 83.\n\n144.\n\nIt follows from the above that the lack of reference to mortgages or \"related property rights\" in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA does not prevent the Mortgages from been characterized as \"real estate or other property\" pursuant to the international *usus loquendi* of the term \"property\"132. Under such *usus loquendi*, the term \"property\" consists of certain rights with regard to a thing, including those arising from mortgages. The terms \"*biens*\"/\"*bienes*\" used in the French and Spanish versions of the NAFTA are understood as expropriable and appropriable movable and immovable elements, including rights *in rem*133*.* Further evidence of the international *usus loquendi* can be found in the treaty practice of the NAFTA State parties, especially those treaties with a definition of \"investment\" based on Art. 1139 NAFTA. An examination of such treaties shows that, as per Mexico\u2019s own *usus loquendi* :\n\n- mortgages are treated within the paragraph defining property as an investment; and\n\n- mortgages are treated separately from loans134.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 92.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection pursuant to Article 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, paras. 89-93; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 84 and 88; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 52.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 213, 222, and 254; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 52.\n\n**B. The Notes are a valid investment**\n---------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Notes are interests of economic nature arising as a result of the commitment of capital of Lion in Mexico and used for an economic activity; as such, they are also a protected investment under Art. 1139(h) NAFTA.\n\n146.\n\nThe Notes are \"interests\":\n\n- under Mexican law (\"*t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito*\") containing a person\u2019s (subscriber) unconditional promise to pay to another person (holder) a determined sum of money135.\n\n- following Canada\u2019s understanding of the ordinary meaning of \"interests\"136.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 135.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 134.\n\n147.\n\nFurthermore, the destination of the commitment was clearly an \"economic activity\" in Mexico: the disbursements made by Lion were intended and used to provide Mexican companies with the funds for the acquisition of land in Mexico and working capital to develop them137.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 134; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 53.\n\n**C. Mexico\u2019s interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is ill-conceived**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nFirst, Art. 1139(d) NAFTA only refers to loans. There is no reference to mortgages, promissory notes or, more broadly, guarantees securing a loan138. The ordinary meaning of the term \"loan\" in Art. 1139 does not include mortgages, something different and separate from a loan. A mortgage may not exist without an obligation, but an obligation (e.g., a loan) can certainly exist without a mortgage139.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 186; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para.106.\n\nHT, 42:8 - 45:18.\n\n149.\n\nThe term \"loan\" is used in three other provisions in Chapter 11 in addition to Art. 1139 NAFTA (i.e., Arts. 1108, 1109 and 1110). Under these provisions, loans are treated as separate and distinct from guarantees, and only as credits and monetary obligations140. And it is used in seven provisions outside Chapter 11, only three being relevant and in two of them (Arts. 1001(5)(a) and 1201(2)(d)) loans are listed as separate assets from their guarantees141.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 208-216; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 221-223; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\n150.\n\nSimilarly, there is no reference in paragraphs (g) and (h) to loans, nor is there any reference to a duration requirement of any sort. The fact that paragraphs (g) and (h) are self-standing is furthermore confirmed by the lack of cross-references to paragraph (d), in contrast to other categories listed as investment in Art. 1139 NAFTA142. The drafters of the NAFTA carefully143 identified the paragraphs that were intertwined or connected144; and yet nothing in paragraphs (g) and (h), or in any other paragraph of Art. 1139, indicates or implies that the qualification of a real-estate interest or interests arising from the commitment of capital as an investment is subordinated to other paragraphs of Art. 1139145.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection, paras. 28-29; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 205; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\nAs explained by Canada: \"The drafters of the NAFTA chose specific language, fully aware of the differences reflected in other provisions of NAFTA\". *Methanex Corporation v. The United States of America*, Second Submission of Canada Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (30 April 2001), para. 14, Exh. CLA-120.\n\nSubparagraph (f) excludes from the category under consideration the interests arising from the assets listed in subparagraphs (c) and (d) (debt security and loans). Subparagraph (i) and (j) refer to subparagraphs (d) and (a) to (h) to clarify which claims to money are protected.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 201-207; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\n151.\n\nSecond, the definition of \"investment\" under Art. 1139 NAFTA is constituted by eight paragraphs, based upon categories of property rights and economic interests, not business activities146. But this does not mean that all the requirements, conditions, and exceptions included in each one of these eight paragraphs must be cumulatively complied with, under the pretext that the ordinary meaning of one those paragraphs shall be read in context. On the contrary, the fact that a condition is included in one of the paragraphs, and not in the general heading that precedes the paragraphs, suggests that the condition in question is applicable to that paragraph and not to the others147.\n\nHT, 41:5 - 42:7.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 103.\n\n152.\n\nSince the language of paragraphs (g) and (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA does not contain any reference to the three-year requirement found in other paragraphs of Art. 1139 NAFTA148, as Mexico itself has noted, \"*ser\u00eda una interpretaci\u00f3n inadmisible dado que implicar\u00eda a\u00f1adir una palabra al P\u00e1rrafo... que no se encuentra ah\u00ed\"149.*\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 113.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 127.\n\n153.\n\nThird, Art. 1139 NAFTA is a definition by enumeration of the economic interests that can be considered to be a covered investment. Only three out of these eight categories include restrictions such as the three-year initial maturity duration for loans (paragraphs (c), (d) and (f))150. The three-year requirement is thus an exception and must be interpreted restrictively, pursuant to the general principle *exceptiones sunt strictae interpretationis*151. This principle entails that a requirement such as the three-year original maturity cannot be applied to any other hypothesis except those to which the text of Article 1139 NAFTA expressly provides it applies152. In fact, the only limitation concerning \"real estate\" or \"property\" under paragraph (g) is that they shall be acquired or used for an \"economic benefit or other business purpose\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 195; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 186; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 106.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 122.\n\n154.\n\nFourth, given that the Mortgages qualify as an investment under paragraph (g) and the Notes under paragraph (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA, such characterization must produce an *effet utile*153*.*\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 127.\n\n155.\n\nThe *effet utile* doctrine is generally understood as follows154:\n\n\"This rule is sometimes invoked as a principle - according to which the interpreter has sometimes to presume that the authors of a treaty, by adopting the wording of a disposition, meant to give it a certain meaning in order for this disposition to receive an effective application\".\n\nExh. CLA-539, Jean Salmon, *Dictionnaire de Droit International Public*, Bruylant, 2001, p. 416: \"Regle parfois invoquee au titre de principe \u2014 selon laquelle l\u2019interprete doit presumer que les auteurs d\u2019un trait&en adoptant les termes d\u2019une disposition, ont entendu leur donner une signification telle que cette disposition puisse recevoir une application effective\".)\n\n156.\n\nThe doctrine is not intended to give guidance in determining whether the asset under consideration is a loan, real estate or property or a commitment of capital. The doctrine simply states that the rules governing any of those categories shall be given their full effect and meaning155. This doctrine operates as a test to make sure that an interpretation is not conducted in bad faith or that it strips a provision of its useful meaning156. In this case, nothing prevents an accessory right to be separately qualified as an investment, even when the main operation does not157.\n\nExh. CLA-105, Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment (5 December 2011), I.C.J. Reports 644 (2011), p. 673, para. 92.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 131.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder to Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection pursuant to Article 45(6) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, paras. 7 and 8. *See* Exh. CLA-109 (*ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2, Award (18 May 2010), paras. 103 and 117).\n\n157.\n\nIn conclusion, the Loans, the Mortgages, and the Notes fall within three different paragraphs under Article 1139 NAFTA, and shall be characterized separately, as acknowledged by other NAFTA tribunals158. Nothing prevents that one asset is protected while another is not159.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 52; *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (12 January 2011), paras. 90-122, Exh. CLA-117.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 134.\n\n**3. The experts\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide a summary of the expert opinion submitted by Respondent (**1.**) and then of the one produced by Claimant (**2.**).\n\n**3.1. THE IRRA OPINIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n159.\n\nRespondent retained Lic. Ren\u00e9 Irra Ibarra to serve as expert on Mexican law in this arbitration. He submitted two reports with his opinions160.\n\nIrra I, dated August 29, 2017 and Irra II, dated December 7, 2017.\n\n160.\n\nLic. Irra testified at the Hearing and ratified the main arguments established in his reports. In particular, he developed the following arguments161:\n\n- Lic. Irra identified as his main disagreement with Claimant\u2019s expert that in his view there are not three different *negotia* ; there is just one *negotium*, evidenced by three legal acts, which are separate, because a mortgage is not a promissory note, and neither of them is a loan; but the existence of three legal acts does not imply that they are different *negotia*162.\n\n- The Loans are the underlying transaction that gave rise to the other legal acts: the Notes and the Mortgages; Lic. Irra acknowledged that under Mexican law each of the three acts is regulated by a different set of laws; but he rejected that the differences in regulation imply the existence of different *negotia* ; the differences are mainly procedural: loans, notes, and mortgages empower the lender to use distinct court actions to enforce its rights163, without creating separate transactions164.\n\n- Mortgages and notes require the existence of a loan that is being secured or formalized165; the borrower assumes a single obligation, to repay the money lent, plus interest, and this is the only obligation that the creditor can enforce, either through the loans, the notes or the mortgage166.\n\nHT, Day 1, 77:14 - 132:13.\n\nHT, Day 1, 83:17 - 84:9.\n\nHT, Day 1, 79:5 - 80:12.\n\nHT, Day 1, 81:15 - 82:4.\n\nHT, Day 1, 83:10 - 83:16.\n\nHT, Day 1, 87:11 - 87:20.\n\n**3.2. THE ZAMORA OPINIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nClaimant retained Lic. Rodrigo Zamora Etcharren to serve as expert on Mexican law in this arbitration. He submitted three reports on the matter167.\n\nZamora I, dated March 6, 2017, Zamora II, dated October 23, 2017 and Zamora III, dated January 18, 2018.\n\n162.\n\nLic. Zamora testified at the hearing and ratified the main arguments from his reports, in particular168:\n\n- There are essential differences between the Loans, the Mortgages, and the Notes, which go beyond furnishing three procedural actions: there are three *negotia* that confer different rights, include different parties, and create different procedural actions169.\n\n- Each *negotium* is a commercial asset that confers its own set of rights: creditors have different rights under a loan agreement, under a note and under a mortgage170.\n\n- The three *negotia* give rise to different procedural actions, which may be brought simultaneously; a creditor can claim under the note, under the mortgage or under the loan; this does not mean, however, that a creditor can recover the principal of the loan three times; the principal is owed only once, and Mexican procedural law provides for mechanisms to avoid such result171.\n\nHT, Day 1, 135:11 - 169:5.\n\nHT, Day 1, 136:6 - 136:20.\n\nHT, Day 1, 137:5 - 137:19.\n\nHT, Day 1, 142:2 -142:10.\n\n**VII. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal is called to decide a discrete question: whether non-negotiable promissory notes formalizing, or mortgages securing short-term loans, can still qualify as NAFTA protected investments under Arts. 1139(h) or 1139(g), even if the loans fail the three-year maturity test under Art. 1139(d).\n\n164.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties have not referred to any previous decision by any court or tribunal deciding on this very question172. The Tribunal is also unable to rely on the opinion of the United States of America or Canada: although both States were entitled to submit their opinion under Art. 1128 NAFTA, both decided not make use of such right. Nor has the NAFTA Commission approved any binding interpretation (under Art. 1131(2) NAFTA) shedding light on the issue.\n\nClaimant has only drawn the attention of the Tribunal to one international law precedent where mortgages were protected as separate investments. Many Americans had mortgages on property taken by Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 1948 did not include any provision concerning mortgages. Notwithstanding the above, the Commission allowed claims for mortgages on the ground that the taking of the encumbered property effectively took from the mortgagee the right to foreclose. Moreover, under the laws of Yugoslavia, a real property mortgage was considered as real property - *see* \"Foreign Claim Settlement Commission of the United States\", Decisions and Annotations; CLA-511, p. 62; the best known decision is *Erna Lina Klein*, CLA-69.\n\n165.\n\nIn absence of any guidance, the Tribunal must apply the governing law mandated by Art. 1131(1) NAFTA: the Tribunal\n\n\"shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement [i.e. the NAFTA] and applicable rules of international law\".\n\n166.\n\nApplying such governing law, the Tribunal will in due course dismiss Claimant\u2019s submission that the Notes qualify as protected investments (**1.**), while finding that the Mortgages do indeed qualify as \"intangible real estate\" for the purposes of Art. 1139(g) NAFTA (**2.**).\n\n**1. The Notes do not qualify as investments**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nClaimant\u2019s case is that the Notes qualify as protected investments under Art. 1139(h) NAFTA:\n\n\"(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\".\n\n168.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, the Notes constitute \"interests arising from commitment of capital\". Lion submits that the concept of \"interests\", as used in this provision, includes titles, and the Notes qualify as titles. \"Interests\" also cover \"*cosas mercantiles*\", and under Mexican law the Notes are \"*cosas mercantiles*\". Finally, the other requirements are also met: the source of the Notes is Lion\u2019s \"commitment of capital\" and the destination of the capital is an \"economic activity\" in Mexico173.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 135.\n\n169.\n\nMexico disagrees. In its submission, the requirements of Art. 1139(h) are not met. Lion made no contribution of capital under the Notes - the only contribution of capital was made under the Loans. Notes are simply instruments which evidence the existence of a debt created by the Loans and facilitate collection of the amounts due174.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 117 and 118.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal - without hesitation - sides with Respondent.\n\n171.\n\nThe Notes clearly do not constitute protected investments under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. To support its conclusion, the Tribunal will briefly explain the nature of promissory notes under Mexican law (**A.**), and then will reason why promissory notes do not meet the requirements under Art. 1139(h) (**B.**).\n\n**A. Promissory notes under Mexican law**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe three Credit Agreements entered into between Lion as Lender, and Inmobiliaria Bains and C&C Capital as Borrowers, required that each \"Credit Drawdown will be documented in a non-negotiable Note\"175. Complying with this contractual obligation:\n\n- on February 28, 2007 Inmobiliaria Bains issued the First Note, undertaking to pay to Lion US$15 million, plus interest, with final maturity date September 30, 2009176.\n\n- on June 14, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Second Note in favor of Lion for US$12.45 million (plus interest), with final maturity date September 30, 2009177; and\n\n- on September 26, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Third Note, again in favor of Lion, for US$5,355,479 (plus interest), with final maturity as of September 30, 2009178.\n\nExh. C-8.\n\nExh. C-153.\n\nExh. C-12.\n\nExh. C-154.\n\n173.\n\nAll three Notes share several characteristics:\n\n- The Notes are defined as \"*pagar\u00e9s*\" subject to Mexican law;\n\n- The Notes incorporate the issuer\u2019s unconditional promise to pay Lion the stated amount, plus ordinary and penalty interest;\n\n- The Notes are expressly stated to be \"*no negociable* [*s*]\";\n\n- Payments are to be made in Lion\u2019s designated U.S. bank account, in freely available funds;\n\n- The issuer submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Mexico\u2019s Distrito Federal.\n\n174.\n\nUnder Mexican Law *pagar\u00e9s* are a special category of *t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito*179. And *t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito* (also known as *t\u00edtulos valor*) are defined by the Ley General de T\u00edtulos y Operaciones de Cr\u00e9dito [\"**LGToC**\"] as180:\n\n\"*documentos necesarios para ejercitar el derecho literal que en ellos se consigna*\".\n\nMexican law uses the concept *titulos de cr\u00e9dito.* Other Spanish-speaking jurisdictions use the equivalent expression *t\u00edtulos valor.*\n\nArt. 5 LGTOC.\n\n175.\n\nThe legal definition underlines the basic trait of a *t\u00edtulo de cr\u00e9dito* : a document signed by the issuer, which grants its holder the rights literally mentioned (\"*incorporados*\", to use the technical expression) in the document.\n\n176.\n\n*Pagar\u00e9s* are one of the basic sub-groups of *t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito* : documents that formalize the issuer\u2019s unconditional promise to pay to the holder a certain amount of money on a certain due date181. To be legally considered as a *pagar\u00e9*, the document must necessarily include the word \"*pagar\u00e9*\".\n\nArt. 170 LGTOC.\n\n177.\n\n*Pagar\u00e9s* are issued to formalize an underlying monetary obligation. Normally, this obligation arises from a contract (*contrato subyacente*) entered into between issuer of the *pagar\u00e9* and its first holder. In the present case, the *contratos subyacentes* are the three Credit Agreements signed between Lion and Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital. Under these contracts the borrowers owe certain amounts of principal and interest to Lion, and these obligations are \"incorporated\" into the three Notes, issued by the borrowers, designating Lion as beneficiary, and which the borrowers delivered to Lion.\n\n178.\n\nThe relationship between a *pagar\u00e9* and its *contrato subyacente* can be \"*abstracto*\" or \"*causal*\"182:\n\nIrra I, para. 15 and Zamora II, para. 110.\n\n179.\n\n(i) In the first case, the law, seeking to protect third parties that acquire *pagar\u00e9s* in good faith by endorsement, creates a separation between the underlying contract and the payment obligation incorporated in the *pagar\u00e9*. If the initial holder of the note endorses the *pagar\u00e9* to a third party (for instance, a bank), such secondary holder is entitled to request that the issuer pay the stated amount on maturity, while the issuer is prohibited from invoking \"*excepciones personales*\", i.e. defenses arising from the *contrato subyacente* between the issuer and the first holder183. A *pagar\u00e9* that has been endorsed and against which *excepciones personales* are not admitted is said to be \"abstract\".\n\n*See* Art. 8 LGTOC; Irra I, para. 15.\n\n180.\n\n(ii) In the second case, the link between *contrato subyacente* and *pagar\u00e9* is not severable: the issuer may deny payment invoking the same defenses that could have been used to reject payment under the *contrato subyacente*. *Pagar\u00e9s* that have not been endorsed, and especially *pagar\u00e9s* which are stated to be *no negociables* (i.e., where endorsement is prohibited) are always considered *t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito causales*184.\n\nIrra I, para. 28.\n\n181.\n\n*Pagar\u00e9s no negociables*, as are the Notes issued in the present case, do not provide the holder with an abstract right to collect. The right incorporated into the note is identical to the right arising from the underlying contract. The main advantage conferred by a *pagar\u00e9 no negociable* is procedural: the holder can enforce the right against the issuer through an *acci\u00f3n ejecutiva*, an expedited procedure that permits the preliminary attachment of the issuer\u2019s assets185.\n\nZamora II, para. 134.\n\n**B.** ***Pagar\u00e9s no negociables*** **do not meet the requirements of Art. 1139(h)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nArt. 1139 NAFTA offers a sophisticated and precise definition of protected investments: the provision lists eight categories of \"interests\" which are considered as investments, and two categories which are excluded186.\n\nThe provision gives the overarching concept of \"interests\" to the ten categories to which it refers - see last line of the definition.\n\n183.\n\nThe eight categories of interests that qualify as investment are in its turn divided into two groups:\n\n184.\n\nThe first group comprises paragraphs (a) through (f) plus sub-paragraph (h.ii) of Art. 1139. These six categories of interests all relate to situations where the foreign investor owns or finances \"enterprises\" located in the host state.\n\n185.\n\nThe situations where the foreign investor finances an enterprise in the host state are developed in paragraphs (c) and (d) and in sub-paragraph (h.ii):\n\n- Paragraphs (c) and (d) cover \"debt securities\" bought or \"loans\" granted by the foreign investor, and specifically require that the financing, if granted to an enterprise which is not affiliated to the investor, has a maturity of at least three years;\n\n- Sub-paragraph (h.ii) adds a different type of financing: contracts where the investor commits capital (or other resources), and the remuneration depends \"substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\"; provided that this requirement is met, NAFTA does not additionally require a minimum three-year maturity.\n\n186.\n\nThe second group of protected investments are those defined in paragraph (g) and subparagraph (h.i). These provisions cover two distinct situations:\n\n- Paragraph (g) refers to \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible\", acquired or used by the foreign investor for economic benefit or for business purposes; while\n\n- Sub-paragraph (h.i) extends the concept of investments to contracts in which the investor commits capital (or other resources) to economic activity in the host state, \"including turnkey or construction contracts or concessions\".\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s decision**\n------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe basic facts of the case are not in dispute:\n\n- The lender of the financing was Lion, a Canadian company;\n\n- The Borrowers were two unaffiliated enterprises located in Mexico;\n\n- The maturity was less than three years;\n\n- The contract was formalized in three Credit Agreements;\n\n- The Borrowers\u2019 repayment obligations were additionally formalized in three nonnegotiable *pagar\u00e9s* ;\n\n- The remuneration for the Loans and the *pagar\u00e9s* was a fixed-interest rate, without any link to the revenues or profits of the Borrowers.\n\n188.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Lion\u2019s interest deriving from these financings - be it the Credit Agreements or the Notes - does not meet the requirements to be considered as a protected investment under any of the categories defined in Art. 1139 NAFTA:\n\n189.\n\n(i) Art. 1139(d) NAFTA187:\n\n\"(d) a loan to an enterprise\n\n(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or\n\n(ii) where the original maturity of the loan is at least three years,\n\nbut does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state enterprise\".\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n190.\n\nThe Credit Agreements do not meet the requirements under Art. 1139(d).\n\n191.\n\nWhilst it is true that the Credit Agreements qualify as \"loans\" to an unaffiliated enterprise, as Claimant itself acknowledges, the Loans by themselves cannot constitute protected investments, because they do not pass the three-year maturity test required by Art. 1139(d)(ii).\n\n192.\n\n(ii) Art. 1139(c) NAFTA188:\n\n\"(c) a debt security of an enterprise\n\n(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or\n\n(ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least three years,\n\nbut does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity, of a state enterprise\".\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n193.\n\nThe Notes fail to qualify as \"debt security\" under Art. 1139(c).\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Claimant\u2019s opinion that *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* do not fit within the definition of \"debt security\" set forth in paragraph (c)189: debt securities are tradeable, while endorsement of *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* is prohibited by law.\n\nClaimant\u2019s presentation at its closing argument (\" **H-2**\"), p. 11.\n\n195.\n\nBe that as it may, even if it were accepted that the *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* can be considered as \"debt securities\", the Notes would not qualify: having been issued by an unaffiliated enterprise, they must pass, but fail, the three-year-maturity threshold.\n\n196.\n\n(iii) Art. 1139(h.i) and (h.ii) NAFTA190:\n\n\"(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\".\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n197.\n\nThe Notes also fail to meet the requirements under sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii).\n\n198.\n\nSub-paragraph (h.i) only covers contracts involving \"the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory\" of the host state; and to clarify its meaning, the provision provides three examples (turnkey contracts, construction contracts and concessions). This category bears no relationship with the case under discussion: *pagar\u00e9s no negociables*, where the underlying contract is a loan, do not imply the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the host state, and have no relationship with turnkey contracts, construction contracts, and concessions.\n\n199.\n\nSub-paragraph (h.ii) also fails to grant protection to the Notes. It refers to contracts where the investor commits capital, provided that the remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise located in the host state - a requirement which the fixed-interest Notes do not satisfy.\n\n**b. Claimant\u2019s counter-arguments**\n-----------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nClaimant argues that the Notes are protected, by referring simply to the *chapeau* of paragraph (h), and excluding any reference to the examples provided in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii). In Claimant\u2019s submission, the Notes qualify as \"interests arising from the commitment of capital [\u2026] to economic activity\" and consequently are protected191.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 135.\n\n201.\n\nThe argument is unconvincing - as Mexico has correctly argued192.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 116.\n\n202.\n\nIn the present case, Lion formalized the commitment of capital contractually - by signing the Credit Agreements. Additionally, Claimant requested and obtained *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* issued by the Borrowers. The delivery of this causal (*i.e*., non-abstract) *t\u00edtulo de cr\u00e9dito*, intrinsically bound to the Credit Agreement, does not change the nature or the scope of the legal relationship between Lender and Borrowers: their legal relationship continues to be governed by the Credit Agreements, and - for the purposes of Art. 1139 NAFTA - such legal relationship continues to be a \"loan\" subject to paragraph (d); a loan which does not meet the three-year maturity test. Contrary to Claimant\u2019s view, the delivery of this *t\u00edtulo de cr\u00e9dito* does not constitute a separate and severable commitment of capital.\n\n203.\n\nClaimant puts the focus of its analysis on the *chapeau* of paragraph (h) and submits that any \"interests arising from the commitment of capital\" are protected.\n\n204.\n\nThis is not so.\n\n205.\n\nThe *chapeau* cannot be read by itself. The NAFTA does not extend protection to any \"commitments of capital\", but only to those which exhibit certain features so as to give rise to \"interests\". These features are defined through two illustrative examples in subparagraphs (h.i) and (h.ii). Both sub-paragraphs share a common feature: both refer to \"contracts\". Thus, it is safe to conclude that a minimum requirement of \"commitments of capital\" protected by paragraph (h) is to be formalized as contracts. The *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* do not meet this test: they are *t\u00edtulos de cr\u00e9dito*, not contracts.\n\n206.\n\nThere is a further argument.\n\n207.\n\nThe contracts that underlie the *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* - short-term, fixed-interest loans -do not share any traits with the contracts described in sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii), which serve as illustrative examples of protected \"commitments of capital\". Sub-paragraph (h.i) covers construction contracts and concessions, and sub-paragraph (h.ii) contracts with variable remuneration. The ordinary meaning of a term in a treaty must be read in its context, as Art. 31.1 VCLT mandates. And in this case the context provided by sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii) shows that \"commitments of capital\" to be protected under paragraph (h) must show some additional, defining feature, which simple short-term fixed-interest loans lack. Loans are specifically governed by Art. 1139(d) NAFTA - and only protected provided that the requirements set forth in that provision are met.\n\n**2. The Mortgages qualify as investments**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nHaving concluded that the Credit Agreements and the Notes do not qualify as NAFTA protected investments, the Tribunal must now address Claimant\u2019s final argument: that the Mortgages qualify as \"intangible real estate or other property\" acquired by Lion \"for the purpose of economic benefit\" under paragraph (g) of Art. 1139.\n\n209.\n\nClaimant maintains that under Mexican law mortgages are considered \"real estate\" and under international law, as \"other property\"193.\n\nHT, Day 1, 48:17 - 51:4.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant does not dispute that mortgages are accessory transactions, which secure rights deriving from the Loans, but considers that the three-year minimum maturity required by paragraphs (c) and (d) is inapposite194, because the Loans and the Mortgages are separate *negotia*, with different objects, different parties, and separate legal regimes. Mortgages are rights *in rem*, effective *erga omnes*, allow the creditor to follow the asset even if owned by a third party, and the value of the mortgage differs from the value of the loan: it is unaffected by the debtor\u2019s solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset195.\n\nHT, Day 1, 51:5 - 52:19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 74 and 75.\n\n211.\n\nMexico disagrees. It says that mortgages are accessory, and that the only economically relevant transaction was the granting of three short-term loans that did not qualify as an investment. Claimant did not invest in mortgages. The definition of \"loans\" in paragraph (d) includes loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity date of less than three years, they do not constitute an investment196.\n\nHT, Day 1, 27:14 - 28:18\n\n212.\n\nMexico adds that the mortgage is a security right created over real property, and the real estate is never delivered to nor owned by the creditor; the only right conferred by the mortgage is a preferential right to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property, and this does not amount to \"real estate or other property\" under paragraph (g)197.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras.121 to 150.\n\n213.\n\nFinally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow protection of any loans - regardless of their original maturity - by just adding a security. This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories198.\n\nHT, Day 1, 29:14 - 33:2.\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyze the nature of mortgages under Mexican law (**1**.), and then will reason why the Mortgages in the present case constitute protected investments under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA, without such protection extending to the Loans or the Notes (**2**.).\n\n**2.1. MORTGAGES UNDER MEXICAN LAW**\n------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nLion obtained three mortgages as a security for the Loans:\n\n- On June 13, 2007 Bansi S.A., as trustee, and as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as founder and beneficiary of the trust, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara Mortgage 1, which encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project, and secured the principal and interest owed under the Second Loan199;\n\n- On September 26, 2007, Bansi S.A, again acting as trustee, as per the instruction of C&C Capital, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara Mortgage 2, which encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project200, and secured the principal and interest owed under the Third Loan;\n\n- On April 2, 2008 Inmobiliaria Bains granted the Nayarit Mortgage over the Nayarit Project, located in Bah\u00eda de Banderas, securing the three Loans, including principal and interest201.\n\nExh. C-14.\n\nExh. C-156.\n\nExh. C-10.\n\n216.\n\nUnder Mexican law, mortgages are regulated by the Civil Code of the states where the real estate is located, regardless of the nature of the obligation which is being secured. In the present case, the Guadalajara Mortgages 1 and 2 are subject to the Civil Code of Jalisco [\"**CC Jalisco**\"], and the Nayarit Mortgage to the Civil Code of Nayarit [\"**CC Nayarit**\"]202.\n\nZamora II, paras. 144-147.\n\n**A. Mortgages are** ***derechos reales***\n------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nArts. 2517 CC Jalisco and 2264 CC Nayarit define mortgages in similar terms203:\n\n\"*Art\u00edculo 2517.- Es contrato de hipoteca aqu\u00e9l por virtud del cual se constituye un derecho real sobre bienes inmuebles o derechos reales que no se entreguen al acreedor, para garantizar el cumplimiento de una obligaci\u00f3n y su grado de preferencia en el pago\"204.*\n\n*\"Art\u00edculo 2264.- La hipoteca es una garant\u00eda real constituida sobre bienes que no se entregan al acreedor, y que da derecho a \u00e9ste, en caso de incumplimiento de la obligaci\u00f3n garantizada, a ser pagado con el valor de los bienes, en el grado de preferencia establecido por la Ley\"205.*\n\nZamora II, para. 149\n\nDoc. 127 to Zamora Reports.\n\nDoc. 128 to Zamora Reports.\n\n218.\n\nMortgages are defined as *derechos reales* that encumber real estate (or other *derechos reales*), affording the mortgagee the right, if the guaranteed obligation is breached, to be paid with the price resulting from the sale in public auction of the asset. The encumbrance follows the asset: if the mortgagor transfers the asset to a third party, the beneficiary\u2019s rights over the real estate remain unaffected206.\n\nArt. 2546 CC Jalisco and Art. 2265 CC Nayarit (Docs. 127 and 128 to Zamora Reports).\n\n219.\n\nMortgages do not imply that the mortgagee acquires the possession or ownership over the asset. The mortgagee does not enjoy the full set of traditional rights granted to the owner of real estate (*ius utendi*, *ius fruendi*, *ius abutendi*), but only a right of preference: if the secured obligation is not paid, the mortgagee can force the sale of the asset, and the price obtained is used to satisfy the secured obligation207 - provided that the mortgage has been documented in a notarial deed and registered in the Public Registry208.\n\nZamora II, paras. 153-154.\n\nZamora II, para. 188.\n\n220.\n\nAs *derechos reales de garant\u00eda*, mortgages always secure an underlying obligation, where the mortgagee is the creditor and the mortgagor, the debtor (or a third party willing to provide a guarantee). Although mortgage and underlying obligation are separate *negocios jur\u00eddicos*, created by declarations of intent of different persons, and formalized in separate documents, mortgages are said to be \"accessory\"209. Accessoriness implies that payment or voidness of the underlying obligation provokes the extinction of the mortgage - but not that both legal relationships are identical210.\n\nIrra II, para. 48.\n\n*See* Roc\u00edo Di\u00e9guez Oliva, *El principio de accesoriedad y la patrimonializaci\u00f3n del rango*, Cuadernos de Derecho Registral, 2009, Exh. CLA-455.\n\n221.\n\nThe value of the mortgage and that of the underlying obligation also do not have to coincide, neither at the time of creation or thereafter: the value of the main obligation fluctuates with the solvency of the debtor, while the value of the mortgage depends on the worth of the mortgaged real estate (and the legal preference granted to mortgages)211.\n\nH-2, p. 70.\n\n**B. Mortgages are** ***bienes inmuebles***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe CCs of Jalisco and of Nayarit distinguish between \"*bienes inmuebles*\" and \"*bienes muebles*\".\n\n223.\n\nUnder Art. 799 CC Jalisco and Art. 738 CC Nayarit, the definition of \"*bienes inmuebles*\" extends not only to tangible assets but also to certain intangible rights:\n\n- Tangible real estate is labelled as \"*inmuebles por naturaleza\"*, and is defined by the fact that such assets \"*no pueden trasladarse de un lugar a otro*\";\n\n- But both CCs, following a long tradition, also extend the concept of *bienes inmuebles* to certain intangible rights over real estate (the so-called \"*bienes inmuebles intangibles o incorporales*\").\n\n224.\n\nPicking up on this tradition, Art. 799 XII CC Jalisco and Art. 738 XII CC Nayarit provide that \"*los derechos reales sobre inmuebles*\" are also to be considered as *bienes inmuebles.* The *derechos reales sobre inmuebles* are certain defined categories of rights *in rem*, including but not limited to mortgages212.\n\nDocs. 127 and 128 to Zamora Reports.\n\n225.\n\nThe necessary corollary is that, under the relevant municipal law, the Mortgages constitute *bienes inmuebles* (and more specifically *bienes inmuebles incorporales o intangibles*) *.*\n\n**2.2. MORTGAGES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF ART. 1139(G)**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nUnder Art. 1139(g) NAFTA, protected investments include (*inter alia*) \"intangible real estate\", provided that the investor uses the asset for \"economic benefit or other business purpose\".\n\n227.\n\nClaimant says that the definition of \"intangible real estate\" must be established applying the *lex situs*, in this case the CCs Jalisco and Nayarit, and that under such rules mortgages indeed qualify as intangible real estate. Lion adds that the second requirement is also met: the Mortgages were granted for economic benefit.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs. It will first explain its reasoning (**A.**), and then will analyze Mexico\u2019s counter-arguments (**B.**)\n\n**A. The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nUnder Art. 1139(g) NAFTA an asset, to be considered as a protected investment, must meet two requirements: it must constitute \"intangible real estate\" and it must be used for economic benefit or other business purpose.\n\n230.\n\nThe Mortgages satisfy both requirements.\n\n231.\n\n(i) NAFTA does not offer a definition of the term \"intangible real estate\" used in its Art. 1139(g). Absent such definition, to determine whether an investor holds \"intangible real estate\", it is necessary to refer to the law of the host state. As the tribunal stated in *Emmis*213:\n\n\"Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law\".\n\n*Emmis International Holding BV v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award (16 April 2014), para. 162. Exh. CLA-501.\n\n232.\n\nThe municipal law in this case are the legal systems of the Mexican states of Nayarit and Jalisco, since the encumbered real estate is located in these jurisdictions and both legal systems embrace the *lex loci rei sitae* principle:\n\n\"*Art\u00edculo 14.- Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado y los bienes muebles que en \u00e9l se encuentren, se regir\u00e1n por las disposiciones de este C\u00f3digo\"214.*\n\n*\"Art\u00edculo 15.- La determinaci\u00f3n del derecho aplicable se har\u00e1 conforme a las siguientes reglas:...*\n\n*V. Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado de Jalisco y los bienes muebles que en \u00e9l se encuentren, se regir\u00e1n por las disposiciones de este C\u00f3digo\"*215.\n\nDoc. 128 to Zamora Reports.\n\nDoc. 127 to Zamora Reports.\n\n233.\n\nApplying the CCs of Nayarit and Jalisco, the Tribunal has already concluded that both civil law systems explicitly and unequivocally include mortgages within the legal category of *derechos reales*, which in their turn constitute *bienes inmuebles*, and more specifically *bienes inmuebles intangibles* or intangible real estate.\n\n234.\n\nThe Mortgages thus constitute intangible real estate, and meet the first requirement under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA.\n\n235.\n\nThere is a small discrepancy between the terminology used in the Civil Codes of Nayarit and Jalisco, and the one used in the Spanish version of the NAFTA: while the Civil Codes refer to *bienes inmuebles*, the Spanish version of the NAFTA refers to *bienes ra\u00edces*. Both expressions are synonyms in Spanish216. The same conclusion, that there is no difference between *bienes inmuebles* and *bienes ra\u00edces*, is reached by comparing the terminology used in the three equally authentic texts of the Treaty217: the French text uses the expression \"*biens immobiliers*\" as equivalent to \"real estate\" in English and \"*bienes ra\u00edces*\" in Spanish.\n\n*See*, Diccionario del Espa\u00f1ol Jur\u00eddico, Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, entry \"bien ra\u00edz\"; available at http://dej.rae.es/#/entry-id/E41960.\n\n*See* Art. 2206 NAFTA, Exh. C-20.\n\n236.\n\n(ii) The second requirement established by Art. 1139(g) is also met: Lion acquired the Mortgages for economic benefit and with a business purpose. Lion is an investment company, and the purpose of the Mortgages was to secure commercial loans, granted to two Mexican enterprises, with the purpose of earning interest (and eventually to invest in certain real estate projects situated in Mexico).\n\n237.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that the ordinary meaning of \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible\" in Art. 1139(g) includes the Mortgages.\n\nConsistent treaty practice\n--------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe conclusion that the Mortgages constitute protected investments is confirmed by Mexico\u2019s treaty practice. Investment treaties signed by Mexico frequently include *derechos reales* as a category of protected investments, and refer to mortgages as specific *derechos reales* which are contained within the scope of protection.\n\n239.\n\nThe treaty practice starts with Mexico\u2019s proprietary Model of Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement, which in its Art. 2 provides a list of investments, and specifically extends protection to \"any other right *in rem*, such as mortgages\"218:\n\n\"[...] immovable property, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or business purposes, as well as any other right *in rem*, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights\".\n\n*See* Carlos Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, *The Mexican Model of Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. \u00bfHay algo nuevo bajo el sol?*, in Jorge A. Vargas, *Mexican Law: A Treatise for Legal Practitioners and International Investors*, Vol. 4, West Group, 2001, p. 68, Exh. CLA-129.\n\n240.\n\nThere are at least 22 BITs signed by Mexico, which follow the same structure, and confirm that in Mexico\u2019s understanding *hipotecas* (mortgages) fall within the category of *bienes inmuebles intangibles*219. The first was the BIT between Mexico and Spain, executed back in 1995, whose Art. 1 (4) (e) extended protection to\n\n\"*la propiedad de bienes muebles o inmuebles, as\u00ed como hipotecas, derechos de prenda, usufructos u otra propiedad tangible o intangible [...] adquiridos para actividades econ\u00f3micas u otros fines empresariales*\".\n\n*See* a list in Claimant\u2019s presentation at its opening argument, p. 12.\n\n241.\n\nThe language of the Treaty shows that, in Mexico\u2019s understanding, *hipotecas* form part of the general category of \"*propiedad intangible*\" and, more specifically, of \"*propiedad intangible de bienes inmuebles*\".\n\n242.\n\nThere are good reasons why mortgages should constitute a category of protected investment of their own. Mortgages are also inextricably linked with the piece of real estate that they burden. And the value of this right *in rem* can be affected by measures adopted by the host state, targeted at such piece of real estate (e.g., expropriation) or specifically at the mortgage (e.g., dilution of preference). The purpose of treaties, when they include mortgages among the protected assets, is to extend the scope of protection to this type of situations.\n\n243.\n\nSumming up : the Mortgages - i.e. the *derechos reales de garant\u00eda* - granted to Lion, meet the two conditions required by Art. 1139(g) to qualify as investments protected by the NAFTA.\n\n**B. Mexico\u2019s counter-arguments considered**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nMexico raises several counter-arguments.\n\n245.\n\nFirst, Mexico says that Claimant did not invest in mortgages; the only economically relevant transaction was the granting of three short-term Loans220. The Mortgages in this case are accessory to and form an integral part of the Loans, and the definition of \"loans\" in paragraph (d) including loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans have a maturity date of less than three years, they do not constitute investments221.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 90-93.\n\nHT, Day 1, 27:14 - 28:18.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced.\n\n247.\n\nLion provided funds to Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital, and in exchange obtained two sets of rights:\n\n- personal rights against the borrowers deriving from the Credit Agreements (and the Notes), plus\n\n- rights *in rem* (*derechos reales*) over certain real estate assets located in Jalisco and Nayarit.\n\n248.\n\nArt. 1139 NAFTA does not define \"investment\" as an abstract notion. It simply states that \"investment means\" one of eight categories of assets or \"interests\", each defined in a separate paragraph, and each subject to specific requirements. The technique followed by Art. 1139 has an important implication: to be considered as a protected investment, an asset or interest must meet the requirements of one of the eight categories. If an investor holds several interests, and all qualify under different paragraphs of Art. 1139, each interest will be protected. And if some of these interests meet the requirements, and others do not, those compliant will still enjoy protection: an investor cannot be denied protection for compliant interests simply because he or she also holds non-compliant assets.\n\n249.\n\nIn the present case, Lion holds three interests that fall into two categories:\n\n- Credit Agreements and Notes: these interests are not protected, because the Notes do not fall under paragraph (h) (as already explained) and under paragraph (d) loans to unaffiliated borrowers require a minimum maturity of three years - a condition which is not met;\n\n- Mortgages: in accordance with municipal law, mortgages constitute \"intangible real estate\"; under paragraph (g), \"intangible real estate\" is protected, provided that the asset was acquired for economic benefit or business purposes - a requirement that Lion does comply with.\n\n250.\n\nArt. 1139 NAFTA does not provide that an investor holding distinct interests, some of which individually qualify as a protected investment while others fail, should be denied protection, simply because one or more assets fail the test. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason to deny protection to the Mortgages under paragraph (g), simply because its Credit Agreements and Notes fall short of the standards under paragraphs (d) and (h).\n\n251.\n\nMexico has tried to circumvent this conclusion, arguing that the Mortgages are ancillary transactions, and that Loans and Mortgages must be considered as one and the same transaction.\n\n252.\n\nContrary to Mexico\u2019s submission, the Mortgages, albeit ancillary, are not and never were integral parts of the Loans. Loans and Mortgages resulted from separate declarations of consent, made by different persons, at different times, and in different documents:\n\n- The Loans were formalized in the Credit Agreements, the contracts in which Lion consented to lend and the Borrowers undertook to repay principal and interest; while\n\n- The Mortgages were created thereafter, in three separate notarial deeds, in which the mortgagors unilaterally consented to the encumbrance of their property as a security for the Loans.\n\n253.\n\nFrom an economics point of view, there is also no identity between Loans and Mortgages: the value of the Loans is the dependent on the borrowers\u2019 solvency and capacity to pay, while the value of the Mortgages hinges on the price which the encumbered real estate will attain in a public auction and on the legal preference afforded to the mortgagee.\n\n254.\n\nSecond, Mexico adds that a mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never delivered to or owned by the creditor; the mortgage only confers a preferential right to the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property. Mexico concludes that mortgages are not \"real estate or other property\" under paragraph (g)222.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 121-150.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with Mexico that mortgages are indeed security rights in real estate, and that possession of the asset does not pass to the mortgagee. But Mexico\u2019s suggested consequence is a *non sequitur*.\n\n256.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already explained, under municipal law mortgages are considered *derechos reales*, which by law constitute *bienes inmuebles intangibles*, and Art. 1139(g) expressly extends protection to this category of assets. The ordinary meaning of \"intangible real estate\" in paragraph (g), which the Tribunal has established by applying Mexico\u2019s own municipal law, does not support, but rather contradicts, Mexico\u2019s argument that mortgages are to be excluded.\n\n257.\n\nFinally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow protection of any loan (regardless of its maturity) by just adding a security - a result said to be contrary to the intention of the NAFTA signatories223.\n\nHT, Day 1, 29:14 - 33:2.\n\n258.\n\nMexico\u2019s counter-argument is based on a misconception: the Respondent assumes that, if the mortgage constitutes a protected investment, the protection is automatically extended to the loan. This is not so.\n\n259.\n\nLoan and mortgage constitute separate categories of interests, with separate sets of requirements to become protected investments. This implies that in certain situations the mortgage may constitute a protected investment, while the underlying loan will not. In those cases, the Treaty protection afforded to the mortgage is not extended to the loan. The scope of protection which the investor enjoys, will depend on the measures adopted by the host state in breach of the Treaty. If such measures affect the mortgage or the encumbered real estate asset, the investor will be entitled to invoke NAFTA protection. If the measures target the loan, no such protection will be forthcoming. To provide a simple example: an investor holding a mortgage, which secures an underlying loan that does not meet the three-year maturity requirement, is protected against an improper expropriation of the real estate, which destroys the value of the mortgage224 - but not for a measure which specifically targets the transfer of funds deriving from loans225.\n\nIn breach of Art. 1110 NAFTA.\n\nE.g., a breach of the right to transfer under Art. 1109 NAFTA.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n260.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief226:\n\n\"140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection and declaring that the Mortgages and Notes are indeed investments under NAFTA Article 1139; and, consequently that it has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims brought by the Claimant; thus ordering the proceedings to continue and the Respondent to file the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial in the period remaining, according with the Amended Timetable.\"\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 140.\n\n261.\n\nMexico ended its Reply on Jurisdiction with the following request227:\n\n*\"152.

Lion was created and is managed by Clarion Partners, L.P. [\"**Clarion**\"], a real estate investment management company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real estate investments for institutional investors14.\n\nExh. C-32.\n\n57.\n\nLion had been making investments in Mexico for over ten years. Over that period, Lion had provided more than US $800 million of capital to entities doing business in Mexico, to be used in developing a wide array of real estate properties, such as hotels, office buildings, residences, warehouses, and resorts15. Wishing to develop further investment opportunities in Mexico, Clarion engaged a specialized broker, and through this channel Sr. H\u00e9ctor C\u00e1rdenas Curiel [\"**Sr. C\u00e1rdenas**\"], a Mexican businessman, was introduced16. Sr. C\u00e1rdenas was presented as a developer seeking funding for the development of two significant real estate projects: the \"**Nayarit Project**\" and the \"**Guadalajara Project**\".\n\nCM, para. 6.\n\nArechederra, para. 9.\n\n**1.1** **S****r****.

However, the preliminary inquiries did not extend to C\u00e1rdenas's father-in-law, a Sr. Garsin, a person with a \"big banking relationship at Bansi Bank18\" and apparently a powerful figure in the State of Jalisco, who also became involved in the project.\n\nHendricks, para. 8.\n\nHT, p. 497.\n\n59.\n\nThe Nayarit Project included an ocean-front residential and resort development in Bah\u00eda de Banderas, State of Nayarit19. The development plan called for a mixed-use high-end resort to be anchored by a Ritz Carlton hotel, 1,500 luxury residential units, extensive amenity offerings, and two ocean-front golf courses, to be developed on 855 hectares (2,100 acres) with 2.8 miles of ocean frontage20.\n\nHendricks, para. 7.\n\nExh.

C-35 and Exh. C-36.\n\n61.\n\nSr. C\u00e1rdenas's plans for the development of the Nayarit and the Guadalajara Projects were preliminary and incomplete at the time he requested capital from Lion to acquire land and begin limited infrastructure development23. Lion was willing to provide capital for the development of these projects subject to certain requirements, accepted by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, including the following:\n\n\"- The granting of mortgages to Lion over the land acquired by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and on the subsequent improvements made on that land24; and\"\n\n- The issuance of promissory notes as unconditional commitments to repay the money owed to Lion, with certain procedural privileges under Mexican law25.\n\nHendricks, para. 9 and CI, paras. 17 and 18.\n\nExh.

C-35.\n\nHendricks, para. 9.\n\n**1.2** **T****he three sets of transactions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn February, June and September 2007, Lion made three loans for financing the purchase of the properties for the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project [the \"**Loans**\"], as well as working capital.\n\n**A.** **The first set of transactions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe first loan took the form of a \"Credit Agreement\" between Lion (as Lender), Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. [\"**Inmobiliaria Bains**\"] (as Borrower) and C&C Ingenier\u00eda, S.A. de C.V. [\"**C&C Ingenier\u00eda**\"] as joint and several obligor -Inmobiliaria Bains and C&C Ingenier\u00eda were two companies owned by C\u00e1rdenas. The first loan was signed on February 28, 2007 and had a term of 18 months. Its original due date was August 28, 2008. The loan was for the amount of US $15,000,000, which accrued ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [the \"**First Loan**\"]26.\n\nExh. C-8.\n\n64.\n\nThe Credit Agreement was written in English and governed by the laws of Mexico27.\n\nExh.

All subsequent versions of the First Note were issued in a single promissory note for US$15 million.\n\n68.\n\nThe First Note (as would the other two) was issued under Mexican law, drafted both in English and Spanish (with the Spanish version governing) and submitted to the exclusive and irrevocable jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico City.\n\nThe Nayarit Mortgage\n--------------------\n\n69.\n\nAbout one year after the signing of the Credit Agreement, on April 2, 2008, Inmobiliaria Bains granted in favor of Lion the \"**Nayarit Mortgage**\" over the Nayarit Project property, located in the Municipality of Bah\u00eda de Banderas29.\n\nExh.

While on February 28, 2007, the mortgage only secured the First Loan, it was subsequently replaced to also cover the Second Loan (on June 13, 2007) and Third Loan (on April 2, 2008), respectively, Protocol Mortgage No. 92.496 of April 2, 2008, recorded under Book 285, section II, A-13 of the Public Property and Commercial Registry of Bucer\u00edas, Nayarit on May 19, 2008 / April 2, 2008. *See* Exh.

It was granted on June 13, 2007, the date of execution of the Credit Agreement, by Bansi S.A., as trustee, as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as founder and beneficiary of the trust, in favor of Lion, over one of the properties pertaining to the Guadalajara Project36.\n\nExh.

It was signed on September 26, 2007 and had a term of 90 calendar days. Its original due date was December 26, 2007. The loan was for the amount of US $5,355,479, which accrued ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and in the event of default, an interest rate of 25% [the \"**Third Loan**\"]37.\n\nExh. C-152, which contains the signature of Lion and the correct original \"Due Date\" of 90 days at Clause 1.1(7) complements Exh. C-16.

It was granted on the day of execution of the Credit Agreement, September 26, 2007, by Bansi S.A., as trustee, as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as founder and beneficiary of the trust, in favor of Lion, over one of the properties pertaining to the Guadalajara Project41.\n\nExh.

Sr. C\u00e1rdenas requested and obtained a series of time extensions: from March 2008 through July 2009 Lion signed maturity date extensions on the First Loan four times42, on the Second Loan seven times43, and on the Third Loan six times44.\n\nExh.

C****\u00e1rdenas**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nLion initiated negotiations and held meetings with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, trying to find an amicable solution to the breach and to avoid initiating formal foreclosure proceedings52. Between September and December 2011 Lion and a representative of C\u00e1rdenas discussed the restructuring of the debt according to a term sheet. Such proposal never contemplated the cancellation of the Mortgages, nor the possibility that Lion become a shareholder in C\u00e1rdenas's companies53. A restructuring term sheet was eventually signed by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas in October 2011 on behalf of the borrowers under the three Loan Agreements [the \"**Debtors**\"], but was not accepted by Lion, as it did not adhere to all the requirements advocated by Lion in the negotiations54.\n\nCM, para. 28.\n\nExh. C-43.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n92.\n\nThe discussions continued until February 2012, without Lion and Sr. C\u00e1rdenas reaching an agreement55. On February 17, 2012 Lion took a first step towards the enforcement of the Mortgages: it served the Debtors with a formal request demanding payment of the amounts owed plus interest, under penalty of initiating foreclosure actions56.\n\nCM, para. 31. In fact, Lion claims that negotiations continued as far as until December 2012, CM, para. 32.\n\nExh. C-45.\n\n**4.** **T****he** **C****ancellation** **L****awsuit**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, unbeknown to Lion, which was still engaged in *bona fide* negotiations with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas57, the Debtors filed a fraudulent lawsuit [the \"**Cancellation Lawsuit**\", the proceeding will be referred to as the \"**Cancellation Proceeding**\"] against Lion before the *Juez Noveno de lo Mercantil* of the State of Jalisco [the ***\"Juez de lo Mercantil****].*\n\nCM, paras. 31-33, Exh. C-43.\n\n94.\n\nUnder the applicable State laws, mortgages registered in the *Registro P\u00fablico* can be cancelled through a judgement issued by a competent judge58. The Cancellation Lawsuit was the first step in a complex judicial fraud schemed by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas to avoid the imminent foreclosure of the Mortgages. It is clear that Sr. C\u00e1rdenas organised this fraudulent scheme because:\n\n\"- He was the person who controlled the Debtors and the beneficiary of the cancellation of the Mortgages;\"\n\n\"- The fraud purported to transfer jurisdiction over the Mortgages from the Courts of Mexico DF to the Courts of Jalisco, precisely where Sr. C\u00e1rdenas resided and was well-established;\"\n\n\"- The scheme required the designation of a false address for the service of Lion, and the collaboration of a person at the false address; this role was fulfilled by a lawyer called Lic. Jos\u00e9 Isaac L\u00f3pez Medina, who appeared to be an associate of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas;\"\n\n\"- The fraudulent scheme eventually required the impersonation of a representative of Lion (Sr. Jos\u00e9 Javier Tovar Arechederra). This was achieved using a copy of Sr. Arechederra's driving licence on the same date that the driving licence was deposited with security at the venue of the meeting organized by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas;\"\n\n- The Tribunal finally notes that Mexico, while refusing to outright admit that fraud had indeed been perpetrated by the Debtors, argues that the \"alleged multi-level fraud\" was so complex and sophisticated that its judicial system could not withstand it59.\n\nCC Jalisco, Art. 2581, CC Nayarit, Art. 2312, discussed in Zamora II, para. 175, footnote 156.\n\nRR, para. 230.\n\n95.\n\nThe objective of the first part of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's fraudulent scheme was to obtain a judgement, register it in the *Registros P\u00fablicos,* and thus legally extinguish the Mortgages, making any foreclosure impossible. The second part of the fraudulent scheme was then to preclude any possibility for Lion to file an *amparo* procedure, which would have rectified the previous cancellation of the mortgages. The fraudulent scheme required an impressive knowledge of the intricacies of the Mexican procedural system, suggesting that Sr. C\u00e1rdenas was assisted by an experienced legal mastermind.\n\n**4.1** **J****udicial enforcement of the** **(****false****)** ***T******\u00e9rminos***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAs a first step, the Debtors approached their local *Juez de lo Mercantil* in Jalisco and requested judicial enforcement of a settlement contract, presented only in the form of a photocopy, titled *\"T\u00e9rminos para pago de los contratos de cr\u00e9dito\"* [the ***\"T\u00e9rminos\"***]and allegedly executed four months before, on November 14, 2011, between Lion and the Debtors60.\n\nExh. C-56, p. 4.\n\n97.\n\nThe Debtors' prayer for relief in the Cancellation Lawsuit reads as follows:\n\n\"PRESTACIONES\n\nA) *Por la DECLARACION JUDICIAL que se haga por parte de su Se\u00f1or\u00eda en el sentido de que la demandada \"LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, L.P.\"* *est\u00e1 obligada al CUMPLIMIENTO CABAL de todas las obligaciones que asumi\u00f3 y que dimanan a su cargo del documento base de la acci\u00f3n que las partes denominamos \"TERMINOS PARA PAGO DE LOS CONTRATOS DE CREDITO**\"\"* [Emphasis added]\n\n98.\n\nThe Debtors were thus seeking a judicial order granting specific enforcement of the obligations purportedly assumed by Lion in the *T\u00e9rminos*: under what seemed to be the terms of this agreement, Lion had accepted the cancellation of all pending debts against the Debtors, the cancellation of the Mortgages securing such debt in the *Registro P\u00fablico*, and the return of the Notes to the Debtors, and in exchange the Debtors had undertaken to issue and to deliver to Lion a participation in Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's companies61.\n\nExh. C-53, p. 7.\n\n99.\n\nThe Debtors now alleged that Lion had defaulted on the obligations assumed in the *T\u00e9rminos* and requested the *Juez de lo Mercantil* to order specific performance, resulting in the cancellation of the Mortgages in the *Registro P\u00fablico*.\n\n100.\n\nThe *T\u00e9rminos* included two further important elements of legal engineering:\n\n101.\n\nFirst, the *T\u00e9rminos* purported to contain a clause awarding jurisdiction to the Courts of Jalisco. While all the Promissory Notes attributed jurisdiction to the Courts of Mexico City, far away from Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's main place of business, the *T\u00e9rminos* granted jurisdiction to the Courts of Jalisco62:\n\n\"**8. Jurisdicci\u00f3n y Competencia** Para la interpretaci\u00f3n, cumplimiento y ejecuci\u00f3n del presente convenio [...] las partes se someten [...] a los Tribunales del Primer Partido Judicial del Estado de Jalisco, renunciando a cualquier otro fuero o jurisdicci\u00f3n que por raz\u00f3n de convenio previo o domicilio actual o futuro pudiese corresponderles\".\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n102.\n\nSecond, the *T\u00e9rminos* included an address for service of process in Jalisco and the name of a process agent. While the Loans provided 3141 Hood Street, Suite 700 Dallas, Texas 7521963 as Lion's address, with a copy to an address in Mexico at Paseo de los Tamarindos 400-B, Piso 8, Bosque de las Lomas, 05120 Mexico, D.F.64, oddly the *T\u00e9rminos* identified a Jalisco lawyer65 and an address in Jalisco66:\n\n\"**7. Domicilio para recibir notificaciones y autorizados** [Lion] se\u00f1ala como domicilio para recibir cualquier tipo de comunicaci\u00f3n relativa a la presente propuesta y notificaciones el de la finca marcada con el n\u00famero 95 Despacho 7 de la calle Tom\u00e1s V. G\u00f3mez, Colonia Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, en el municipio de Guadalajara, Jalisco y como autorizados para recibirlas y acusar recibo de las mismas a los Licenciados Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez de Castilla del Valle y Jose Isaac L\u00f3pez Medina\".\n\nExh. C-08, p. 15, Exh. C-12, p.16 and Exh. C-16, pp. 15-16.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nClaimant's expert witness confirmed, when asked by the President at the Hearing, that it is not a usual practice in Mexico to enumerate persons authorized to receive communications by name, rather than referring to addresses only, see HT, pp. 546-547. In this case, the *T\u00e9rminos* provide the name of a well-known M\u00e9xico DF lawyer (Gonz\u00e1lez de Castilla), who did not participate in the scheme, and whose name was inserted to give credibility to the clause, and of a Jalisco lawyer (L\u00f3pez Medina), who actually received the notifications, never informed Lion of such fact and who seems to have acted as C\u00e1rdenas's straw man.\n\nExh. C-53, p. 7.\n\n**4.2** **T****he** ***T******\u00e9rminos*** **document is a forgery**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that the *T\u00e9rminos* are in fact a forgery [and will refer to the document frequently as the \"**Forged Settlement Agreement**\" or \"**Forged Agreement**\"]. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following evidence compelling:\n\n\"- The Forged Agreement purports to have been signed by Lion's legal representative in Mexico, Mr. James Christian Hendricks67; Mr. Hendricks appeared as a witness in this procedure, and gave sworn evidence that he never signed the document and that the signature appended to the document (shown below) is false68;\"\n\n\"- Lic. Gonz\u00e1lez de Castilla, the other lawyer allegedly designated by Lion as a person authorized to receive notifications in the *T\u00e9rminos,* and a well-known and highly respected professional, has declared in the presence of a Public Notary that: (i) he was not authorized by Lion or by any other company to receive any notification in Guadalajara; (ii) he did not know the said address nor the other person allegedly authorized; and (iii) he had no professional dealings in Guadalajara69;\"\n\n\"- Since the very moment that Lion obtained knowledge of the existence of the Forged Agreement in mid-December 201270, it has consistently averred that the document is a forgery; Lion has repeated the averment in this procedure71;\"\n\n\" - Lion has repeatedly tried to obtain a declaration from the Mexican civil Courts, confirming the forgery of the *T\u00e9rminos*72; although the Mexican civil Courts have never rendered a judgement confirming the existence of forgery, Claimant says that such refusal is improper and tainted by denial of justice;\"\n\n- Upon gaining knowledge of the *T\u00e9rminos,* Lion initiated criminal actions against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas73, some of which were ongoing at the time of the filing of Post-Hearing Briefs74.\n\n\"- The Forged Agreement purports to formalize a settlement, in which Lion agrees to cancel the Loans, the Notes and the Mortgages in exchange for a participation in Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's companies; there is no contemporary evidence proving that in the negotiations between Lion and Sr. C\u00e1rdenas such solution was ever discussed; to the contrary, the evidentiary record shows that Lion's intention during the negotiation was to obtain repayment of the Loans, and if the negotiation failed, to foreclose on the Mortgages75;\"\n\n\"- It is unlikely that Lion, a well advised Canadian company, which had insisted that in its previous agreements with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and his companies jurisdiction should lie with the Courts of Mexico City, would accept that the *T\u00e9rminos,* the settlement agreement finalizing the relationship, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Jalisco; it is even more unlikely that Lion additionally would have consented to designate an obscure lawyer in Jalisco, related to C\u00e1rdenas, and with whom Lion had never had relations, as its process agent, authorized to receive all types of notifications;\"\n\n- There is a final argument: confronted with Claimant's averment in the present arbitration that the Forged Settlement indeed is a forgery, Mexico has failed to dispute this statement76.\n\nExh.

The service attempt was done on Lic. Jos\u00e9 Isaac L\u00f3pez Medina77, one of the two lawyers identified in the Forged Agreement78, who apparently had his office at that address.\n\nExh. C-52.\n\nExh. C-53.\n\n105.\n\nConfronted by the *actuario,* Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina formally declared that no legal representative of Lion was present in his office in order to receive the *emplazamiento*. Upon receipt of this representation, the *actuario* withdrew, announcing that he would return the next day.\n\n106.\n\nAt the second visit, which occurred next day, the *actuario* decided to make the *emplazamiento* against Lion through a *notificaci\u00f3n por c\u00e9dula* delivered to the person who was at the address, Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina79.\n\nExhs. C-52 and C-52, CR, paras. 95-96.\n\n107.\n\nLic. L\u00f3pez Medina accepted the *emplazamiento* and received a copy of the judicial file (\"*autos\"*).\n\n108.\n\nBeing unaware that a Court procedure against it was pending before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* of Jalisco, Lion inevitably failed to appear within the statutory time-limit.\n\n109.\n\nThe consequence of this failure was that six weeks thereafter, on May 22, 2012, Lion was declared *en rebeld\u00eda* by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* through notification via *bolet\u00edn judicial80* (a judicial bulletin)81.\n\nExh. C-73.\n\nClaimant's expert explains that while the Commerce Code as well Mexico's procedural codes and statutes provide for different methods of *emplazamiento,* including through *bolet\u00edn judicial* and *estrados,* for the initial notification of a defendant, only personal service is legally accepted, see Zamora I, para. 142 and footnotes therein. This is not disputed by Mexico.\n\n110.\n\nTwo weeks after the declaration *en rebeld\u00eda*, on June 6, 2012 the Debtors submitted their evidence before the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, including the Mortgage deeds and Minutes of the General Shareholders Meeting of C&C Capital. All the evidence marshalled by the Debtors was admitted six days later, on June 12, 201282.\n\nExh. C-57.8.\n\n**4.4** **T****he** **J****udgment of the** ***J******uez de lo*** ***M******ercantil***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nJust two weeks after the submission of evidence, on June 27, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, acting solely on the basis of the evidence marshalled by the Debtors, and without any participation of Lion, declared the Loans settled and ordered Lion to cancel the Mortgages and return the Notes [the \"**Cancellation Judgment**\"]83. From the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the rendering of the Cancellation Judgment, only 170 days had lapsed.\n\nExh. C-78, pp. 53-54.\n\nThe Cancellation Judgement *causa estado*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nA few days thereafter, on August 8, 2012, and at the request of the Debtors, the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* declared that the Cancellation Judgement *\"causa estado por ministerio de la ley\",* i.e. that it has become *res iudicata,* there being no possibility of submitting a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n.* The reason given by the Judge for his decision precluding any further appeal was that the amount claimed in the procedure was less than MEX 500,000 (approximately USD 25,000)84.\n\nExh. C-79 *\"Causar estado\",* pursuant to the definition under CLA-216.\n\n113.\n\nThe decision is difficult to understand, because the principal amount of the Loans settled and Mortgages terminated amounted to tens of millions of dollars. Be that as it may, the decision was highly relevant, because it deprived Lion of any possibility of launching an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation Judgement.\n\nThe Cancellation Judgement is enforced\n--------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nIn a subsequent procedural decision, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* gave Lion a peremptory term of three days to voluntarily comply with the Cancellation Judgement85. Lion, who was still unaware of the Cancellation Proceeding, failed to comply and on August 30, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil* ordered the *Registro P\u00fablico* of Jalisco to cancel the Guadalajara Mortgages86 and that of Nayarit to do the same with the Nayarit Mortgage87.\n\nExh. C-79.\n\nExh. C-84.\n\nThis was done through a request for assistance of the 1st Civil Judge in Bucer\u00edas, Nayarit to send a following request for cancellation to the *Registro P\u00fablico* in Nayarit.; Exh. C-86.\n\n115.\n\nThe *Registro P\u00fablico* of Jalisco did so on September 7, 201288. The cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage was recorded on October 19, 201289. Upon these registrations, all three Mortgages became extinct for all legal purposes.\n\nExh. C-85.\n\n*Registro P\u00fablico* in Nayarit informs about cancellation, 19 October 2012, Exh. C-88.\n\n**5.** **F****alse** ***A******mparo*** **P****roceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Debtors' scheme did not end here.\n\n117.\n\nHaving orchestrated the cancellation of the Mortgages, the Debtors wanted to ensure that Lion, upon being appraised of the Cancellation Judgment, would encounter considerable procedural obstacles in seeking to reverse such decision.\n\n118.\n\n*Pro memoria*: Lion had already been deprived of any possibility of appeal against the Cancellation Judgement, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* having decided, upon the request of the Debtors, that the amount in dispute was less than MEX 500,000 and that as a consequence thereof the respondent was not entitled to appeal.\n\n119.\n\nThe Debtors, well advised on the intricacies of the Mexican procedural system, were aware that the other viable avenue for reversal of the Cancellation Judgment required Lion to initiate an *Amparo* procedure. As explained by Claimant's legal expert, a *juicio de Amparo* is a general challenge procedure governed by the *Ley de Amparo*, which seeks to revert violations of human rights as afforded to citizens and aliens under Mexico's Constitution90.\n\nZamora I, para. 79.\n\n120.\n\nThe Debtors developed a further fraudulent scheme to disrupt the eventual *Amparo* to be filed in due course by Lion. The scheme would develop in two stages, which were to occur before Lion became aware of the Cancellation Judgment (and filed a real *Amparo*):\n\n\"- in the first stage, a person falsely alleging to be a legal representative of Lion would present a request for *Amparo* purporting to act on behalf of Lion; and\"\n\n- in the second, that person would abandon the *Amparo.*\n\n121.\n\nThe purpose of this scheme was to prevent Lion, when it eventually obtained knowledge of what had happened, from presenting a proper *Amparo:* Art. 73 of the *Ley de Amparo* provides a list of eighteen causes for the finding of inadmissibility of an *Amparo*, including when an *Amparo* is based on the same facts as a previously abandoned one91. Under this rule, Lion's proper *Amparo* would be inadmissible, because a previous *Amparo* relating to the same facts, had already been submitted and then abandoned. To revert this inadmissibility finding, Lion would have to prove that the person who had submitted and then abandoned the False *Amparo,* purporting to be a representative of Lion, was in fact not authorized by Lion to act on its behalf - an endeavour fraught with difficulties which in the actual facts proved impossible.\n\nZamora I-004, Ley de Amparo, Article 73, fracciones III and IX - \"El juicio de amparo es improcedente: [...]III.- Contra leyes o actos que sean materia de otro juicio de amparo que se encuentre pendiente de resoluci\u00f3n, ya sea en primera o \u00fanica instancia, o en revisi\u00f3n, promovido por el mismo quejoso, contra las mismas autoridades y por el propio acto reclamado, aunque las violaciones constitucionales sean diversas; IX.-Contra actos consumados de un modo irreparable\".\n\n122.\n\nIn order to file an *Amparo* falsely in the name of Lion, the Debtors needed to gain access to a copy of the case file, which in turn could only be obtained by a person holding a power of attorney. Sr. C\u00e1rdenas knew from the documents which accompanied one of Lion's requests for payment, that a certain Sr. Jos\u00e9 Javier Tovar Arechederra was one of Lion's representatives in Mexico. All that was needed was to impersonate Sr. Arechederra.\n\n**5.1** **T****he impersonation of** **S****r****. A****rechederra**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn the same day when the Cancellation Judgment was issued, someone impersonating Mr. Arechederra went to a Notary in Jalisco to obtain a copy of the power of attorney granted to the real Mr. Arechederra92.\n\n[Two years later this Notary Public would be arrested on charges of fraud and forgery of documents, subsequently fined and suspended as a Notary Public and eventually permanently disbarred by the State of Jalisco93]\n\nCM, paras. 75-77.\n\nCR, para. 130, CM, para. 78.\n\n124.\n\nThe plan was not yet fully completed. Sr. C\u00e1rdenas still required a document confirming the impostor's identity as Sr. Arechederra. On July 6, 2012, Sr. C\u00e1rdenas summoned the real Sr. Arechederra to a meeting in Jalisco (the city where the *Juez de lo Mercantil* is located)94. Sr. Arechederra left his driver's license at the security control of the building where the meeting took place95.\n\nCM, para. 67.\n\nArechederra I, para 16.\n\n125.\n\nOn the same day, July 6, 2012, an impostor using the same driver's license96 to identify himself as Sr. Arechederra, filed with the *Juez de lo Mercantil* a request for a certified copy of the entire case file97, on behalf of Lion, exhibiting the power of attorney obtained from the Notary98.\n\nExh. C-58, p. 4.\n\nExh. C-58.\n\nExh. C-77.\n\n126.\n\nWith the copy of the case file, on August 7, 2012 an *Amparo* against the Cancellation Judgment, purportedly signed by Sr. Arechederra on behalf of Lion, was submitted at the Jalisco Courts [the \"**False** ***Amparo\"***]99.\n\nExh. C-64.\n\n**5.2** **T****he** **F****alse** ***A******mparo***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that Sr. Arechederra never actually signed the False *Amparo* on behalf of Lion. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following evidence compelling:\n\n\"- Sr. Arechederra corroborated by his sworn testimony at the Hearing that he never carried out any of the above actions100;\"\n\n\"- Sr. Arechederra's stamp signature under the False Request for Copies contains a typographical mistake (A**rr**echede**r**a instead of Arechederra)101 - it is unlikely that the real Sr. Arechederra would be using a stamp signature containing not one but two typos in his name;\"\n\n\"- Mr. Arechederra has submitted a voucher from the airport102 confirming that it would have been physically impossible for him to file the request for the certified copy, obtain it, sign its receipt, and make it to the airport within an hour103;\"\n\n\"- The False *Amparo* designated as domicile for notifications to Lion *\"los estrados del Juzgado que en turno conozca de la presente demanda*104*\",* i.e, the notice board of the competent Court which would judge the False *Amparo;* and not the address of Lion's lawyers, as was the case in the Loans105 when an address in Mexico was given for Lion;\"\n\n- Lastly, Mexico has not denied that the False Amparo was filed by someone else than the real Sr. Arechederra.\n\nArechederra I, paras. 21 and 31; Exh. C-115. Ms. Payne explained that Jos\u00e9 Arechederra did not sign either the request for copies of the Cancellation Lawsuit file dated 6 July 2012 or the False Amparo.\n\nExh. C-58, p.3, see *infra.*\n\nExh. C-59; Exh. C-60.\n\nCM, para. 69.\n\nExh. C-64*,* p. 2.\n\nExh. C-08, p. 15, Exh. C-12, p.16 and Exh. C-16, pp. 15-16.\n\n128.\n\nThe False *Amparo* was (on purpose) filed with a procedural deficiency: the person submitting the request failed to attach sufficient copies as required under Mexican procedural law106. The *Juez* in charge of the *Amparo* notified Lion of this mistake (through the *estrados)* granting Lion three days to remedy the deficiency107.\n\n[The possibility of amending this procedural deficiency is noteworthy, as it contrasts with the treatment given to the real Lion, when it filed the proper *Amparo:* it was never granted an opportunity to cure an alleged defect in the power of attorney of the person signing an *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda.*]\n\nCM, para. 84.\n\nExh. C-65.\n\n129.\n\nThe very purpose of the False *Amparo* was to be filed and then to be abandoned. Consequently, no copies were ever delivered, and the procedural deficiency was never corrected. Consequently, on August 17, 2012, the *Juez* dismissed the False *Amparo*108 and on September 6, 2012 declared this decision to be final and not subject to appeal109.\n\nExh. C-66.\n\nExh. C-67.\n\n130.\n\nThe effects came to haunt Lion when it eventually filed the proper *Amparo*.\n\n**6.** **L****ion forecloses on the** **(****soon to be cancelled****) N****ayarit** **M****ortgage**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nIn the meantime, Lion was still unaware that the Debtors had filed the Cancellation Lawsuit in the local Courts of Jalisco, seeking enforcement of a Forged Settlement Agreement, that the *emplazamiento* had been delivered to an obscure lawyer in Jalisco, that Lion had been declared *en rebeld\u00eda* and that the Cancellation Judgement had been rendered in favour of the Debtors, cancelling the outstanding Loans and Mortgages.\n\n132.\n\nLion continued its *bona fide* negotiations with C\u00e1rdenas, but in view of the persistence of the default, on April 3, 2012 Lion finally decided to foreclose, but only on one of the three Mortgages: it initiated a *juicio especial hipotecario* [the ***\"Juicio Hipotecario***]110 before the *Juez Trig\u00e9simo Noveno de lo Civil de M\u00e9xico D.F.* [the *\"****Juez de lo Civil***\"]111, against the Debtors, seeking to enforce the Nayarit Mortgage. Lion decided not to foreclose on the Guadalajara Mortgage, trying to minimize costs and with the hope that filing one foreclosure proceeding would incentivize Sr. C\u00e1rdenas to pay the outstanding amounts112.\n\nExh. C-44.\n\nExh. C-46.\n\nCM, para. 35.\n\nDifficulties in the *emplazamiento*\n-----------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe attempts to notify the *Juicio Hipotecario* to the various Debtors commenced on April 26, 2012, but it would take several years until all the mortgagors could be properly served *(emplazados)*113 Lion requested the *Juez de lo Civil* to serve Inmobiliaria Bains 13 times, providing nine different addresses in both Jalisco and Nayarit; the courts of Jalisco and Nayarit - acting at the request of the *Juez de lo Civil* - were unable to notify the company114 and this situation prevented the *Juicio Hipotecario* from progressing for more than three years115.\n\nCM, para. 38.\n\nExhs. C-47-50.\n\nCM, para.38\n\n*Anotaci\u00f3n preventiva*\n----------------------\n\n134.\n\nWhile Lion was trying to notify the *Juicio Hipotecario* to the Debtors, it requested and obtained an order from the *Juez de lo Civil* in M\u00e9xico D.F., instructing the *Registro P\u00fablico* in Bucer\u00edas to make a preventive annotation in the books setting forth the existence of a foreclosure procedure [the *\"****Anotaci\u00f3n Preventiva****\"*]*.* The Registrar did so on May 3, 2012 and added that this *Anotaci\u00f3n Preventiva* would guarantee the *\"inmovilidad registral\"* of the real estate, preventing any future annotation which could disrupt the proper development of the *Juicio Hipotecario*116:\n\n*\"[L]o anterior para efectos de que dicha inscripci\u00f3n sirva como inmovilidad registral con la finalidad de que no se pueda verificarse (sic) en la finca hipotecada ning\u00fan embargo, toma de posesi\u00f3n, diligencia precautoria o cualquier otra que entorpezca el curso del juicio\".*\n\nExh. C-157.\n\n135.\n\nThe *Anotaci\u00f3n Preventiva* was made on May 3, 2012, a month and a half before the Cancellation Judgment (dated June 27, 2012), and in theory prevented any future annotation which could disrupt the *Juicio Hipotecario.*\n\n136.\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, upon rendering the Cancellation Judgement, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* of Jalisco sent (through a local Court) an *oficio* to the *Registro P\u00fablico de Bucer\u00edas,* requesting cancellation of the Mortgage *(\"solicito a Usted, cancele la hipoteca\"*)117 The Registrar, disregarding the existence of the previous *Anotaci\u00f3n Preventiva,* registered the cancellation of the Mortgage in the *Registro P\u00fablico* on October 16, 2012, the security thus becoming null and void118:\n\nExh. C-87.\n\nExh. C- 157, pp. 4-5.\n\nGuadalajara Mortgages\n---------------------\n\n137.\n\nSince Lion had chosen only to enforce the Nayarit Mortgage, but not the Guadalajara Mortgage, no *Anotaci\u00f3n Preventiva* was ever issued in relation to the Guadalajara Mortgages, and the security was cancelled, upon an *oficio* of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* of Jalisco of August 30, 2012119.\n\nExh. C-84.\n\n**7.** **L****ion****'****s attempts to remedy the cancellation of the** **M****ortgages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn mid-December 2012 Lion was astonished to learn, through informal sources, of the cancellation of the Mortgages120.\n\nPayne I, para. 13, HT, pp. 486-487.\n\n139.\n\nLion immediately turned to trying to undo the cancellation.\n\n140.\n\nMexican procedural law allows for the institution of *Amparo* proceedings to overturn judicial decisions. There are two different types *of Amparo* procedures: *Amparo directo* and *Amparo indirecto*. The *Amparo directo* is most commonly filed against final judgments, and the *Amparo indirecto* against certain procedural orders, or against actions taken after the case ends or against persons who did not participate in proceedings121.\n\nZamora I, para. 85.\n\n141.\n\nThe *Amparo* claim has to be filed by the person affected by the act which is challenged (known as the *acto reclamado*). Other parties to the *Amparo* procedure are\n\n- the authorities who dictated, promulgated, published, ordered, executed or tried to execute the *acto reclamado* (*autoridades responsables*), and\n\n- the affected party's counterparty in the procedure in which the challenged action was issued or executed (known as the *tercero perjudicado*)122.\n\nZamora I, para. 82.\n\n**7.1** **L****ion files an** ***A******mparo indirecto***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOn December 18, 2012 Lion filed an *Amparo indirecto* lawsuit123 [\"**Real** ***Amparo\"****,* also *\"****Amparo*** **claim**\" and ***\"Amparo*** **lawsuit**\" (as opposed to the previous False Amparo)] before the *Juez de Distrito en Materia Civil* in Jalisco [\"***Juez de Distrito\"***]*.*\n\nExh. C-91.\n\n143.\n\nThe claim was brought against the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* against his Secretary and against the officers responsible for the *Registros P\u00fablicos* of Nayarit and Bucer\u00edas124. The Debtors were designated in the *Amparo* claim as *terceros perjudicados* (aggrieved third parties)125.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n144.\n\nThe *actos reclamados* included, among others, the lack of proper notification of Lion in the Cancellation Lawsuit:\n\n*\"La falta de emplazamiento al quejoso y todas y cada una de las actuaciones y resoluciones relativas al juicio Ordinario Mercantil radicado ante el Juzgado Mercantil del Primer Partido Judicial del Estado de Jalisco*\"126*.*\n\nExh. C-91, at p. 2.\n\n**7.2** **A****ttempts to claim forgery**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nInitially, Lion started the *Amparo indirecto* to obtain declaratory relief that it had never been properly served by the *Juez de lo Mercantil*. It did not include any reference to the Forged Settlement Agreement, because the specific content of the Forged Agreement only became known to Lion when the *Juez de lo Mercantil* filed an *informe* as part of the *Amparo* proceeding127.\n\nHT, p. 140; H1, p. 6: Exh. C-97, p. 4.\n\nThe *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda*\n---------------------------\n\n146.\n\nUpon receiving this information, on January 28, 2013 Lion filed an *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda* (extension request) of the *Amparo* lawsuit, explaining that the service made by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* was based on a forged document and should thus be deemed inexistent128:\n\n*\"La falta de emplazamiento legal a la hoy quejosa [i.e. Lion] [...] debido a que el supuesto emplazamiento [...] se hizo en un domicilio que no es de la hoy quejosa [...]. Am\u00e9n de que el supuesto domicilio donde de practic\u00f3 dicho emplazamiento,* *fue se\u00f1alado en un documento que no fue suscrito por mi mandante ni por persona alguna con facultades, ya que la firma que se advierte en el mismo es completamente falsa por no proceder del pu\u00f1o y letra a quien se atribuye**.\"* [Emphasis added]\n\nExh. C-97, p. 3.\n\n147.\n\nLion's forgery claim was accompanied by, *inter alia*129*:*\n\n- a graphological expert report to prove that the signature in the Forged Agreement did not belong to Mr. Hendricks, and\n\n- emails between a broker retained by Lion and Sr. C\u00e1rdenas to demonstrate that, after the Forged Agreement was supposedly signed in November 2011, Lion and C\u00e1rdenas were still holding discussions on the terms of the repayment of the Loans.\n\n148.\n\nBy *prove\u00eddo* (procedural decision) of January 30, 2013 [the \"**Dismissal** ***Prove\u00eddo\"***] the *Secretario del Juzgado de Distrito* [i.e. the clerk of the *Juez de Distrito]* in Jalisco dismissed the *ampliaci\u00f3n* of the *Amparo* submitted by Lion, arguing that130\n\n*\"dichos actos ya fueron precisados desde el escrito inicial de demanda\".*\n\nExh. C-103, p. 4.\n\n149.\n\nFrustrated by this postponement, Lion brought, on February 6, 2013, an *\"incidente de falsedad de documento\"* before the *Juez de Distrito,* claiming again that the Forged Agreement was the result of fraud131.\n\nExh. C-107.\n\n150.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the *Juez de Distrito* stated that he would decide in due course on the admissibility of the proposed graphological expertise on the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement132. And on April 19, 2013, the *Juez de Distrito* once again decided to postpone his decision on the admissibility of the evidence, because of a *queja* proceeding which was subsequently initiated and which will be dealt with in the next section133.\n\nExh. C-106, p. 10.\n\nExh. C-180, p. 2 *(\"se reserva a proveer lo que en derecho correspond\")**.*\n\n**7.3** **T****he dismissal of evidence on the forgery**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nWhile the decision on the admission of evidence was pending before the *Juez de Distrito*, one of the Debtors, C&C Ingenier\u00eda, filed as a *tercero perjudicado* two *quejas*134 before the *Segundo Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Civil del Tercer Circuito* [the *\"****Tribunal de Queja****\"*] against the Dismissal *Prove\u00eddo* issued by the Secretary of the Court135 and the April 10, 2013 decision of the *Juez de Distrito*136*.* C&C Ingenier\u00eda argued that Lion's *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* was inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on Lion's behalf.\n\nThe orders and judgments issued in *Amparo* proceedings are themselves subject to three different challenges: *revisi\u00f3n, queja* and *reclamation.* In an *Amparo indirecto,* such as the one file by Lion, the most common challenges are *queja* against different procedural orders (specifically those that cause irreparable harm) and *revision* against the *Juez de Distrito's* final judgment, both of which are decided by a *Tribunal Colegiado de Circuito,* referred to as *Tribunal de Queja,* see Zamora I, para. 87.\n\nExh. C-181.\n\nC&C Ingenier\u00eda's *queja,* No. 37/2013 against *Juez de Distrito's* decision of April 10, 2013, referenced under CM, p. 34, footnote 164 (but not included in the list of exhibits).\n\n152.\n\nLion for its part also submitted a *queja* against the same decision, because it precluded Lion from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement was a forgery and the origin of the improper service137.\n\nExh. C-182.\n\n153.\n\nThe *Tribunal de Queja* dismissed Lion's *queja* and sided with C&C Ingenier\u00eda: the appeal court ruled that the *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda*, which Lion had filed, was inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on behalf of Lion: it should have been signed by Lion's legal representative and not by the attorney empowered by Lion to act on its behalf in the *Amparo* proceedings138.\n\nRCM, para. 92, citing Exh. C-105, p. 3-4 and Exh. R-19.\n\n154.\n\nLion was not given an opportunity to cure the alleged procedural defect, although the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* aimed at proving that Lion, an alien company operating in Mexico, had been the victim of an elaborate fraud to avoid its proper *emplazamiento.*\n\n[This stands in stark contrast with the treatment granted to the complainants when the False *Amparo* was submitted without the requisite copies. In that instance, the *Juez* accorded the complainants the chance to cure the formalistic deficiency.]\n\nThe decisions of the *Juez de Distrito*\n---------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nOnce the *queja* had been resolved, the *Juez de Distrito* resumed his work, and in accordance with the decision of the *Tribunal de Queja* resolved that all evidence linked to the forgery claim should be dismissed (both the evidence already admitted and the evidence still pending admission)139.\n\nExhi C-105, pp. 8-9.\n\n156.\n\nThereafter the *Juez de Distrito* rendered a specific ruling on Lion's separate motion (*\"incidente de falsedad de documento\"*)*.* The judge dismissed it on the grounds that the allegedly false document (the Forged Settlement Agreement) was not related to the subject-matter of the *Amparo* Proceeding140.\n\nExh. C-108.\n\nForgery is excluded from the scope of the *Amparo*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nBe that as it may, from that date on, the scope of the *Amparo* did not include any inquiry into the issue whether the Settlement Agreement had been forged; it was assumed that the Settlement Agreement was valid and binding, having been properly executed by Lion. The scope of the *Amparo* was reduced to the question whether the *emplazamiento* had or not been properly executed in accordance with Mexican law. And - congruently with this reduced scope of investigation - all evidence in the file seeking to prove the forgery of the Settlement Agreement was expurgated.\n\n**7.4** **T****he** ***A******mparo*** **J****udgment**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nOn December 4, 2013, the *Juez de Distrito* delivered his decision denying Lion protection against the Cancellation Judgment [the *\"****Amparo*** **Judgment**\"]141.\n\n\"[...] R E S U E L V E: \u00daNICO.

[...]\" [Capitals in the original]\n\nExh. C-115, pp. 66-67.\n\n159.\n\nThe *Amparo Judgement* is a 67-page document, which in its *\"Resultando\"* summarizes the procedure, and which then reasons the decision in seven *\"Considerandos\".*\n\nSr. Arechederra's signature had been forged\n-------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nAs a preliminary question, the *Juez de Distrito* analyzes Lion's allegation that on July 6, 2012 Sr. Arechederra's signature had been forged in the false request for copy before the *Juzgado de lo Mercantil* - see section 5.1. *supra.* (The issue was relevant, because if it had been true that on July 6, 2012 Lion had been aware of the Cancellation Judgement, the *Amparo* would have been inadmissible due to the statute of limitations).\n\n161.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement, after weighing the expert evidence marshalled by the parties, concludes that Sr. Arechederra's signature indeed had been forged, that the request for copy had indeed been false, and that consequently Lion's request for *Amparo* was not time barred142.\n\nExh. C-115, p. 39.\n\nSr. C\u00e1rdenas is in prison\n-------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement also acknowledges that Sr. Arechederra and Lion had filed a criminal action against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, accusing him of having forged his signature on various documents, and that on September 26, 2013 the criminal judge had ordered the imprisonment of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas for this crime. However, the *Amparo* Judge accorded little weight to this piece of evidence143.\n\nExh. C-115, p. 61.\n\nNo discussion of forgery of the Settlement Agreement\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nNotwithstanding the finding that at least on one occasion Sr. Arechederra's signature had been forged, and that Sr. C\u00e1rdenas was in prison for alleged forgeries of documents, the *Amparo* judgement does not even discuss Lion's argument that the Settlement Agreement might also have been forged: since the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* had been dismissed (because it had been signed by Lion's attorney, but not by a legal representative), any issue relating to the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was off limits in the *Amparo* procedure.\n\n164.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement consequently assumes that the Settlement Agreement was validly executed on Lion's behalf. There being a valid Settlement Agreement with a designation of process agent and an address for service of process, the *Juez de Distrito* dismisses Lion's argument that the *emplazamiento* should have been made in Dallas, Texas, USA, and in accordance with the applicable international treaties144.\n\nExh. C-155, p. 47.\n\n165.\n\nInstead, the *Juez de Distrito* discusses at length a minor incident in the way the fraudulent *emplazamiento* had taken place: in accordance with the Settlement Agreement the notification should have been made at Calle Tom\u00e1s V. G\u00f3mez 95, *despacho* 7. But in reality, the *actuario* went to the same address, but to a different office: *despacho* 5.\n\n166.\n\nThe *Juez de Distrito* finds that this \"minor defect\" does not invalidate the *emplazamiento*, because the *actuario* was able to locate Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, who, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement, was the person designated by Lion as process agent145.\n\nExh. C-155, p. 53\n\n**7.5** **T****he** ***R******ecurso de*** ***R******evisi\u00f3n***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nLion was not satisfied with the *Amparo* Judgement. On December 19, 2013 Lion filed a *recurso de revisi\u00f3n* [the ***\"Recurso de Revisi\u00f3n\"****\"],* seeking its revocation, the granting of protection to Lion's constitutional rights and the finding that the Cancellation Lawsuit and related acts were null and void146.\n\nExh. C-116, pp. 46-57.\n\n168.\n\nAmong other reasons, Lion explicitly challenged the *Amparo* Judgment, arguing that the *Juez de Distrito* had disregarded Lion's claim that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, using the argument that the falsehood was unrelated to the dispute and that the defendants in the *Amparo* had not participated in the alleged forgery. Lion explained that the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was indeed relevant for the *Amparo,* because Lion's *emplazamiento* had been delivered to Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, Lion's purported process agent designated in the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement was a forgery, the designation of Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina was false, and the *emplazamiento* had not been properly made147.\n\nExh. C-116, pp. 16-17.\n\n169.\n\nAt first, the *Recurso de Revisi\u00f3n* was assigned to the *Cuarto Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Civil del Tercer Circuito*148. However, it was later decided that the *Recurso de Revisi\u00f3n* should instead be heard by the same court that had rejected Lion's earlier *queja* regarding the *decisi\u00f3n sobre la ampliaci\u00f3n* the *Segundo Tribunal del Tercer Circuito,* referred to in this Award as *\"Tribunal de Queja\"*)149.\n\nCM, para. 155.\n\nCM, para. 156, citing, Exh. C-118.\n\nThe False *Amparo* surfaces\n---------------------------\n\n170.\n\nUp to this point, Claimant had undertaken at least four formal attempts requesting that it be authorized to allege in the *Amparo* that the Settlement Agreement was indeed a forgery, and to marshal evidence proving this allegation. Yet the *Tribunal de Queja,* once again, decided not to investigate the issue of forgery nor to admit any evidence to prove it - but this time for a different reason.\n\n171.\n\nMore than 16 months after the initiation of the *Recurso de Revisi\u00f3n,* on April 17, 2015, the *Tribunal de Queja* surprisingly decided to remand the case back to the *Juez de Distrito* for a totally different purpose: to determine whether Lion's *Amparo* proceeding was inadmissible, a different *Amparo* relating to the same facts having been filed at an earlier date and thereafter abandoned.\n\n172.\n\n*Pro memoria:* the False *Amparo* had been fraudulently filed and then abandoned by someone impersonating Sr. Arechederra, Lion's representative in Mexico - with the purpose of obstructing the real *Amparo* which Lion was expected to submit in due course.\n\n173.\n\nWhen the *Tribunal de Queja* raised the issue of the False *Amparo* it came as a total surprise:\n\n\"- For the last 16 months of *Amparo* proceeding no party and no prior court had ever referred to this admissibility issue150;\"\n\n\"- The same *Tribunal de Queja* had also failed to raise the issue when it first intervened in these proceedings, to adjudicate the appeal against interlocutory decisions of the *Juez de Distrito*;\"\n\n\"- The *Tribunal de Queja* decided *sua sponte,* and over a year into the *recurso de revisi\u00f3n*, to raise the existence of the False *Amparo*; the only reason given by the *Tribunal de Queja* to justify its decision was that an unidentified administrative official had informed the Court of the existence of the previous *Amparo*151.\n\nExh.

C-119, p. 21.\n\n174.\n\nAs regards the remand procedure, the *Tribunal de Queja* ordered that it should be restricted to adjudicating the admissibility issue, explicitly prohibiting the parties to marshal new evidence regarding the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement152 and instructing the *Juez de Distrito* not to analyze Lion's allegation that such Agreement had been forged153.\n\nExh. C-119, p. 18\n\nExh. C-119, pp. 17-18.\n\n175.\n\nAfter three years of judicial battling, Lion still had no decision confirming the falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement and now it was fighting to prove that it should not be deprived of *Amparo* recourse - the only way to overturn the wrongful cancellation of the Mortgages.\n\n**7.6** **T****he remand** ***A******mparo***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe fact that Lion was being tried by the same judge who had already dismissed evidence on the forgery did not discourage Lion from bringing once more a petition to admit evidence on the fraudulent nature of the Forged Settlement Agreement154. And, since Lion had only acquired knowledge of the False *Amparo's* existence at this point, it also provided evidence pointing to the inauthenticity of the False *Amparo*155*.*\n\nExh. C-121.\n\nExh. C-122.\n\n177.\n\nOn September 23, 2015 the *Juez de Distrito* only accepted the graphology expert report and a brief filing on the False *Amparo* as evidence156. The *Juez de Distrito* used formalistic reasoning to reject further evidence provided by Lion157.\n\nExh. C-123.\n\nExh. C-123: Sr. Arechederra's testimony could not be admitted because it was rendered by Claimant's legal counsel and raised a risk of bias; additionally, the Court found that Claimant incorrectly submitted a questionnaire that included identical questions for Sr. Arechederra and Mr. Baer, a type of evidence that is forbidden under the applicable law, see RR, para. 119 together with footnote within, invoking inadmissibility of such evidence under Art. 150 of the *Amparo* law.\n\nLion's withdrawal\n-----------------\n\n178.\n\nAt that point Claimant had spent almost three years in lawsuits before Mexican civil courts trying to undo the fraudulent cancellation of the Mortgages. It had achieved very little:\n\n\"- Lion had filed an *Amparo,* but its recurring attempts that the scope of the procedure be extended to cover the forgery of the Settlement Agreement (a fact which Lion only learned after it had filed the *Amparo*) and that it be authorized to marshal evidence proving the forgery, had been repeatedly dismissed by the first instance *Juez de Distrito* and in second instance by the *Tribunal de Queja,* for a purely formalistic reason: the *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda* had been signed on behalf of Lion by its attorney and not by its legal representative - a minor procedural defect Lion was never offered the opportunity to remedy;\"\n\n\"- Unable to submit that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, Lion's *Amparo* had been dismissed by the first instance *Juez de Distrito*; in the *Amparo* Judgement the *Juez de Distrito* assumed the Settlement Agreement to be valid and binding and concluded that Lion's *emplazamiento* had been properly served on Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, Lion's process agent as identified in the Forged Settlement Agreement - an obscure attorney, with whom Lion had never had any relationship and who failed to inform Lion;\"\n\n\"- On appeal against the *Amparo* Judgement, the second instance *Tribunal de Queja,* whom Lion had asked to review a further time the prohibition to argue the forgery issue, did not take up this question; instead the *Tribunal de Queja*, in an unexpected move, made *sua sponte* the decision to remand the procedure back to the first instance Judge, with a strictly limited remit: to review whether the *Amparo* had been properly admitted, in light of the existence of a previous *Amparo* (the False *Amparo* - a decoy procedure filed fraudulently by the Debtors to derail the admissibility of the real *Amparo);*\"\n\n- Upon the instructions of the *Tribunal de Queja,* the *Juez de Distrito* again denied Lion's request to expand the scope of the remand, so that the *Amparo* could encompass the forgery of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n179.\n\nOn December 11, 2015 Lion waived the *Amparo* lawsuit. Lion says that it took this decision, because it believed it was futile to continue:\n\n\"- On the one hand, had Lion pursued the Remand *Amparo*, Mexico could have argued in this arbitration that Lion's expropriation claim under NAFTA Article 1110 would be inadmissible pursuant to NAFTA Article 1121(2), which sets a three-year time limit to bring claims158;\"\n\n\"- On the other hand, the circumstances made it clear that further pursuit of Lion's claims, before the same court that had ruled against it before, on the basis on the same evidence admitted previously, and barring admission of other relevant evidence, was futile;\"\n\n- Additionally, the graphological evidence that was in fact admitted, with the experts opinions two-to-one in favour of the authenticity of the False *Amparo*, made it even less likely that the Remand *Amparo* would make a ruling in favour of Lion159.\n\nCM, para. 171.\n\nCM, paras. 171-176.\n\n**8.** **C****riminal proceedings and the fate of the** **N****ayarit property**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nAt the time of the filing of Post-Hearing Briefs, three criminal proceedings concerning the alleged irregularities of which Lion says it has been a victim were pending resolution:\n\n\"- A criminal action160 had been brought against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas in connection with the Forged Settlement Agreement and the false request for copy; the investigation phase had been completely exhausted; Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, in his defense, had initiated *Amparos* No. 610/2017 and No. 1518/2018; the criminal proceedings were halted until those *Amparos* were resolved161;\"\n\n\"- A criminal action162 had been brought against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas concerning the False *Amparo;* at the time of the filing of the Post-Hearing Briefs, this proceeding was at the initial investigation phase, before the Prosecutor's Office in Jalisco; the Prosecutor was in the process of analyzing the matter to bring charges formally (the \"*imputaci\u00f3n*\")163;\"\n\n\"- A criminal164 action had been brought against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas for the sale of the Nayarit Property; at the time of the final Party submissions, the proceeding was at the initial investigation phase, before the Prosecutor's Office in Jalisco165.\n\nNo. 4713/2016.\n\nCPHB, p. 40, RPHB para. 189.\n\nNo. 121667/2017.\n\nCPHB, para. 41.

Implicitly referring to the stature of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's father-in-law and the apparent leniency of Jalisco courts towards Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, Ms. Onay Payne (one of Lion's representatives) stated at the Hearing that they were able to \"get him [Sr. C\u00e1rdenas] behind bars\", but \"not for long\"166.\n\nHT, p. 500.\n\n182.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Inmobiliaria Bains sold the Nayarit Property to *\"Hotelera los Tules\"*167. This sale operation was recorded by the *Registro P\u00fablico* of Bucer\u00edas on May 16, 2017.

To declare that Mexico has breached its obligations under Articles 1110 and 1105 of NAFTA and international law;\"\n\n\"b. To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the amount of US$81,992,752 as compensation for the loss caused by the cancellation of the Mortgages with interest at the rate mentioned under (e) below;\"\n\n\"c.

To order Mexico to pay the Claimant whatever amount is assessed against LMC by the Mexican courts (currently valued at US$14,853,013.73) as a result of the waiver of the Foreclosure Proceedings as per Article 1121 of NAFTA;\"\n\ne. To order Mexico to pay interest on the amounts under (b) to (c) at the Mexican Legal rate provided by Article 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code compounded monthly (i.e., 6%), through the date of full and effective payment of those amounts as from:\n\n\"(i) 31 March 2015 for the lost value of the Mortgages;\"\n\n\"(ii) 31 December 2015 to reimburse LMC for the attorney's fees and costs it incurred in Mexican court proceedings;\"\n\n\"f. To order Mexico to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees in connection with this arbitration with interest as of the date of the award at the interest rate mentioned above at (e); and\"\n\ng. Any other remedies that the Tribunal consider appropriate in the circumstances given Mexico's breaches\"\n\nCPHB, para. 320.\n\n185.\n\nMexico's request for relief in its Rejoinder is as follows170:\n\n\"For all of the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests:\n\n\"\u2022 an Order dismissing the Claimant's Claim in its entirety;\"\n\n\"\u2022 an Order that the Claimant indemnify the Respondent for its costs incurred in this arbitration, including its legal costs and the travel expenses occurred by its legal team, witnesses, and experts; and\"\n\n\u2022 such other relief as the Respondent may request and this Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n635. In the alternative, in the unlikely event that the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is internationally liable for a breach of its obligations under NAFTA Article 1110 and/or NAFTA Article 1105, the Respondent requests:\n\n\"\u2022 that the amount of damages be determined on the basis of the CBRE reports and Sanchez Devanny opinion, which put the value of the property, net of foreclosure fees and expenses, at USD $47,060,068.57;\"\n\n\"\u2022 *minus* the deduction that the Tribunal finds appropriate to avoid double recovery and to account for the Claimant's contributory fault;\"\n\n\"\u2022 *plus* an award of interest based on a relatively low and risk-free rate applicable to U.S. dollar denominated amounts, such as the U.S. Treasury Bill with annual compounding; and\"\n\n\u2022 any such other relief as the Respondent may request and this Tribunal may deem appropriate\".\n\nRR, paras. 634 and 635.\n\n186.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief Respondent specified that171:\n\n\"[...] any damages found must be subject to a deduction for contributory fault of at least 50% and closer to 100% since the Claimant would not have suffered any losses had it not acted negligently and with a lack of due care\".\n\nRPHB, para. 217.\n\n**VI.** **MERITS**\n------------------\n\n187.\n\nLion has brought this arbitration against Mexico to address Mexico's alleged:\n\n\"- judicial and administrative expropriation of Lion's investment under NAFTA Art. 1110172;\"\n\n- alternatively, Mexico's denial of justice as a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Art. 1105, and\n\n- alternatively, the failure to grant Lion's investment full protection and security under NAFTA Art. 1105.\n\nClaimant alleges that it suffered a judicial expropriation of the Mortgages through the Cancellation Judgment which eventually also resulted in an administrative expropriation through the cancellation of the Mortgages in the Public Registry (See CM, para. 260 and CPHB, para. 179 *et seq.).*\n\nGeneral rule: No judicial expropriation without denial of justice\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nWhile expropriation constitutes Claimant's primary claim173, the Tribunal observes that liability for expropriation under Art. 1110 arising from the decisions of domestic courts requires a finding of a denial of justice.\n\nCPHB, paras. 143-150, CR, paras. 200-202, CM, paras. 201-203, 233-236.\n\n189.\n\nThis is agreed upon by both of the Non-Disputing Parties in their submissions:\n\n- The USA states that174:\n\n\"Decisions of domestic courts acting in the role of neutral and independent arbiters of the legal rights of litigants do not give rise to a claim for expropriation under Article 1110(1). Moreover, the United States has not recognized the concept of \"judicial takings\" as a matter of domestic law [...].\"\n\n- Canada in turn asserts that175:\n\n\"A domestic court's bona fide adjudication as to whether a property right exists under domestic law cannot be recast as an expropriation of that property. A neutral and independent judicial determination that a property right is invalid under domestic law, unless it can be impugned as a denial of justice, does not give rise to separate claim of expropriation under customary international law. International tribunals have followed this approach.\"\n\nUSA Submission, para. 20.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 12.\n\n190.\n\nThis position is buttressed by the *Loewen* tribunal, which stated the following about a judicial expropriation claim presented as an alternative to denial of justice176:\n\n\"Claimant's reliance on Article 1110 adds nothing to the claim based on Article 1105. In the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in violation of Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen established a denial of justice under 1105\".\n\n*Loewen,* para. 141\u00a0quoted in Canada Submission, para. 12.\n\n191.\n\nA similar view has been expressed by legal scholars, *inter alia,* by Paparinskis, who in his seminal treatise on the international minimum standard and fair and equitable treatment has opined that\n\n\"[w]hile taking of property through the judicial process could be said to constitute expropriation, the rules and criteria to be applied for establishing the breach should come from denial of justice\"177.\n\nM. Paparinskis, \"The International Minimum Standard and Fair and Equitable Treatment\", 2013, p. 208.\n\nExceptions to the rule\n----------------------\n\n192.\n\nThere is an exception to the general rule, acknowledged explicitly by both the USA and Canada in their submissions - whenever it can be proved that the courts were not neutral and independent, especially from the other branches of power of the host State.\n\n193.\n\nThe USA has opined that178:\n\n\"Of course, where a judiciary is not separate from other organs of the State and those organs (executive or legislative) direct or otherwise interfere with a domestic court decision so as to cause an effective expropriation, these executive or legislative acts may form the basis of a separate claim under Article 1110, depending on the circumstances.\"\n\nUSA Submission, para. 21.\n\n194.\n\nThe submission by Canada confirms the exception by stating that \"[a] neutral and independent judicial determination [...] does not give rise to separate claim of expropriation under customary international law179\", thus implying that such a separate claim could be found valid if the judicial determination under question was not neutral or independent.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 12.\n\n195.\n\nIn the current case, the Tribunal does not find sufficient proof to apply the above exception:\n\n\"- No proof has been marshalled as to the interference of the executive or legislative branches of Mexico's government in the course of the local proceedings;\"\n\n\"- Even though Claimant has presented allegations of bias by Mexico's courts180, these are not substantiated by evidence; and\"\n\n- The decisions of the courts failed to benefit the Respondent State.\n\nI.e., with regard to the length of the notification process in the Foreclosure Proceeding compared with the swiftness of service and issuance of a decision in the Cancellation Proceeding or the excessive formality of the rejection of the *ampliati\u00f3n de demanda* when compared with the acceptance of a photocopy of the Forged Settlement Agreement instead of the required original.\n\n196.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that it must first adjudicate Lion's claim for denial of justice (**VI.1**), then it will analyse the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (**VI.2**), establish its conclusions (**VI.3**) and finally devote a short chapter to Claimant's alternative claims (**VI.4**).\n\n**VI.1.** **DENIAL OF JUSTICE**\n-------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nClaimant avers that it was denied justice by the Mexican judicial system.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal will first make an introduction (**1.**), then it will provide a summary of Claimant's and Respondent's respective positions (**2.** and **3.**) and finally it shall make a decision (**4.**).\n\n**1.** **O****verview**\n-----------------------\n\n199.\n\nDenial of justice, referred to as *denegaci\u00f3n de justicia* in Spanish, is\n\n\"a defect in a country's organization of courts or administration of justice, resulting in the country's violating its international legal duties to protect aliens\"181.\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition, p. 499.\n\n200.\n\nThe concept reaches back to the Middle Ages182, when private reprisals were allowed against acts of injustice committed by actors of another State183. It later evolved into diplomatic protection assumed by States184. Traditionally, some authors perceived denial of justice as any internationally illegal treatment of aliens185:\n\n\"A denial of justice, in a broad sense, occurs whenever a State, through any department or agency, fails to observe, with respect to an alien, any duty imposed by international law or by treaty with his country\".\n\nSee ILC Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1957, Volume I, UN DoC/CN.4/SER.A/1957 155, quoted from Paparinskis, *op. cit.,* p. 47: \"[the rules relating ... to denial of justice were centuries old, thus they could be found, stated in very modern terms [...] three hundred years before Grotius\".\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 13.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nO. J. Lissitzyn, \"The Meaning of the Term Denial of Justice in International Law\", *The American Journal of International Law* Vol. 30, No. 4 (Oct., 1936), p. 633, providing insight on multiple authors propagating such view.\n\n201.\n\nHowever, currently a narrower view prevails, although there is much debate on what specific State actions constitute denial of justice: points of contention include whether the concept encompasses administrative acts, whether manifestly unjust court decisions on the merits can constitute denial of justice, and whether subjective elements, such as bad faith, should be required186.\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 633-635.\n\n202.\n\nIn 1935, de Visscher famously described denial of justice as \"one of the oldest and one of the worst elucidated [concepts] in international law\"187 Despite the passage of nearly a century, de Visscher's statement still stands true.\n\nCh. de Visscher, \"Le d\u00e9ni de justice en droit international\", *Recueil des cours,* Vol. 52, 1935, p. 369.\n\n203.\n\nPaulsson, one of the most prominent contemporary researchers on the subject, has defined denial of justice as follows188:\n\n\"[d]enial of justice arises when proceedings are so faulty as to exclude all reasonable expectation of a fair decision [...]\".\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 205.\n\n204.\n\nPaulsson's definition puts the emphasis on the active subject (judicial bodies of the host State) and on the wrongdoing (very grave breaches of due process to the detriment of the alien, which preclude the possibility of an unjust decision on the merits be reviewed).\n\nApplicability under the NAFTA\n-----------------------------\n\n205.\n\nNowhere in the NAFTA treaty do the words \"denial of justice\" appear. The same happens in most investment treaties. There is, however, unanimous agreement among the Parties (including the Non-Disputing Parties) that denial of justice is an international wrong which breaches the fair and equitable treatment [\"**FET**\"] standard. Case law and doctrine reach the same conclusion189.\n\nE.g., *Flughafen,* para. 630, *Jan de Nul,* para. 188; *Jan Oostergetel,* para. 272; *Pey Casado,* para. 655, *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* para. 7.4.11. See also R. Dolzer and Ch. Schreuer, \"Principles of International Investment Law\", 2008, OUP, p.142.\n\n206.\n\nArt. 1105 NAFTA delineates the FET standard:\n\n\"Article 1105: Minimum Standard of Treatment\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\"\n\n207.\n\nArt. 1131(2) of the NAFTA states that an interpretation by the Free Trade Commission of a NAFTA provision \"shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section\".\n\n208.\n\nOne such interpretation was provided on the protections under Art. 1105 of the NAFTA. The Interpretation Note of July 31, 2001 [the \"**FTC Note**\"] states as follows:\n\n\"[T]he Free Trade Commission hereby adopts the following interpretations of Chapter Eleven in order to clarify and reaffirm the meaning of certain of its provisions: [...]\n\nB. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law\n\n1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n209.\n\nIn light of the Interpretation Note, the protection to be accorded to investors under the FET and full protection and security standards is set at the level of \"customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\".\n\n210.\n\nSince Claimant has brought a case of denial of justice by the Mexican Courts, the adjudication of this case requires that the Tribunal determine what \"customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\" is expected from those Courts. Breach of that standard implies denial of justice.\n\n**1.1** **P****rocedural and substantive denial of justice**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn its Memorial, Claimant argues that the Minimum Standard of Treatment under Article 1105 (1) of the NAFTA incorporates a threefold protection for investors in their dealings with local Courts. Thus, local Courts are prohibited from:\n\n- incurring unreasonable delay in administering justice190,\n\n- refusing the investors access to justice191, and\n\n- rendering manifestly unjust and erroneous decisions that a competent judge would not have taken192.\n\nCM, para. 339.\n\nCM, para. 444.\n\nCM, para. 351.\n\n212.\n\nIn Claimant's view, denial of justice can thus be subsumed in two great categories: procedural and substantive denial of justice.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant's Reply provides a more elaborate typology of denial of justice, introducing a two-fold differentiation into *\"d\u00e9ni de justice\"* and *\"d\u00e9fi de justice\"* proposed by the *Institut de Droit International*193 and a four-fold one under the Harvard Draft Convention194, which includes substantive denial of justice as one of the categories195:\n\n\"A state is responsible if an injury to an alien results from a denial of justice. Denial of justice exists when there is\n\n[i] a denial, unwarranted delay or obstruction of access to courts,\n\n[ii] gross deficiency in the administration of judicial or remedial process,\n\n[iii] failure to provide those guaranties which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or\n\n[iv] a manifestly unjust judgment. An error of a national court which does not produce manifest injustice is not a denial of justice\".\n\nCR, para. 403, citing IDI, \"Responsabilit\u00e9 internationale des Etats \u00e0 raison des dommages caus\u00e9s sur leur territoire \u00e0 la personne et aux biens des \u00e9trangers\", 1927, Exh.

RL-45.\n\n215.\n\nRespondent in turn argues that denial of justice is always procedural197.\n\nRR, para. 195-197.\n\n216.\n\nMexico retorts that the artificial distinction made by the *Oostergetel* tribunal is misleading and that ultimately it did not lead to the application of any other standard for denial of justice than the traditional, very high one198. Respondent also claims that the Harvard Draft Convention and the *Institut de Droite International's* Draft Articles are irrelevant, because they lack customary law status199.\n\nRR, paras. 203-209.\n\nRR, paras. 194, 210.\n\nThe view of the Tribunal\n------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent, who convincingly argues that there is no \"substantive denial of justice\". While the dichotomy between substantive and procedural denial of justice has indeed been adopted (to greater or lower endorsement) by some arbitral tribunals200, this differentiation is not useful. To determine whether a judgment was outrageous or egregious on the merits would require a tribunal to delve into the decision-making process under national law - it is trite to repeat that international tribunals cannot be and do not constitute domestic courts of appeal201.\n\nE.g., *Jan de Nul, Oostergetel.*\n\nSee e.g., Exh. CLA-272, E. Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, \"International Law in the Past Third of a Century\", *159 Recueil des cours 267,* 1978, p. 282.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal endorses Paulsson's view that:\n\n\"in modern international law there is no place for substantive denial of justice [...] If a judgment is *grossly* unjust, it is because the victim has not been afforded fair treatment [...] Extreme cases should thus be dealt with on the footing that they are so unjustifiable that they could have been only the product of bias or some other violation of the right of *due process*202*\"*\n\n\"[...] denial of justice is always procedural203.\"\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 82.\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 98.\n\n219.\n\nPaulsson adds that manoeuvring the line between what appears to be substantively unjust and what is unjust or erroneous because of gross procedural breaches is \"the greatest difficulty of our subject\" and explains that204:\n\n\"\"gross or notorious injustice - whatever the words used - is not a denial of justice merely because the conclusion appears to be demonstrably wrong in substance; it must impel the adjudicator to conclude that it could not have been reached by any impartial judicial body worthy of that name\".\n\nPaulsson Lecture, p. 31.\n\n**1.2** **T****ypes**\n---------------------\n\n220.\n\nA review of case law and scholarly writings reveal that procedural denial of justice can be classified in subtypes: the right to access justice (**A.**); the right to be heard and to present one's case (**B.**) ; and the right to obtain a decision without undue delay (**C.**). These are some of the separate manifestations of denial of justice and, if committed against an alien, constitute international wrongs which can be imputed against the State.\n\n**A.** **Denying an alien access to justice**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe first category of procedural denial of justice is uncontroversial. Prof. Paparinskis writes205:\n\n\"The easiest case, accepted as uncontroversially wrongful under the Hague Conference, was a discriminatory denial of access to court, described in the Hague Texts as the situation where 'the foreigner has been hindered by the judicial authorities in the exercise of his right to pursue judicial remedies\".\n\nPaparinskis, p. 190, footnotes omitted.\n\n222.\n\nHe also provides the following examples206:\n\n\"[...] a purposeful disruption of the commencement of the proceedings, or even the absence of notification about proceedings that exclude the possibility to challenge them could all result in denial of justice\".\n\nPaparinskis, p. 191, footnotes omitted.\n\n223.\n\nFreeman in turn explains due process under international law in the following words207:\n\n\"\"whenever judicial action is taken without giving the alien a hearing or without properly notifying him in order to prepare a defense; whenever misconduct of the judge in withholding, hiding or destroying papers essential to the foreigner's cause is prejudicial in effect; whenever he has not been permitted to produce evidence or to summon valuable witnesses\".\n\nExh. CLA 190, A. V. Freeman, \"The International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice\", 1938, pp. 267-268.\n\n224.\n\nCase law supports this view.\n\n225.\n\nThe judgment in *Ambatielos* offers insight into the basic right of foreigners to access local courts in pursuit of justice208:\n\n\"\"Thus, when 'free access to the Courts' is covenanted by a State in favour of the subjects or citizens of another State, the covenant is that the foreigner shall enjoy full freedom to appear before the courts for the protection or defence of his rights, whether as plaintiff or defendant; to bring any action provided or authorized by law [...]\" [Emphasis added].\n\n*Ambatielos,* p. 111.\n\n226.\n\nIn *Idler* the US-Venezuela Commission found that the American claimant, Mr. Idler, was denied justice when the Supreme Court in Caracas gave him notice of an impending hearing without sufficient time for him to physically be able to appear in court209.\n\n*Idler,* pp. 152-153.\n\n227.\n\nThe *Cotesworth & Powell* tribunal described the following facts as an \"absolute denial of justice\"210:\"\n\n\"Still, a plain violation of the substance of natural justice, as, for example, refusing to hear the party interested, or to allow him opportunity to produce proofs, amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice\".\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 188.\n\n228.\n\n*AI-Bahloul* explicitly recognized that due process breaches include not notifying the investor of hearings and that deciding in the investor's absence amounts to a gross violation of procedural rules211.\n\n*Al-Bahloul,* para. 221.\n\n229.\n\nThe right to access justice also extends to the right to lodge appeal. This aspect was discussed by the tribunal in *Al-Bahloul*, where the claimant alleged that his appeals were wrongfully rejected without regard to due process standards212 - the tribunal explicitly acknowledged that the allegations could constitute a denial of due process (but ultimately dismissed the claim because of the limited evidence on the record213).\n\n*Al-Bahloul,* para. 82.\n\n*Al-Bahloul,* para. 227.\n\n**B.** **Denying an alien the right of defense or to present evidence**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe violation of an alien's right of defense or to present evidence as an international wrong amounting to denial of justice has been universally recognized by academia214.\n\nFor example, Paulsson states that \"No serious international lawyer contests either of the first two [types of denial of justice]\", with reference to denial of access to justice and denial of justice for undue delay. See Paulsson Lecture, p. 30.\n\n231.\n\nCase law equally supports this view.\n\n232.\n\nThis was done by the aforementioned *Cotesworth & Powell* tribunal215:\"\n\n\"Still, a plain violation of the substance of natural justice, as, for example, refusing to hear the party interested, or to allow him [an] opportunity to produce proofs, amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice\". [Emphasis added]\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 188.\n\n233.\n\nIn the *Ambatielos* ruling216:\n\n\"\"the covenant is that the foreigner shall enjoy full freedom to [...] deliver any pleading by way of defence, set off or counterclaim; to engage Counsel; to adduce evidence, whether documentary or oral or of any other kind; to apply for bail; to lodge appeals and, in short, to use the Courts fully and to avail himself of any procedural remedies or guarantees provided by the law of the land in order that justice may be administered on a footing of equality with nationals of the country.\".\n\n*Ambatielos,* p. 111.\n\n234.\n\nAnd the *Krederi* decision:\n\n\"[m]ost frequently a denial of justice may result from a serious defect in the adjudicative process, such as a violation of ... the right to be heard and to present evidence [...]217\"\n\n*Krederi,* p. 61 para. 449 (iii).\n\n235.\n\nThe US-Mexico General Claims Commission in *Chattin* found that local courts displayed \"a most astonishing lack of seriousness\" because there was \"no trace of an effort to have the two foremost pieces of evidence explained\", there was no inquiry made into verifying the statement of a key witness in the domestic prosecution proceedings and there was no effort to examine a witness who could have presented important exculpatory evidence218.\n\n*Chattin,* p. 292, para. 22.\n\n236.\n\nIn *Ballistini,* the claimant was denied a crucial piece of evidence necessary to make his case because the judge he accused of arbitrariness deliberately withheld the documents. The French-Venezuelan Commission found a denial of justice\n\n\"because the local authorities deprived Mr. Ballistini of the legal means of instituting before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would authorize him in case he might improperly have been condemned to a criminal judgment.219\"\n\n*Ballistini,* p. 20.\n\n237.\n\nIn *Joseph F. Riham*220*.* the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico reversed the decisions of lower courts in enforcement proceedings because it claimed that critical evidence -that was clearly on the record and discussed by one of the justices - had in fact not been presented before it. The American Mexican Claims Commission found that there was denial of justice as221:\n\n\"\"[I]n the face of the clear and indisputable evidence in the record to the contrary, more particularly in view of the fact that the, attention of the court had been drawn to such evidence by one of its members warrants the conclusion that the said court wilfully disregarded such evidence; that the decision of the court was lacking in good faith and that the same fell so far short of international standards as to amount to a denial of justice\" [Emphasis added]\n\n*Joseph F. Rihani*, p. 254.\n\n*Joseph F. Rihani*, p. 258.\n\n**C.** **Prohibition of undue delay**\n-------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe final type of procedural denial of justice concerns undue delay in the rendering of a judgement by the local Courts.\n\n239.\n\nThere is unanimous agreement by scholars that undue delay in the exercise of justice is a separate type of denial of justice222.\n\nFor example, Paulsson states that \"No serious international lawyer contests either of the first two [types of denial of justice]\", with reference to denial of access to justice and denial of justice for undue delay. Paulsson Lecture, p. 30.\n\n240.\n\nAs early as the *Fabiani*223 case discussed *supra,* international tribunals have agreed that \"justice delayed is justice denied\". It is widely recognized that undue delay amounts to a denial of due process224.\n\n*Fabiani,* pp. 4902 and 4904: \"by encouraging a debtor's ill-founded opposition has, if not refused to decide, at the very least provoked an unjustified delay [...] this last denial of justice alone would be sufficient to justify the diplomatic intervention and guarantee an award on damages against the Defendant State\".\n\nSee e.g., *Al-Bahloul,* para. 221, Oostergetel, pp. 73-77.\n\n241.\n\nIt is common ground that there is no abstract manner of determining whether a particular period constitutes reasonable delay but each case should be scrutinized under the specific facts225. For example, in *Pey Casado*226*,* a period of seven years without rendering a first instance decision by local courts amounted to a denial of justice. In *El Oro Mining and Railway Co*.227, the Great Britain and Mexico Claims Commission found that the passage of nine years without a hearing in its case for compensation for having provided materials to the government, constituted a denial of justice. However, in *Oostergetel,* the length of local proceedings of two years was found not to be in breach of the international minimum standard228.\n\n*Toto Construzioni,* para. 155.\n\n*Pey Casado,* para. 659.\n\n*El Oro Mining,* p. 191, para. 9.\n\n*Oostergetel,* paras. 208, 290.\n\n242.\n\nThe tribunal in *Chevron* devised a widely recognized test for denial of justice for undue delay: it found that \"some of the factors that may be considered are the complexity of the case, the behaviour of the litigants involved, the significance of the interests at stake in the case, and the behaviour of the Courts themselves\"229.\n\n*Chevron I,* para. 250.\n\n243.\n\nThe *Chevron* test was followed by the tribunal in *Oostergetel*230.\n\n*Oostergetel,* para. 290.\n\n244.\n\nSimilarly, the more recent *Toto Construzioni*231 decision, discussed in detail by both Parties in their submissions, has stated that232:\n\n\"\"There is not, under international law, a specific measure by which lapses of time may be condemned as excessive: the lapse is to be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account (i) the complexity of the matter; (ii) the need for celerity of decision; and (iii) the diligence of claimant in prosecuting its case.\"\n\nCM, para. 342, RR, para. 249, citing *Toto Costruzioni.*\n\n*Toto Costruzioni*, para. 163.\n\n**1.3** **S****tandard**\n------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that denial of justice has been conceived by international customary law and that there is no treaty formula under the NAFTA (and most treaties for that matter) which can offer guidance on which judicial actions attributable to States amount to *justitia denegata.* Additionally, the Tribunal has decided that denial of justice can only be procedural.\n\n246.\n\nThe question remains, however: how to differentiate between procedural decisions properly adopted by local Courts, which are contrary to the alien's interests, and those which amount to an international wrong and engage the responsibility of the State. To clarify this issue the Tribunal shall undertake a brief analysis of some of the major denial of justice cases233 starting with those of the 19th/20th century (**A.**), then it shall continue with more recent decisions (**B.**), present the Parties' positions (**C.**) and reach a conclusion (**D.**).\n\nThe Tribunal has excluded cases with negative finding of denial of justice, where the denial of justice was administrative rather than judicial, and where the basis for the judgment was judicial expropriation. Only analysing positive findings of judicial denial of justice and excluding instances of judicial expropriation, makes the vast majority of the case law discussed by the Parties inapposite.\n\n**A.** **Late 19**th **and early 20**th **century cases**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, there was a proliferation of denial of justice decisions that still today serve as guidance for investment tribunals. On the other hand, certain ideas of the concept of denial of justice developed under these early decisions have been superseded234.\n\nSee paras. 253-255, *infra.*\n\n248.\n\nIn *Cotesworth & Powell,* a decision from 1875, the international tribunal found multiple instances of denial of justice. A sentence of classification in bankruptcy proceedings was deemed unjust for illegally excluding claimants as common creditors and failing to notify them of the proceedings235. Additionally, a sentence issued without hearing the claimants in the case as plaintiffs in the suit was also found to constitute denial of justice236. Another denial arose from a one-year delay in notifying an important judicial sentence237. Finally, the tribunal identified a conflict between decisions made by the same courts238.\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 188, para. 2.\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 188, para. 5.\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell*, p. 188, para. 5.\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 180, para. 2, p. 188, para. 5.\n\n249.\n\n*Idler,* a case decided in 1890, concerned the use of an obscure legal remedy from medieval times, which allowed the reversal of any judgments or proceedings detrimental to the government, used by the State to annul previous Court decisions favourable to the alien. The US-Venezuela Commission found that the singular invocation of this ancient remedy by the Supreme Court of Venezuela served to circumvent enforcement of the decisions in favour of the alien and thus constituted a denial of justice239. The Commission also found that the claimant was denied justice because the notice of proceedings he was given made it impossible for him to appear in court240.\n\n*Ibid.,* pp. 161, 164.\n\n*Idler,* pp. 152-153.\n\n250.\n\nIn *Fabiani,* a case from 1896, Venezuela was held responsible for denial of justice, because its courts refused to enforce an arbitral award of a French national against his Venezuelan partners due to strictly procedural arguments, which amounted to a \"disguised refusal to rule\" (\"*refus d\u00e9guis\u00e9 de statuer\"*241)*.* The arbitrator also found that the claimant was subjected to undue delay242.\n\n*Fabiani,* pp. 4900, 4904.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 4904.\n\n251.\n\nIn *Ballistini*243, a decision of the French-Venezuelan Commission of 1902, a Venezuelan judge wrongfully rendered judgment for calumny and injuries against a foreigner. When Mr. Ballistini sued the judge, who apparently had issued an arbitrary decision to arrest him, the same judge withheld the necessary documentary evidence, making it impossible for Mr. Ballistini to make an effective case before local courts. The Commission found that the claimant had been denied justice:\n\n\"[b]ecause the local authorities deprived Ballistini of the legal means of instituting before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would authorize him in case he might improperly have been condemned to a criminal judgment\"244.\n\n*Ballistini*, p. 20.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 20, para. 3.\n\n252.\n\nIn the *Chattin* case of 1928, the American-Mexican Claims Commission found a denial of justice. Mr. Chattin was arrested illegally and sentenced to two years of jail for embezzlement on the basis of spurious evidence, in a trial in which he was not duly informed regarding the charges brought against him and in which the Court hearings lasted as little as five minutes245. This was a landmark decision regarding basic procedural guarantees to be afforded to foreigners.\n\n*Chattin*, p. 290, para. 15.\n\nThe *Neer* case and the subjective element of denial of justice\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nOne of the traditionally recognized leading cases on denial of justice is the 1926 award of the US-Mexico General Claims Commission in *L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer.* In its decision, the US-Mexico Commission laid out its standard246:\n\n\"[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\".\n\n*Neer,* p. 60.\n\n254.\n\nThe imprint made by *Neer* on the concept of denial of justice has been palpable in investment arbitration awards247; however, it appears that the reliance on the case has rightfully declined in the recent years.\n\n*E.g.,* *Glamis Gold* at para. 22.\n\n255.\n\nThe *Mondev* tribunal was correct in stating that the facts in *Neer* were centred on a State's alleged failure to carry out an effective police investigation into a foreigner's murder, and are not apposite when discussing treatment of aliens under the FET standard248. As the *Azurix* tribunal found249:\n\n\"the traditional *Neer* formula ... reflects the traditional, and not necessarily the contemporary, definition of the customary minimum standard, at least in certain non-investment fields\".\n\n*Mondev,* para. 115.\n\n*Saluka,* para. 295.\n\n256.\n\nOther tribunals have agreed that the *Neer* standard may have reflected the minimum standard - but only as of 1927 and not in contemporary times250.\n\nSee e.g., *Azurix,* para. 372, *Mondev,* paras. 116-117.\n\n257.\n\nSimilarly, Paulsson writes that\n\n\"there should be no doubt that, to the extent that customary-law minimum standard has any role to play in the interpretation of investment treaties, the *Neer* formula is of limited import\"251.\n\nJ. Paulsson, G. Petrochilos, \"Neer-ly Misled?\", *Miami Law Research Paper Series,* p. 257.\n\n258.\n\nAn additional reason why the *Neer* standard has become less relevant is that it explicitly requires the finding of bad faith252. This notion has been rejected by NAFTA decisions concerning denial of justice253, and authors alike254.\n\nExh. CLA-277, \"[t]he treatment of an alien ... should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\" [Emphasis added], *Neer,* pp. 61-62.\n\nSee e.g., *ADF,* para. 181, *Mondev,* paras. 116-117, *Loewen,* para. 132, *CMS,* para. 280, *Glamis Gold,* para. 627.\n\nSee e.g. Paulsson Lecture, pp. 34-35, Opinion of Christopher Greenwood, Q.C. of March 26, 2001 (on the denial of justice under international law) in *Loewen,* para. 64.\n\n**B.** **Recent denial of justice decisions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Parties have not drawn the Tribunal's attention to any NAFTA decision with a positive finding of denial of justice.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly analyse *Mondev* and *Loewen,* the two major cases discussed by the Parties. The Tribunal shall also discuss *Dan Cake* - a very recent award finding for denial of justice in a non-NAFTA case.\n\nThe *Mondev* case\n-----------------\n\n261.\n\nThe *Mondev* case (2002) concerned a failed investment in the USA by a Canadian construction company and involved a claim that the local authorities prevented the claimant from exercising an option to purchase a certain parcel of land. When the claimant filed a case before US courts, the jury found against the local authorities, a decision which was later overturned on appeal. The claimant then failed to obtain a judgment in its favour from the Massachusetts Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court rejected the case by not granting *certiorari.* According to the claimant, the Massachusetts Supreme Court deviated from its previous rulings to the extent that it had in effect applied \"a new rule\".\n\n262.\n\nThe *Mondev* tribunal did not find that denial of justice had occurred as, in any common law jurisdiction, one may and should expect \"new\" judge-made law and the decisions taken by the US courts were not \"extreme cases\" that would amount to a denial of justice.\n\n263.\n\nThe *Mondev* tribunal found that denial of justice would require255:\n\n\"a wilful disregard of due process of law, [...] which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\".\n\n*Mondev,* para. 127 (footnote omitted).\n\n264.\n\nIts analysis did not end here, however. The tribunal continued to explain that256:\n\n\"The Tribunal would stress that the word \"surprises\" does not occur in isolation. The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide a real measure of protection. In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula can be offered to cover the range of possibilities\". [Emphasis added].\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n265.\n\n*Mondev* also determined that the threshold for establishing treatment in violation of the FET standard had evolved in the past century and that currently it does not require subjective elements on the part of the Host State such as bad faith257:\n\n\"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat a foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith [...] the content of the minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary international law as recognised in arbitral decisions in the 1920s\".\n\n*Mondev,* paras. 116 and 123\n\nThe *Loewen* case\n-----------------\n\n266.\n\nIn *Loewen* (2003), the other major case discussed by the Parties, a Canadian funeral home conglomerate challenged a Mississippi State Court jury award of USD 100 M in compensatory damages and USD 400 M in punitive damages on claims that included fraud and violations of Mississippi antitrust law. The claimant argued that, apart from the egregious damages decision by the Mississippi State court, it was also wronged by the application of civil procedure rules requiring it to post USD 625 M to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal.\n\n267.\n\nInterestingly, the investment tribunal appeared to lean towards finding that claimant was indeed denied justice under the facts of the case258:\n\n\"After all, we have held that judicial wrongs may in principle be brought home to the State Party under Chapter Eleven, and have criticised the Mississippi proceedings in the strongest terms. There was unfairness here towards the foreign investor\".\n\n*Loewen*, para. 241.\n\n268.\n\nThe *Loewen* tribunal used the following test, according to which denial of justice amounts to259:\n\n\"[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety\"\n\n*Loewen,* para. 132.\n\n269.\n\n*Loewen* also endorsed the *Mondev* view that under contemporary international customary law, bad faith or malicious intent is not required for a denial of justice260:\n\n\"Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice\".\n\n*Loewen,* para. 132.\n\n270.\n\nHowever, the *Loewen* tribunal ultimately found that the claimant had failed to exhaust all available local remedies when it decided to reach a settlement rather than pursue its case before the US Supreme Court261.\n\n*Loewen*, para. 217.\n\n271.\n\nApart from the claimant not having exhausted the available local remedies, Loewen's claims were dismissed for lack of standing, due to claimant's buyout by a company of the Host State (which led to claimant losing its status as a foreign investor under the NAFTA).\n\n272.\n\nThe Parties have dedicated a lengthy discussion to the *Mondev* and *Loewen* decisions. The Tribunal observes that these cases may offer assistance regarding the applicable standard of denial of justice in the abstract. The underlying facts of those cases, however, substantially differ from the ones in this case.\n\nThe *Dan Cake* case\n-------------------\n\n273.\n\nIn a recent non-NAFTA decision of 2015, the *Dan Cake* tribunal found denial of justice: under Hungarian law the claimant's enterprise, that was in liquidation, was entitled to convene a composition hearing in order to seek an agreement with its creditors. Instead of following the established procedure, the Metropolitan Court of Budapest ordered claimant to submit a number of documents not required by law, and which the claimant was unable to provide. The tribunal considered that such order was unnecessary and that it prejudged and denied the claimant's right to seek an agreement with its creditors262.\n\n*Dan Cake,* para. 146.\n\n274.\n\nBased on these grounds and taking into account that there was no appeal from the Court's order263, the tribunal found that the Court's conduct \"[did] shock a sense of judicial propriety264\" and that thus claimant had been denied justice.\n\n*Dan Cake,* para. 55 and 154.\n\n*Dan Cake,* paras. 145-146.\n\n**C.** **The position of the Parties and the Non-Disputing Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal shall briefly summarize the positions of Claimant and Respondent on the applicable standard for denial of justice. The Tribunal will also review the Non-Disputing Parties' observations on this matter in their NAFTA Art. 1128 submissions.\n\nClaimant's position\n-------------------\n\n276.\n\nClaimant argues that with respect to procedural denial of justice, the Tribunal should follow the *Oostergetel* tribunal and apply a standard that the procedural irregularities be \"severe\" and affect the outcome of the dispute and that any undue delay be \"excessive\"265.\n\nCR, para. 410, citing *Oostergetel,* paras. 286-290.\n\n277.\n\nLion also claims that it is sufficient for it to prove that Mexico's courts failed to remedy the prior denial of justice, which consisted in the service of process made in a manner inconsistent with the applicable international standards and local law266.\n\nCR, paras. 422-425, 475.\n\n278.\n\nLion also attacks the *Mondev* standard proposed by Respondent by stating that the decision was based on an incorrect legal basis: that of arbitrariness rather than denial of justice267.\n\nCR, para. 399.\n\nMexico's position\n-----------------\n\n279.\n\nRespondent in turn argues that a single very high standard should apply to all types of denial of justice268. This single standard for the finding of denial of justice should be based on the *Mondev* case269:\n\n\"[...] a wilful disregard of due process of law, ... which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\"\n\nRR, paras. 185-186, 194.\n\nRR, para. 173, RCM, para. 150, citing *Mondev,* para. 127.\n\n280.\n\nAccording to Mexico, the *Mondev* tribunal was not wrong in referring to arbitrariness as part of NAFTA's Art. 1105 minimum standard of treatment. What the tribunal in *Mondev* did was to hold the criterion of arbitrariness \"useful in the context of denial of justice\"270, while fully acknowledging the difference between the two.\n\n*Mondev*, para. 127.\n\n281.\n\nMexico emphasizes that the standard for denial of justice is very high, summarizing its scope in the following words271 :\n\n\"The threshold to establish denial of justice is very high - e.g. requiring a 'notoriously unjust' or 'egregious' administration of justice 'which offends a sense of judicial propriety'. It does not suffice to establish that domestic adjudicators have erred, or misapplied or misinterpreted domestic law\".\n\nRCM, para. 147.\n\nThe USA's position\n------------------\n\n282.\n\nIn its submission the USA explicitly identifies the denial of justice threshold as high272, due to the principle of judicial independence, the particular nature of judicial action and the unique status of the judiciary in both international and municipal legal systems273. International tribunals should accord deference to domestic courts, whose judgments are presumed to be regular under international law to a higher degree than the actions of a State's legislative or administrative branch274.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 8.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 8.\n\n283.\n\nThe USA provides examples for denial of justice: an \"obstruction of access to courts\" or a \"failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice275\".\n\nUSA Submission, para. 19, citations omitted.\n\n284.\n\nThe USA emphasizes the argument that domestic court decisions, or misapplications or misinterpretation of domestic law, do not in themselves constitute a denial of justice under customary international law276.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 7.\n\nCanada's position\n-----------------\n\n285.\n\nLike the USA, Canada advocates for a high standard for denial of justice claims and evokes the traditional standard of Court actions or omissions being \"extremely gross\" or \"egregious\" or amounting to \"an outrage, bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of action apparent to any unbiased man\"277. The high standard is amplified by the need of international tribunals to defer to local Courts278.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 5, citations omitted.\n\nCanada Submission, paras. 5-7.\n\n286.\n\nCanada lists as examples of denial of justice instances where there has been\n\n\"a refusal to entertain a suit or serious failure to adequately administer justice or if there has been a 'clear and malicious misapplication of the law' or if the judgment in question is so patently egregious that 'it is impossible for a third party to recognize how an impartial judge could have reached the result in question\".279\n\nCanada Submission, para. 5, citations omitted.\n\n**D.** **The Tribunal's view**\n------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe very high standard adopted by *Mondev* has been endorsed by a multitude of tribunals, NAFTA280 and non-NAFTA281 alike. The Tribunal also notes that the test has been proposed by Respondent282 and endorsed by both Non-Disputing Parties283.\n\nE.g., *Loewen,* para. 133, *Waste Management,* paras. 95, 98.\n\nE.g., *Chevron II,* para. 8.35, *Dan Cake,* para. 146, footnote 18.\n\nRR, para. 173, RCM, para. 150.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 7, Canada Submission, para. 6.\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the *Mondev* standard as a guide to adjudicate Lion's denial of justice claim. However, some precisions are required in light of the arguments presented by the Parties.\n\n289.\n\nThe starting point for the tribunal in *Mondev* was the *ELSI* judgement. In this case the ICJ assessed the concept of \"arbitrariness\" under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the USA and Italy, in the context of a dispute concerning the requisition and forced liquidation of an insolvent Italian company wholly owned by a US corporation. In this setting the ICJ stated that arbitrariness was284:\n\n\"a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\".\n\n*ELSI,* para. 128.\n\n290.\n\nThe *Mondev* tribunal replicated the above statement285. Taking this isolated sentence, Mexico has suggested that a finding of denial of justice requires \"evidence of intention or malice, collusion, corruption, or flagrant abuse by the Respondent's judicial system\"286.\n\n*Mondev*, para. 127.\n\nRR, para. 9. See also RR, paras. 223, 230.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Mexico's conclusion, which is only the result of an incomplete reading of the *Mondev* standard.\n\n292.\n\nThe *Mondev* tribunal acknowledge that the *ELSI* standard was defined in the context of evaluating arbitrariness, but considered it useful in further defining the test for denial of justice287. The tribunal continued stating that for denial of justice288:\n\n\"... the test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome..\".\n\n*Mondev,* para. 127.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n293.\n\nThe tribunal continued to frame this test within the standard of FET under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA289:\n\n\"In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment\".\n\n*Mondev,* para. 127.\n\n294.\n\nIn defining the test for denial of justice, nowhere does the *Mondev* tribunal allude to a subjective element. Moreover, in assessing international liability of the Contracting States under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, the tribunal explicitly rejected this possibility290:\n\n\"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith\" [Emphasis added].\n\n*Mondev,* para. 116.\n\n295.\n\nOther NAFTA tribunals have endorsed this view291. For instance, the *Glamis Gold* tribunal stated292:\n\n\"The Tribunal emphasizes that, although bad faith may often be present in such a determination and its presence certainly will be determinative of a violation, a finding of bad faith is not a requirement for a breach of Article 1105(1).\n\nE.g., *ADF,* paras. 180-181, citing the *Mondev* award, *Eli Lilly,* para. 222 endorsing the standard from *Glamis Gold.*\n\n*Glamis Gold,* para. 627.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees: a wilful and intentional illicit conduct by local Courts may serve as the grounds for a finding of denial of justice. Wilful intent thus, might be an accessory element in discerning whether denial of justice has occurred, but it is not a necessary requirement.\n\n297.\n\nThe *Loewen* tribunal used a similar test, stressing that denial of justice is procedural293:\n\n\"[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety\".\n\n*Loewen,* para. 132.\n\n298.\n\n*Loewen* also endorsed the *Mondev* view that under contemporary international customary law, bad faith or malicious intent is not required for a denial of justice claim, framed within the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Article 1105(1) NAFTA294:\n\n\"Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice\".\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Loewen,* para. 132.\n\n299.\n\nIn conclusion, the test is an objective one: denial of justice requires a finding of an improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts (whether intentional or not), which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n**2.** **C****laimant****'****s position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nLion says that Mexico breached its duty to treat it in a fair and equitable manner through denying Lion justice in its pursuit of legal remedies against the Debtors: Claimant argues that it was not accorded proper due process rights, since first, it was not granted the opportunity to be heard and then, it was deprived of the legal means to defend its rights (**2.1.**); Lion also maintains that it suffered undue delay in the local proceedings (**2.2.**); finally, Lion argues that it complied with the exhaustion of local remedies rule (**2.3.**).\n\n**2.1** **C****laimant was denied due process**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nClaimant argues that it was denied justice through the violation of its due process rights by being barred access to justice (**A.**) and being prevented from presenting its case before local courts and marshalling evidence to support it (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Lion was denied access to justice**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nClaimant was denied the chance to participate before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* because it was never properly served.\n\n303.\n\nUnder Mexican law, proper notification by a Court is subject to making certain (*\"cerciorarse\"*) that the defendant indeed resides in the place where service is made; the service confirmation should explain the reason that led the Court to be certain (\"*convencimiento*\")295. This obligation is enshrined in Arts. 111, 112 and 112 bis, of the Civil Procedure Code of Jalisco [\"**CPC Jalisco**\"]296. Additionally, Art. 279 of CPC Jalisco requires the *Juez de lo Mercantil* to \"examine the legality of the service of process\" (*\"examinar\u00e1 la legalidad del emplazamiento\"*) before declaring Lion in default297.\n\nCR, para. 450.\n\nCM, para. 328.\n\nCR, para. 452, citing CPC Jalisco, Art. 279.\n\n304.\n\nLion argues that Mexico clearly failed to comply with these provisions.\n\n305.\n\n*First,* the Court based the citation address solely on the domicile indicated by the plaintiff, designated in the Forged Settlement Agreement - a document which was not an original and bore no original signatures. This notwithstanding, the Court accepted the false information without further research298.\n\nCR, para. 453, citing Exh. C-73.\n\n306.\n\n*Second* the Court's *actuario* failed to \"include particular reasons or objective proof'299, and to indicate the means upon which Lion's domicile was corroborated; apparently, the Court's *actuario* only relied on the word of the person served, Lic. Jos\u00e9 Isaac L\u00f3pez Medina, although he provided no indication or proof of his position at Lion nor any evidence that he had representation powers300. According to Claimant, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* acted erroneously and failed to exercise diligence to ensure that Lion was properly served301.\n\nZamora I, para. 149, footnote 202, judicial precedent (first version), \u00abdebe expresar las razones particulares o medios de convicci\u00f3n [...] tanto objetivos (aquellos que aprecie directamente el funcionario), como subjetivos (los que le sean proporcionados por otras personas), para tener la certeza [...], ya que si carece de tales datos, no puede sostenerse jur\u00eddicamente la legalidad del emplazamiento\u00bb quoted by Claimant in CM, para. 236.\n\nCR, paras. 87-90; CM, para. 327.\n\nCR, para. 103, CM, para. 328.\n\n307.\n\n*Third,* Lion avers that notification by *c\u00e9dula* was inappropriate given the circumstances of the case302. According to Lion, notification by judicial bulletins or boards amounts to fictitious service of process, which is clearly inconsistent with the treatment to be given to a foreign company303. Service on Claimant by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* was inconsistent with two international treaties to which Mexico is party - the Inter-American Convention on Letters Rogatory (with its Additional Protocol) and the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters304 - personal service to Lion should have been made via an international cooperation mechanism305.\n\nCR, para. 461-475.\n\nCR, para. 462.\n\nCR, paras. 438-446.\n\nCR, paras. 446-447.\n\n308.\n\n*Furthermore,* Claimant reinforces its argument by stating that a different standard for service was employed by judicial personnel with regard to the Debtors. For example, Claimant observes that while in average, it took a Court in Mexico 42 days to admit and serve a lawsuit306, the *Juez de lo Civil* failed to serve the *Juicio Hipotecario* on Inmobiliaria Bains for more than three years, and at the same time required only 22 days to serve the incorrect *emplazamiento* on Lion307.\n\nCM, para. 40, citing Exh. CLA-137.\n\nCM, para. 40.\n\n309.\n\n*Finally,* Lion avers that it was limited in its pursuit of justice before local Courts, because it was barred from bringing an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation Judgment, due to an incorrect decision by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* granting said Judgment *res judicata* effect in only 42 days, at the request of the Debtors308.\n\nCPHB, para. 79; CM, paras. 270, 393.\n\n**B.** **Claimant was deprived of its right to exercise means of defense**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nClaimant says that it was not allowed to properly defend itself. Respondent denied it access to justice through its Courts' continuous failure to scrutinize the authenticity of the forged documents309:\n\nCM, paras. 344-350.\n\n311.\n\n*First,* the *Juez de lo Mercantil* should have looked *ex officio* into the nature of the Forged Settlement Agreement and the documentation indicating that Lion was a foreign company310 before declaring Lion in default311.\n\nCR, para. 101, citing Zamora IV, para. 86.\n\nCR, paras. 104-106.\n\n312.\n\n*Second,* Mexico's Courts have denied Lion the opportunity to prove the forgery. Lion submitted the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* as soon as it gained knowledge of the facts underlying the forgery and cannot be blamed for not having raised the issue *ab initio*312. In Claimant's view, lack of service is a breach of such a magnitude under Mexican law that the *Juez de Distrito* should have allowed all evidence and arguments that are necessary to prove the circumstances of the allegedly illegal service313, yet the *Juez de Distrito* dismissed any evidence pointing to the falsehood of the *emplazamiento*314*.* And then the *Juez de Distrito's* decision in the remand *Amparo* refused to admit Sr. Arechederra's testimony, thereby depriving Lion of the principal evidence that could prove that the person alleged to have signed the False Amparo did not do so315.\n\nCR, paras. 135-139.\n\nCR, para. 153.\n\nCR, para. 152.\n\nCM, para. 379.\n\n313.\n\n*Third,* none of Mexico's Courts seized of Lion's proceedings ruled on the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement. The *Juez de Distrito* refused to decide on the issue316; the *Tribunal de Queja* refused as well317, ruling that the question should be resolved after the False *Amparo* issue was decided in the Remand *Amparo;* and finally the *Juez de Distrito* refused318, understanding that the *Tribunal de Queja* had excluded from the admissible evidence the evidence concerning the falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement319. Ultimately, Lion's *Amparo* claim was thus frustrated.\n\nCR, paras. 130-141.\n\nCR, paras. 146-147.\n\nThis time in the Remand *Amparo.*\n\nCR, paras. 155-157, CM, para. 379.\n\n**2.2** **M****exico****'****s unreasonable delay in administering justice**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Mexico's Courts failed to decide Lion's *Amparo* claim within a reasonable time.\n\n315.\n\nClaimant avers that the time required for the resolution of the *Amparo* lawsuit was at odds with the usual duration of such proceedings in Mexico. According to the statistics from the Mexican *Consejo de la Judicatura Federal,* the *Amparo* lawsuit took almost four times as long as the average for the same year320.\n\nCM, para. 376.\n\n316.\n\nTo determine if this delay is unreasonable and amounts to a denial of justice, international tribunals consider three features321:\n\n\"- The complexity of the matter: Claimant maintains that the claim submitted to the *Juez de Distrito* and the *Tribunal de Queja* was not complex; given that the service was performed at the address and to the person mentioned in the Forged Settlement Agreement, there was only one issue to be decided by the Courts in order to determine whether Lion was properly served - was the Forged Settlement Agreement authentic?322 Claimant states that under normal circumstances, the authenticity of a document is a factual issue that is disposed of preliminarily as a procedural incident323.\"\n\n\"- The procedural diligence of the interested parties: Claimant did not cause any undue delay through its actions during the Real *Amparo* proceedings324; as soon as it learned of the existence of the Forged Settlement Agreement, it filed a petition to challenge its authenticity325.\"\n\n- Whether celerity is especially warranted to avoid harm generated in the legal situation of the person involved in the process: Lion submits that celerity was essential because the *Amparo* claim, as a remedy to ultimately prevent the cancellation of the Mortgages, would become ineffective as time went by326.\n\nCM, para. 342, 364.\n\nCM, para. 366.\n\nCM, para. 369.\n\nCM, para. 374.\n\nCM para. 132.\n\nCM, para. 370-371.\n\n317.\n\nOn a separate note, Claimant compares the delay in its claims with the unusual speed of the Cancellation Judgment, which deprived it of its investment in Mexico327.\n\nCPHB, paras. 79-80.\n\n**2.3** **C****laimant complied with the exhaustion of local remedies rule**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nClaimant begins by stating that under international law, the State arguing that a party has failed to exhaust local remedies has the burden to prove the existence, availability and adequacy of such remedies328, and Mexico has failed to discharge this duty.\n\nCM, p. 390, citing *ELSI,* at p. 47, para. 62 (\"*it was for Italy to show, as a matter of fact, the existence of a remedy which was open to the United States stockholders and which they failed to employ\"'),* *Diallo,* p. 600, para. 44, (\"[*i*]*t is for the respondent to convince the Court that there were effective remedies in its domestic legal system that were not exhausted 1.... Thus, in the present case 1...]; it is, on the other hand, for the DRC to prove that there were available and effective remedies in its domestic legal system against the decision to remove\").*\n\n319.\n\nAccording to Lion, it fully complied with the exhaustion requirement as it did pursue all adequate remedies available to it329 (**A.**)\n\nCR, para. 420-421.\n\n320.\n\nNotwithstanding, Lion was not required to exhaust all local remedies because:\n\n- The remedies available were inadequate, ineffective and their exhaustion unreasonable330 (**B.**), and\n\n- A denial of justice for undue delay claim is not subject to the exhaustion requirement331 (**C.**).\n\nCR, paras. 506-520.\n\nCM, paras .392, 394.\n\n**A.** **Lion's claims did not require further action before Mexico's courts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nLion argues that the exhaustion of local remedies rule applies to those domestic recourses that are likely to be successful. In the case at hand, the remedies to be exhausted would be those which could reinstate the Mortgages to Lion; and Lion did pursue them332. Lion was not required to initiate any proceedings other than the *Amparo* as it was not feasible for it to launch the *juicio de nulidad,* which offered inferior protection to the Amparo route. The criminal proceedings did not offer appropriate protection either.\n\nCM, p. 400.\n\n322.\n\nClaimant elaborates on the concept of 'original judicial misconduct'333 and distinguishes between the initial wrong, the denial of justice and the exhaustion of local remedies, which requires the exhaustion of all adequate available remedies334. Following this threefold concept, Claimant avers that in the present case:\n\n\"- The initial wrong would be the Debtors' fraudulent actions;\"\n\n- The denial of justice would be the breach of Lion's right to be heard by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* and\n\n- What followed after the Cancellation Proceeding (i.e., the *Amparo* Proceeding, the Revision Appeal Proceeding and the Remanded Proceeding) is the exhaustion of local remedies, where the \"system\" failed to correct the initial miscarriage of justice335.\n\nCR, para. 417 citing *Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 175.\n\nCR, paras. 418-419.\n\nCR, paras. 420-420.\n\n323.\n\nLion argues that, since all three elements were met, it did in fact exhaust the adequate available local remedies, thus complying with the exhaustion rule under international law336.\n\nCR, para. 421.\n\n**B.** **Lion was exempted from exhausting available local remedies**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nIn any event, Claimant states that, under international law, it was exempted from the exhaustion rule as the local remedies were inadequate, ineffective and their exhaustion unreasonable337.\n\nCPHB, paras. 226-230.\n\n325.\n\nLion uses the *Loewen* standard, stating that only \"remedies which are effective and adequate and are reasonably available to the complainant in the circumstances in which it is situated\" must be exhausted338.\n\nCPHB, para. 226, citing *Loewen,* para. 168.\n\n326.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the rule provides that only effective remedies, i.e., those providing a reasonable possibility of an effective remedy, must be exhausted and such effectiveness is to be assessed in light of the circumstances in advance of resorting to the remedy (*ex ante),* rather than in light of the actual outcome of the case and in light of the nature of the violation the remedy is aimed at correcting339.\n\nCPHB, para. 227; RR, paras. 511-512; CM, paras. 403-404.\n\n327.\n\n*Secondly,* only those remedies which can reasonably be demanded from the investor are to be exhausted. In the present arbitration, the remedies available to Lion were neither effective nor reasonable340:\n\n\"- Lion's secured returns on its investments were declining every day and Lion would never be made whole because the Debtors' indebtedness continued to grow and exceeded the value of the collateral;\"\n\n- Pursuing the Remand *Amparo* would have been unreasonably inefficient and would likely have taken more than three additional years.\n\nCPHB, para. 227; CM, pp. 405 and 410.\n\n**C.** **Denial of justice for undue delay does not require exhaustion**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nClaimant invokes the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection to state that under customary international law, local remedies do not need to be exhausted when there is undue delay in obtaining justice and this delay may be attributed to the Host State341.\n\nCM, para. 394, citing I.L.C. Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 15, Exh. CLA-284.\n\n329.\n\nLion therefore submits that its denial of justice for undue delay claim is exempted from the exhaustion requirement342.\n\nCM, paras. 394 and 396\n\n**3.** **M****exico****'****s position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nMexico avers that Lion was not denied access to justice as it was given proper opportunity to be heard and to exercise its right of defense (**2.1.**). Additionally, there was no unreasonable delay in the Courts' proceedings (**2.2.**). Even if the Tribunal finds that Lion was denied justice, its claim should fail as it did not comply with the exhaustion of local remedies requirement (**2.3.**). Finally, Mexico presents a list of preliminary objections to Lion's claims (**2.4.**).\n\n**3.1** **R****espondent fully accorded claimant procedural due process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nRespondent argues that Lion was neither denied access to justice (**A.**) nor barred from defending its case and presenting documents to support it (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Mexico's judiciary did not deny Claimant the opportunity to be heard**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nAccording to Mexico, Claimant's allegations that the *Juez de lo Mercantil* failed to properly serve it are mistaken343:\n\nCM, 70-79.\n\n333.\n\n*First,* Mexico is also a victim of the Forged Settlement Agreement344. The *actuario* had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement. Under Mexican law, a Judge has the obligation to verify that the document that serves as the basis for the legal action is compliant, but the Judge lacks power to question its authenticity345. According to Respondent, Claimant has provided no evidence to suggest that the *Juez* knew or should have known that the contact information was false346. Claimant also ignores the fact that the *Juez* had no *prima facie* reason not to rely on the documentation before him347.\n\nCRM, 64-65.\n\nRCM, para. 73, citing Ovalle I, para. 87.\n\nRCM, para. 72.\n\nRR, para. 231.\n\n334.\n\n*Second,* the *actuario'*s duty is limited to making sure \"that service takes place at the domicile provided by the claimant\"348. In this case:\n\n\"- The *actuario* performed service at the address identified by the plaintiff; this service was directed at the legal representative of Lion, as confirmed by the *actuario*349.\"\n\n\"- On the first attempt of service, dated 3 April, 2012, the *actuario* left a citation with Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina ordering the legal representative to be present at a specified date and time to facilitate service; given the legal representative's absence, the *emplazamiento* could be effectuated upon any individual present at the time - in this case, it was Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, who was also identified in the Settlement Agreement as authorized to receive notification on behalf of Claimant350.\n\nRR, para. 75.\n\nRR, para. 78, citing Ovalle II, para. 37.\n\nRCM, paras. 76-77.\n\n335.\n\nThe *emplazamiento* was correct: according to the Supreme Court, the *emplazamiento* has to be performed with the legal representative351 and, if this is not possible, the *actuario* simply has to ask for the legal representative before performing service upon any other person present at the moment352.\n\nRCM, para. 78.\n\nRCM, para. 78 citing Exh. RL-39: \"*NOTIFICACION A TRAVES DE UNA PERSONA DISTINTA DEL INTERESADO YA PERSONAS MORALES REQUISITOS EN EL ACTA QUE SE LEVANTE\".*\n\n**B.** **Claimant was accorded the right to exercise means of defense**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\n*First,* if anyone is to be blamed for the Forged Settlement Agreement never being scrutinized by the judicial system in Mexico, it is Lion, whose negligence was the reason why the Courts could not admit the additional evidence353: Claimant should have included references to the alleged fraud in its original *Amparo* claim, rather than seeking to introduce them through the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda*354.\n\nCRM, para. 95, RR, paras. 102 and 103.\n\nRR, para. 245, citing Ovalle II, para. 108.\n\n337.\n\nHaving failed to include fraud issues, the *Juez de Distrito* followed the law when it adjudicated a claim for improper notification *(\"falta de emplazamiento\"*) rather than a claim for forgery355. Therefore, the *Juez de Distrito* was bound to deliver the judgment that it did and Lion cannot claim a denial of justice due to its own negligence in pursuing its claims.\n\nRR, para. 94-96.\n\n338.\n\nIn its decision to dismiss the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda,* the *Secretario del Juzgado de Distrito* acted in accordance with local law, which did not require him to grant Lion an opportunity to cure its procedural defects356. It was Lion who failed to demonstrate the necessary link between its claim and the Forged Settlement Agreement357.\n\nRR, para. 100, citing Ovalle II, para. 91.\n\nRR, para. 102.\n\n339.\n\nWhen Claimant disagreed with the *Juez de Distrito'*s decision, it exercised its right to challenge it through a review proceeding, but lost358 due to one more failure to follow procedural law: the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* must be signed either by the aggrieved party or by its legal representative359. Lion does not appear to contest the fact that it filed its *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* improperly360. Therefore, it was not denied the right to present evidence and defend its case.\n\nRR, para. 105.\n\nRR, paras. 246-247.\n\nRCM, para. 95.\n\n340.\n\n*Second,* the *Juez de Distrito* in the Remand *Amparo* did not dismiss all of Lion's evidence, but rather explained that some of it was already on the Court's record361; in any event, the *Juez de Distrito* was not empowered to admit new evidence in respect of the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement in the Remand *Amparo* and acted in complete accordance with applicable procedural rules362.\n\nRR, para. 268, with regard to the voicher purporting to prove that Mr. Arechederra could not have signed the False Request for Copies and the *Juez de Distrito's* decision on the false nature of the False Request for Copies, citing Exh. C-123.\n\nRR, paras. 259-260.\n\n341.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant cannot claim that the decisions to dismiss the additional evidence were the result of an idiosyncratic or arbitrary decision363. By failing to follow the applicable procedural rules, Lion and not Mexico is responsible for Lion's inability to present evidence and defend its case before Mexico's Courts.\n\nCRM, para. 96.\n\n**3.2** **M****exico****'****s courts decided** **L****ion****'****s claims within a reasonable time**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nRespondent claims that the duration of each of the stages of the *Amparo* Proceeding was reasonable364:\n\n\"- *First,* the *Amparo* Proceedings took one year to complete, which constitutes an appropriate time given its multiple complexities365;\"\n\n\"- *Second,* the proceedings before the *Tribunal de Queja* took 16 months to complete, which once again was a justifiable time given the extraordinary complexities involved in it366;\"\n\n- *Third,* the *Juez de Distrito* had only started analysing the Remand *Amparo* and cannot be blamed for not delivering a decision due to Claimant's premature withdrawal from the proceedings367.\n\nRR, paras. 250-252.\n\nRR, para. 251.\n\nRR, paras. 261-263.\n\nRR, paras. 273-274.\n\n343.\n\nMexico avers that Claimant still had one or two years of litigation ahead had it chosen to continue, which would not constitute an unusual time given the complexity of the case368. Additionally, Lion is equally responsible for any delay as it waited for four years to initiate the *Juicio Hipotecario*369.\n\nRPHB, para. 109.\n\nIbid.\n\n344.\n\nThere is nothing in the duration of the proceedings that amounts to a wilful disregard of due process of law, which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety. Thus, the duration of the local proceedings does not meet the threshold of a denial of justice through unreasonable delay370.\n\nRR, para. 252.\n\n**3.3** **L****ion failed to exhaust local remedies**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nMexico asserts that Lion did not comply with the requirement of the local remedies rule as it did not exhaust all available remedies (**A.**) and no futility exception is applicable (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Claimant did not exhaust all available local remedies**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant is improperly using the current arbitration as an appeal of the *Amparo* judgment in lieu of Mexico's domestic legal system371.\n\nRR, para. 241.\n\n347.\n\nAccording to Mexico, international law accords the judiciary a greater presumption of regularity and requires a claimant to exhaust local remedies before initiating a denial of justice claim. Otherwise, the host State's judicial system would not have an opportunity to correct itself372.\n\nRCM, para. 169.\n\n348.\n\nRespondent avers that Claimant did not exhaust all available local remedies: it could have and should have initiated a *nulidad de juicio concluido* proceeding and it has also not exhausted the criminal proceedings373.\n\nRPHB, paras. 116-118, RR, paras. 127-137, Ovalle II, para. 109.\n\n349.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent emphasizes that a denial of justice may only occur with regard to a State's entire judicial system and not separate judicial acts374; a claim of denial of justice can only be based on adjudicative measures that are final. Since Claimant has not exhausted all available options of seeking recourse under Mexican law, it is barred from pursuing a denial of justice claim375.\n\nRR, paras. 198-201.\n\nRR, para. 126, RCM, para. 79.\n\n**B.** **The futility exceptions to the exhaustion rule does not find application in the current case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nAccording to Mexico, the futility standard is high and is not met here376. Instances of ineffectiveness and futility include situations where377:\n\n\"- the local Courts have no jurisdiction over the dispute;\"\n\n\"- the local Courts are notoriously lacking in independence;\"\n\n\"- the local Courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate and adequate remedy; and\"\n\n- the absence of an adequate system of judicial protection.\n\nRCM, para. 207.\n\nRCM, para. 206, citing Exh. RL-51, pp. 118-119 citing J. Dugard, \"Third Report on Diplomatic Protection to the ILC\", *UN Doc. A/CN.4/523* and Add. 1, at pp. 14-17, paras. 38-44.\n\n351.\n\nThere has been no suggestion by Claimant of a lack of jurisdiction or independence or incompetence or inadequate judicial protection. In fact, Claimant was in the process of seeking remedy through the Remand *Amparo* when it prematurely and unnecessarily withdrew from the proceedings378.\n\nRCM, para. 207.\n\n352.\n\nMexico argues that Lion failed to prove that there was an unavailability of obtaining recourse pursuant to *Apotex*, and instead simply abandoned local proceedings based on its perceived low likelihood of being granted its desired relief379.\n\nRCM, paras. 210-212.\n\n**3.4** **L****ion is barred from bringing its claims**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nMexico additionally raises a number of preliminary objections to Lion's claims. These include:\n\n\"- Lion is not protected under NAFTA Art. 1105, a rule which, according to Mexico, applies only to investments but not to investors380;\"\n\n\"- Lion failed to exercise due diligence and made irrational business decisions when it decided to grant the Loans to the Debtors, when it improvidently extended their maturities and postponed the decision to foreclose, and when it took the erroneous decision not to foreclose on the Guadalajara Mortgages381; and\"\n\n- Mexico's Courts were confronted with a sophisticated fraud and acted appropriately. Additionally, Mexico's Courts should be excused because there is no allegation that its Judges acted with an intention of malice, or that their decisions were impaired by collusion or corruption382.\n\nRR, para. 138; RCM, paras. 134-144.\n\nRPHB, paras. 14-60; RR, paras. 140-147.\n\nRPHB, para. 65-66; RR, paras. 2, 9, 214, 220, 223,230; RCM, paras. 11 and 64.\n\n**4.** **T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s decision**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nIn the following section, the Tribunal will briefly analyse and dismiss Respondent's preliminary objections (**4.1.**); then it will establish that Lion was indeed denied justice by Mexico's judiciary, in breach of NAFTA Art. 1105 (**4.2.**), and thereafter dismiss Mexico's counterargument that Lion failed to exhaust available and reasonable local remedies (**4.3.**).\n\n**4.1** **R****espondent****'****s preliminary objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address Mexico's preliminary objections (summarized in section 3.4. *supra):*\n\nNAFTA Art. 1105 protects investments and investors\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nMexico's first argument is based on a literal reading of Art. 1105 of NAFTA, which provides that Mexico \"shall accord to investments of investors\" of the other treaty Parties treatment in accordance with international law, including FET and FPS. Respondent says that Art. 1105 only extends protection to investments, but not to investors383.\n\nRR, para. 138, RCM, paras. 134-144.\n\n357.\n\nContrary to Mexico's submission, the Tribunal finds that NAFTA Art. 1105 does indeed grant protection to Lion as an investor.\n\n358.\n\nThe FTC Interpretation Note equates the standard of protection to be applied under Art. 1105 of the NAFTA with the standard of \"customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\". The reference to \"aliens\", in a context of investment protection, can only mean investors. A multitude of NAFTA Tribunals have also construed Art. 1105 as a source of protection for investors rather than solely for their investments.384\n\nSee e.g.,*Gami,* para. 91; *Chemtura,* para. 179; Exh. CLA-139; *Merrill,* para. 83.\n\nLack of due diligence and irrational business decisions\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unconvinced by Respondent's argument that Lion failed to exercise due diligence and made irrational business decisions.\n\n360.\n\nWhen Lion took the business decision to grant various short-term loans to bridge finance the acquisition of certain real estate Claimant, it was already a seasoned investor in Mexico. To secure its rights, Claimant engaged Mexican counsel and formalized the transaction in the instruments which, under Mexican law, grant creditors the maximum level of legal certainty:*pagar\u00e9s* and *hipotecas.* Mexico has failed to draw the Tribunal's attention to any other action (bar abstaining from investing in Mexico) which Claimant could have taken to improve its contractual rights and facilitate enforcement through the Courts.\n\n361.\n\nThe business decisions impugned by the Respondent were largely prior to the involvement of the Mexican courts. They form part of the factual and legal matrix submitted to the jurisdiction of the Mexican courts, and irrespective of the wisdom of these decisions (when viewed with hindsight) the Claimant was entitled to the protection of its rights by the Mexican courts in accordance with Mexican law.\n\n362.\n\nClaimant cannot be blamed for its decision to negotiate with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas before launching a Court action to enforce the Mortgages. It was within Lion's discretion either, to try to reach an amicable solution with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, or to seek foreclosure on the Guadalajara Properties. The relevant issue in the present case is whether Lion could effectively avail itself of the protection it was entitled to under Mexican law, if it opted to enforce the Mortgages.\n\n363.\n\nThe case law invoked by Mexico is inapposite385.\n\nThe *MTD v. Chile* tribunal explicitly dealt with a situation where the claimants' lack of diligence consisted in that they failed to \"protect themselves contractually\"; in cases *Churchill Mining* and *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy* the tribunals decided that the BIT could not protect against usual business risks or their unwise business decisions. See: *MTD v. Chile,* para. 178; *Churchill Mining,* para. 506; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy,* para. 478.\n\nFraud as an excuse\n------------------\n\n364.\n\nFinally, Respondent invites the Tribunal to take into account the contextual factors of the case which include386\n\n- The existence of an alleged multi-Level sophisticated fraud, and\n\n- The absence of allegation that The Mexican judiciary acted with an intention of malice, collusion, corruption, or flagrant abuse of judicial procedure.\n\nRR, para. 223.\n\n365.\n\nRespondent avers that its Courts acted appropriately in the circumstances they faced387 and that they (like Claimant) also fell victim to Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's fraudulent scheme.\n\nRPHB, para. 66.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with Mexico that the evidence marshalled in this case supports the conclusion that Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and the Debtors engaged in a sophisticated fraud, which resulted in the cancellation of the Mortgages in the *Registro P\u00fablico.* But the existence of a fraud, however sophisticated, does not excuse the respondent State from its duty to have a properly functioning judicial system:\n\n\"- Any proper judicial system must have robust safeguards, which minimize the risk that aliens are not properly notified of procedures filed against them, and that *in absentia* judgements against aliens are only adopted, when the Court is satisfied that the aliens have been properly notified and are aware that they are being sued;\"\n\n\"- A properly functioning judicial system must avoid that false information maliciously provided to the Courts is used, without proper review, to the detriment of an unsuspecting third parties;\"\n\n\"- Finally, the judicial system must offer effective solutions for situations when the falsehood of the party-provided information is detected once a judgment to the detriment of the alien has been rendered; in such cases, the system must facilitate that the aggrieved third party can make allegations and present evidence to overturn the wrongful judgement.\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding that Lion has indeed suffered a denial of justice is based on the premise that the Mexican judicial system, in particular, the Courts of Jalisco, have failed to function properly, to the detriment of Lion, a protected investor under NAFTA (as will be further discussed in section 4.2. *infra).*\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that Lion is not alleging that Mexico's Courts acted in bad faith to the detriment of an alien, nor that they colluded with the fraudsters nor that the judicial decisions were tainted by corruption. The Tribunal will consequently accept as proven that the Mexican judicial system acted in good faith, without colluding with Sr. C\u00e1rdenas or the Debtors, and without any impairment by corruption. That said, the Tribunal has already established that a finding of bad faith, is not required to make an adjudication for denial of justice (see section 1.3D *supra).*\n\n**4.2** **D****enial of justice**\n---------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe starting point of any analysis of denial of justice must be an acknowledgement that in this area the Tribunal's powers are subject to strict limitations: the Tribunal is not a municipal Court of appeal; it should pay deference to decisions as to the merits properly adopted by municipal Courts, and should offer such Courts a wide margin of appreciation before the threshold of denial of justice is trespassed. The Tribunal also identifies with the presumption, set forth in *Chevron,* that municipal Courts have acted properly unless Claimant proves otherwise388.\n\n*Chevron II*, para. 8.35.\n\n370.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal accepts and supports the finding that the standard for a finding of denial of justice is high, and that Claimant must prove, to the Tribunal satisfaction, that the municipal Courts incurred in an improper and egregious procedural conduct which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety389.\n\nSee para. 296 *supra.*\n\n371.\n\nApplying this high standard, the Tribunal is persuaded that Lion was indeed denied procedural justice in three respects:\n\n\"- Lion was denied access to justice: Lion was, without its fault, never given the opportunity to defend itself in the Cancellation Proceeding (**A.**);\"\n\n\"- Lion was also denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement: the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* the same authority who had rendered the Cancellation Judgment, adopted a subsequent decision, at the request of the Debtor, giving *res iudicata* effect (*causar estado*) to the Cancellation Judgement and preclosing any opportunity of appeal (**B.**);\"\n\n- Lion was also denied the right to allege in the *Amparo* Proceeding that the Forged Settlement Agreement had indeed been forged and to present evidence to prove this claim: three years into the *Amparo* Proceeding the forgery claim had still not been admitted within the *Amparo* Proceeding (**C.**).\n\n**A.** **Lion was denied access to justice**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nLion, a Canadian corporation with corporate domicile in Dallas, Texas390, was never properly notified that it was being sued in the Cancellation Proceeding, which the Debtors had filed before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* in Jalisco, requesting the cancellation of the Mortgages. Being unaware of these Proceedings, Lion failed to appear before the *Juez* and failed to submit a defense. As a result, the *Juez* declared Lion *en rebeld\u00eda,* and without any further effort to ascertain whether Lion was aware of the Proceedings, issued the Cancellation Judgement *in absentia*, mandating that the Mortgages be forthwith cancelled*.*\n\nExh. C-1, p. 7.\n\n373.\n\nThe Cancellation Proceeding was procedurally faulty - Lion was never properly notified; and the consequences of the defective notification were devastating to its case. The conduct of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* by itself does not amount to a denial of justice. What is relevant, however, is that the Mexican judiciary never corrected this situation, despite multiple opportunities to do so at Lion's request.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize the Parties' positions (**a.**), the proven facts (**b.**) and the applicable law (**c.**) and then analyse why the conduct of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* is the basis of the denial of justice (**d.**).\n\n**a. Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nLion claims that it was denied access to justice by Mexico's courts - it was never notified of the Cancellation Lawsuit and thus never participated in it, and as a consequence was declared *en rebeld\u00eda* without fault.\n\n376.\n\nThis was due to the *actuario* not performing basic diligence in the service391 and the *Juez de lo Mercantil* sanctioning the faulty *emplazamiento* despite the applicable law requiring that he examine *de oficio y de manera exhaustiva* whether the defendant was duly served392.\n\nCPHB, paras. 66, 69; CR, paras. 78, 86-96; CM, paras. 96-98.\n\nCPHB, para. 71. 74; CR, paras. 103-105; CM, para. 99.\n\n377.\n\nMexico responds by stating that nothing in the *actuario'*s service or the actions of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* was irregular. Both adhered to the standards prescribed by the applicable State and Federal Mexican law393.\n\nRPHB, paras. 70-71; RR, paras. 77-83, 85-87; RCM, paras. 72-78.\n\n378.\n\nRespondent says the *actuario* duly confirmed that the address indicated in the basis for the service *(citatorio)* was the same as the one in the notice of service394. The *actuario* additionally relied on the representation of Mr. Lopez Medina that the address was Lion's actual place of business and that he was authorized to receive notice on Lion's behalf395. These two elements of the *actuario's* conduct satisfy the level of scrutiny required by the applicable law396.\n\nRPHB, para. 71; RR, para. 77; RCM, paras. 76-77.\n\nRPHB, para. 71; RR, para. 77; RCM, paras. 76-77.\n\nOvalle II, para. 37.\n\n379.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal were to find irregularities in the *emplazamiento* or *declaraci\u00f3n en rebeld\u00eda,* these would not be sufficient for a finding of denial of justice as recourse from the decision of the Juez de lo Mercantil was available to Claimant, which it did pursue397.\n\nRPHB, para. 74; RR, paras. 71-73; RCM, para. 79.\n\n**b. Facts**\n------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize the facts that underlie the denial of access to justice to Lion by Mexico's Courts.\n\n381.\n\nOn April 3, 2012 the *actuario* (a court officer of the *Juez de lo Mercantil)* attempted a first service of process [the *\"****emplazamiento\"***] at the address identified in clause 7 of the Forged Settlement Agreement. The service attempt was made on Lic. Jos\u00e9 Isaac L\u00f3pez Medina398, one of the two lawyers identified in the Forged Agreement399, who apparently had his office at that address. There is no evidence that Lion at any time had an office or other type of establishment at that address, or that it had ever had any business or professional relationship with Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina.\n\nExh. C-52.\n\nExh. C-53.\n\n382.\n\nConfronted by the *actuario,* Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina formally declared that no legal representative of Lion was present in his office in order to receive the *emplazamiento* (a statement which evidently was true, Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina himself never having had any power of attorney to represent Lion and no other director or representative of Lion being present). Upon receipt of this representation, the *actuario* withdrew, announcing that he would return the next day. There is no evidence that Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina ever informed Lion of these facts.\n\n383.\n\nAt that second visit, which occurred next day, again no legal representative of Lion was present, since Lion was totally unaware of these occurrences in Jalisco. This being so, the *actuario* decided to make the *emplazamiento* against Lion through a *notificaci\u00f3n por c\u00e9dula* delivered to the person who was at the address, Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina400.\n\nExh. C-52; CR, paras. 95-96.\n\n384.\n\nLic. L\u00f3pez Medina accepted the *emplazamiento* and received a copy of the judicial file (\"*autos\"*). In the *emplazamiento* the *actuario* informed Lion that it had a 15-day period to appear before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* and submit its defense, and that if it failed to do so it would be held *en rebeld\u00eda*401*.*\n\nExh. C 52, p. 2.\n\n385.\n\nThere is no evidence that Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, with whom Lion had no relationship402, ever informed Lion that he had accepted the *emplazamiento.* Lion never received the *emplazamiento*403, and being unaware that a Court procedure against it was pending before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* of Jalisco, it inevitably failed to appear within the statutory time-limit.\n\nCM, para. 50.\n\nCM, paras. 133, 307.\n\n386.\n\nThe consequence of this failure was that six weeks thereafter, on May 22, 2012, Lion was declared *en rebeld\u00eda* by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* through notification via *bolet\u00edn judicial*404 (a judicial bulletin)405. Since Lion was not in the habit of reviewing the *boletines judiciales* in Jalisco, nor required to do so, it was completely unaware that it had been declared *en rebeld\u00eda.*\n\nExh. C-73.\n\nClaimant's expert explains that while the Commerce Code as well Mexico's procedural codes and statutes provide for different methods of *emplazamiento,* including through *bolet\u00edn judicial* and *estrados,* for the initial notification of a defendant, only personal service is legally accepted, see Zamora I, para. 142 and footnotes therein. This is not disputed by Mexico.\n\n387.\n\nTwo weeks after the declaration *en rebeld\u00eda,* on June 6, 2012 the Debtors submitted their evidence before the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, including the Mortgage deeds and Minutes of the General Shareholders Meeting of C&C Capital. All the evidence marshalled by the Debtors was admitted six days later, on June 12, 2012406.\n\nExh. C-57.8.\n\n388.\n\nAlthough some of these documents mentioned that Lion was a foreign company domiciled in the United States407, this information seems to have been overlooked or disregarded by the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, because he never made any attempt to notify Lion at any other address. All further communications of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* -including the final judgment - were simply affixed to the *estrados* (notice board), and Lion was presumed to have been properly notified408.\n\nExh. C-74, which refers to Exh. C-10, p. 13; Exh. C-14, p. 1 and Exh. R-13, p. 18.\n\nCM, para. 101.\n\n389.\n\nJust two weeks after the submission of evidence, on June 27, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, acting solely on the basis of the evidence marshalled by the Debtors, and without any participation of Lion, declared the Loans totalling USD 32.85 M settled and ordered Lion to cancel the Mortgages and return the Notes through the Cancellation Judgment409. From the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the rendering of the Cancellation Judgment, only 170 days had lapsed.\n\nExh. C-78, pp. 53-54.\n\n390.\n\nBoth Parties' legal experts agreed at the Hearing that this constituted an unusually short duration410.\n\nCPHB, para. 80; HT, pp. 711-712 (President Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, Dr. Ovalle and Dr. Zamora).\n\n**c. Law**\n----------\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal has already made findings on the nature of denial of justice and the standard that needs to be applied to the facts to decide whether a denial of justice occurred.\n\n392.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal reiterates its view that denial of justice is always procedural411.\n\nSee Section 1.1, *supra.*\n\n393.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal has also established that denial of access to justice is considered denial of justice in its purest form and is a universally accepted type of this international wrong412. The case law and scholarly writings acknowledge that access to justice is impaired when a party is not notified of a proceeding that involves its rights and it is prevented from being heard by the local Courts.\n\nSee Section 1.2A, *supra.*\n\n394.\n\nPaparinskis recalls that413\n\n\"[...] the absence of notification about proceedings that exclude the possibility to challenge them could all result in denial of justice\".\n\nPaparinskis, *op. cit.,* p. 191, footnotes omitted.\n\n395.\n\nThe *Ambatielos* decision also recognizes this basic rule of administration of justice414:\n\n\"\"[...] the foreigner shall enjoy full freedom to appear before the courts for the protection or defence of his rights, whether as plaintiff or defendant; to bring any action provided or authorized by law [...]\".\n\n*Ambatielos,* p. 111.\n\n396.\n\nThirdly, based on the opinions of international scholars and the decisions of investment tribunals, the Tribunal has adopted the prevailing test: a positive finding of denial of justice requires an improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts (whether intentional or not), which does not meet the basic international accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n**d. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n397.\n\nIn a judicial proceeding, a basic principle of natural justice requires that the defendant, who is being sued, is properly notified of the terms of the claims, and is afforded the opportunity to appear before the Court, to rebut these claims, to make allegations and to present evidence.\n\n398.\n\nLion never knew that the Debtors had filed the Cancellation Proceeding against it before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* in Jalisco, and was denied the opportunity to make allegations or present evidence in that Procedure. It was not the Court, but rather third parties, which informed Lion about the existence of the Cancellation Proceeding, after the Cancellation Judgement had been rendered and had become *res iudicata.*\n\nA deeply flawed *emplazamiento*\n-------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nThe *emplazamiento* performed on behalf of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* was deeply flawed.\n\n400.\n\nThe *actuario* served Lion *por c\u00e9dula, i.e.,* via a notification which is not given directly to the respondent, but which can simply be handed to a defendant's relatives, employees or domestic helper415.\n\nCPC Jalisco, Article 112 bis, \"La c\u00e9dula, copias y citatorios, en los casos de los dos art\u00edculos anteriores, se entregar\u00e1n a los parientes o empleados del interesado o en su defecto a cualesquiera otra persona que viva o se encuentre dentro del domicilio, despu\u00e9s de que el notificador se hubiere cerciorado de que all\u00ed vive o de que es el principal asiento de sus negocios, de todo lo cual se asentar\u00e1 raz\u00f3n en la diligencia, incluyendo el medio o la fuente de que se vali\u00f3 o las fuentes de informaci\u00f3n a que tuvo que recurrir para adquirir la certeza senalada\", [Emphasis added]; Zamora IV, para. 59.\n\n401.\n\nLion's expert opines that such service requires a higher degree of certainty than ordinary service, with the *actuario* having to ascertain that the person served is actually at the defendant's domicile, and that such person maintains one of the legally established categories of relationship with the defendant416.\n\nZamora IV, para. 60, Zamora I, para. 149.\n\n402.\n\nMexico's expert admits that according to the applicable law, confirmation of service by the *actuario* should explain the reason that led the *Juez* to be certain that the defendant factually resides in the place service is to be made417.\n\nOvalle I, para. 98.\n\n403.\n\nThe rules to be applied to the *emplazamiento* of Lion were enshrined in Arts. 112418 and 112 bis419 of the CPC Jalisco420.\n\nCPC Jalisco, Article 112, \"La diligencia de emplazamiento se realiza personalmente con el demandado; el servidor p\u00fablico judicial, deber\u00e1 de cerciorarse de la identidad del mismo en la forma prevista por el art\u00edculo 70 de este C\u00f3digo, o, dar fe de que lo conoce; haciendo constar en el acta esa circunstancia. Si se trata de emplazamiento a juicio o de requerimiento y s\u00f3lo si a la primera busca no se encuentra al demandado, se le dejar\u00e1 citatorio para hora fija del d\u00eda siguiente; y si no espera, se le har\u00e1 la notificaci\u00f3n por c\u00e9dula; [...]\".\n\nCPC Jalisco, Article 112 bis, \"La c\u00e9dula, copias y citatorios, en los casos de los dos art\u00edculos anteriores, se entregar\u00e1n a los parientes o empleados del interesado o en su defecto a cualesquiera otra persona que viva o se encuentre dentro del domicilio, despu\u00e9s de que el notificador se hubiere cerciorado de que all\u00ed vive o de que es el principal asiento de sus negocios, de todo lo cual se asentar\u00e1 raz\u00f3n en la diligencia, incluyendo el medio o la fuente de que se vali\u00f3 o las fuentes de informaci\u00f3n a que tuvo que recurrir para adquirir la certeza se\u00f1alada\".\n\nCM, para. 328.\n\n404.\n\nThe general rule is contained in Art. 112 CPC: The *emplazamiento* must be done personally on the respondent (\"*se realiza personalmente con el demandado*\"); if the respondent is not present when the *actuario* arrives, a new visit is scheduled for the next day, and if the respondent is still absent, a *notificaci\u00f3n por c\u00e9dula* is admissible.\n\n405.\n\nArt. 112 bis CPC the regulates the requirements for a valid *notificaci\u00f3n por c\u00e9dula.* The c\u00e9dula can be delivered to a relative, an employee or to any person found at the domicile, subject to a specific requirement: the *actuario* must verify that the defendant has at such domicile its principal place of business *(\"despu\u00e9s de que el notificador se hubiere cerciorado* [...] *de que es el principal asiento de sus negocios\"*)*.*\n\n406.\n\nThe *emplazamiento* performed on Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina by the *actuario* does not satisfy this legal standard: it is clear from the minutes of service filed by the *actuario* that he failed to obtain any evidence that could corroborate that the domicile set-forth in the Forged Settlement Agreement (that is, that *\"n\u00famero* 95, *despacho* 7, *de la calle* Tom\u00e1s V. G\u00f3mez, Colonia Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara (Guadalajara, Jalisco\") was indeed \"*el principal asiento de los negocios*\" of Lion LLC, a Canadian incorporated company). It is specially telling that the *actuario* failed to challenge Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina's authority, and never requested that the lawyer present any evidence linking himself to Lion.\n\n407.\n\nMexico's experts argue that the *actuario* was not obliged to verify the authenticity of the documents serving as the basis for service, and that he did not have the power to do so421. However, another of Mexico's experts accepted at the Hearing that the *actuario* has authority to verify the address for the *emplazamiento*422. Thus, it is clear that the mechanical checking of whether the address matches that in the *citatorio* is not sufficient to meet the standard required of the *actuario* under the CPC Jalisco.\n\nOvalle II, para. 37.\n\nHT, pp. 644-645.\n\n408.\n\nMoreover, the *citatorio*, which served as the basis for the address for notification, contains a discrepancy in the office number, when compared with the address provided in the Forged Settlement Agreement:\n\n- The Forged Settlement Agreement stated that the address was *\"n\u00famero* 95, *despacho* 7, *de la calle* Tom\u00e1s V. G\u00f3mez, Colonia Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara (Guadalajara, Jalisco)\"423.\n\n- The *citatorio* indicated office (*\"despacho)\"* 5, rather than the *despacho* 7424.\n\nExh. C-53, p. 7.\n\nExh. C-23.\n\nA deeply flawed *declaraci\u00f3n en rebeld\u00eda*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nBut not only the *actuario* failed to fulfil its task to ascertain that the *emplazamiento* was proper, so did also the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* who was required to scrutinize whether the *emplazamiento* had been completed without irregularities, before declaring Lion *en rebeld\u00eda.*\n\n410.\n\nUnder Mexican law, the effects of being *en rebeld\u00eda* are draconian: the procedure continues, without the participation of the person declared in default; furthermore the defendant is declared *confeso;* i.e. he/she is legally presumed to have accepted the facts as averred in the counterparty's claim425. Based on such presumption, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* eventually would accept, without further inquiries, the truthfulness of the Forged Settlement Agreement and order its specific performance, including the cancellation of the Mortgages.\n\nExh. C-73.\n\n411.\n\nThis is the reason why Art. 279 CPC requires the *Juez de lo Mercantil* to examine the legality of the service of process before issuing the *declaraci\u00f3n en rebeld\u00eda*:\n\n\"Trascurrido el t\u00e9rmino del emplazamiento sin haber sido contestada la demanda, se har\u00e1 la declaraci\u00f3n de rebeld\u00eda y se observar\u00e1n las prescripciones del cap\u00edtulo I del T\u00edtulo D\u00e9cimo Segundo de este C\u00f3digo. Para hacer la declaraci\u00f3n de rebeld\u00eda, el juez examinar\u00e1 de oficio y de manera exhaustiva si las citaciones, notificaciones y emplazamientos fueron hechas al demandado en la forma establecida por este c\u00f3digo caso contrario, deber\u00e1 reponer el procedimiento sin esperar al dictado de la sentencia.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n412.\n\nThe rule could not be clearer: before declaring respondent *en rebeld\u00eda,* the Judge must examine *ex officio* and exhaustively (\"*de manera exhaustiva*\") whether the *emplazamiento* has been properly performed.\n\n413.\n\nThere is no indication in the case file426, of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* having performed any scrutiny with regard to the *emplazamiento,* let alone \"examining [it] in an exhaustive manner\". The *Juez* mechanically corroborated and accepted that the service had been properly completed by his *actuario*, and did not take any additional measure to verify that the respondent had been properly notified and was actually aware that it was being sued in Jalisco.\n\nExh. C-52; Exh. C-57-3.\n\n414.\n\nThe omission is especially shocking, because the Cancellation Proceeding was not a minor case, but rather a complex procedure, which pitched a group of well-known local companies against a US-based corporation, which affected well-known and highly valuable pieces of real estate located within the State of Jalisco and which could result (and indeed resulted) in the cancellation of multi-million USD Mortgages granted in favour of the US creditor. Under these circumstances the Judge should have double-checked \"*de manera exhaustiva*\" that the respondent had been properly notified.\n\n415.\n\nWith a minimum of diligence, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* could and should have realized that Lion was a foreign company that needed to be served internationally. The information available to the *Juez de lo Mercantil* included:\n\n\"- Lion's denomination, \"LP\", which does not correspond to any incorporation under Mexican law427;\"\n\n\"- A certified copy of the Nayarit Mortgage, where the actual domicile of Lion was specified to be in the US428;\"\n\n\"- Certified copies of the Guadalajara Mortgages, which state that Lion was a company constituted in conformity with the laws of Quebec, Canada429;\"\n\n- The mortgages included as attachments to the Loans, which explicitly state that Lion's domicile is in the US430.\n\n\"- The Minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting of C&C Capital and Inmobiliaria Bains, which also stated that Lion was a legal entity constituted pursuant to the laws of Quebec, Canada431\n\nCPHB, para. 61, also citing HT, pp. 645-646 (Dr. Ovalle).\n\nExh. C-10, p. 13.\n\nExh. C-14, p.1; Exh. C-18, p .1.\n\nExh. C-8, p. 16; Exh. C-12, p. 16; Exh.C-16, p. 15.\n\nExh. R-13, p. 18.\n\n416.\n\nThe omission to verify whether the respondent had been properly notified was exacerbated when subsequent procedural steps and decisions were simply notified by means of a noticeboard in the courthouse. No additional effort was ever made, to ascertain whether Lion was aware of the developments within the Cancellation Proceeding432. Lion was kept completely in the dark.\n\nExh. C-73.\n\n417.\n\nThe lack of any diligence reached its zenith, when the *Juez de lo Mercantil* issued a default judgment, fully accepting the Debtors' claims. No attempt was made to ascertain that Claimant was duly informed of the decision, and of its right to lodge an appeal.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal observes the similarity of the current facts with those in *Cotesworth & Powell,* where the tribunal decided that claimants had been denied justice because of the failure of the judge to summon the absent creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding and later also failing to notify them of the sentence of classification433. The net result was the same: the creditors were unable to participate in a proceeding in the same way that Lion was not given the opportunity to appear before the *Juez de lo Mercantil*.\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 188.\n\n419.\n\nSimilarities may also be drawn between the situation in *Idler,* where the US-Mexico Claims Commission found a denial of the US plaintiff's access to justice, when he was notified of the upcoming hearing in Venezuela with insufficient time left for him to make the necessary travel to appear in court434. Lion was likewise given a formalistic notice to appear - on the *estrados* notice board in the State of Jalisco - which in fact amounted to a lack of effective notification. The end result is the same: an impediment to the aggrieved alien to appear before the local Court and defend its rights.\n\n*Idler,* pp. 152-153.\n\n420.\n\nFinally, Lion's exclusion from the proceedings was exacerbated by the unusual swiftness of the Cancellation Proceeding. Both Parties' legal experts agreed at the Hearing that the 170 days that it took from the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the rendering of the Cancellation Judgment constituted an unusually short duration435.\n\nCPHB, para. 80; HT, pp. 111-112 (President Fernandez-Armesto, Dr. Ovalle and Dr. Zamora).\n\n421.\n\nApplying the established legal standard, the Tribunal finds that depriving Lion of its right to appear before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* through a severely irregular *emplazamiento* and *declaraci\u00f3n en rebeld\u00eda* amounts to an improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts, which does not meet the basic international accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n422.\n\nAs will be analysed in the following sections, the Mexican judiciary never corrected this wrong, despite Lion's numerous requests to the judiciary to do so.\n\n**B.** **Lion was also denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nOnce the Cancellation Judgement had been rendered, the Debtor approached the *Juez de lo Mercantil* (the same who had rendered the Cancellation Judgment), and alleging spurious arguments requested that the *Juez* give *res iudicata* effect (*causar estado*) to the Cancellation Judgement. The *Juez* did so, and barred any possibility of Lion, once it became aware of the Cancellation Judgement, to lodge an appeal.\n\n424.\n\nThe decision of the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* granting *res iudicata* status to the Cancellation Judgement, also constitutes a denial of justice.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal will again apply a fourfold discussion comprising the Party positions (**a.**), the proven facts (**b.**) and the applicable law (**c.**) and an analysis of why the *causar estado* ruling by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* is another component of Mexico's Courts' actions amounting to denial of justice (**d.**).\n\n**a. Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nClaimant says that, as with the Cancellation Proceeding, it was not properly served with the Cancellation Judgment436. On August 8, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil* declared that Claimant had no right to appeal the Cancellation Judgment437 and, upon the Debtors request, issued an order to the Public Registries of Nayarit and Jalisco to cancel the Mortgages438.\n\nCM, para. 108.\n\nCM, para. 107.\n\nCM, para. 111.\n\n427.\n\nRespondent does not offer any argumentation purporting to justify the *Juez*'s decision.\n\n**b. Facts**\n------------\n\n428.\n\nOn June 27, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, acting solely on the basis of the evidence marshalled by the Debtors, and without any participation of Lion, issued the Cancellation Judgement, declaring the Loans settled and ordering Lion to cancel the Mortgages and return the Notes439.\n\nExh. C-78, pp. 53-54.\n\n429.\n\nA few weeks thereafter, on August 8, 2012, and at the request of the Debtors, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* declared that the Cancellation Judgement *\"causa estado por ministerio de la ley\", i.e.* that it has become *res iudicata,* there being no possibility of submitting a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n.* The reason given by the Judge for his decision precluding any further appeal was that the amount claimed in the procedure was less than MEX 500,000 (approximately USD 25,000)440.\n\nExh. C-79 *\"Causar estado\".* pursuant to the definition under CLA-216.\n\n430.\n\nOn August 30, 2012 the *Juez de lo Mercantil* ordered specific performance of the Cancellation Judgement, and instructed the *Registro P\u00fablico* of Jalisco to cancel the Guadalajara Mortgages441 and that of Nayarit to do the same with the Nayarit Mortgage442. The *Registro P\u00fablico* of Jalisco did so on September 7, 2012443. The cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage was recorded on October 19, 2012444. Upon these registrations, all three Mortgages became extinct for all legal purposes.\n\nExh. C-84.\n\nThis was done through a request for assistance of the 1st Civil Judge in Bucer\u00edas, Nayarit to send a following request for cancellation to the *Registro Publico* in Nayarit; Exh. C-86.\n\nExh. C-85.\n\nExh. C-88.\n\n**c. The law**\n--------------\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that denial of justice is always procedural and the test for denial of justice established by the Tribunal under Section VI.1.1.3D above, which remains applicable for the second analysis of facts: improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts (whether intentional or not), which does not meet the basic international accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n432.\n\nSince the second denial of justice pondered by the Tribunal concerns the arbitrary closing of an avenue of appeal that was otherwise guaranteed to it by the law, the conduct of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* falls under the same type of wrong as the deeply flawed *emplazamiento*: denying Lion access to justice.\n\n433.\n\nThe Hague Texts similarly remind that an international wrong occurs when445:\n\n\"the foreigner has been hindered by the judicial authorities in the exercise of his right to pursue judicial remedies\".\n\nHague Texts (n 5) art, 9(2) quoted from Paparinskis, *op. cit.,* p. 190.\n\n434.\n\nIn the same vein, the tribunal in *Krederi* observed that one of the serious defects in the adjudicative process may take the form of a violation of\n\n\"[...] the right to be heard and to present evidence446\"\n\n*Krederi,* para. 449 (iii).\n\n435.\n\nIn analysing whether Lion was denied access to justice through the *causar estado* ruling by the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* the same scholarly writing and case law find application as those cited under Section VI.1.1.2A, *supra.*\n\n**d. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n436.\n\nThe decision of the *Juez de lo Mercantil* to grant *estado* to the Cancellation Judgment was deeply flawed.\n\n437.\n\nUnder Mexican law, commercial cases of the first instance are subject to appeal. The Commercial Code of Mexico states the following:\n\n**\"**Art\u00edculo 1336.- Se llama apelaci\u00f3n el recurso que se interpone para que el tribunal superior confirme, reforme o revoque las resoluciones del inferior que puedan ser impugnadas por la apelaci\u00f3n, en los t\u00e9rminos que se precisan en los art\u00edculos siguientes.\n\nArt\u00edculo 1337.- Pueden apelar de una sentencia:\n\nI. El litigante condenado en el fallo, si creyere haber recibido alg\u00fan agravio [...]\"\n\n438.\n\nThe Commercial Code of Mexico foresees an exception to the general rule, when the value of the dispute is below the threshold of MEX 500,000, adjusted yearly for inflation447:\n\n\"Art\u00edculo 1340. La apelaci\u00f3n no procede en juicios mercantiles cuando por su monto se ventilen en los juzgados de paz o de cuant\u00eda menor, o cuando el monto sea inferior a [MEX 500,000448] por concepto de suerte principal, debiendo actualizarse dicha cantidad en los t\u00e9rminos previstos en el art\u00edculo 1339.\"\n\nExh. CLA- 336, Zamora I-3, p. 136.\n\nArt. 1349 additionally stipulates: \"Corresponder\u00e1 a la Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda actualizar cada a\u00f1o por inflaci\u00f3n el monto expresado en pesos en el p\u00e1rrafo anterior y publicarlo en el Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, a m\u00e1s tardar el 30 de diciembre de cada ano.\"\n\n439.\n\nThe *Juez de lo Mercantil* offers no reasoning as to how he reached the conclusion that the value of the Cancellation Proceeding equalled less than MEX 500,000.\n\n440.\n\nInstead, he automatically accepted the Debtors' request, despite two types of evidence before him demonstrating the obviously superior value of the dispute: the Promissory Notes and the Mortgage deeds. The decision is difficult to understand, because the principal amount of the Loans settled and Mortgages terminated amounted to tens of millions of USD.\n\n441.\n\nThe First Promissory Note was issued to Lion for USD 15 M449, the Second Note for USD 12.45 M450, and the Third Note for USD 5,355,479451.\n\nExh. C-9.\n\nExh. C-13.\n\nExh. C-17.\n\n442.\n\nThe deed for the Nayarit Mortgage, which covered all three Loans, contains explicit reference to all three of the aforementioned amounts452:\n\n**Lic.

C-14, p. 5.\n\n444.\n\nFinally, the Guadalajara 2 Mortgage deed also contains a reference to the value of the Third Loan at USD 5,355,479.\n\n\"--------VI.- Qua de conformidad con el Contrato de Cr\u00e9dito de fecha 26 veintis\u00e9is de septiembre de 2007 dos mil siete (seg\u00fan sea modificado ocasionalmente en lo sucesivo el \"Contrato de Cr\u00e9dito\"), celebrado entre C&C CAPITAL, SOCIEDAD AN\u00d3NIMA DE CAPITAL VARIABLE como acreditada (la \"Acreditada\") y LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, LP como acreditante (el \"Acreditante\"), el Acreditante ha acordado entre otras cosas, otorgar un Pr\u00e9stamo (seg\u00fan dicho t\u00e9rmino se define en el Contrato de Cr\u00e9dito) a la Acreditada por la cantidad de hasta EE.UU.A.$5.355,479.00 (CINCO MILLONES TRESCIENTOS CINCUENTA Y CINCO MIL CUATROCIENTOS SETENTA Y NUEVE D\u00d3LARES 00/100) moneda en curso legal en los\n\n445.\n\nEven disregarding the value of the Notes (which do not constitute a protected investment), the Judge had before him the Mortgage deeds, which also contain references to the value of the Loans, each of which was made for millions of dollars. The Guadalajara Mortgage 1 deed even contains an equivalent in Mexican pesos, which amounts to MEX 131,197,200 - *circa* two hundred and fifty times as much as the threshold for the possibility to bring appeal.\n\n446.\n\nThe *Juez de lo Mercantil* was well aware of this information. In its own Cancelation Judgment, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* acknowledged that the Mortgages had been established to secure the Loans for a total value of USD 32.8 M454.\n\nExh. C-78, p. 6, 8 and 10.\n\n447.\n\nThe *Juez de lo Mercantil* thus blatantly failed to follow the procedure set out in the Commercial Code of Mexico when it granted *res iudicata* effect to the Cancellation Judgment. The decision was highly relevant, because Lion was denied the possibility to appeal the Cancellation Judgment, once again being subjected to the closing of a legal avenue before even realizing the existence of the Cancellation Proceeding. The only remaining alternative within the civil Court system was to launch an *Amparo.*\n\n448.\n\nApplying the relevant test, the Tribunal finds that the decision granting *estado* effect to the Cancellation Judgment, patently disregarding the amount in dispute in the Cancellation Proceeding, and closing one of Lion's avenues of accessing justice before local Courts through an otherwise available appeal mechanism, amounts to improper and egregious procedural misconduct by the local courts, which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n**C.** **Lion was denied the right to allege and prove the forgery of the Forged Settlement Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nLion was also denied justice through the local Courts' consistent denial for Lion to present material and relevant evidence to effectively defend its case.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal will re-apply the previous structure for its reasoning, beginning with the Party positions (**a.**), moving on to the proven facts (**b.**) and the applicable law (**c.**) to finish with an analysis of why Mexico's Courts deprived Lion of its right to present evidence and defend its case, thus constituting a denial of justice (**d.**).\n\n**a. Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nLion avers that despite its multiple attempts to do so, Mexican courts barred it from presenting material and relevant evidence to defend its case in the local proceedings455.\n\nCM, paras. 344-350.\n\n452.\n\nLion argues that Mexico's Courts have denied it the opportunity to prove the forgery. In Claimant's view, lack of service is a breach of such a magnitude under Mexican law that the *Juez de Distrito* should have allowed all evidence and arguments that are necessary to prove the circumstances of the allegedly illegal service456 under the *suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja* (supplement of the deficiency of the complaint)457, yet the *Juez de Distrito* dismissed any evidence pointing to the falsehood of the *emplazamiento* without granting Lion a chance to cure any formal deficiencies458*.*\n\nCR, para. 153.\n\nZamora IV, para. 122.\n\nCR, para. 152.\n\n453.\n\nAdditionally, none of Mexico's Courts seized of Lion's proceedings ruled on the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement. The *Juez de Distrito* refused to decide on the issue459; the *Tribunal de Queja* also460, ruling that the question should be resolved after the False *Amparo* issue was decided in the Remand *Amparo;* and the *Juez de Distrito*461*,* understanding that the *Tribunal de Queja* had excluded from the admissible evidence the evidence concerning the falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement462. Ultimately, Lion's *Amparo* claim was thus frustrated.\n\nCR, paras. 130-141.\n\nCR, paras. 146-147.\n\nThis time in the Remand *Amparo*.\n\nCR, paras. 155-157; CM, para. 379.\n\n454.\n\nMexico responds by arguing that Lion was not denied the right to present evidence and that all prejudice it allegedly suffered is attributable to its own negligent actions.\n\n455.\n\nIf anyone is to be blamed for the Forged Settlement Agreement never being scrutinized by the judicial system in Mexico, it is Lion, whose negligence was the reason why the Courts could not admit the additional evidence463: Claimant should have included references to the alleged fraud in its original *Amparo* claim, rather than seeking to introduce them through the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda*464.\n\nCRM, para. 95; RR, paras. 102 and 103.\n\nRR, para. 245, citing Ovalle II, para. 108.\n\n456.\n\nAs Lion failed to include allegations of fraud, the *Juez de Distrito* followed the law when it adjudicated a claim for improper notification (\"*falta de emplazamiento*\") rather than a claim for forgery465. Therefore, the *Juez de Distrito* was bound to deliver the judgment that it did and Lion cannot claim a denial of justice due to its own negligence in pursuing its claims.\n\nRR, para. 94-96.\n\n457.\n\nIn its decision to dismiss the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda,* the *Secretario del Juzgado de Distrito* acted in accordance with local law, which did not require him to grant Lion an opportunity to cure its procedural defects466. It was Lion who failed to demonstrate the necessary link between its claim and the Forged Settlement Agreement467.\n\nRR, para. paras. 99-100, citing Ovalle II, para. 91.\n\nRR, para. 102.\n\n458.\n\nWhen Claimant disagreed with the *Juez de Distrito'*s decision, it exercised its right to challenge it through a review proceeding, but lost468 due to one more failure to follow procedural law: an *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* must be signed either by the aggrieved party or by its legal representative469. Lion does not appear to contest the fact that it filed its *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* improperly470. Therefore, it was not denied the right to present evidence.\n\nRR, para. 105.\n\nRR, paras. 246-247.\n\nRCM, para. 95.\n\n459.\n\nAdditionally, the *Juez de Distrito* in the Remand *Amparo* did not dismiss all of Lion's evidence, but rather explained that some of it was already on the Court's record471; in any event, the *Juez de Distrito* was not empowered to admit new evidence in respect of the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement in the Remand *Amparo* and acted in complete accordance with applicable procedural rules472.\n\nRR, para. 268, with regard to the voucher purporting to prove that Mr. Arechederra could not have signed the False Request for Copies and the *Juez de Distrito's* decision on the false character of the False Request for Copies, citing Exh. C-123.\n\nRR, paras. 259-260.\n\n460.\n\nAccording to Mexico, Lion cannot claim that the decisions to dismiss the additional evidence were the result of an idiosyncratic or arbitrary decision473. By failing to follow the applicable procedural rules, Lion is responsible for barring itself from presenting evidence to defend its case. Therefore, the claim that the Mexican judiciary failed to grant Claimant the right to defend itself and to present evidence should be rejected.\n\nCRM, para. 96.\n\n**b. Facts**\n------------\n\n461.\n\nIn the course of the local proceedings, Lion tried on multiple occasions to bring relevant evidence that could easily prove the illegality of service and justify the annulment of the Cancellation Judgment. However, the municipal Courts repeatedly denied Lion the possibility to do so.\n\nFailed *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda*\n------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nIn the Cancellation Judgment of June 27, 2012, the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* without Lion's participation, declared the Loans settled and ordered Lion to cancel the Mortgages and return the Notes474. In mid-December 2012, Lion learned about the existence, but not the details, of the Cancellation Judgment475.\n\nExh. C-78, pp. 53-54.\n\nPayne I, para. 13; HT, pp. 486-487.\n\n463.\n\nWithin the 15-day deadline to file an *Amparo,* the only available effective remedy, Lion filed its *Amparo* Lawsuit on December 19, 2012476, to challenge the cancellation of the Mortgages. Lion did not include any reference to the Forged Settlement Agreement, because it did not know of its existence: the Forged Agreement was only made known to Lion when the *Juez de lo Mercantil* filed an *informe* (report) in January 2013477.\n\nCR, para. 131.\n\nCR, paras. 138-139; HT, p. 140; H1, p. 6, below; Exh. C-97, p. 4.\n\n464.\n\nThus, Lion's initial *Amparo* claim was for improper *emplazamiento*, a broad category encompassing different causes, rather than the precise allegation of forgery.\n\n465.\n\nHaving obtained access to the Forged Settlement Agreement and the file of the Cancellation Proceeding, on January 28, 2013478, Lion filed an *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda,* alleging the illegality of the service performed by the *actuario* on the basis of the newly acquired information on the Forged Settlement Agreement479:\n\n*\"La falta de emplazamiento legal a la hoy quejosa [i.e. Lion] [...] debido a que el supuesto emplazamiento [...] se hizo en un domicilio que no es de la hoy quejosa [...]. Am\u00e9n de que el supuesto domicilio donde de practic\u00f3 dicho emplazamiento,* *fue se\u00f1alado en un documento que no fue suscrito por mi mandante ni por persona alguna con facultades, ya que la firma que se advierte en el mismo es completamente falsa por no proceder del pu\u00f1o y letra a quien se atribuye**.\"* [Emphasis added]\n\nCR, para. 138; Exh. C-97.\n\nExh. C-97, p. 3.\n\n466.\n\nLion's forgery claim was accompanied by, *inter alia*480:\n\n- a graphological expert report to prove that The Signature in The Forged Agreement did not belong to Mr. Hendricks, and\n\n- emails between a broker retained by Lion and Sr. C\u00e1rdenas to demonstrate that, after the Forged Agreement was supposedly signed in November 2011, Lion and Sr. C\u00e1rdenas were still holding discussions on the terms of the repayment of the Loans.\n\nExh. C-97; Exh. C-55; Exh. C-102.\n\n467.\n\nThis procedural step of extending the initial claim to include the (highly relevant) inauthenticity of the Forged Agreement, would become a stumbling block hindering the progression of the *Amparo* Proceeding and leading to its eventual demise.\n\n468.\n\nThe first step occurred on January 30, 2013: in a *prove\u00eddo* the *Secretario del Juzgado de Distrito* in Jalisco dismissed the *ampliaci\u00f3n* of the *Amparo* submitted by Lion, arguing that\n\n*\"dichos actos ya fueron precisados desde el escrito inicial de demanda\"*481\n\n- a plainly wrong statement. The *Secretario* further admitted some (rather irrelevant) evidence attached to Lion's forgery claim, but postponed the decision on the admissibility of the expert and witness evidence482.\n\nExh. C-103, p. 4.\n\nExh. C-103, p. 5, see below.\n\n469.\n\nFrustrated by this postponement, Lion brought, on February 6, 2013, an *\"incidente de falsedad de documento\"* before the *Juez de Distrito,* claiming again that the Forged Agreement was the result of fraud483.\n\nExh. C-107.\n\n470.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the *Juez de Distrito* stated that he would decide in due course on the admissibility of the proposed graphological expertise on the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement484. And on April 19, 2013 the *Juez de Distrito* once again decided to postpone his decision on the admissibility of the evidence, because of a *queja* proceeding which was subsequently initiated and which will be dealt with in the next section485.\n\nExh. C-106, p. 10.\n\nExh. C-180, p. 2.\n\nDismissal by the *Tribunal de Queja*\n------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nWhile the decision on the admission of evidence was pending before the *Juez de Distrito,* one of the Debtors, C&C Ingenier\u00eda, filed as a *tercero perjudicado* two *quejas*486 before the *Tribunal de Queja* against the Dismissal *Prove\u00eddo* issued by the Secretary of the Court487 and the April 10, 2013 decision of the *Juez de Distrito.* C&C Ingenier\u00eda argued that Lion's *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* was inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on Lion's behalf.\n\nThe orders and judgments issued in Amparo proceedings are themselves subject to three different challenges: *revision, queja* and *reclamation.* In an *Amparo indirecto,* such as the one file by Lion, the most common challenges are *queja* against different procedural orders (specifically those that cause irreparable harm) and *revision* against the *Amparo* court's final judgment, both of which are decided by a *Tribunal Colegiado de Circuito* (Federal Circuit Court), see Zamora I, para. 87.\n\nExh. C-181.\n\n472.\n\nLion for its part also submitted a *queja* against the same decision, because it precluded Lion from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement was a forgery and the origin of the improper service488.\n\nExh. C-182.\n\n473.\n\nThe *Tribunal de Queja* dismissed Lion's *queja* and decided in favour of C&C Ingenier\u00eda: the appeal court ruled that the *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda*, which Lion had filed, was inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on behalf of Lion: it should have been signed by Lion's legal representative and not by the attorney empowered by Lion to act on its behalf in the *Amparo* proceedings489.\n\nRCM, para. 92, citing Exh. C-105, p. 3-4 and Exh. R-19, see *infra.*\n\n474.\n\nLion was not given an opportunity to cure the alleged procedural defect, although the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* aimed at proving that Lion, an alien company operating in Mexico, had been the victim of an elaborate fraud to avoid its proper *emplazamiento*. This stands in stark contrast with the treatment granted to the complainants when the False *Amparo* was submitted without the requisite copies. In that instance, the *Juez* accorded the complainants the chance to cure the formalistic deficiency.\n\nFailure of *incidente de falsedad de documento*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nOnce the *queja* had been resolved, the *Juez de Distrito* resumed his work, and in accordance with the decision of the *Tribunal de Queja* resolved that all evidence linked to the forgery claim should be dismissed (both the evidence already admitted and the evidence still pending admission)490.\n\nExh. C-105, pp. 8-9.\n\n476.\n\nThereafter the *Juez de Distrito* rendered a specific ruling on Lion's separate motion (*\"incidente de falsedad de documento\"*). The judge dismissed it on the grounds that the allegedly false document (the Forged Settlement Agreement) was not related to the subject-matter of the *Amparo* Proceeding491.\n\nExh. C-108.\n\n477.\n\nIn so deciding, the *Juez de Distrito* ignored the principle *fraus omnia corrumpit*: an *emplazamiento* obtained by fraud, involving the forgery of the document which purports to provide the address for service of process and the name of the process agent, is evidently unlawful, and can never constitute a proper *emplazamiento*.\n\n478.\n\nBe that as it may, from that date on, the scope of the *Amparo* did not include any inquiry into the issue whether the Settlement Agreement had been forged; it was assumed that the Settlement Agreement was valid and binding, having been properly executed by Lion. The scope of the *Amparo* was reduced to the question whether the *emplazamiento* had or not been properly executed in accordance with Mexican law. And - congruently with this reduced scope of investigation - all evidence in the file seeking to prove the forgery of the Settlement Agreement was expurgated.\n\nFailure to address forgery in *Amparo* Judgment\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nOn December 4, 2013, the *Juez de Distrito* delivered the *Amparo* Judgment denying Lion protection against the Cancellation Judgment492.\n\n\"[...] R E S U E L V E: \u00daNICO. LA JUSTICIA DE LA UNI\u00d3N NO AMPARA NI PROTEGE A LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, L.P., contra los actos que reclama del JUEZ Y DEL SECRETARIO EJECUTOR, AMBOS ADSCRITOS AL JUZGADO NOVENO DE LO MERCANTIL DEL PRIMER PARTIDO JUDICIAL DEL ESTADO DE JALISCO. [...]\" [Capitals in the original]\n\nExh. C-115, pp. 66-67.\n\n480.\n\nThe *Amparo Judgement* is a 67-page document, which in its *\"Resultando\"* summarizes the procedure, and which then reasons the decision in seven *\"Considerandos\".*\n\n481.\n\nAs a preliminary question, the *Juez de Distrito* analyzes Lion's allegation that on July 6, 2013 Sr. Arechederra's signature had been forged in the false request for copy before the *Juzgado de lo Mercantil* - see section 5.1 *supra.* (The issue was relevant, because if it had been true that on July 6, 2013 Lion had been aware of the Cancellation Judgement, the *Amparo* would have been inadmissible due to the statute of limitations).\n\n482.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement, after weighing the expert and other evidence marshalled by the parties, concludes that Sr. Arechederra's signature indeed had been forged, that the request for copy had indeed been false, and that consequently Lion's request for *Amparo* was not time barred493.\n\nExh. C-115, p. 39.\n\n483.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement also acknowledges that Sr. Arechederra and Lion had filed a criminal action against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, accusing him of having forged his signature on various documents, and that on 26 September 2013 the criminal judge had ordered the imprisonment of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas for this crime. But the *Amparo* Judge accorded little weight to this piece of evidence494:\n\n*\"[El auto de formal prisi\u00f3n] \u00fanicamente constituye un indicio que unido a otras pruebas, puede coadyuvar a la formaci\u00f3n de prueba plena con las que se acrediten, en un momento dado, hechos diversos a los aqu\u00ed demostrados\"*\n\nExh. C-115, p. 61.\n\n484.\n\nNotwithstanding the finding that at least on one occasion Sr. Arechederra's signature had been forged, and that Sr. C\u00e1rdenas was in prison for alleged forgeries of documents, the *Amparo* judgement does not even discuss Lion's argument that the Settlement Agreement was also forged: since the *ampliaci\u00f3n de demanda* had been dismissed (because it had been signed by Lion's attorney, but not by a legal representative), any issue relating to the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was off limits in the *Amparo* procedure.\n\n485.\n\nThe *Amparo* Judgement consequently assumes that the Settlement Agreement was validly executed on Lion's behalf. There being a valid Settlement Agreement with a designation of process agent and an address for service of process, the *Juez de Distrito* dismisses Lion's argument that the *emplazamiento* should have been made in Dallas, Texas, USA, and in accordance with the applicable international treaties495.\n\nExh. C-155, p. 47.\n\n486.\n\nInstead, the *Juez de Distrito* discusses at length a minor incident in the way the fraudulent *emplazamiento* had taken place: in accordance with the Settlement Agreement the notification should have been made at Calle Tom\u00e1s V. G\u00f3mez 95, *despacho* 7. But in reality, the *actuario* went to the same address, but to a different office: *despacho* 5.\n\n487.\n\nThe *Juez de Distrito* finds that this \"minor defect\" does not invalidate the *emplazamiento*, because the *actuario* was able to locate Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, who, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement, was the person designated by Lion as process agent496. The Judge's very words are the following497:\n\n\"*De ah\u00ed que, aun y cuando aparece que el emplazamiento a juicio de la ahora quejosa [Lion], se practic\u00f3 en un domicilio diverso al pactado [...], ello de ninguna manera acarrea la consecuencia que [Lion] no estuviera enterada [del juicio],* *en raz\u00f3n que la diligencia de llamamiento a juicio se entendi\u00f3 personalmente con uno de sus autorizados para recibir cualquier tipo de comunicaci\u00f3n* *[...]\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nExh. C-155, p. 53\n\nExh. C-155, p. 54\n\n488.\n\nThe argument is straightforward: since the Settlement Agreement must be deemed valid and binding and Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina is Lion's process agent, the *emplazamiento* made to Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, even if at the wrong address, is also valid and binding.\n\nFailure to address forgery in *recurso de revisi\u00f3n*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nLion was not satisfied with the *Amparo* Judgement. On December 19, 2013 Lion filed the r*ecurso de revisi\u00f3n*, seeking its revocation, the granting of protection to Lion's constitutional rights and the finding that the Cancellation Lawsuit and related acts were null and void498.\n\nExh. C-116, pp. 46-57.\n\n490.\n\nAmong other reasons, Lion explicitly challenged the *Amparo* Judgment, arguing that the *Juez de Distrito* had disregarded Lion's claim that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, with the erroneous argument that the falsehood was unrelated to the dispute and that the defendants in the *Amparo* had not participated in the alleged forgery. Lion explained that the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was indeed relevant for the *Amparo,* because Lion's *emplazamiento* had been delivered to Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, Lion's purported process agent designated in the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement was a forgery, the designation of Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina was false, and the *emplazamiento* had not been properly made499.\n\nExh. C-116, pp. 16-17\n\nSummary of Lion's efforts to introduce evidence\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nAs outlined above, Lion attempted on multiple occasions to present evidence regarding the fraudulent character of the Forged Settlement Agreement and was denied at every attempt.\n\n492.\n\nLion filed a total of four petitions to submit evidence on the forgery and was denied the opportunity every single time. It did so in all possible instances:\n\n\"- On January 28, 2013 Lion filed its *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda,* explaining that the service made by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* was based on a forged document and should thus be deemed inexistent500;\"\n\n\"- On February 6, 2013, Lion brought an *\"incidente de falsedad de documento\"* before the *Juez de Distrito*, claiming again that the Forged Agreement was the result of fraud501;\"\n\n- Separately, on February 8, 2013, Lion also submitted a *queja* against Dismissal *Prove\u00eddo* as precluding it from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement was a forgery502, and\n\n- On December 19, 2013 as part of its *recurso de revisi\u00f3n*, Lion once again tried to claim the forgery of the *T\u00e9rminos* document503. However, it was barred from doing so by the express order of the *Tribunal de Queja* which forbade the *Juez de Distrito* to look into the issue in the Remand Proceeding.\n\nExh. C-97, p. 3.\n\nExh. C-107.\n\nExh. C-182.\n\nExh. C-116, pp. 16-17\n\n**c. The law**\n--------------\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that the third type of denial of justice occurs when municipal Courts prevent an alien from producing evidence to support its case504.\n\nSee section 1.2 B supra.\n\n494.\n\nIn *Cotesworth & Powell* the tribunal confirmed that\"\n\n\"[...] refusing to hear the party interested, or to allow him [an] opportunity to produce proofs, amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice\". [Emphasis added]\n\n495.\n\nThe right to present relevant and material evidence in the context of denial of justice has also been recognized by academia505 :\n\n\"[When discussing procedural guarantees whose violation amounts to denial of justice] One strand of procedural improprieties related to equality of arms, in particular regarding the right of aliens to be notified about procedural developments, the right to be heard, the right to counsel, the right to call and confront witnesses, the right to produce evidence, and the right to public proceedings in criminal cases. [...]\n\n[Equality of arms] may also apply regarding matters such as attendance of hearings, neutrality of the expert, the right to call witnesses, submit evidence, have the evidence considered by the court, comment on observations, and be informed about the reasons of challenged decisions.\"\n\nPaparinskis, *op. cit.,* pp. 193-194, 203, citations omitted.\n\n**d. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n496.\n\nThe *Juez de Distrito* saw fit to decide on the correctness of the *emplazamiento* without first addressing whether the Settlement Agreement was in fact a forgery, which led to rulings that are, in the Tribunal's view, contradictory506. On July 5, 2013 the *Juez de Distrito* decided that the issue of the forgery of the Forged Settlement Agreement was not related to the subject-matter of the *Amparo* Proceeding507 and on December 4, 2013 the same *Juez de Distrito* decided, based on the Forged Settlement Agreement, that the *emplazamiento* was performed correctly. The Tribunal finds it logically apparent that the correctness of the *emplazamiento* hinges upon the truthfulness of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nThe two rulings of the *Juez de Distrito* contradict each other: on July 5, 2013 the *Juez de Distrito* decided that there was: No need to deal with forgery of the Alleged Hendricks Document and on December 4, 2013: Proper service on the basis of the Alleged Hendricks Document (denying LMC's Amparo Claim).\n\nExh. C-108.\n\n497.\n\nIn *Cotesworth & Powell* the international tribunal found multiple denials of justice to claimants, including an instance of contradictory rulings by the same tribunal:\"\n\n\"\"That between the sentence of the superior tribunal of March 8, 1861, and that of April 2, 1862, by the same tribunal, there is a direct and irreconcilable contradiction. One recognized the authority of the claimant's attorney to bring action; the other expressly denied it508\".\n\n*Cotesworth & Powell,* p. 180, para. 2; p. 188, para. 5.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds it surprising that the *Juez de Distrito,* while explicitly acknowledging that on September 26, 2013 a criminal judge had ordered the imprisonment of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas precisely for the alleged forgery, did not find sufficient reason to scrutinize the veracity of the Forged Settlement Agreement509.\n\nExh. C-115, p. 61.\n\n499.\n\nThe reasoning behind the refusals to examine the Forged Settlement Agreement was always purely procedural and concerned minor mistakes by Lion which were curable - but Lion was never given the opportunity to correct them. The continuing rejections of Lion's motions to present evidence on the false character of the Forged Settlement Agreement were based on dubious formalistic nuances of local procedural law.\n\n500.\n\nLion was blamed for not having alleged forgery in its initial *Amparo* claim, since Mexico avers that Lion was aware, as of December 17, 2012, that \"[a] lawsuit was simulated, signatures were forged, *et cetera*510*\".* But it has been proven that Lion did not have access to the relevant files, which included a copy of the Forged Settlement Agreement, until mid-January 2013511 and was pressured by the 15-day time limit to bring an *Amparo* from the date of taking notice of the Cancellation Judgment, which occurred on December 17, 2012512. At the moment of filing of the *Amparo,* Lion simply knew that a Cancellation Judgment had been rendered in a proceeding of which it was not aware. The Tribunal finds no error on Claimant's side.\n\nRPHB, para. 180, citing Mr. Hendricks, HT, p. 485.\n\nCPHB, para. 39, citing Exh. C-96 and Exh. C-97, pp. 7, 19.\n\nPayne I, para. 13; HT, pp. 486-487.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal is further persuaded by Lion's supported arguments that any formalistic errors in the filing of submissions were curable and that the *Juez de Distrito* should have provided Lion the opportunity to amend them513. The failure to grant Lion a period to cure the formal deficiency stands in stark contrast not only to basic principles of due process under Mexican law514, but also the actions of the *Juez del Primer Distrito*, who in the case of the False *Amparo* allowed a three-day period for the plaintiff to provide the requires six additional copies of the False *Amparo*515*.*\n\nCR, paras. 482-495.\n\nCR, paras. 485-490.\n\nExh. C-65.\n\n502.\n\nLion further avers that lack of service amounts to a fundamental breach under Mexican law and that the Mexican Supreme Court has established that, in such cases, the *amparo* court should offer protection to the aggrieved party, even if its arguments were insufficient or incomplete, through the institution of the so-called *suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja* (supplement of the deficiency of the complaint)516. According to Lion's expert, the *suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja* gives the *Juez de amparo* the power to *ex officio* complement the *amparo* claim with any evidence that may be relevant to the case in furtherance of an aggrieved party's fundamental rights517. Thus, the *Juez de Distrito* could have not only admitted the evidence proposed by Lion but also requested any other relevant evidence, given the gravity of the claim of lack of service. Respondent does not directly oppose Claimant's analysis of the *suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja.*\n\nZamora IV, para. 122.\n\nZamora IV, para. 128.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n503.\n\nThe Tribunal observes the similarity of the facts with those in *Idler,* where the respondent State invoked a seemingly valid legal basis (an ancient remedy inherited from a codification by Spanish Kings) to circumvent granting the claimant the execution of a judgment he should have been accorded under the law. Mexico was using a similar formalistic excuse - procedural requirements that were very minor in their nature and which did not apply in other circumstances - to bar Lion from exercising its right to defense before a court.\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note of the similarities of the situation affecting Lion with that of the French individual in the *Fabiani* arbitration, where a denial of justice was found because Mr. Fabiani was unable to obtain a decision granting *exequatur* by Venezuelan courts to a judgment in his favour against local defendants518. Similarly, Lion was unable to obtain a decision on the false character of the Forged Settlement Agreement from the local Courts, despite multiple diligent attempts to obtain such a ruling.\n\n*Fabiani,* p. 4900.\n\n505.\n\nHaving been refused the opportunity to produce evidence of the forgery, Lion had no means to prove that the *emplazamiento* was wrong. Lion was disarmed and unable to properly exercise its right to defense. Like in *Ballistini,* where the French-Venezuelan Commission made a finding of denial of justice\n\n\"[b]ecause the local authorities deprived Ballistini of the legal means of instituting before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would authorize him\"519,\n\nLion was deprived by the local authorities of the legal means in the form of presenting relevant and material evidence, to defend its case.\n\n*Ballistini,* p. 20, para. 3.\n\n**D.** **Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n506.\n\nIn conclusion, coming back to Paulsson's definition that \"[d]enial of justice arises when proceedings are so faulty as to exclude all reasonable expectation of a fair decision [...]\", the Tribunal finds that Lion, after three years of fighting within the municipal judicial system, could not expect a fair decision within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n507.\n\nSimilarly, using the *Mondev* test proposed by Respondent, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant suffered \"a wilful disregard of due process of law, ... which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\": first, when Lion was not properly notified of the Cancellation Proceeding and was judged *in absentia,* and later when it was barred from effectively making its case that it had been the victim of fraud and from presenting relevant and material evidence, necessary to support its argument.\n\n508.\n\nThe Mexican Courts had four opportunities to address the question of the forgery of the Settlement Agreement. They did not do so for reasons which were unclear, contradictory within the same process, or purely formalistic. The Tribunal finds that the decisions of the Mexican Courts repeatedly denying Lion the right to present relevant and material evidence to defend its case, amount to an improper and egregious procedural conduct, which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standard of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.\n\n509.\n\nHaving established that Mexico's Courts denied Lion justice by restricting its access to justice and its right to defend itself and present evidence to support its case, the Tribunal does not need to look into whether Lion also suffered undue delay.\n\n**VI.2.** **EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES**\n------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nMexico presents a major counterargument to refute Lion's claim for denial of justice: that Claimant decided to withdraw the *Amparo* claim, and that as a consequence of such withdrawal, it failed to exhaust local remedies - a requirement for a finding of denial of justice520.\n\nRR, para 168.\n\n511.\n\nClaimant does not deny that it withdrew the *Amparo* Proceeding, but argues that Lion pursued all adequate and effective remedies available to it, within the limits of reasonableness521.\n\nCR, paras. 506-520.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize the Parties' positions (**1.**), then the relevant facts (**2.**), then the law regarding exhaustion of legal remedies, including its exceptions (**3**.), and finally discuss and dismiss Mexico's counterargument (**4**.).\n\n**1.** **P****osition of the** **P****arties**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that under international law a finding of denial of justice is premised on the claimant having exhausted local remedies, i.e. judicial measures which could result in the Mortgages being reinstated522. Claimant adds that the exhaustion rule has to be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism523.\n\nCM, p. 400.\n\nCM, para 401.\n\n514.\n\nClaimant explains that it pursued the *Amparo* proceedings, the only avenue which was open to it: it was forced to choose between either filing an *Amparo* claim or a *nulidad de juicio concluido* [also \"**nullity proceeding**\"] action. According to Lion, it was impossible for it to bring both an *Amparo* claim and a nullity proceeding in the same matter524. It further argues that the criminal proceedings are not adequate to deal with contractual issues, and pursuing the case further in criminal courts would not have led to binding findings for civil courts525.\n\nCPHB, para. 94.\n\nCPHB, para. 227.\n\n515.\n\nClaimant adds that it filed and pursued the *Amparo Proceedings,* until it became obvious that continuation was futile, whereupon it decided to withdraw such Proceedings.\n\n516.\n\nClaimant's arguments are the following:\n\n**a. Undue delay**\n------------------\n\n517.\n\nClaimant says that, as codified by the International Law Commission, local remedies do not need to be exhausted when there is undue delay in the remedial process, attributable to the State. And in this case, the *Amparo* Proceedings were excessively and unreasonably long and continuation of the *Amparo* Proceeding would have extended that unreasonable delay at least by 2.5 years526.\n\nCPHB, 224.\n\n**b. Mexico's lack of diligence**\n---------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nClaimant avers that the withdrawal of the *Amparo* Proceedings became necessary due to Mexico's own lack of diligence. The *Amparo* Courts could and should have raised the existence of the False *Amparo* much earlier, in early 2013. If the *Amparo* Courts would have been diligent, Lion would have had the opportunity to exhaust the *Amparo* Proceedings within the three-year time limit provided for by NAFTA Article 1116527.\n\nCM, para 417.\n\n519.\n\nLion did everything that was reasonable, but, despite its best efforts, Mexican Courts did not provide effective means to reverse the cancellation of the Mortgages within a reasonable period. Mexico cannot rely on the ineffectiveness of its own system to prevent a finding of denial of justice528.\n\nCM, para 423.\n\n**c. Continuation of the** ***Amparo*** **Proceeding was not necessary**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nAs a second argument, Claimant says it was not required to continue with the *Amparo* Proceedings, because such proceedings did not meet the test (established in the *Loewen* decision) of being adequate, effective and reasonably available:\n\n521.\n\nFirst, as regards adequacy, Claimant says that the *Amparo* Proceedings were the only adequate proceedings available to undo the cancellation of the Mortgages529.\n\nCPHB, para 227.\n\n522.\n\nSecond, as regards the effectiveness criterion, Claimant adds that the most likely outcome of the Remand *Amparo* would have been for the *Juez de Distrito* to decide that the *Amparo* was inadmissible530. But in the most optimistic scenario, assuming that the *Juez de Distrito* had decided that the False *Amparo* indeed was a fraudulent machination, Lion would then have to re-submit its initial appeal to the *Tribunal de Queja,* requesting the opportunity to prove that the Forged Settlement Agreement had been falsified. However, the same *Tribunal de Queja* had already ruled that no hearing would be allowed; there was no reason to assume that the *Tribunal de Queja* would change its position, and there was no appeal to the Supreme Court531.\n\nCPHB, para 229.\n\nCPHB, para 227.\n\n523.\n\nClaimant adds a second argument: even if the *Juez de Distrito* and then the *Tribunal de Queja* had decided in its favour, the result would be a finding that Lion had not been properly served in the Cancellation Lawsuit - but not the reestablishment of the Mortgages. The Cancellation Lawsuit would be reopened before *the Juez de lo Mercantil,* and a new series of proceedings, taking between 18 and 36 months, would have to be started, to annul the Cancellation Judgement and reinstall the Mortgages532\n\nCM, para 410.\n\n524.\n\nThird, concerning reasonableness, Claimant avers that even under the most favourable scenario, the exhaustion of the *Amparo* Proceedings would have lasted an additional 2.5 to 3.5 years as of December 2015, resulting in a delay of six years for a simple and straightforward *Amparo*533.\n\nCPHB, para 227\n\n525.\n\nClaimant adds that pursuing further *Amparo* Proceedings would have required Lion to definitively waive its judicial expropriation claim before NAFTA tribunals, due to the three-year time limits established in Art. 1116 and 1117 NAFTA - an unreasonable requirement534.\n\nCR, paras. 521-537; CPHB, para. 227.\n\n**B.** **Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nAs a starting point, Mexico asserts that under international law, exhaustion of local remedies is a requirement for a finding of denial of justice, as acknowledged by publicists, State practice, NAFTA jurisprudence and non-NAFTA jurisprudence535.\n\nRCM, paras. 168-204.\n\nThe unavailability exception\n----------------------------\n\n527.\n\nMexico acknowledges that exhaustion of local remedies knows one exception, which is however subject to a high test: unavailability. An aggrieved alien does not have to exhaust local remedies that are not available. Respondent says that the NAFTA jurisprudence focuses on availability, not on futility. Provided that remedies are available, Claimant is required to exhaust them536. Mexico says that the threshold test of unavailability was set in *Loewen* and *Apotex*537*.*\n\nRCM, para. 208; RR, paras. 281-291.\n\nCR, para. 281.\n\n528.\n\nTurning to the facts, Mexico says Claimant did not exhaust all proceedings which in accordance with Mexican law were available:\n\n529.\n\nFirst, Respondent says that Lion failed to exhaust other avenues under Mexican law to avoiding the cancellation of the Mortgages, like a *nulidad de juicio concluido* action538 or the criminal proceedings already initiated by Lion539.\n\nHT, pp. 654-657; RR, paras. 126, 136: RCM, para. 79, citing Ovalle I, paras. 94-95.\n\nRPHB, paras. 116, 118, citing HT, p. 773.\n\n530.\n\nSecond, Mexico disagrees with Claimant's argument that continuing with the Amparo Proceedings would have been ineffective. In Respondent's view, Claimant essentially is arguing that the *Tribunal de Queja* and the Supreme Court were unlikely to render any decision in its favour. However, as the *Apotex* tribunal announced, what matters is not the likelihood that the higher judicial authority would have granted the relief the Claimant sought, but simply the availability of further remedies. In this case a multitude of remedies existed540. Respondent also denies that the Mexican Courts incurred in unreasonable delay, or that the expected duration of the remedy procedures would be unreasonable541.\n\nRR, para. 310\n\nRR, para. 313, 319.\n\n531.\n\nThird, as regards Claimant's argument that it was obliged to withdraw the Amparo Proceedings, because the three-year limit established in Art. 1116 and 1117 NAFTA was approaching, Respondent says that the time limitations imposed by these provisions begins on the date on which there is \"knowledge of the alleged breach\". Since local remedies must be exhausted before it can be determined if justice has been denied, the limitation period had not started to run at the time the *Amparo* Proceedings were abandoned. Thus, the entire rationale for the Claimant abandoning the proceeding was unfounded542.\n\nRR, para. 337.\n\n532.\n\nFinally, Mexico submits that the Claimant was not required to withdraw from the *Amparo* Proceedings to comply with the waiver requirement established in NAFTA Art. 1121, because the *Amparo* Proceedings fall within the exception of NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) (\"except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving payment of damages\")543.\n\nRR, para 350.\n\n**2.** **F****acts**\n--------------------\n\n533.\n\nOn December 18, 2012 Lion filed an *Amparo indirecto* lawsuit544 before the *Juez de Distrito* in Jalisco. The *Amparo* was based on a breach of Art. 14 and 16 of *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica* of Mexico, and the *actos reclamados* included the lack of proper *emplazamiento* of Lion in the Cancellation Lawsuit.\n\nExh. C-91.\n\n534.\n\nThe development of the *Amparo* Proceedings has been described in section IV.7 above. Suffice it to say here that more than two years after the initial filing of the *Amparo,* on April 17, 2015, the *Tribunal de Queja* decided *sua sponte* to remand the case back to the *Juez de Distrito*, with the limited purpose to determine whether Lion's *Amparo* proceeding was inadmissible, a different *Amparo* relating to the same facts having been filed at an earlier date and thereafter abandoned.\n\n535.\n\nWhen the *Tribunal de Queja* raised the issue of the False *Amparo* it came as a total surprise:\n\n\"- For the last 16 months of *Amparo* proceeding no party and no prior court had ever referred to this admissibility issue545;\"\n\n\"- The same *Tribunal de Queja* had also failed to raise the issue when it first intervened in these proceedings, to adjudicate an appeal against interlocutory decisions of the *Juez de Distrito*;\"\n\n\"- The *Tribunal de Queja* decided *sua sponte,* and over a year into the *recurso de revisi\u00f3n*, to raise the existence of the False *Amparo*; the only reason given by the *Tribunal de Queja* to justify its decision was that an unidentified administrative official had informed the Court of the existence of the previous *Amparo*546.\n\nExh. C-119.\n\nExh. C-119, p. 21.\n\n536.\n\nAs regards the remand procedure, the *Tribunal de Queja* ordered that it should be restricted to adjudicating the admissibility issue, explicitly prohibiting the parties from presenting new evidence regarding the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement547 and instructing the *Juez de Distrito* not to analyze Lion's allegation that such Agreement had been forged548.\n\nExh. C-119, p. 18\n\nExh. C-119, pp. 17-18.\n\n537.\n\nAfter three years of judicial battling, Lion still had no decision confirming the falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement, and after the remand decision it was fighting to prove that it should not be deprived of the *Amparo* recourse - the only way to overturn the wrongful cancellation of the Mortgages.\n\nThe Remand *Amparo*\n-------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe fact that the Remand *Amparo* was being tried by the same judge who had already dismissed evidence on the forgery, did not discourage Lion from bringing once more a petition to admit evidence on the fraudulent nature of the Forged Settlement549. And, since Lion had only acquired knowledge of the False *Amparo's* existence at this point, it also provided evidence pointing to the inauthenticity of the False *Amparo*550*.*\n\nExh. C-121.\n\nExh. C-122.\n\n539.\n\nOn September 23, 2015 the *Juez de Distrito* only accepted the graphology expert report and a brief filing on the False *Amparo* as evidence551. The *Juez de Distrito* used formalistic reasoning to reject further evidence provided by Lion552.\n\nExh. C-123.\n\nExh. C-123: Sr. Arechederra's testimony could not be admitted because it was rendered by Claimant's legal counsel and raised a risk of bias; additionally, the Court found that Claimant incorrectly submitted a questionnaire that included identical questions for Sr. Arechederra and Mr. Baer, a type of evidence that is forbidden under the applicable law, see RR, para. 119 together with footnote within, invoking inadmissibility of such evidence under Art. 150 of the *Amparo* law.\n\nLion's withdrawal\n-----------------\n\n540.\n\nOn December 11, 2015 Lion decided to withdraw the *Amparo* Proceedings in their entirety.\n\n**3.** **T****he law**\n----------------------\n\n541.\n\nLion's claim for denial of justice is based on Art. 1105 of NAFTA, which provides that Mexico shall accord to investments of protected investors treatment in accordance with international law, including FET. The FTC Interpretation Note equates the standard of protection to be applied under Art. 1105 of the NAFTA with the standard of \"customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\".\n\n542.\n\nThis \"minimum standard of treatment\" incorporates denial of justice, together with its traditional requirement that the aggrieved investor, to be authorized to proceed against the State, must first have exhausted all legal remedies available in the municipal Court system and must have lodged appeals up to the highest instance (**A.**). The requirement is, however, subject to an exception: exhaustion is unnecessary in situations where lodging an appeal would be obviously futile (**B.**)\n\n**A.** **The requirement**\n--------------------------\n\n543.\n\nThe rule of exhaustion of local remedies derives from the customary international law principle that, prior to bringing an international claim, the foreign national must have first resorted to the host State's legal remedies to obtain redress.\n\n544.\n\nThis principle of customary international law was developed in the context of diplomatic protection in the *Interhandel* and *ELSI* cases553. In *Interhandel* the ICJ stated that554:\n\n\"The rule that local remedies must be exhausted before international proceedings may be instituted is a well-established rule of customary international law [...] Before resort may be had to an international court ... it has been considered necessary that the State where the violation occurred should have an opportunity to redress it by its own means, within the framework of its own domestic legal system\".\n\n*Interhandel; ELSI.*\n\n*Interhandel,* p. 27.\n\n545.\n\nThe ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection records this well-established principle in Article 14.\n\nArticle 14. Exhaustion of local remedies\n\n1. A State may not present an international claim in respect of an injury to a national [...] before the injured person has, subject to draft article 15, exhausted all local remedies\".\n\nThe exhaustion rule in investment protection cases\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nIt is unanimously accepted that the exhaustion rule is a substantial element of denial of justice and applies beyond diplomatic protection. Professor James Crawford, rapporteur on State Responsibility of the ILC, said that555:\n\n\"the exhaustion of local remedies rule is not limited to diplomatic protection\".\n\nState Responsibility, Document A/CN,4/517 and Add. 1 - Fourth report on State responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur.\n\n547.\n\nThe academic writings on investment protection support this view. Paulsson recalls that:\n\n\"[f]or a foreigner's international grievance to proceed as a claim of denial of justice, the national system must have been tested. Its perceived failings cannot constitute an international wrong unless it has been given a chance to correct itself556\".\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 108.\n\n548.\n\nProfessor Paparinskis in turn states that:\n\n\"[i]t is accepted that denial of justice becomes internationally wrongful only after the whole system of administration of justice has been put to the test by exhaustion of local remedies557\".\n\nM. Paparinskis, *op. cit.,* p. 182 [Footnote omitted].\n\n549.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs: a claim for denial of justice only becomes ripe when the remedies available in the legal system of the host State to impeach the decision have been exhausted. The underlying reasons for this requirement are twofold:\n\n- It guarantees that the host State's judicial system is provided with an opportunity to rectify errors in the decision of lower court instances, and\n\n- It guarantees that international tribunals do not become appeal Courts for dissatisfied investors.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n550.\n\nInvestment tribunals in the context of NAFTA have endorsed the same conclusion558. The Tribunal in *Loewen* specifically stated that a claim for denial of justice within Article 1105 NAFTA, incorporated the exhaustion requirement559:\n\n\"The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State the opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law occasioned by the lower court decision. The requirement has application to breaches of Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as Article 1105\".\n\nSee e.g., *Loewen,* paras. 150-156*,* *Waste Management II,* para. 97, *Apotex,* para. 282 and other decisions discussed *infra.* The position in *Mondev* is exceptional and not shared by this Tribunal.\n\n*Loewen,* para. 156.\n\n551.\n\nThe *Waste Management II* tribunal, for instance, stated in the context of assessing a denial of justice claim that560:\n\n\"The system must be tried and have failed, and thus in this context the notion of exhaustion of local remedies is incorporated into the substantive standard and is not only a procedural prerequisite to an international claim\".\n\n*Waste Management II,* para. 97.\n\n552.\n\nInvestment tribunals in non-NAFTA cases have come to the same conclusion. For example, in *OI European Group B. V.* the tribunal emphasized the need to give the host State's judicial system an opportunity to rectify its mistakes so as to avoid the use of international law as a system of appeals against judgments unfavourable to investors:\n\n\"International Law cannot become a convenient system to appeal any domestic court decision the investor disagrees with. Before it can be established under International Law that a State's legal system has committed a wrong, it is essential to provide it with a chance to correct its own mistake\"561.\n\n*OI,* paras. 533-536.\n\nNon-Disputing Parties\n---------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe United States562 and Canada563 have defended the same position in their Non-Disputing Party submissions:\n\n\"- The USA says that the international responsibility of States may only be invoked with respect to final judicial acts, unless recourse to further domestic remedies is obviously futile or manifestly ineffective564; judicial acts only result in a breach of Article 1105(1) if the justice system as a whole, as validated by a court of the highest instance, produces a denial of justice565;\"\n\n- Canada also submits that a denial of justice claim must be preceded by the local court decisions reaching finality at the court of last resort of the State's judiciary566.\n\nUSA Submission, paras. 11-14.\n\nCanada Submission, paras. 7-8.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 11.\n\nUSA Submission, paras. 12-13.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 7, citations omitted.\n\n**B.** **The exception of obvious futility**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe requirement that local remedies be exhausted is subject to an exception: an alien cannot be required to take a measure or lodge an appeal which will not remedy the international wrong.\n\n**a. The position of the Parties and the Non-Disputing Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nThe precise scope of the exception to the rule of exhaustion of local remedies has been much discussed by the Parties:\n\n- Lion says that the claimant must only exhaust remedies which are adequate, effective and reasonable567, while\n\n- Mexico submits that the only remedies which do not have to be exhausted are those which are unavailable, adding that NAFTA jurisprudence *(Loewen, Apotex)* focuses on availability, not on futility568.\n\nCPHB, para. 227.\n\nRR, para. 280.\n\n556.\n\nThe Non-Disputing Parties have also presented their views on the exception to the rule of exhaustion:\n\n\"- The USA recognizes that the exhaustion rule does not apply whenever further recourse for a claimant is obviously futile or manifestly ineffective569; further remedies are obviously futile where there \"was no justice to exhaust570\"; but it is not enough for a claimant to allege the \"absence of a reasonable prospect of success or the improbability of success, which are both less strict tests571\".\"\n\n\"- Canada also acknowledges that the rule gives way whenever it would be \"demonstrably futile\" to pursue local remedies572; whether recourse to further appeals of a domestic court judgment is futile is \"a fact-specific inquiry taking into consideration the availability, adequacy and effectiveness of the remedy\"573.\n\nUSA Submission, paras. 12-13.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 14, citations omitted.\n\nUSA Submission, para. 14.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 7, citations omitted.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 8.\n\n**b. Position of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nMexico argues that under NAFTA the only remedies which do not have to be exhausted are those which are \"unavailable\", adding that NAFTA jurisprudence equates unavailability with futility. Mexico seeks support in two NAFTA cases *Loewen* and *Apotex.*\n\n558.\n\nMexico's position is excessively restrictive. It implies that an investor is obliged to pursue all available remedies, even if there is no reasonable prospect that the request or appeal will effectively undo the international wrong.\n\n559.\n\nScholars in the realm of investment protection, such as Paulsson, suggest that the appropriate test should be more flexible, and based on the formulation of Judge Lauterpacht in his separate opinion the *Norwegian Loans* case: the remedies that ought to be pursued are those which offer a \"reasonable possibility of an effective remedy\"574. Paulsson explains that575:\n\n\"[t]he victim of a denial of justice is not required to pursue improbable remedies. Nor is he required to contrive indirect or extravagant applications beyond the ordinary path of a frontal attempt to have the judgment by which he was unjustly treated set aside, or to be granted a trial he was denied\".\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 118; *Norwegian Loans,* p. 39.\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 113.\n\n560.\n\nProf. Amerasinghe describes the exception as follows576:\n\n\"The test of obvious futility clearly requires more than the probability of failure or the improbability of success, but perhaps less than the absolute certainty of failure. The test may be said to require evidence from which it could reasonably be concluded that the remedy would be ineffective\".\n\nCh. Amerasinghe, \"Local Remedies in International Law\", Cambridge, 2004, p. 206.\n\n561.\n\nThe ILC has recorded this exception in its Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection:\n\n\"Article 15. Exceptions to the local remedies rule\n\nLocal remedies do not need to be exhausted where:\n\n(a) There are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress\".\n\n562.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the exhaustion rule is subject to two categories of exceptions: an aggrieved alien is only required to pursue remedies\n\n- which are reasonably available (i), and\n\n- which have an expectation that they will be effective, *i.e.* the measure or appeal has a reasonable prospect of correcting the judicial wrong committed by the lower courts (ii).\n\nReasonable availability\n-----------------------\n\n563.\n\n(i) The first facet of the exhaustion rule is that the aggrieved alien must launch all remedies, which are not extravagant, and take them to the highest judicial instance in the land.\n\n564.\n\nThe burden on Claimant is not to pursue all possible remedies, but only those which are reasonably available. In the words of Paulsson577:\n\n\"[t]he victim of a denial of justice is not to pursue improbable remedies. Nor is he required to contrive indirect or extravagant applications beyond the ordinary path of a frontal attempt to have the judgment by which he was unjustly treated set aside, or to be granted a trial he was denied\".\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 113.\n\n565.\n\nProf. Amerasinghe supports the same conclusion578:\n\n\"An aggrieved alien is bound only to exhaust those remedies that are available to him. The requirement thus postulated has been described in terms of accessibility\".\n\nCh. Amerasinghe, *op. cit.,* p. 181.\n\n566.\n\nIn its Commentary to the ILC Draft on Diplomatic Protection, the ILC recalls that the \"reasonable availability\" test is supported by judicial decisions that considered that remedies need not be exhausted when579:\n\n\"\"[...] the local court has no jurisdiction over the dispute in question; the national legislation justifying the acts of which the alien complains will not be reviewed by local courts; the local courts are notoriously lacking in independence; there is a consistent and well-established line of precedents adverse to the alien; the local courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate an adequate remedy to the alien; or the respondent State does not have an adequate system of judicial protection\".\n\nText adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission's report covering the work of that session. The report, which also contains commentaries on the draft articles, appears in Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-first Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/61/10).\n\nEffectiveness\n-------------\n\n567.\n\n(ii) The aggrieved alien is not under an obligation to resort to an appeal which, although available, was obviously futile. As Prof. Amerasinghe explains, this exception580\n\n\"was a compromise between the interests of the respondent state in having a fair opportunity of doing justice by its own means and those of the alien in having the most efficient justice done at the lowest cost in the quickest way\".\n\nCh. Amerasinghe, *op. cit.,* p. 205.\n\n568.\n\nThe seminal case establishing this exception was the 1934 *Finnish Vessels Arbitration,* which held that a claimant is not obliged to resort to an appeal, provided that such remedy was \"obviously futile\"581. In the specific case the arbitrator found that where the finding of fact by a lower instance court was final, and the success of the claimant's case depended on a different finding of fact, an appeal to a higher Court was obviously futile582.\n\n*Finnish Vessels,* p. 1504.\n\n*Finnish Vessels,* p. 1543.\n\n569.\n\nThis initial threshold has been lowered by several decisions that followed. In the *Ambatielos Case,* the Arbitration Commission said that583:\n\n\"It is the whole system of legal protection, as provided by municipal law, which must have been put to the test [...]. It is clear, however, that [the exhaustion rule] cannot be strained too far. Taken literally, it would imply that the fact of having neglected to make use of some means of procedure \u2014 even one which is not important to the defence of the action \u2014 would suffice to allow a defendant State to claim that local remedies have not been exhausted, and that, therefore, an international action cannot be brought. This would confer on the rule of the prior exhaustion of local remedies a scope which is unacceptable\".\n\n*Ambatielos*, p. 120.\n\n570.\n\nIn the *Norwegian Loans* case, Judge Lauterpacht issued a separate opinion proposing a lower threshold with regard to effectiveness, which has gathered support in the writings of jurists584. He stated that:\n\n\"The requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is not a purely technical or rigid rule. It is a rule which international tribunals have applied with a considerable degree of elasticity [...]\n\nSee Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission's report covering the work of that session. The report, which also contains commentaries on the draft articles, appears in Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-first Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/61/10), p. 47.\n\n571.\n\nJudge Lauterpacht suggested that the exhaustion rule should be put aside where there was no \"reasonable possibility\" for the complainant to obtain \"an effective remedy\"585.\n\n*Norwegian Loans,* p. 39.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n572.\n\nThe tribunal in *Apotex* relied on the more rigid \"obvious futility\" test586. Other tribunals, such as *Loewen,* resorted to the standards of \"effectiveness\" and \"reasonable availability\" of the remedies. The tribunal in *ATA Construction* considered that the complainant has to exhaust those remedies that are \"plausibly available\"587; and in *Jan de Nul,* the tribunal said that the exception applied when \"there is no effective remedy or no reasonable prospect of success\"588.\n\n*Apotex,* para. 276.\n\n*ATA Construction,* para. 107.\n\n*Jan de Nul*, para. 258.\n\n573.\n\nA less rigid approach to the exceptions has been also applied in the non-NAFTA investment cases. In *Duke Energy:*\n\n\"[t]he Claimants are right to point out that there is no obligation to pursue 'improbable' remedies.589\"\n\n*Duke Energy,* para. 400.\n\n574.\n\nThe *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunal also qualified the rule as applicable only to reasonably available remedies590:\n\n\"It appears to be generally accepted in international law that obligations requiring an individual to approach a State's local courts before a claim may be taken to the international plane do not apply unconditionally. [...] only those remedies must be used which are available 'as a matter of reasonable possibility.\"\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Ambiente Ufficio,* para. 599.\n\n575.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that an investor who has suffered denial of justice is only required to exhaust remedies:\n\n- which are reasonably available, and\n\n- which have an expectation that they will be effective, *i.e.* the measure or the appeal have a reasonable prospect of correcting the judicial wrong suffered by the alien.\n\n**4.** **D****iscussion**\n-------------------------\n\n576.\n\nMexico argues that Claimant did not exhaust local remedies:\n\n\"- Claimant should have pursued other adequate remedies (and specifically the *nulidad del juicio concluido),* but failed to do;\"\n\n\"- Claimant wrongly withdrew the Amparo Proceedings; Claimant's argument is simply an assumption that the *Tribunal de Queja* and the Supreme Court were unlikely to render any decision in its favour.\n\n577.\n\nRespondent also denies that the Mexican Courts incurred in unreasonable delay, or that the expected duration of the remedy procedures would be unreasonable591.\n\nRR, paras. 313 and 319.\n\n578.\n\nLion defends the contrary position: it avers that\n\n- Mexico incurred in undue delay592,\n\n- Mexico failed to provide effective means to reverse the cancellation of the Mortgages593,\n\n- The *Amparo* Proceedings were the only adequate proceedings available594.\n\n- Continuation of the *Amparo* Proceedings was obviously futile595,\n\n\"- The finalization of the *Amparo* Proceedings would only have resulted in a finding that the *emplazamiento* in the Cancellation Lawsuit had been improperly made -requiring a new procedure to reinstate the validity of the Mortgages;\"\n\n- Exhaustion of local remedies would in total have lasted six years - an unreasonable period of time596.\n\nCPHB 224.\n\nCM para 423.\n\nCPHB para 227.\n\nCPHB para 229.\n\nCPHB, para 227.\n\nDecision\n--------\n\n579.\n\nThe Tribunal decides in favour of Lion for three reasons:\n\n\"- The *Amparo* was the only remedy, reasonably available to the Claimant, to undo the cancellation of the Mortgages (**A.**);\"\n\n\"- Lion sought redress before the highest Court available within the Amparo proceeding (**B.**);\"\n\n- Claimant unsuccessfully pursued the *Amparo* Proceedings for three years before the two available instances, and withdrew such Proceedings at a time when continuation would have been obviously futile and no effective redress would be obtained (**C.**).\n\n**A.** **The** ***Amparo*** **was the appropriate remedy**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nIn the present case, the international wrong committed by Mexico consists in a denial of justice: Mexico's judicial system has denied Lion access to justice by failing to correct the Cancellation Lawsuit, by denying Lion the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement and finally has denied Lion the right to allege and prove the forgery of the Forged Settlement Agreement. As a result of the denial of justice, the Mortgages, Lion's protected investments, have been cancelled and Claimant has lost the protection afforded by these securities.\n\n581.\n\nFor Lion the detrimental effects of the Cancellation Proceeding were twofold:\n\n\"- First, the Judgement ordered the cancellation of the Mortgages - and this was quickly accomplished, because the Judge ordered specific performance of the decision and by October 2012 the *Registros P\u00fablicos* had cancelled the Mortgages, which were extinguished for all legal purposes;\"\n\n- Second, the *Juez de lo Mercantil* also issued a decision, declaring that the Cancellation Judgement had become *res iudicata*, and precluding the possibility that Lion launch a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n.*\n\n582.\n\nWhen Lion finally obtained knowledge of the existence of the Cancellation Judgement, this decision had already become *res iudicata* - the ordinary *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n* was not any longer available. In the circumstances, Lion had, in principle, to choose between two procedures:\n\n\"- The *recurso de Amparo;* or\"\n\n- The *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido.*\n\n583.\n\n*Amparo* proceedings are an established institution under State and Federal law of Mexico, and represent the ordinary means to obtain protection from the Courts when constitutional rights have been breached597. The *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido* is an institution developed by Mexican jurisprudence, which is not codified under the law of Jalisco or at the Federal level, which can only be used in extraordinary circumstances to request the annulment of certain civil judgments which are already *causa juzgada.*\n\nZamora I, para. 79.\n\n584.\n\nThe Parties' experts discussed whether Lion could have had access to a *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido.* Mexico's legal expert - Dr. Ovalle - acknowledged that this type of remedy was not available to Lion under Codes of Civil Procedure of Jalisco and Nayarit598.\n\nOvalle II, para. 60.\n\n*Recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido*\n----------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nDr. Ovalle, however, suggests that Lion could have initiated a *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido,* based on a supplementary application of the Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal District (which regulates the *nulidad del juicio concluido)* and applies to supplement proceedings under the Commercial Code, pursuant to its Article 105 4599. Dr. Ovalle says that the Mexican Supreme Court has established jurisprudence endorsing this possibility by allowing a party to initiate a *juicio de nulidad* in civil proceedings under specific circumstances600. Dr. Ovalle refers to extracts of the jurisprudence of the Mexican Supreme Court applying this doctrine, in a case of the 1960s regarding *prescripci\u00f3n adquisitiva de dominio* (the doctrine of adverse possession)601 and a case of 2001, regarding a judgement of *estado civil* (marital status)602.\n\nOvalle I, para. 94.\n\nOvalle I, para. 93.\n\nOvalle I, p. 24, citing to Tesis de Jurisprudencia. \"Nulidad de Juicio Concluido, declarada en otro juidio posterior.

IV, p. 249, registro 913238.\n\n586.\n\nDr. Zamora - Lion's legal expert - does not agree: he acknowledges the general jurisprudence of the Mexican Supreme Court that allows the supplementary application of the Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal District to civil proceedings before the civil Courts of the Mexican States only in certain cases. Dr. Zamora cites additional jurisprudence that has clarified that the supplementary application of the Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal District to commercial proceedings does not include access to the remedies or appeals not governed in the Commercial Code603:\n\n\"De conformidad con el art\u00edculo 1054 del C\u00f3digo de Comercio, la aplicaci\u00f3n supletoria de la legislaci\u00f3n local en los juicios mercantiles no debe entenderse de un modo absoluto, sino con las restricciones que el propio numeral se\u00f1ala [...] trat\u00e1ndose de recursos, mismos que se encuentran reglamentados adecuadamente en ese cuerpo normativo, no existe la citada supletoriedad, en virtud de que tal legislaci\u00f3n cuenta con un sistema propio y completo de recursos, raz\u00f3n por la cual no puede sostenerse que deba aplicarse lo dispuesto por el referido art\u00edculo 1054 del C\u00f3digo de Comercio\".\n\nZamora IV, para. 37 citing to Tesis: VI.2o.

P\u00e1gina: 154.\n\n587.\n\nIn particular, with respect to the suppletory application of the *nulidad del juicio concluido*, the jurisprudence says that it is available in civil proceedings of \"*materia civil\",* however, it clarifies that604:\n\n\"Ahora bien, esta figura jur\u00eddica [nulidad de juicio concluido] es improcedente contra juicios mercantiles tramitados conforme al C\u00f3digo de Comercio, ello en raz\u00f3n de que no prev\u00e9 dicha nulidad, ni alguna similar mediante la cual pueda dejarse insubsistente lo resuelto en un proceso anterior, aunado a que no cabe la supletoriedad del c\u00f3digo procesal civil citado, ya que no fue voluntad del legislador hacer excepciones a la cosa juzgada en materia mercantil\".\n\nExh. R-41.\n\n588.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the Tribunal is not convinced that the *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido* was reasonable available to Lion in order to revert the Cancellation Judgment, which is undisputedly, *materia mercantil* and not *materia civil.*\n\n589.\n\nBut even if Claimant could, due to a favourable interpretation, overcome the limitation that the scope of the *nulidad de juicio concluido* is restricted to judgments of *materia civil,* it would encounter an additional hurdle: as pointed by Dr. Zamora, in a judgment of 2008, the Mexican Supreme Court declared the unconstitutionality of a provision of the *nulidad de juicio concluido* regulated in Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal District605, because it violated the principle of legal certainty606. Since then, a party seeking a *nulidad de juicio concluido* is required to provide evidence that the judgement impugned was rendered on the basis of a document that has been declared false. Lion would have to first file a criminal complaint seeking a declaration by the criminal Courts, that the Settlement Agreement was a forged document. Only then, could Lion try to initiate the *nulidad de juicio concluido,* with the hope that the Mexican courts would create new jurisprudence and extend the scope of this extraordinary remedy to a case of *materia mercantil*.\n\nArticle 737 A, *Fracci\u00f3n II, \u00faltima parte.*\n\nZamora, IV, para. 43, citing to Tesis: P./J. 88/2008.

Zamora IV-188).\n\n590.\n\nIn any event, Claimant was also precluded from launching successively an *Amparo* and a *nulidad de juicio concluido.* The filing of an *Amparo* precludes the subsequent presentation of a *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido.* Although Respondent's expert testified at the Hearing that the *nulidad de juicio concluido* and the *Amparo* are not mutually exclusive607, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that they are, based on Art. 73 of the *Amparo* law608:\n\n*\"CAPITULO VIII De los casos de improcedencia*\n\n*Art\u00edculo 73.- El juicio de amparo es improcedente:*\n\n*[...]XIV.- Cuando se est\u00e9 tramitando ante los tribunales ordinarios alg\u00fan recurso o defensa legal propuesta por el quejoso que pueda tener por efecto modificar, revocar o nulificar el acto reclamado\".*\n\nHT, p. 656.\n\nExh. CLA-308.\n\n591.\n\nClaimant chose the *Amparo* route. That this decision was the reasonably available remedy is proven by the Debtors foresight: anticipating that Lion would eventually launch an *Amparo* (and not a *recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido,* which was not reasonably available), the Debtors prepared the False *Amparo* Proceedings, a machination intended to forestall (as it eventually did) Lion's rightful *Amparo.*\n\n592.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal believes that Claimant resorted to the reasonable available remedy in the given circumstances.\n\nCriminal proceedings\n--------------------\n\n593.\n\nClaimant also launched criminal proceedings, which are still ongoing. The criminal proceedings also did not constitute a viable alternative avenue for Lion to pursue its economic claims, due to the vastly different character of criminal proceedings and the impossibility of obtaining the reversal of the Cancellation Judgment and the reinstatement of the Mortgages. Thus, Claimant is not required to first reach judicial finality in their respect to bring its NAFTA Art. 1105 claim.\n\n**B.** **The** ***Tribunal de Queja*** **was the highest Court available within the** ***Amparo*** **Proceeding**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n594.\n\nThe rule of exhaustion requires that the aggrieved alien obtain a ruling rendered by highest court in the host State609. Claimant says that the *Tribunal de Queja* was acting as the Court of highest instance in the *Amparo* Proceedings and that there was no possibility for Claimant to bring its case to the Supreme Court of Mexico - an allegation which has not been challenged by Mexico610.\n\nRR, paras. 180, 198-201; RCM, para. 188.\n\nCPHB, para. 227, citing HT, 592-593 (Mr. Zamora); RR, para. 310.\n\n595.\n\nIt is, thus, undisputed that Lion had taken its case to the highest available authority: the *recurso de revisi\u00f3n* brought the *Amparo* before the *Tribunal de Queja*, which was the highest authority available in the *Amparo* lawsuit.\n\n**C.** **Claimant was entitled to withdraw from the** ***Amparo*** **Proceeding**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n596.\n\nOn December 11, 2015 Lion waived the *Amparo* lawsuit.\n\n597.\n\nAt that point Claimant had spent almost three years in *Amparo* lawsuits before Mexican Courts, trying to undo the fraudulent cancellation of the Mortgages. It had achieved very little:\n\n\"- Lion had been deprived, by an idiosyncratic decision of the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* of filing an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation Judgement (issued by the same *Juez de lo Mercantil);*\"\n\n\"- The only avenue open to Lion had been an *Amparo,* which it filed as soon as it became aware of the Cancellation Judgement, but at a time when it still did not know that the Debtors had based their case on the Forged Settlement Agreement; Lion's recurring attempts to extend the scope of the *Amparo* to cover the forgery of the Settlement Agreement and to present evidence proving such forgery, had been dismissed by the first instance *Juez de Distrito* and in second instance by the *Tribunal de Queja*, for a purely formalistic reason: the *ampliaci\u00f3n de la demanda* had been signed on behalf of Lion by its attorney and not by its legal representative - a minor procedural defect Lion was never offered the opportunity to remedy;\"\n\n\"- Unable to submit that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, Lion's *Amparo* had been dismissed by the first instance *Juez de Distrito;* in the *Amparo* Judgement the *Juez de Distrito* assumed the Settlement Agreement to be valid and binding and concluded that Lion's *emplazamiento* had been properly served on Lic. L\u00f3pez Medina, Lion's process agent as identified in the Forged Settlement Agreement - an obscure attorney, with whom Lion had never had any relationship and who failed to inform Lion;\"\n\n\"- On appeal against the *Amparo* Judgement, the second instance *Tribunal de Queja,* whom Lion had asked to review a further time the prohibition to argue the forgery issue, did not take up this question; instead the *Tribunal de Queja*, in an unexpected move, made *sua sponte* the decision to remand the procedure back to the first instance Judge, with a strictly limited remit: to review whether the *Amparo* had been properly admitted, in light of the existence of a previous *Amparo* (the False *Amparo* - a decoy procedure filed fraudulently by the Debtors to derail the admissibility of the real *Amparo);*\"\n\n- Upon the instructions of the *Tribunal de Queja,* the *Juez de Distrito* again denied Lion's request to expand the scope of the remand, so that the *Amparo* could encompass the forgery of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n598.\n\nAccording to Claimant's expert611, the best-case scenario for the progression of the *Amparo* would have required an additional period of between 18 to 30 months to finalize; a positive outcome in favour of Lion would have resulted in the Cancellation Proceeding being held anew, which would take one to two more years612.\n\nZamora Hearing Presentation, pp. 12-13.\n\nZamora Hearing Presentation, p. 13.\n\n599.\n\nBut Claimant's prospects for a best-case scenario were limited:\n\n\"- First*,* the *Tribunal de Queja* remanded the case to the *Juez de Distrito* with a strictly limited mandate: to only look into the admissibility of the *Amparo* proceedings (in view of the False *Amparo*), explicitly prohibiting the *Juez de Distrito* from discussing the issue of the forgery of the Settlement Agreement, which constituted the cornerstone of Lion's *Amparo* Lawsuit;\"\n\n- Secondly*,* Lion's case was going to be heard by the same *Juez de Distrito* who had already dismissed the *Amparo* in the first instance, and\n\n- Thirdly, in this Remand *Amparo,* Lion filed a motion alleging the forgery of Mr. Arechederra's signature in the False *Amparo* and requested the *Juez de Distrito* to hear the testimony of Mr. Arechederra. The *Juez de Distrito* rejected the testimony and relied only on three expert reports to determine the authenticity of signature stamped in the False *Amparo.* Lion and one of the Debtors (Bains) appointed each an expert and the *Juez de Distrito* appointed a third expert. Lion's expert certified that the signature was not of Mr. Arechederra. However, the Debtor and the Court appointed experts arrived to the opposite conclusion, considering that the signature in the False *Amparo* was indeed of Mr. Arechederra's613.\n\nZamora I, para. 191.\n\n600.\n\nAt this point, the fate of the Remand *Amparo* was in jeopardy: it is most likely that the *Juez de Distrito* would have ruled that the False *Amparo* was authentic, thereby making Lion's real *Amparo* inadmissible and rendering any further legal actions obviously futile.\n\n*[Pro memoria,* Lion had lodged an incident at the outset of the *Amparo* proceeding alleging that on July 6, 2012 Sr. Arechederra's signature had been forged in the false request for copy before the *Juzgado de lo Mercantil.* In that instance, two of the three experts (Lion's expert and the one appointed by the *Juez de Distrito)* had concluded that the signature had been forged614. Based on the experts' evidence, the *Juez de Distrito* had accepted the falsehood of the signature stamped on the July 6, 2012 request for copy before the *Juzgado de lo Mercantil*615. That the first signature of Mr. Arechederra had been forged, would seem to support the conclusion that his second signature had also been forged - the purpose of the machination was to file the False *Amparo,* which required two signatures.]\n\nExh. C-115, pp. 31-34 and 36-39.\n\nSee para. 161 *supra;* Exh. C-115, p. 39.\n\n601.\n\nThus, Claimant was further away from annulling the cancellation of the Mortgages than it was at the outset of the local proceedings. Moreover, it had little prospect of success, since Lion was prohibited from presenting evidence to prove the forgery and the *Juez de Distrito* had already once decided against its position. And even if Lion was successful, the effect of the *amparo* would be limited to a declaration that the *emplazamiento* in the Cancellation Judgement had been improperly made. A new procedure before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* would be required, to annul the Cancellation Judgement, which already had the *status* of *cosa juzgada -* a process that would at least require three years for the Cancellation Judgment to be overturned.\n\n602.\n\nIt is at this point when Lion abandoned all hope to obtain redress from the Mexican judiciary and waived the *Amparo* lawsuit.\n\n603.\n\nIn sum, Lion was put in a situation where three years into the *Amparo* Proceeding the only point of discussion was whether such proceedings were admissible at all. In three years of litigation, Lion was unable to obtain from the Mexican judiciary a recognition that it had been subject to such a manifest fraud and identity theft, that would effectively result in the reversal of the cancellation of the Mortgages. It is difficult to accept that Lion did not exhaust all reasonable and available remedies with a reasonable prospect of reversing the denial of justice it had suffered.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n604.\n\nCase law supports the Tribunal's finding.\n\n605.\n\nIn the historic *Montano* case between the US and Peru, the Umpire rejected the US Government objection of non-exhaustion of local remedies and upheld Peru's claim. He wrote616:\n\n\"The obligation of a stranger to exhaust the remedies which nations have for obtaining justice, before soliciting the protection of his government, ought to be understood in a rational manner, that such obligation does not make delusive the rights of the foreigner .\n\n*Peru v. US,* Moore, \"Arbitrations\", 1630 at p. 1637, quoted from Paulsson, \"Denial of Justice in International Law\", p. 112.\n\n606.\n\nThe Peruvian claimant, a Sr. Montano, had obtained a US Federal judgement in his favour, but it remained unenforced due to the negligence of a US Marshal charged with its execution. The US government considered that claimant should have lodged a complaint against the Marshal, which led the Umpire to ironically reject the US position saying that \"what Montano gained by the sentence was the right to bring forward another complaint\".\n\n607.\n\nThe situation is similar in the present case: even if Claimant were to succeed in the *Amparo* Proceedings, what it would have gained is an acknowledgement that it had been improperly notified in the Cancellation Proceeding, and that these Proceedings should be repeated, upon proper notification of the American company.\n\n608.\n\nLion also finds itself in a similar position to the claimant in *Saipem,* who pursued local remedies for two and a half years until it became evident that continuing to litigate in local courts would have amounted to pursuing \"improbable remedies\"617:\n\n\"It is undisputed that Saipem had already litigated the issue of the arbitral misconduct for more than two and a half years in front of different courts in Bangladesh before being served with the decision revoking the power of the ICC Tribunal. It can thus be held to have exerted reasonable local remedies, having spent considerable time and money seeking to obtain redress without success although the allegation of misconduct was clearly ill-founded. Requiring it to do more and file appeals would amount to holding it to \"improbable\" remedies.\"\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n*Saipem,* para. 183.\n\n609.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Lion exhausted the reasonable available remedies that could have reversed the cancellation of the Mortgages. Lion was excused from continuing the Amparo proceeding in light of its obvious futility in the sense of its lack of any reasonable prospect of reversing the cancellation of the Mortgages.\n\n**VI.3.** **CONCLUSION**\n------------------------\n\n610.\n\nThe Tribunal's assessment of the facts of the present case and its conclusions on Lion's denial of justice claim are restricted to the conduct of the Courts of Jalisco with respect to the Cancellation and Amparo Proceedings. The Tribunal does not purport to pass judgement on the propriety or efficiency of the entire Mexican judicial system, for which this Tribunal has the utmost respect.\n\n611.\n\nThe Tribunal has held that Lion was wrongfully denied the right to appear before the *Juez de lo Mercantil* in the Cancellation Proceeding that resulted in the cancellation of the Mortgages. This was caused by a deeply flawed *emplazamiento* and *declaraci\u00f3n en rebeld\u00eda* that the Mexican judicial system never corrected.\n\n612.\n\nLion was further deprived from the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgment, based on an improper procedural decision that patently disregarded municipal law: the *Juez de lo Mercantil* deemed that the value of the Cancellation Proceeding was less than MEX 500,000 *(circa* USD 25,200). This decision was adopted despite the knowledge\n\n\"- that the Cancellation Judgment had the effect of removing the security for the Loans with a total value of USD 32.8 M; and\"\n\n- that the creditor had been declared in *rebeld\u00eda*.\n\n613.\n\nFinally, when Lion sought to remedy this situation through the *Amparo* proceeding, the two instances available (*Juez del Distrito* and *Tribunal de Queja*) refused Lion's repeated requests to be authorized to present evidence and allegations that it had been subject to a sophisticated fraud that had resulted in the loss of its investment.\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal has also concluded that Lion pursued the reasonably available remedies within the Mexican judicial system that should have effectively restored its rights; and that after several attempts to obtain redress, these remedies proved ineffective and obviously futile.\n\n615.\n\nIn view of all of the above, the Tribunal concludes that Mexico incurred in denial of justice and failed to provide Lion fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Art. 1105.\n\n**VI.4.** **THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nClaimant has formulated, in the alternative, two additional claims:\n\n\"- For judicial and administrative expropriation of Lion's investment under NAFTA Art. 1110; and\"\n\n- For failure to grant Lion's investment full protection and security under NAFTA Art. 1105.\n\n617.\n\nClaimant says that Mexico would be liable to award the same compensation for a breach of denial of justice or for any of the breaches alleged as alternative claims618.\n\nCPHB, paras. 143, 186, 243 and 247.\n\n618.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Mexico is responsible for a denial of justice in breach of NAFTA Art. 1105, and consequently Lion is entitled to compensation (to be established in the next section). Consequently, Lion's alternative claims are moot.\n\n**VII.** **QUANTUM**\n--------------------\n\n619.\n\nNAFTA Art. 1135(1)(a) provides for the award of monetary damages and applicable interest where a Party is found to have violated a Chapter Eleven provision. In the previous sections the Tribunal determined that Mexico breached the FET standard enshrined in NAFTA Art. 1105 through a denial of justice.\n\n620.\n\nThe NAFTA does not provide rules for the awarding of compensation in denial of justice claims, in breach of Art. 1105 - unlike in expropriation claims under Art. 1110. Consequently, the Tribunal must seek the appropriate standard in customary international law.\n\nCustomary international law\n---------------------------\n\n621.\n\nThe seminal case dealing with compensation under customary international law is the PCIJ's *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*619, a decision from 1928 which, despite the passage of nearly a century, remains a precedent which is extensively used by investment tribunals. It established the principle of full reparation for the injury caused, even if the treaty serving as the basis of the dispute does not contain a specific provision requiring full indemnification of the wronged party.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* Exh. CLA-180.\n\n622.\n\nThe PCIJ found that:\n\n\"\"[...] reparation must, so far as possible wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law\".\n\n623.\n\nThe customary international law principle of full reparation has been embodied in Art. 31(1) of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility, which states that:\n\n\"1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\".\n\n624.\n\nCustomary international law thus mandates that breaches by the host State of the obligations assumed under NAFTA Art. 1105, should be remedied by granting the wronged investor full reparation for the injury caused.\n\n625.\n\nAdditional guidance is provided by Art. 34 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which states that:\n\n\"Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter\".\n\n626.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant seeks solely reparation in the form of compensation, and Respondent has not proposed that instead it should grant restitution or satisfaction. The Tribunal must consequently award a compensation sufficient to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed620\".\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* p. 47.\n\n627.\n\nFull reparation by compensation requires that the Claimant, as regards its investment, be restored to the situation in which it would have been, had a breach not occurred. The appropriate methodology to establish the impairment suffered by Claimant's investment requires a three-step approach621:\n\n\"- In a first step, the Tribunal must value Claimant's investment (in this case the Mortgages) on a certain valuation date, under the assumption that no international wrong had occurred - the so called \"But For Scenario\";\"\n\n\"- In a second step, the Tribunal must determine the actual value of the investment, taking into consideration the effects of the breach - the so called \"As Is Scenario\";\"\n\n- In a final step, the difference between the But For and As Is values of the investment must be calculated, such difference representing the impairment suffered by the investment due to the host State's wrongful action.\n\nSee *Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* p. 51; *Burlington,* para. 357.\n\n628.\n\nClaimant is additionally entitled to any additional damages suffered as a consequence of the breach, to the extent that such damages have been incurred and can be proven.\n\nValuation date\n--------------\n\n629.\n\nDetermination of the impairment suffered by Claimant's investment requires selecting an appropriate valuation date. The Parties hold different positions:\n\n\"- Claimant estimates that in the judicial foreclosure action it would have acquired the Properties without an auction (since the debt exceeded the value of the collaterals) and that it would have re-sold the Properties by March 31, 2015; Lion proposes that this date should act as valuation date for all Mortgages622;\"\n\n- Respondent, on the other hand, says that the valuation dates should be separate for each Mortgage, and proposes September 7 and October 16, 2012 - the dates immediately before the cancellation of the Guadalajara and the Nayarit Mortgages in the *Registro P\u00fablico*623.\n\nCPHB, para. 248; Zamora II, para. 201.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 63 and CBRE Guadalajara I, p. 59.\n\n630.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Claimant's proposed valuation date to be purely hypothetical and premised on a large number of uncertainties. The only certain date in Claimant's But For Scenario is the start of the Foreclosure Proceeding for the Nayarit Property; the rest of the counter-factual milestones are purely hypothetical - including the commencement of foreclosure proceedings regarding the Guadalajara Properties, the ending of both foreclosure proceedings with a judgment ordering foreclosure and assignment of the Properties to Lion, and ultimately, the possibility of selling these Properties at arms' length to third parties around March 2015. The Tribunal lacks sufficient evidence to make a proper estimation as to when these events may have happened.\n\n631.\n\nIn this situation, the Tribunal prefers the valuation date proposed by Respondent: Mexico's denial of justice occurred over several judicial instances and an extensive period of time; but the origin of the denial of justice can be pinpointed to the Cancellation Judgment issued by the *Juez de lo Mercantil*, and the subsequent cancellation of the Mortgages by the Public Registries. There is also no doubt that such cancellation was a harmful act: it caused the extinction of the Mortgages and stripped Claimant's Loans of the collateral which guaranteed repayment. It thus is appropriate that the impairment of the investment be calculated as of the date of cancellation of each Mortgage.\n\n632.\n\nIn conclusion, the valuation dates should be September 7, 2012 for the Guadalajara Mortgages and October 16, 2012 for the Nayarit Mortgage.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n633.\n\nClaimant specifically requests the following categories of compensation624:\n\n\"- The first category is the impairment suffered by the investment, to be calculated as the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario (equal to the market value of the Properties, minus transaction costs) minus the value in the As Is Scenario (nil) (**VII.1.**);\"\n\n\"- The second category are certain Legal Fees which Claimant says could arise as a consequence of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding (**VII.2**);\"\n\n- The third category are certain expenses and fees incurred in the exhaustion of local remedies (**VII.3**).\n\nCPHB, para. 320.\n\n**VII.1.** **IMPAIRMENT OF THE INVESTMENT**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nThe first category of compensation requested by Claimant is the impairment allegedly suffered by its investment, the three Mortgages, to be calculated as the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario minus the value in the As Is Scenario.\n\nBut For Scenario\n----------------\n\n635.\n\nClaimant submits that the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario should be equal to the market value of the Properties as of the valuation date, minus transaction costs. In Lion's opinion, had it not been for Mexico's breach, it would have been able to acquire the Nayarit and Guadalajara Properties in the Foreclosure Proceedings and promptly re-sell them to a willing third party, using the sales price to set off (part of) the amounts due under the Loans625.\n\nCPHB, para. 248.\n\n636.\n\nThis proposition has not been opposed by Mexico.\n\n637.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees: were it not for the Cancellation Judgment issued by the *Juez de lo Mercantil* and the failure of Mexico's judicial system to correct this Judgment, in breach of the FET standard, the Mortgage registrations in the Nayarit and Guadalajara Public Registries would never have been cancelled. Upon default of the secured Loans, Lion would have instituted Foreclosure Proceedings, which would have resulted in the judicial enforcement of the Mortgages and in the assignment of the Properties to Lion - assignment of the mortgaged asset to the creditor (and not foreclosure by public auction) is the rule provided for by Mexican Law when the secured debt exceeds the market value of the mortgaged asset626.\n\nZamora II, para. 201.\n\n638.\n\nIn the present case, the secured debt in fact exceeded the value of the Properties: the Nayarit Mortgage was granted to secure the three Loans, and the two Guadalajara Mortgages secured the Second Loan and Third Loan respectively. By October 2012 the total debt under the three Loans amounted to approximately USD 104 M (USD 49,4 M under the First Loan, USD 38,9 M under the Second Loan and USD 15,9 under the Third Loan)627. As will be explained *infra,* the value of the Properties as of October 2012 was less than the debts secured by each of the Mortgages628.\n\nThe last invoice that Lion sent to Sr. Cardenas for the payment of the debt is as of June 30, 2011 and it records a total debt of USD 76 M (See para. 89 *supra;* CM, para. 27; Exh. C-42). With default interests running, the debt increased by October 2012 to USD 104 M.\n\nSee para. 761 *infra*\n\n639.\n\nIt is also safe to assume that, upon assignment of the Properties, Lion would have eventually sold them to a willing third party to recover its loans629.\n\nSee paras. 762 and 763 *infra*.\n\nForeclosure costs\n-----------------\n\n640.\n\nIn the But For Scenario, the assignment and re-sale of the Properties would imply certain foreclosure costs. Claimant agrees that such costs be deducted from the compensation and avers that the costs include630:\n\n\"- Public Registry and Notary fees, plus transfer taxes, which amount to 4.6% of the Nayarit Property sales price and 0.7% of the sales price of the Guadalajara Properties;\"\n\n- plus an amount in MEX631 and USD 50,000 in legal fees.\n\nPayne II, Appendix B.\n\n100,700.69 + 3% on the balance of the price - 3,736,575,01.\n\n641.\n\nRespondent has not questioned these amounts, and instead has focused its disagreement on the value of the Properties.\n\nValuation of the Properties\n---------------------------\n\n642.\n\nBoth Parties have engaged valuation experts to determine the market value of the Properties: Claimant presented the expert opinion of Mr. Marchitelli, who works for Cushman & Wakefield, and Respondent relied on the valuation carried out by a team from CBRE.\n\n643.\n\nThe valuation of an asset, whether an enterprise, or as in this case, real estate, is a complex exercise, which requires the election of a certain methodology, the definition of certain hypotheses, the calculation of certain variables and, at the end of the day, the making by the valuer of certain estimations. Depending on these factors, different valuers may reach materially different results.\n\n644.\n\nIn this case, Claimant seeks damages of USD 85.9M, based on its expert's proposed valuation of the Properties632. Respondent's expert, on the other hand, arrives at a much more conservative figure, proposing a valuation of USD 47M633.\n\nPayne II, para. 11; H-4, p. 11 and 27\n\nRR, para. 635.\n\n645.\n\nGiven the wide spectrum of results that different valuations may yield, tribunals need to retain a certain margin of appreciation in determining the final compensation due. This does not mean that the tribunal becomes an *amiable compositeur,* because the tribunal's margin of appreciation can only be exercised in a reasoned manner and within the boundaries of the principles of international law for the calculation of damages634.\n\n*Rusoro,* para. 642; *Gold Reserve,* para. 686.\n\n646.\n\nIn determining Lion's compensation for Mexico's NAFTA breach the Tribunal will take as its starting point the valuations of the Properties that each of the Parties' experts have presented. The Tribunal will thereafter make an adjustment, to reflect the actual value of the Properties and the Mortgages, in the specific circumstances of this case.\n\n647.\n\nThe Tribunal will first assess the market values of the Nayarit Property (**1.**) and of the Guadalajara Properties (**2.**), as calculated by the experts; it will then make certain adjustments to reflect the proper calculation of the impairment suffered by the investments (**3.**); and finally, will address and dismiss Respondent's ancillary arguments that purport to reduce the compensation due (**4.**).\n\n**1.** **T****he market value of the** **N****ayarit** **P****roperty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nThe Nayarit Property is located on Banderas Bay, in an area known as Distiladeras635. It is an unimproved, oceanfront tract that covers an area of approximately 373,558 m2636:\n\nCushman I, p. 9.\n\nCushman I, p. 10.\n\n649.\n\nThrough the property runs an old double lane road, close to the beach, which links the cities of Punta Mita and La Cruz [the \"**Old Road**\"].\n\nThe Collaboration Agreement\n---------------------------\n\n650.\n\nOn July 30, 2008 the Nayarit State Government and Inmobiliaria Bains (one of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas's companies) signed a collaboration agreement [the \"**Collaboration Agreement**\"]637. The agreement acknowledged that Inmobiliaria Bains held the Nayarit Property and that the Old Road ran across it638. The Old Road, however, did not have its *\"derecho de v\u00eda liberado\"* and this was both problematic and irregular639. To resolve that situation, the Nayarit State Government planned on building a new road linking the same two cities (Punta de Mita and La Cruz) but farther away from the coast640 [the \"**New Highway**\"].\n\nExh. C-188.\n\nWhereas 2.4.\n\nWhereas 1.3.\n\nWhereas 2.5.\n\n651.\n\nPursuant to the Collaboration Agreement:\n\n\"- The Government undertook to give the possession of the Old Road to Inmobiliaria Bains641 as soon as the works of the New Highway were completed642 (which were supposed to last eight months643);\"\n\n- Inmobiliaria Bains would transfer an area of land for the construction of the New Highway644 and contribute to a portion of the building costs645, estimated at MEX 23.5 M, by bank check issued at that moment in favour of the Government646.\n\nClause Segunda e).\n\nClause Sexta.\n\nClause S\u00e9ptima.\n\nClause Tercera a).\n\nClause Tercera b).\n\nClause Quinta.\n\n652.\n\nThere is no dispute that the New Highway is presently in use, and so still is the Old Road.\n\n653.\n\nAs will be seen further below, the implications of having the Old Road transverse the Nayarit Property is one of the main points of departure between the experts.\n\n654.\n\nThis is an aerial photograph of the area, depicting the Old Road, the Nayarit Property and the New Highway647:\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nH4, p. 4.\n\n655.\n\nBoth experts were tasked with the estimation of the market value of the Nayarit Property, assuming that its highest and best use is for tourist-related development, including hotels, condominiums and single-family homes648.\n\nCushman I, p. 11. CBRE Nayarit I, p. 48.\n\n656.\n\nClaimant's valuation was based on a sales comparison approach649 (**1.1**); Respondent's expert used the same approach650, but validated the results with a residual methodology (**1.2.**). The experts' valuations differ by USD 27.3 M651. The Tribunal will have to determine which valuation is preferable (**1.3.**).\n\nCushman I, p. 3.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 51.\n\nClaimant proposes a value of USD 48.6 M in October 2012; Respondent suggested MEX 274,739,000 in October 2012. Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 542 mentions that CBRE values the Nayarit Property as of October 2012 at USD 21.3 M. RPHB, para. 134 refers to a difference of USD 8.3 M but confuses the Nayarit Property's value with the Guadalajara Properties' one.\n\n**1.1** **C****laimant****'****s valuation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n657.\n\nMr. Marchitelli from Cushman & Wakefield made a special assumption regarding the valuation of the Nayarit Property: since the Collaboration Agreement foresaw that Inmobiliaria Bains would gain full possession of the Old Road once the New Highway was built, Mr. Marchitelli assumed that the Old Road would be an integral part of the Nayarit Property and that the strip of land of the Old Road would be developed together with the rest of the Nayarit Property as a single plot652.\n\nCushman I, p. 11.\n\n658.\n\nBased on the above special assumption, the expert sought comparable properties with ocean frontage. He identified seven sales of parcels of vacant land in the same market area as the Nayarit Property that are suitable for residential and/or hospitality development653.\n\nCushman I, p. 14.\n\n659.\n\nA summary of the comparables654 and their location655 follows:\n\n\"\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **LAND SALES SUMMARY** |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Sale No.** | **Property Location** | **Sale Date** | **Sale Price (US$)** | **Site Size (m2)** | **Site Size (Ha.)** | **Price US/m2** | **Frontage (m)** |\n|  |  |  |  |  | **Beach** | **Ocean** |\n| S | Fraction A - San Ignacio de la Cruz | -- | -- | 373,558 | 37.36 | -- | 460 | 1,050 |\n| 1 | La Solana, Punta Mita | Dec-13 | $30,460,000 | 161.874 | 16.19 | $188.17 | 196 | 796 |\n| 2 | Playa Pontoque, Carr.

Mr. Marchitelli increased the price for each comparable by the increase in the Mexican National Consumer Price Index during the same period656. After this adjustment for market conditions, the prices ranged from USD 105.88/m2 to USD 232.26/m2657\n\nCushman I, p. 19.\n\nCushman I, p. 20.\n\n661.\n\nSecondly, the expert adjusted the prices upward or downward depending on whether the comparables' location, size, ocean frontage and marketability were better or worse than the Nayarit Property's658; and then weighted the prices according to his expertise659.\n\nCushman I, p. 20.\n\nCushman I, p. 21.\n\n662.\n\nAs a result, the expert believes USD 160 per m2 (as of December 2017), in total, USD 59,769,280 to be a market value for the Nayarit Property660. The expert suggests using the Mexican National Consumer Price Index to convert that market value to terms of the date of valuation661. The value as of March 31, 2015 would be USD 53.3 M662.\n\nCushman I, p. 21.\n\nCushman I, p. 22.\n\nH4, p. 11.\n\nRespondent's criticism\n----------------------\n\n663.\n\nCBRE does not accept USD 160/m2 as a reasonable price for the Nayarit Property. Especially, taking into consideration that the Nayarit Property was sold in July 2016 for MEX 803.69/m2 - this means that, if Mr. Marchitelli was correct, the property would have increased its value by almost 400%663.\n\nCBRE II, p. 15.\n\n664.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent makes the following comments on the comparables sales chosen by Mr. Marchitelli:\n\n\"- Sales 1, 2, 3 and 4 were adjusted upward artificially because of inflation664; and, if anything, inflation adjustments should be made taking the average of past five years' Mexican National Consumer Price Index665;\"\n\n\"- Sale 1 was a plot sold in conjunction with a Four Seasons hotel; it is however unclear how Mr. Marchitelli decided to allocate to the plot USD 30.46 M out of the total sale price666;\"\n\n\"- Sale 2 (Playa Pontoque) is an inexistent closing: the alleged buyer has informed CBRE that it never acquired the property667;\"\n\n\"- Sale 4 (Rosewood) is part of a larger development, including infrastructure, which added value to the plot, but no downward adjustment was made in comparison to the Nayarit Property, which is not part of a master plan development668;\"\n\n\"- Sale 6 consists of two parcels with different uses each669 (a 20,000 m2 parcel with tourist zoning and USD 120/m2, and a second parcel of 54,500 m2 with residential zoning classification670) - a downward adjustment is necessary to account for the fact that it is a listing price, not a sales price671;\"\n\n- Sale 7 should also be adjusted downward because it is a listing and has a better location than the Nayarit Property672.\n\nCBRE II, p. 15.\n\nCBRE II, p. 16.\n\nRPHB, para. 160.\n\nCBRE II, p. 17.\n\nRPHB, para. 155.\n\nCBRE II, p. 17.\n\nHT, p. 865.

Hence, Respondent's expert divides the 373,558 m2 of the Nayarit Property into three distinct areas674:\"\n\n\"- Ocean frontage: 139,465 m2 (**A.**);\"\n\n\"- View on the sea: 204,496 m2 (**B.**);\"\n\n- Old Road and utility poles675: 29,596.9 m2.\n\nCBRE II, p. 20.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 53.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 18.\n\n666.\n\nThe expert values the first two areas separately.

Claimant takes issue with a number of premises assumed by CBRE:\n\n\"- By dividing the Nayarit Property into two discrete geographical areas, disregarding the Collaboration Agreement, its full development potential and true highest and best use was not acknowledged697;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 2 was sold on July 29, 2016 for USD 45.12/m2, as a distressed sale, the seller being an entity controlled by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas698 and Comparable 4 was also a distressed sale699; but the very definition of market value used also by CBRE, provides that transactions are made without duress and the seller is under no compulsion to sell700;\"\n\n\"- Offering 2 is a property more than 30 km away from the beach - it is not acceptable as a comparable property for an ocean view property701;\"\n\n\"- Adjustment factors based on whether there is access through fewer or more roads only make sense when valuing urban property702;\"\n\n\"- The land residual method is inherently unreliable because of the many assumptions that need to be used703, which are totally unsupported704;\n\nCushman II, p. 6.\n\nCushman II, p. 8.\n\nCushman II, p. 6.\n\nH4, p. 19.\n\nCushman II, p. 7.\n\nHT, p. 914.\n\nHT, pp. 932 and 933.\n\nCushman II, p. 9.\n\nCushman II, p. 10.\n\n**1.3** **T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, in order to reach a decision on the adequate value of the Nayarit Property, it must perform a double analysis: how, if at all, the Old Road should impact the valuation (**A.**); and which adjusted comparables should be used to determine the value of the Nayarit Property (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Impact of Old Road**\n-----------------------------\n\n677.\n\nIt is undisputed that, at valuation date, an Old Road crossed the Nayarit Property.\n\n678.\n\nRespondent's expert suggests valuing the Nayarit Property as it is, with the Old Road dividing the Property in two plots: one ocean frontage and one with view on the sea. Claimant's expert, on the other hand, puts emphasis on the existence of a Collaboration Agreement by which the Government of Nayarit granted Inmobiliaria Bains full possession over the Old Road in exchange of land and money to build the New Highway; since the New Highway is already built, the expert believes that the Nayarit Property should be valued under the special assumption that the Old Road would be an integral part of the Property, and that it could be developed as a whole.\n\n679.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant on this point.\n\n680.\n\nThe terms of the Collaboration Agreement are clear: upon completion of the New Highway, Inmobiliaria Bains would have complete possession over the Old Road to use it as it saw fit. Since there is no discussion that the Nayarit Property has more value without the Old Road705, it seems reasonable to assume that a prospective buyer would remove the Old Road and develop that strip of land together with the rest of the Nayarit Property.\n\nHT, p. 830.\n\n681.\n\nIn view of the above, the Nayarit Property will be considered, for valuation purposes, a single piece of land, apt for development as a whole, pursuant to its highest and best use.\n\n**B.** **Adjusted comparables**\n-------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nBoth experts have valued the Nayarit Property through sales comparisons. Respondent's expert has also applied a residual use method, as a secondary approach for validation, a decision criticized by Claimant's expert706: the method allegedly is fraught with unsupported hypotheses707 and a minor change in any of these could have profound upward or downward effects on the value708.\n\nHT, p. 952.\n\nCushman II, p. 10.\n\nCushman II, p. 9.\n\n683.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both experts have expressed their preference for sales comparison as the most appropriate method to estimate the value of the Nayarit Property; thus, to the extent that the Tribunal is satisfied that this approach renders an appropriate value, there will be no need to perform a validation through the residual method.\n\n684.\n\nUnder the sales comparison approach the experts have each provided a list of comparables which, duly adjusted, could serve to estimate the Nayarit Property's value. But both experts have raised a number of critiques regarding the comparables and the adjustments proposed by the counter-expert. The Tribunal will analyse the suggested comparables and adjustments, one by one, starting with Mr. Marchitelli's (**a.**), followed by CBRE's (**b.**).\n\n**a. Claimant's adjusted comparables**\n--------------------------------------\n\n685.\n\nClaimant's expert found seven comparables (five sales and two listings). Respondent's expert has taken issue with three of them:\n\n\"- Sale 1 (La Solana): according to public information this plot together with a Four Seasons Resort was sold for roughly USD 200 M709, of which Mr. Marchitelli has allocated USD 30.46 M to the land; CBRE questions how Mr. Marchitelli decided which portion of the price related to the parcel and Mr. Marchitelli responded that the developer, contacted by a local valuer, confirmed the prices710; the Tribunal sees no reason to strike Sale 1 as comparable: Respondent's expert has not denied the sale, nor has it challenged the reasonableness of the price allotted to the land, or suggested an alternative price - it simply questions Mr. Marchitelli's method, but the Tribunal notes that real estate transactions occur in a closed market, with scarce public data, and in these circumstances it seems reasonable to rely on local appraisers and on informal contacts with persons directly involved in the transactions to obtain information which would otherwise never reach the public.\"\n\n\"- Sale 2 (Playa Pontoque): both experts agree that this sale was never consummated711; however, Mr. Marchitelli believes that Sale 2 at least shows a meeting of the minds712; the Tribunal considers that if Sale 2 never became a closed deal, the proper way to proceed is to treat this sale as a listing and have its price adjusted accordingly.\"\n\n\"- Sale 6: Respondent's expert avers that this plot actually consists of two parcels with different uses - one with 20,000 m2 and USD 120/m2 has tourist zoning, and the other of 54,500 m2 has residential zoning classification713; the Tribunal sees no cause to disregard Sale 6: in its residual approach, CBRE has acknowledged that the best development of the Nayarit Property would be as two distinct facilities (a hotel and a residential area) - it seems that Sale 6, *prima facie,* could similarly be developed separately as a hotel and as a residential area; and, since Respondent's expert has not disclosed the price of the residential zoning parcel of Sale 6, the Tribunal cannot verify whether the average price provided by Mr. Marchitelli for both parcels (USD 140/m2) requires a downward adjustment.\n\nHT, p. 822.\n\nHT, pp. 822 and 823.\n\nCBRE II, p. 17. HT, p. 847.\n\nHT, p. 847.\n\nHT, p. 865.\n\n686.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that Sales 1, 2 and 6 are proper comparables; however, Sale 2 needs to be treated as a listing and thus adjusted accordingly. The following paragraphs will address issues regarding appropriate adjustment and weighting that need to be applied to all comparable sales.\n\nRespondent's expert\n-------------------\n\n687.\n\nRespondent's expert, in essence, took issue with two general adjustments undertaken by Mr. Marchitelli (**i.** and **ii.**) and suggested further downward adjustment on two comparables (**iii.**):\n\n(i) Market conditions\n---------------------\n\n688.\n\nMr. Marchitelli valued the Nayarit Property as of December 2017, the date the transaction of Sale 5 (Playa Amor) took place. This is the latest date of all transactions used as comparables. The expert decided to bring the price of the other four previous transactions to December 2017 using the Mexican National Consumer Price Index.\n\n689.\n\nRespondent's expert finds that this procedure raises comparable prices artificially714. And, if at all, inflation adjustments should be made using the average of the past five years' Mexican National Consumer Price Index715.\n\nCBRE II, p. 15.\n\nCBRE II, p. 16.\n\n690.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree.\n\n691.\n\nClaimant's valuation relies on comparable sales which took place between December 2013 (Sale 1 - La Solana) and December 2017 (Sale 5 - Playa Amor). But a nominal price of 2013, in times of inflation, is worth less in 2017 - therefore, it becomes necessary to harmonise amounts set at different moments in time before performing a comparison.\n\n692.\n\nTo bring forward past amounts and normalise them in terms of inflation, the expert applies the Mexican National Consumer Price Index, an index which - in general terms - measures the evolution of the cost of living.\n\n693.\n\nIn contrast, CBRE has used unaltered nominal prices of transactions reaching back to August 2012 and December 2011716 to infer a value of the Nayarit Property as of 8 October 2018 - the expert has, thus, assumed that the value of MEX has not changed between 2011/2012 and 2018; but the evolution of the Mexican National Consumer Price Index seems to suggest the opposite, as the following graph shows717:\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 54.\n\nCushman I, Exhibit 6.\n\n694.\n\nAs to whether Mr. Marchitelli should have adjusted for inflation using the average National Consumer Price Index of the past five years718, the Tribunal finds no support for such proposition. Claimant's expert adjusted the past nominal prices to account for the increases in the National Consumer Price Index between transaction dates and December 2017; and did the same when discounting the December 2017 value to the valuation date719. Mr. Marchitelli's use of the National Consumer Price Index to bring amounts forward and backwards in time has been consistent.\n\nCBRE II, p. 16.\n\nCushman I, p. 23.\n\n695.\n\nMoreover, it seems that CBRE obviated the criticism just made, when it brought back the value of the Nayarit Property from October 2018 to October 2012 using the difference in the National Consumer Price Index between both dates (and not the average of the past five years)720.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 63.\n\n(ii) Subjective adjustments\n---------------------------\n\n696.\n\nCBRE characterises the adjustments on the sales prices performed by Mr. Marchitelli as subjective and lacking explanations721.\n\nCBRE II, p. 16.\n\n697.\n\nThe Tribunal partially agrees with CBRE as all valuation procedures entail a degree of subjectivity. The appraiser decides, based on his or her expertise, what adjustment factors are relevant and how to weight the different comparables. But subjectivity does not equal randomness. The Tribunal is satisfied with the explanations provided by Mr. Marchitelli of the motivation underpinning the adjustment and weighting factors used722 - this being said without prejudice to the Tribunal's decision regarding further adjustments.\n\nCushman I, pp. 20 and 21.\n\n698.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that CBRE's valuation, and more particularly, the choice of normalisation723 and weighting724 factors is also premised on the subjectivity of the appraisers who drafted the report.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, pp. 56 and 58.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, pp. 57 and 58.\n\n(iii) Further downward adjustment\n---------------------------------\n\n699.\n\nRespondent has suggested performing an additional downward adjustment to two comparable sales:\n\n\"- Sale 4 (Rosewood) is located in a large luxury development called La Mandarina, the master plan development of which foresees the construction of certain infrastructure which Mr. Marchitelli accepted would add value to the plot, yet no downward adjustment was made to account for the fact that the Nayarit Property has no master development plan725; the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a downward adjustment is warranted - the Tribunal notes, however, that Sale 4 has been adjusted upward by Mr. Marchitelli because the Nayarit Property has, generally, a better location726; absent evidence on the specific weight to be attributed to adjustment factors for infrastructure and for general location, the Tribunal decides to weigh them equally, with the result that the new downward adjustment and the existing upward adjustment for general location cancel each other out.\"\n\n\"- Sale 7 should be adjusted downward because it is a listing and has a better location than the Nayarit Property727; the Tribunal notes that Sale 7 has already been adjusted downwards to reflect that it is a listing728 - no further adjustments seem necessary.\n\nHT, p. 825.\n\nCushman I, p. 20.\n\nCBRE II, p. 19.\n\nCushman I, p. 19.\n\n700.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal decides to disregard the general location upward adjustment performed on Sale 4 by Mr. Marchitelli, to compensate for the warranted infrastructure downward adjustment which was lacking.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n701.\n\nMr. Marchitelli relied upon five sales and two listings which in view of the above decisions must be adjusted as follows729:\n\n\"- Sale 3 (USD 105.88/m2) needs to be adjusted upwards for an inferior location and larger size than the Nayarit Property; in order to quantify these two upward adjustments, the Tribunal will rely on CBRE's expert opinion, according to which, the degree of desirability should translate into a 10% increase730 - since for Sale 3 two upward adjustments are warranted, the Tribunal will increase the price by a 1.2 factor; this results in USD 127.06/m2.\"\n\n\"- Sale 4 (USD 116.08/m2) needs only be adjusted upwards for having less beach area than the Nayarit Property - the other two proposed adjustments cancelled each other out, pursuant to the Tribunal's previous decision731; the Tribunal will apply a 1.1 factor; this results in USD 127.69/m2.\"\n\n- Listing 6 (USD 140.87/m2) requires two downward adjustments for being larger than the Nayarit Property and a listing rather than a sale, and two upward adjustments for having less beach and an inferior configuration than the Nayarit Property - positive and negative adjustments that cancel each other out.\n\n\"- Listing 7 (USD 168.31/m2) requires two downward adjustments for having a worse location than the Nayarit Property and being a listing, and an upward adjustment for having less beach - since a positive and a negative adjustment cancel each other out, the Tribunal must only adjust the listing price by applying a 0.9 factor (the factor used by CBRE to adjust listing prices732); the resulting price is USD 151.48/m2;\"\n\n- Sale 5 (USD 187.36/m2) is adjusted downward for being larger than the Nayarit Property and upward twice for having less beach area and a more complicated shape - this means that the price needs to be increased by a factor of 1.1, USD 206.1/m2.\n\n\"- Sale 1 (USD 220.75/m2) is adjusted downward twice for being larger and in a better location and upward once for having less beach - in sum, the price will be adjusted by a factor of 0.9 to USD 198.67/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale 2 (USD 232.26/m2) is only adjusted upward once, to account for the fact that it has less beach area than the Nayarit Property; thus, the price will be augmented by a 1.1 factor, USD 255.5/m2.\n\nCushman I, p. 20.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 56: good desirability has a factor of 1.1, high desirability of 1.2.\n\nSee para. 699 *supra.*\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 56.\n\n**b. Respondent's adjusted comparables**\n----------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nRespondent's expert divided the Nayarit Property in two, on account of the Old Road: one parcel with ocean frontage and one with view over the sea; then the expert looked for comparables for each plot.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, has accepted as a special assumption that the Old Road is an integral part of the Nayarit Property and that it is subject to development together with the rest of the land. Thus, the Nayarit Property is a 373,558 m2 ocean frontage plot. It follows that the comparables identified as sea view without ocean frontage are less suitable for estimating the value of an ocean frontage property such as the Nayarit one.\n\n704.\n\nBut CBRE also located four sales and two listings of parcels with ocean frontage. These transactions are *prima facie* eligible comparables. However, Claimant has made a number of criticisms, which will be addressed by the Tribunal:\n\n\"- Comparables 2 and 4 should be disregarded because they were distressed sales733, sold at half the price commanded by properties without any sea frontage734; Respondent accepts that Comparable 2 was a distressed sale and should be eliminated from the analysis735 and, as Claimant points out, Mexico has not denied that Comparable 4 was a forced sale736; the Tribunal agrees: both experts were tasked with estimating the market value of the Nayarit Property737 and a distressed sale is outside the scope of market value.\"\n\n\"- No inflation adjustment was applied to pre-2018 comparables738: the Tribunal notes that CBRE uses the Mexican National Consumer Price Index to bring an October 2018 value back to an October 2012 value; however, when calculating the 2018 value, the expert takes transactions which occurred over a period covering from 2012 to 2017 at nominal value, without performing an inflation adjustment - this approach artificially brings down the price as when moving forward in time no upright adjustment is made but when projecting back, a downward adjustment is performed. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that pre-2018 comparables must be subject to an inflation adjustment.\"\n\n- No adjustment for amount of ocean frontage was made739 or for proximity to the Nayarit Property740: the Tribunal has already accepted that valuation is not an exact science, but rather open to and dependent on the expertise and subjectivity of the appraiser - the Tribunal accepts that CBRE, for good reason, favoured other adjustment factors over those two.\n\n\"- CBRE adjusted the prices taking into account the number of roads through which the property is accessible, when in fact this would only be relevant for urban properties and Respondent's expert agreed that this adjustment is not relevant to a beach property741; the Tribunal will thus disregard this adjustment factor.\n\nHT, p. 788.\n\nHT, p. 790.\n\nHT, p. 905.\n\nCPHB, para. 275.\n\nCushman I, p. 2: \"I was requested to estimate the market value CBRE Nayarit I, p. 5: \"El prop\u00f3sito del presente estudio es estimar el valor de mercado de la propiedad en estudio ...\".\n\nCPHB, para. 278.\n\nCPHB, para. 255.\n\nCPHB, para. 270.\n\nHT, pp. 932 and 933.\n\n705.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal shall only consider comparables with ocean frontage and within this group will disregard Comparables 2 and 4 which are distressed sales (**i.**), apply an inflation adjustment (**ii.**), and not adjust any of the comparables in view of the number of roads through which the property has access (**iii.**).\n\n706.\n\n(i) These are the remaining comparables - two sales and two listings742:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| RESUMEN VE | NTA DE TERRE | NOS - RIVIERA NAYARIT |\n| **No.** | Direcci\u00f3n | Fecha Transacci\u00f3n | \u00c1rea Terreno | Precio Venta (MX$) | **Precio Venta(MX$/m2)** | Ubicaci\u00f3n | **Infraestructura** | Uso de Suelo |\n| **1** | **Terreno Denominado \"EI lzote\" Fraccionamiento lo Reserva, Boh\u00eda de Banderas, Noyarit** | **Sep-16** | **891,783** | **$1,670,634,665** | **$1,873.36** | **Frente de Playa** | **Parcial** | **Turistico** |\n| **2** | **Carretera Crut de Huanacaxtle - Punta de Mita SN, Bah\u00eda de Banderos, Noyarit** | **Jul-16** | **900,000** | **$750,190,792** | **$833.55** | **Frente de Playa** | **Completo** | **Turistico - Residencial** |\n| **3** | **Fracci\u00f3n de Terreno Denominado \"Lo Mandonina\", Bah\u00eda de Banderas, Noyarit** | **Aug-12** | **25,000** | **$36,257,375** | **$1,450.30** | **Frente de Playa** | **Completo** | **Turistico** |\n| **4** | **Lote de Terreno Identificado como RU-1, RU-2, RU-3, RT15, RTI5A y Poligono 1B, Carretera Punta Mita - a la Cruz de Huanocaxtle, Punta Pantoque, en el Municipio de Bucenas, Noyarit** | **Aug-17** | **135,056** | **$170,000,000** | **$1,258.73** | **Frente de Playa** | **Parcial** | **Turistico** |\n| **OFERTAS** | **AS ACTUALES** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **L4** | **Terreno Sayulita Noyarit** | **Listing** | **110,000** | **$166,320,000** | **$1,512.00** | **Frente de Playa** | **Parcial** | **Turistico** |\n| **L5** | **Terreno Vista Herrmosa, Sayulita, Noyarit** | **Listing** | **890,000** | **$1,345,680,000** | **$1,512.00** | **Frente de Playa** | **Parcial** | **Turistico** |\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 54.\n\n707.\n\n(ii) Comparables 1 and 3 need to be adjusted for inflation. Mr. Marchitelli has brought his comparables to December 2017 values; to enable comparison, the Tribunal will capitalise CBRE's values to the same date. To do so, Mr. Marchitelli relied on the Mexican National Consumer Price Index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis743. According to this publication:\"\n\n\"- In September 2016 the index was at 103.08389 whilst in December 2017 it was at 112.11382 - this means an upward change of the Comparable 1 September 2016 price by 1.08744: MEX 1,873.36/m2 of September 2016 equal MEX 2,037.46/m2 in December 2017;\"\n\n- In August 2012 the index was at 90.2298, whilst in December 2017 it was at 112.11382 - this requires an upward adjustment of the Comparable 3 August 2012 price by 1.24745: MEX 1,450.3/m2 of August 2012 become MEX 1,802.05/m2 in December 2017.\n\nCushman I, Exhibit 6. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEXCPIALLMINMEI\n\n112.11382/103.08389 = 1.08\n\n112.11382/90.2298 = 1.24\n\n708.\n\nSince the comparables provided by CBRE are in MEX, while Mr. Marchitelli's are in USD, the Tribunal will convert all amounts into USD. Mr. Marchitelli concluded that the Nayarit Property was worth USD 160/m2746 or MEX 3,100/m2747 as of December 2017; this implies an exchange rate of 19.375 MEX/USD. Converted into USD at this exchange rate, CBRE's comparables look as follows:\"\n\n\"- Comparable 1: MEX 2,037.46/m2 in December 2017 is USD 105.16/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 3: MEX 1,802.05/m2 in December 2017 equals USD 93/m2;\"\n\n- Offerings 4 and 5: MEX 1,512/m2 is 78.04 USD/m2.\n\nCushman I, p. 21.\n\nCushman I, p. 24.\n\n709.\n\n(iii) Compared to the Nayarit Property, the only adjustments performed by CBRE for normalisation purposes were748:\n\n\"- On Comparable 3, for surface area (factor 0.92) and equipment (factor 1.05); this means, in average, a factor of 0.985 that applies to USD 93/m2 and results in USD 91.61/m2.\"\n\n\"- On Offerings 4 and 5 to account for the fact that their prices do not reflect a close sale (factor 0.9749); this implies that USD 78.04/m2 sales price be reduced to USD 70.2/m2.\"\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 56.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 56.\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal has normalised all comparable transactions provided by both experts and arrives at the following prices per m2:\n\n\"- Offering 4: USD 70.2/m2;\"\n\n\"- Offering 5: USD 70.2/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 3: USD 91.61/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 1: USD 105.16/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale 3: USD 127.06/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale 4: USD 127.69/m2;\"\n\n\"- Listing 6: USD 140.87/m2;\"\n\n\"- Listing 7: USD 151.48/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale 1: USD 198.67/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale 5: USD 206.1/m2;\"\n\n- Sale 2: USD 255.5/m2.\n\n711.\n\nInstead of calculating the arithmetic mean, Respondent's expert has proposed to use the average of the quadratic mean and the harmonic mean750.\n\nCBRE Nayarit I, p. 54.\n\n712.\n\nQuadratic mean is often used when the sample has both positive and negative figures, which the arithmetic mean would cancel out - here, however, there are no negative figures. The harmonic mean is ordinarily used to calculate the average of ratios and, for positive data, the harmonic mean will always be the least of means - the Tribunal is seeking the average of integers, it thus sees no good reason to choose a mean which tends to minimise the average.\n\n713.\n\nSince the different data have already been adjusted for purposes and weighted for normalisation, the arithmetic mean seems the most appropriate average: it places equal value on each element without additional distortions. The arithmetic mean of the prices of the different comparables is USD 140.42/m2.\n\n714.\n\nThe above amount is set at December 2017; the valuation date of the Nayarit Property is, however, October 16, 2012751. The Mexican National Consumer Index was 112.11382 in December 2017 and 91.08599 in October 2012; USD 140.42/m2 brought back to October 2012 is USD 114.08/m2. Multiplied by 373,558 m2 it equals USD 42,615, 497.\n\nSee para. 632 *supra.*\n\n715.\n\nAt valuation date the Nayarit Property is estimated at USD 42,615, 497.\n\n716.\n\nAs anticipated752, the Tribunal must now deduct the costs related to the foreclosure sale: 4.6% on the sales price plus USD 25,000; i.e. USD 1,985,313753.\n\nSee paras. 640 and 641 *supra.*\n\n(USD 42,615, 497 \\* 4,6%) + USD 25,000.\n\n717.\n\nThe net market value of the Nayarit Property, at valuation date, is thus, **USD 40,630,184**.\n\n**2.** **T****he market value of the** **G****uadalajara** **P****roperties**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nThe Guadalajara property consists of two adjacent plots of land which cover a total area of 15,478 m2754The two plots are also known as Las Am\u00e9ricas A and Las Am\u00e9ricas B, with an area of 9,335 m2 and 6,143 m2, respectively755.\n\nCushman I, p. 28.\n\nCBRE Guadalajara I, p. 12.\n\n719.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas A and B, although adjacent, pertain to different zoning districts, which impacts on the possible use of the land. Las Am\u00e9ricas A is zoned for mixed use and Las Am\u00e9ricas B for residential use756.\n\nCBRE II, p. 21.\n\n720.\n\nHere is an aerial photograph of the Guadalajara Properties757:\n\nH5, p. 20.\n\n721.\n\nClaimant's expert estimated the fair market value of the Guadalajara Properties using a sales comparison approach (**1.**), as did Respondent's expert, but the latter also performed a residual value approach (**2.**). Although the experts performed their valuations under different premises, the results do not lie too far apart: there is a difference of opinion among the experts of USD 1.5M758. The Tribunal will determine which valuation is preferable (**3.**).\n\nClaimant proposes USD 29.6 M September 2012, opposed to Respondent's suggested MEX 365,725,000 in September 2012. According to Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 542, Mexico values the Guadalajara Properties at USD 27.87 M.\n\n**2.1** **C****laimant****'****s valuation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n722.\n\nMr. Marchitelli acknowledges that Las Am\u00e9ricas A and Las Am\u00e9ricas B each has a different assigned use. However, he strongly believes that, when two adjacent plots are held by the same owner and have different uses, the owner may choose the use that renders the most value out of the two and develop the entire property for that use759. In this case, Mr. Marchitelli determines that the highest and best use is for a mixed-use development760.\n\nHT, p. 794.\n\nCushman I, p. 29.\n\n723.\n\nThe expert found six sales for analysis and one additional sale.

But it is equally undebated that they are adjacent and belong to the same owner.\n\n738.\n\nIn essence, Mr. Marchitelli has valued the Guadalajara Properties as a single parcel according to a special assumption: that it is permitted to develop them jointly as a mixed-use property. The Tribunal, however, cannot accept the special assumption, which goes against the principle of valuing the property as it is, without proper evidence that would justify the assumption.\n\n739.\n\nIn the previous valuation of the Nayarit Property, Mr. Marchitelli brought evidence that the Old Road should be deemed an integral part of the Nayarit Property and the Tribunal, thus, validated that special assumption; but here, Mr. Marchitelli has failed to refer to any planning legislation which permits adjacent lands, which belong to the same owner, to be developed as one. Absent supporting evidence, the Tribunal cannot accept the proposed special assumption. Las Am\u00e9ricas A and Las Am\u00e9ricas B will, thus, be valued separately, each according to its own use.\n\n740.\n\nThe Tribunal will now estimate the value of Las Am\u00e9ricas A (**A.**) and Las Am\u00e9ricas B (**B.**) through a sales comparison approach, based on the comparables found by both experts. For reasons already anticipated795, the Tribunal, if satisfied with the resulting value, will not perform a secondary valuation through a residual use method.\n\nSee para. 683 *supra*.\n\n**A.** **Las Am\u00e9ricas A**\n-------------------------\n\n741.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas A is a mixed-use plot. The Tribunal will first analyse Claimant's comparables (**a.**) and then Respondent's (**b.**).\n\n**a. Claimant's comparables**\n-----------------------------\n\n742.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that almost all comparables identified by Mr. Marchitelli are mixed-use lands (Sales A - F); *prima facie* the Tribunal accepts this data as eligible comparables, subject to the appropriate adjustment *infra.*\n\n743.\n\nCBRE has only taken issue with Sale B because it, allegedly, contains erroneous information (the surface was 7,580 m2 and the sales price USD 12,282,076) - an allegation which has not been disputed. The corrected price per m2 is, thus, USD 1,620 (not USD 1,900 as proposed by Mr. Marchitelli796). This price needs to be adjusted for inflation and brought forward to July 2015, by a factor of 1.0689797; this results in an actual (corrected) price of USD 1,732/m2.\n\nCushman I, p. 34.\n\nCushman I, p. 34. July 2015 index is 99,52798 and that of June 2013 is 93,11464.\n\n744.\n\nMr. Marchitelli's sole additional adjustment is for size: smaller sites tend to sell for more unit price. Since the Guadalajara Properties will be valued separately, the Tribunal must determine whether the adjustments for size made by Mr. Marchitelli still apply, now that the subject property (Las Am\u00e9ricas A) is reduced from 15,478 m2 to only 9,335 m2. The Tribunal notes that Sale B is the only comparable similar in size to Las Am\u00e9ricas A (7,580 m2798, as opposed to 9,335 m2); Sales C, D and E have each an area of around 4,000 m2 and thus need a downward adjustment; whilst Sales A and F (14,000 m2 and 18,200 m2, respectively) require an upward adjustment. Absent specific evidence on the weight attributed by Mr. Marchitelli to the size adjustment, for consistency reasons799 the Tribunal decides to apply a 0.1 factor upward or downward. The sales adjusted sales prices per m2 are as follows:\"\n\n\"- Sale D: the price is brought down from USD 1,915/m2 to USD 1,723/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale C: the price is reduced from USD 2,027/m2 to USD 1,824/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale F: the price needs to be raised from USD 2,100/m2 to USD 2,310/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale A: the price will be augmented from USD 2,129/m2 to USD 2,342/m2;\"\n\n- Sale E: the price is minored from USD 2,239/m2 to USD 2,015/m2.\n\nAs corrected by the Tribunal; see para. 743 *supra.*\n\nSee para. 701 *supra*.\n\n**b. Respondent's comparables**\n-------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nCBRE has identified five sales comparables for mixed use and three listings800. The Tribunal will adjust the sales price to account for inflation (**i.**) and then it will convert all amounts into USD (**ii.**).\n\nCBRE Guadalajara I, p. 51.\n\n746.\n\n(i) As already seen in the valuation of the Nayarit Property, an adjustment of the comparable prices for inflation becomes necessary. All values will be adjusted in time to July 2015 - the date used by Mr. Marchitelli in his valuation - using the Mexican National Consumer Price Index801:\n\n\"- Comparable 1 dates from July 2016; in July 2016 the consumer price index was 102.17028, whilst in July 2015 it was 99.53, thus a factor of 0.974802 needs to be applied - the sale price of MEX 15,341/m2 is brought down to MEX 14,944/m2.\"\n\n\"- Comparable 2 is from 2015; no month has been specified - absent this information, the Tribunal assumes that the sale took place in the mid-year and the sale price of MEX 46,442.7/m2 need not be adjusted.\"\n\n\"- Comparable 3 is from 2014; lacking evidence on the month in which the transaction happened, the Tribunal will assume it happened in the mid-year - in July 2014 the consumer price index was 96.87454, whilst in July 2015 it was 99.53, thus a factor of 1.027803 needs to be applied - the sale price of MEX 34,786.64/m2 is raised to MEX 35,739/m2.\"\n\n\"- Comparable 4 is from July 2013; in July 2013 the consumer price index was 93.08379, whilst in July 2015 it was 99.53, thus a factor of 1.069804 needs to be applied - the sale price of MEX 38,454.55/m2 is increased to MEX 41,117/m2.\"\n\n- Comparable 5 is exactly from July 2015: the price of MEX 39,762.52/m2 does not need to be adjusted.\n\nCushman I, Exhibit 6. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEXCPIALLMINMEI\n\n99.53/102.17028 = 0.974\n\n99.53/96.87454 = 1.027\n\n99.53/93.08379 = 1.069\n\n747.\n\n(ii) Now that CBRE's comparables are adjusted for inflation, they need to be converted into USD and so do the three offerings. Mr. Marchitelli estimates the Guadalajara Properties to be worth USD 2,100/m2805 or MEX 32,000/m2806 in July 2015 - the exchange rate applied is 15.24 MEX/USD. The above sales prices converted into USD are as follows:\n\n\"- Comparable 1: MEX 14,944/m2 is USD 981/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 2: MEX 46,442.7/m2 is USD 3,048/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 3: MEX 35,739/m2 is USD 2,345/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 4: MEX 41,117/m2 is USD 2,698/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 5: MEX 39,762.52/m2 is USD 2,609/m2;\"\n\n\"- Offering 1: MEX 48,616/m2 is USD 3,190/m2;\"\n\n\"- Offering 2: MEX 32,938/m2 is USD 2,162/m2;\"\n\n- Offering 3: MEX 36,536/m2 is USD 2,398/m2.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\nCushman I, p. 35\n\nCushman I, p. 37.\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal has now six sales from Mr. Marchitelli and the five comparables and three offerings from CBRE, with the following prices:\n\n\"- Comparable 1: USD 981/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale D: USD 1,723/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale B: USD 1,732/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale C: USD 1,824/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale E: USD 2,015/m2;\"\n\n\"- Offering 2 is USD 2,162/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale F: USD 2,310/m2;\"\n\n\"- Sale A: USD 2,342/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 3 is USD 2,345/m2;\"\n\n\"- Offering 3 is USD 2,398/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 5 is USD 2,609/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 4 is USD 2,698/m2;\"\n\n\"- Comparable 2 is USD 3,048/m2;\"\n\n- Offering 1 is USD 3,190/m2.\n\n749.\n\nFor reasons explained above, the Tribunal applies the arithmetic mean of the above prices: USD 2,241.29/m2.\n\n750.\n\nThis amount is set at July 2015, whereas the valuation date of the Guadalajara Properties is September 7, 2012807. The Mexican National Consumer Index was 99.52798 in July 2015 and 90.62747 in September 2012. The average price is, thus, USD 2,040.86/m2808 in September 2012. Multiplied by 9,335m2, it equals a total value of USD 19,051,406809.\n\nSee para. 632 *supra.*\n\nUSD 2,241.29/m2 \\* 90.62747/99.52798 = USD 2,040.86/m2\n\nUSD 2,040.86/m2 \\* 9,335m2 = 19,051,406\n\n**B.** **Las Am\u00e9ricas B**\n-------------------------\n\n751.\n\nFor las Am\u00e9ricas B, with residential use, CBRE found six listings: three for residential use and another three for mixed use. Apparently, CBRE incorporated the mixed use listings because the plots were planned to be developed as residential home *(construcci\u00f3n habitacional*)810. In view of a criticism made by CBRE, the Tribunal has accepted that each of the Guadalajara Properties be valued separately, on account of the different ground uses, and the Tribunal has disregarded the mixed used properties identified by Mr. Marchitelli as comparables for Las Am\u00e9ricas B; consequently, the three mixed use listings relied upon by CBRE to value Las Am\u00e9ricas B should equally be disregarded.\n\nCBRE Guadalajara I, p. 53.\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal will estimate Las Am\u00e9ricas B's values based on the other three listings with residential use found by CBRE and one additional sale for residential use identified by Mr. Marchitelli (Sale G). Mr. Marchitelli has questioned the relevance of the comparables, since they do not represent closed sales - the Tribunal accepts the critique and notes that CBRE has applied a 0.95 reducing factor to account for this fact811. In turn, CBRE suggests that Sale G be stricken because the sale took place in 2009 and thus would lack relevance - the Tribunal notes that Sale G is the only closed transaction and for this reason the Tribunal has decided not to disregard it.\n\nCBRE Guadalajara I, p. 54.\n\n753.\n\nAdjusted to July 2015, Sale G has a price of USD 2,168/m2812; since the rest of the comparables are listings, they need not be adjusted for inflation813, and just have to be converted into USD at the 15.24 MEX/USD exchange rate814:\"\n\n\"- Listing 1: MEX 21,884/m2 is USD 1,436/m2;\"\n\n\"- Listing 5: MEX 29,215/m2 is USD 1,917/m2;\"\n\n- Listing 6: MEX 18,104/m2 is USD 1,188/m2.\n\nCushman I, p. 34.\n\nSince the listings are offerings made for an unspecified period of time, Mr. Marchitteli and CBRE do not adjust these values for inflation.\n\nSee para. 747 *supra.*\n\n754.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the above data is USD 1,677/m2.\n\n755.\n\nThis amount is set at July 2015. Adjusted to the valuation date, the sale price is reduced to USD 1,527.4/m2. Multiplied by 6,143 m2, it equals a total value of USD 9,382,669.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n756.\n\nAt the valuation date, September 7, 2012, Las Americas A is worth USD 19,051,406 and Las Americas B is valued at USD 9,382,669; in total, the estimated value of the Guadalajara Properties is USD 28,434,075.\n\n757.\n\nThe Tribunal needs now to deduct the foreclosure sales costs which are815: 0.7% of the sales price, MEX 100,700.69 plus 3% on the balance price minus MEX 3,736,575, and UD 25,000 in legal fees.\n\nPayne II, Appendix B.\n\n758.\n\nThe sales price has to be converted into MEX. Up to this point, as the the exchange rates were undisputed, the Tribunal has relied on the exchange rates used by Mr. Marchitelli; however, September 2012 was not a relevant date in Mr. Marchitelli's expert reports and he does not provide this information. In the absence of this input from the expert, the Tribunal has applied the exchange rate of September 7, 2012 published in Mexico's official gazette816: 13.0483. The sales price is, thus, MEX 371,016,615.\n\nhttps://www.dof.gob.mx/indicadores\\_detalle.php?cod\\_tipo\\_indicador=158&dfecha=06%2F09%2F2012&hfecha= 11%2F09%2F2012\n\n759.\n\nCosts in the amount of MEX 2,597,116817 and MEX 14,964,753818 accrue for Public Registry and Notary fees on the one hand, and for transfer taxes on the other; this results in a total amount of MEX 17,561,869, which converted back to USD is USD 1,345,912819. Now USD 25,000 needs to be added for legal fees, i.e. USD 1,370,912.\n\n(0.5% + 0.2%) \\* MEX 371,016,615.\n\nMEX 100,700.69 + 3% balance price (MEX 370,915,914) - MEX 3,736,575.\n\nMEX 17,561,869/13.0483 = USD 1,345,912\n\n760.\n\nThe sales price minus associated costs is, thus, **USD 27,063,184**.\n\n**3.** **C****alculation of the impairment**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n761.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined the market value of the Nayarit Property on October 16, 2012, to be USD 40,630,184; and that of the Guadalajara Properties on September 7, 2012 to be USD 27,063,184.\n\n762.\n\nLion avers that the impairment of its investment, as a consequence of the breach, equates with the market value of the Properties: upon the Debtor's default and the filing of the Foreclosure Proceedings, Lion would have acquired ownership of the Properties *in lieu* of payment, and would promptly have re-sold the Properties to third parties through arms' length transactions, thereby securing the full market value of the Properties (*i.e.* approximately USD 67 M for all Properties, as established by the Tribunal with the experts' methodologies)820.\n\nCPHB, para. 248; Zamora II, paras. 201 and 204.\n\n763.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Lion's assumption far too optimistic.\n\n764.\n\nLion in essence assumes that in the But For Scenario, it would have succeeded in re-selling the Properties at full market value. This assumption disregards the substantial uncertainties and legal risks which Lion would have faced in its efforts to foreclose on the Mortgages and to re-sell the Properties, uncertainties and risks which are unrelated to Mexico's breaches of its NAFTA obligations.\n\n765.\n\nThese risks arise from the very terms of the Loans (speculatively high interest rates of 18% and 25% when the Loans were in default, and short maturities), and the personal characteristics of the Debtors selected by Claimant. These risks have been exacerbated by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas' obstinate (and as the facts show highly effective) defense of his legal rights, above and beyond the proper conduct required by Mexican law. The Tribunal considers that a hostile reaction by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas to the resale of valuable properties that he had owned and for many years had sought to develop is not a mere possibility but close to a certainty. His willingness to engage in administrative and legal frauds and abuses to obtain his ends has been amply demonstrated in these proceedings as, unfortunately, has his effectiveness with these abuses within his home state of Jalisco.\n\n766.\n\nAny possible re-sale of the Properties to a willing buyer would have faced the risks of obstructions and possible legal challenges by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and the Debtors, in proceedings before the Courts of his home State, Jalisco. Most buyers would have shied away from assuming these risks; the few prepared to accept the uncertainty would only do so if offered a significant discount over market prices.\n\n767.\n\nThe necessity to offer discounts to prospective buyers has an important consequence: awarding Claimant the full market price of the Properties, would not result in re-establishing the situation which would have existed, absent Mexico's breach, but in a windfall profit. The proper compensation must be reduced by the probable discount a willing buyer would have applied.\n\n768.\n\nHow to calculate the correct percentage of discount?\n\n769.\n\nNo formula exists, and there is no set of precedents, from which a precise number could be induced. In situations like this, where the precise determination of damage is subject to uncertainty, tribunals are authorized to apply a degree of discretion. As the Annulment Committee in *Rumeli* said821:\n\n\"The estimation of damages [...] is not an exact science. It is of the essence of such an exercise that the tribunal has a measure of discretion, since the final figure must of its nature be an approximation of the claimant's loss\".\n\n*Rumeli,* Decision on Annulment, para. 179(5).\n\n770.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that a discount of approximately 30% over the preliminary market value appropriately reflects the risks faced by prospective buyers: it is safe to assume that, upon foreclosure of the Mortgages, and delivery of ownership of the Properties to Lion, willing buyers would only have been prepared to pay to Lion approximately USD 47 M822 (and not the full market value of USD 67 M) for the purchase of the Nayarit and the Guadalajara Properties.\n\n(1-30%)\\*(USD 40,630,184 + USD 27,063,184), rounded down to the nearest million\n\n771.\n\nThe Tribunal's figure of USD 47 M is reinforced by the valuation provided by Respondent's expert, who used conservative parameters to establish the market price of the Properties, and, applying a completely different methodology, arrived at a similar figure823.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nRR, para. 635.\n\n772.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal finds that in the But For Scenario the value of the Claimant's investment would have amounted to USD 47 M.\n\n773.\n\nAs regards the As Is Scenario, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the present value of the investment is nil - upon cancellation in the Property Registry the Mortgages have become extinguished and consequently worthless.\n\n774.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal determines that the compensation due to Lion, for the impairment suffered by its protected investment - the Nayarit and Guadalajara Mortgages - amounts to the difference in the values of the Mortgages in the But For and the As Is valuation, i.e. **USD 47,000,000** - and this is the sum awarded in Claimant's favour under this heading.\n\n**4.** **R****espondent****'****s ancillary objections**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n775.\n\nMexico submits two additional arguments to sustain that any compensation awarded to Lion should be reduced:\n\n**4.1** **S****hares in** **D****ebtor companies**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n776.\n\nMexico argues that, if Lion is awarded damages in this arbitration, the Tribunal should reduce the compensation in an amount equal to the value of the shares Lion owns in the Debtor companies824.\n\nRPHB, para. 11; RCM, para. 299.\n\n777.\n\nTo this date, under Mexican law, the forgery of the Settlement Agreement has not been established and it remains legally effective. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, share certificates were issued in Lion's name. Thus, Lion is the owner of these shares, and therefore, their value must be subtracted from any compensation awarded by this Tribunal825.\n\nRR, paras. 579 and 580.\n\n778.\n\nIn the course of criminal proceeding 137/2004, Sr. C\u00e1rdenas presented various expert reports calculating the book value of Lion's shares in order to sustain his allegation that Lion had not suffered damages as a consequence of his criminal behaviour. Respondent points out that, according to these reports, Lion's shares in the Debtor companies have a book value as of December 2012 of USD 81,8 M826.\n\nRCM, para. 301, citing Exh. R-15 and Exh. R-16; RR, para. 583.\n\n779.\n\nRespondent does not share Claimant's position that Lion could assign its rights over the shares to Mexico, in order to avoid double recovery. Mexico has not accepted Claimant's offer and this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to order that Lion's shares be transferred to Mexico; and even if it did, there is no assurance that this transaction could legally take place under Mexican law827.\n\nRPHB, para. 197.\n\n**B.** **Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n780.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's proposition: Lion never acquired shares in the Debtor companies because no legal effects arose from the Forged Settlement Agreement828. The fact that the Debtors never recorded the increase of capital at the Commercial Registry, reveals that the whole operation was a sham829.\n\nCR, para. 12 and 194\n\nCR, para. 196\n\n781.\n\nIn any case, the valuation of the shares proposed by Respondent has not been established in a reliable manner. Claimant had no opportunity to rebut the reports presented by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas in the criminal proceedings, which were suspended by the Federal Attorney-General830.\n\nCR, para.197, citing Exh. C-173.\n\n782.\n\nClaimant says that, in order to avoid double recovery, it has offered to tender any rights it may have over these shares to Mexico, upon receiving the compensation due in this arbitration831.\n\nCR, para. 199.\n\n**C.** **The Tribunal's decision**\n----------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nRespondent argues that any compensation due to Lion must be reduced in an amount equal to the value of the shares it owns in the Debtor companies. Claimant rejects this proposition, alleging that it never acquired ownership of any such shares.\n\n784.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that the Settlement Agreement, in which Lion allegedly agreed to settle the debts owed by the Debtor companies and to cancel the Mortgages, in exchange for shares in these companies, was a forgery832. *Quod nullum est, nullum effectum producit.* Furthermore, the increases of share capital in favour of Lion were never recorded in the Commercial Registry, with the consequence that the shares were never formally created833 .\n\nSee paras. 103 *et seq supra.*\n\nCR, para 196, with reference to Exh. C-170 and C-171, certificates of records of C6C Capital and Inmobiliaria Bains at the Commercial Registry; these certificates show that other capital increases were duly registered.\n\n785.\n\nFinally, Respondent has not marshalled any convincing evidence proving the value of the shares in the Debtor companies allegedly owned by Lion. The valuation provided by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas himself, as defendant in a criminal case, is not persuasive.\n\n786.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that Mexico has failed to prove that Lion is the rightful owner of any participation in the capital of the Debtor companies. And even if Lion were to have validly acquired such shareholdings *(quod non),* the Respondent has not marshalled convincing evidence establishing their proper value.\n\n**4.2** **C****riminal proceedings**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **The Parties' positions**\n---------------------------------\n\n787.\n\nRespondent says that Lion has a chance to obtain double recovery, because it can potentially claim reparation if Sr. C\u00e1rdenas is found criminally liable for fraud in any of the pending criminal proceedings834.\n\nRCM, para. 576; Plascencia, para. 84; RPHB, paras. 117 and 202.\n\n788.\n\nClaimant says that any hypothetical compensation that it may be awarded under the criminal proceedings cannot prevent it from obtaining the full compensation that is due under international law for Mexico's breaches. In any case, Claimant argues, the issue of double recovery in this case would be something to decide in the future by the Mexican courts when awarding any compensation to Lion835.\n\nCPHB, para. 47.\n\n**B.** **The Tribunal's decision**\n----------------------------------\n\n**a. Facts**\n------------\n\n789.\n\nOn April 18, 2013 Claimant submitted its first criminal action, 463/2013, before the criminal Court of Jalisco. The action was against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and was based on the Forged Settlement Agreement and the request for certified copies of the Cancellation Proceeding, through the impersonation of Mr. Arechederra. The criminal Court of Jalisco dismissed the case for lack of sufficient evidence836.\n\nExh. R-20.\n\n790.\n\nOn April 19, 2013 Lion filed a parallel action, this time before the criminal Courts of Mexico City (137/2014). The Mexico City Court dismissed the action on the ground that the facts were already being tried in Jalisco837.\n\nExh. R-22.\n\n791.\n\nLion made a third attempt, on June 19, 2015, filing another action before the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Jalisco, which resulted in criminal proceedings 181/2016. The case was dismissed on the basis that the statute of limitations had expired838.\n\nRCM, para. 126.\n\n792.\n\nRespondent's expert, Dr. Plascencia, declared with respect to the abovementioned proceedings that839:\n\n*\"Del an\u00e1lisis de los expedientes queda claro que Lion Mexico Consolidated, ejerci\u00f3 las acciones, derecho y recursos correspondientes para tratar de demostrar los hechos aparentemente delictivos que le atribu\u00eda a H\u00e9ctor C\u00e1rdenas, sin embargo, de las resoluciones dictadas por tres diferentes jueces penales en tres procedimientos distintos se desprende que no fue posible acreditar de los hechos denunciados la comisi\u00f3n de delito alguno\".*\n\nPlascencia, para. 87.\n\n793.\n\nLion was unable to obtain a criminal conviction of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, and consequently, no reparation was granted.\n\n794.\n\nDespite the above, Lion has persisted in its attempt to secure a criminal conviction against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas and has filed three additional criminal complaints that are currently pending. At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal requested the Parties to inform the Tribunal on the status of these pending criminal proceedings:\n\n\"- Criminal Action No. 4713/2016: in these proceedings Lion seeks a criminal conviction of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas with respect to the forgery of the Settlement Agreement and the impersonation of Mr. Arechederra; the proceedings remain suspended, pending two *Amparos* initiated by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas840;\"\n\n\"- Criminal Action No. 121667/2017: these proceedings concern the forgery and fraud in relation to the filing of the False Amparo; the last information available is that the investigation phase is ongoing, and that no formal charges *(imputaci\u00f3n)* have been issued against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas841;\"\n\n- Criminal Action No. 83426/2017: these proceedings concerning the sale by Sr. C\u00e1rdenas of the Nayarit Property, that was subject to a freeze order, is in the investigation phase and no formal charges *(imputaci\u00f3n)* have been issued against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas842.\n\nCPHB, para. 40.\n\nCPHB, para. 41.\n\nCPHB, para. 42.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n795.\n\nRespondent's main argument is that Lion may obtain double recovery, since it still has the potential right to be compensated if Sr. C\u00e1rdenas is found guilty under any of the criminal proceedings that are currently pending. Respondent says that the potential compensation of Lion in these criminal proceedings is guaranteed by the \"land freezes\" imposed by the Prosecutor on the Nayarit and Guadalajara Properties843.\n\nPlascencia, para. 106.\n\n796.\n\nTo this date, however, no criminal conviction has been issued against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas, and no compensation has been awarded to Lion by any criminal Court. Respondent's expert acknowledges that in the current proceedings a criminal conviction of Sr. C\u00e1rdenas is unlikely844. The criminal Courts have already dismissed Lion's allegations for lack of evidence, and the statute of limitations and the principle *non bis in idem* make it now highly unlikely that a criminal conviction against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas be rendered.\n\nPlascencia, para. 97.\n\n797.\n\nSince the Mexican criminal Courts have until now failed to render any decision awarding compensation in favour of Lion, Respondent's request that the compensation granted in this arbitration be reduced is moot.\n\n798.\n\nIf in the future any Mexican criminal Court is to issue a decision in favour of Lion, and by that time Lion has collected any of the amounts awarded in its favour in the present arbitration, it is for the Mexican Court to adopt the appropriate measures to avoid double recovery.\n\n**VII.2.** **LEGAL FEES ARISING FROM THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n799.\n\nArt. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA requires that, as a condition precedent to the submission of a claim to arbitration, investors withdraw from any parallel local judicial proceedings, except for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary proceedings not involving the payment of damages:\n\n\"Article 1121: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if:\n\n[...]\n\n(b) the investor [...] waive[s] [its] right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n800.\n\nLion argues that it should be compensated by Mexico for *gastos, costas y perjuicios* [\"**Legal Fees**\"] it may be ordered to pay to the Debtors as a result of its withdrawal from the Foreclosure Proceeding845. Lion avers that it was required to abandon all local proceedings to comply with the waiver requirement of NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b), which lists withdrawal from local proceedings as one of the conditions precedent to submitting a NAFTA arbitration claim846, and thus, such costs are ultimately a consequence of Mexico's breach.\n\nCPHB, para. 312.\n\nCPHB, para. 312,\n\n801.\n\nAs to the quantification of these Legal Fees, at the time of the Parties' latest submissions, a decision on the exact amount to be paid by Lion was pending before the *Juez de lo Civil*847, but according to an estimate by Lion, they could reach an amount of up to USD 14 M848.\n\nCPHB, para. 315.\n\nCPHB, para. 315, Annex II to CPHB, para. 18.\n\n802.\n\nMexico in turn claims that Lion was not required to withdraw from the Foreclosure Proceeding849. In fact, the decision to withdraw was \"ill-advised\", as the NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) withdrawal requirement did not apply to the Foreclosure Proceeding850.\n\nRPHB, para. 106.\n\nRPHB, paras. 125, 127.\n\n803.\n\nThe Tribunal must, thus, analyse whether under NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) Lion was required to withdraw from the Foreclosure Proceeding and whether Legal Fees ordered by the local Courts as a consequence of such withdrawal, constitute part of the compensation due.\n\n804.\n\nTo adjudicate this question, the Tribunal will first establish the proper interpretation of Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA (**1****.**), then it will analyse whether Lion was obliged to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding (**2.**) and finally it will discuss whether Mexico has to assume the Legal Fees which Claimant may eventually be forced to pay to the Debtors (**3.**)\n\n**1.** **T****he proper interpretation of** **A****rt****. 1121(1)(****b****)** **NAFTA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n805.\n\nArt. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA requires that a protected investor, before accessing international justice, must discontinue any existing parallel proceedings before the municipal Courts, relating to the same dispute. The rationale of the rule is twofold: to avoid contradicting decisions between the local Courts and international arbitration, and to prevent double recovery.\n\n806.\n\nThe Non-Disputing Parties hold the same opinion:\n\nUS851: \"The purpose of the waiver provision is to avoid the need for a respondent Party to litigate concurrent and overlapping proceedings in multiple forums, and to minimize not only the risk of double recovery, but also the risk of 'conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty)'\".\n\nCanada852: \"The purpose of this provision is to preclude parallel litigation involving the payment of damages in order to avoid conflicting outcomes and double redress with respect to the same measure\".\n\nUSA submission, para. 25.\n\nCanada Submission, para. 9.\n\n807.\n\n*Thunderbird* offers a similar, teleological clarification on how to approach Art. 1121 of the NAFTA853:\n\n\"In construing Article 1121 of NAFTA, one must also take into account the rationale and purpose of that article. The consent and waiver requirements set forth in Article 1121 serve a specific purpose, namely to prevent a party from pursuing concurrent domestic and international remedies, which could either give rise to conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty) or lead to double redress for the same conduct or measure\". [Emphasis added]\n\nInternational Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Arbitral Award, 26 January 2006, para. 118.\n\n808.\n\nIn sum, under Art. 1121 NAFTA a prospective claimant is required to withdraw from any municipal procedure, if such procedure:\n\n- could give rise to an outcome which conflicts with the result of the investment arbitration, or\n\n- can result in claimant being compensated twice for the same loss or damage.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\n809.\n\nNAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) contains exceptions to the general rule of withdrawal; there are certain types of proceedings where the Treaty does not require a waiver as a condition precedent to the investor filing an investment arbitration.\n\n810.\n\nThe NAFTA has been executed in English, French and Spanish, all three versions being equally authentic854. As regards the exceptions to the waiver requirement, there are marked differences between the English and French texts, and the Spanish text of Art. 1121(1)(b).\n\nArt. 33 of the VCLT acquiesced by Respondent at RR, para. 353.\n\n811.\n\nIn English, the exceptions to the general rule appear to concern three categories of proceedings:\n\n\"[...] except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party\".\n\n812.\n\nThis is also the case in French:\n\n*\"\u00e0 l'exception d'une* *procedure d'injonction, d'une proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9claratoire ou d'un autre recours extraordinaire, ne supposant pas le paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats,* *entrepris devant une juridiction administrative ou judiciaire\"*.\n\n813.\n\nWhile the Spanish version refers to one category (\"*medidas precautorias*\"*,* i.e. injunctive measures) of threefold character:\n\n*\"salvo los procedimientos en que se solicite la aplicaci\u00f3n de* *medidas precautorias de car\u00e1cter suspensivo, declaratorio o extraordinario, que no impliquen el pago de da\u00f1os a**nte el tribunal administrativo o judicial\".* [Emphasis added]\n\n814.\n\nDoes a *Juicio Hipotecario* like the Foreclosure Proceeding fall within any of these exceptions?\n\n815.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the answer is in the negative, whatever the version of the NAFTA Treaty is preferred (all being equally authentic).\n\n816.\n\nThe *Juicio Hipotecario* is an ordinary procedure, with the purpose of enforcing a mortgage through the judicial sale of the property and the delivery of the price obtained to the claimant, up to the amount and in payment of the secured debt. Consequently, a *Juicio Hipotecario* is not a *\"medida precautoria\"*, as required in the Spanish version of the rule.\n\n817.\n\nIf we turn to the English or French versions, the requirements for an exception are also not met. In a *Juicio Hipotecario* the relief requested by claimant consists in the judicial enforcement of the Mortgage, and the allocation of the price obtained to the payment of the debt. The relief does not meet the requirement for the exception to apply (\"injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief\"); the NAFTA rule additionally requires that the relief does not \"involv[e] the payment of damages\" - a requirement which the *Juicio Hipotecario* again does not meet, since foreclosure of a mortgage involves the payment of a sum of money for the settlement of a debt.\n\n818.\n\nIn sum, the Foreclosure Proceeding is a *Juicio Hipotecario,* and as such is not included in any of the exceptions to the general rule that parallel proceedings must be withdrawn as a condition precedent for the filing of an investment arbitration.\n\n**2.** **L****ion was obliged to withdraw the** **F****oreclosure** **P****roceeding**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n819.\n\nThe general rule under Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA is that before bringing a NAFTA claim, a claimant must withdraw any local proceedings \"with respect\" to the measure adopted by the host State that allegedly constitutes an international wrong.\n\n820.\n\nAccording to Lion, the wording \"with respect to\" should be interpreted broadly855. Claimant argues that the Foreclosure Proceeding was intended to recover the value of the Mortgage, i.e., the investment - the same value as the compensation it seeks to recover in the current arbitration.\n\nCR, para. 537, citing Detroit International Bridge Company v. Government of Canada, PCA Case No. 2012-25, Submission of the United States of America, para. 6 (14 February 2014), Exhibit CLA-660.\n\n821.\n\nRespondent counters that the facts show that the Foreclosure Proceeding is not \"with respect to\" any of the measures giving rise to Lion's claims856. Mexico's argumentation is summarized in its reiteration that \"none of the measures at issue in this case have anything to do with the Foreclosure Proceedings\"857.\n\nRR, para. 349.\n\nRPHB, para. 125, RR, para. 358.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n822.\n\nDoes the Foreclosure Proceeding meet the test of being \"with respect to\" the international wrong committed by Mexico, and was Lion consequently obliged to withdraw before commencing this investment arbitration?\n\n823.\n\n*Pro memoria:* in April 2012 Lion filed the Foreclosure Proceeding, a *Juicio Hipotecario,* before a *Juez de lo Civil* in Mexico D.F., seeking to enforce the Nayarit Mortgage (but not the Guadalajara Mortgage). The purpose of the Procedure was to realize the value of such security, by forcing its judicial sale and using the proceeds to settle Lion's secured and unpaid obligations. The Foreclosure Proceeding never matured: Lion encountered numerous difficulties in the *emplazamiento* of the Debtors, and the *Juicio Hipotecario* stalled for more than three years. Eventually, before commencing this NAFTA arbitration, Claimant withdrew the Foreclosure Proceeding.\n\n824.\n\nThe international wrong committed by Mexico has been established in this Award:\n\n\"- Lion was denied access to justice and was wrongfully prevented from participating in the Cancellation Proceeding, which eventually led to the cancellation of the Mortgages;\"\n\n\"- Lion was also wrongfully denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement; and finally\"\n\n- Lion was wrongfully denied the right to allege and prove the forgery of the Forged Settlement Agreement, all in breach of Art. 1105 of the NAFTA.\n\n825.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that one situation where Art. 1121 NAFTA requires a prospective claimant to withdraw a municipal procedure, is where such procedure can result in multiple compensation for the same loss or damage.\n\n826.\n\nLion found itself precisely in that situation.\n\n827.\n\nIn this arbitration Lion is asking to be compensated for its total loss resulting from the cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage, and such loss is equal to the value of such Mortgage.\n\n828.\n\nThe continuation of the Foreclosure Proceeding would indeed have created a risk of double recovery: if foreclosure of the Nayarit Mortgage had resulted in the recovery of any amount of money, the total compensation received by Claimant would have exceeded its total loss (equal to the value of the Mortgage and already compensated in these proceedings).\n\n829.\n\nIt is precisely to minimize this risk that Art. 1121 NAFTA requires that local proceedings be discontinued, as a condition precedent to the filing of a NAFTA arbitration.\n\n830.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that Lion, to comply with the requirement of Art. 1121(1)(b) and secure the admissibility of this arbitration, was obliged to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding.\n\n831.\n\nAll that Lion did was to comply with this obligation.\n\n**3.** **D****iscussion of the** **L****egal** **F****ees**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nAn unintended consequence of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding was the decision of the *Juez de lo Civil* ordering Lion to pay the Legal Fees *(\"gastos, costas y perjuicios*\") suffered by the Debtor858. Despite Lion's appeal in *Amparo,* Mexico's Supreme Court ultimately upheld the original decision859: the municipal rule which requires that in foreclosure proceedings a withdrawing party assumes the Legal Fees incurred by the counterparty does not contravene the NAFTA860.\n\nResolution of Civil Judge ordering the payment of costs and expenses by Lion, January 7, 2016, Exhibit C-191.\n\nAnnex II to CPHB, p. 3.\n\nSupreme Court's decision (Amparo revision) confirming the order for Lion to pay the costs, January 31, 2018, Exhibit C-192.\n\n833.\n\nAt the time of the Parties' latest submissions, a decision on the exact amount to be paid by Lion was pending before the *Juez de lo Civil861.* Lion says that the Debtor is claiming more than USD 14M, avers that it has asserted meritorious defences to such claim, but adds that there is a risk that the Mexican courts will mechanically apply Legal Fees in the amount of 6% of the amount in controversy862.\n\nCPHB, para. 315.\n\nCPHB, para. 315, Annex II to CPHB, para. 18.\n\n834.\n\nThe question which the Tribunal must decide is whether these Legal Fees (in whichever amount eventually established) have to be borne by Claimant or by Mexico.\n\n835.\n\nLion says that \"but for Mexico's breaches\", it would not have been required to waive the Foreclosure Proceeding and would not have incurred these liabilities.\n\n836.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that the damages awarded must be sufficient (in the words of *Chorz\u00f3w*) to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed\"863.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* p. 47.\n\n837.\n\nTo do so, it is necessary to assume that Mexico had not committed any wrongful conduct. In such case, the Nayarit Mortgage would not have been cancelled, the Foreclosure Proceeding would eventually have been successful, the Nayarit Property would have been foreclosed, and the price obtained would have been used to pay the secured debts. In this scenario Lion would not have incurred any Legal Fees payable to the Debtor.\n\n838.\n\nIn reality what has happened is that the Mexican Court system has incurred in a denial of justice, which has resulted in the wrongful cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage, and has forced Lion to seek redress through international arbitration. This award has already acknowledged that Lion is entitled to a compensation for the impairment of its investment. But this compensation does not wipe out all the consequences of Mexico's wrongful act. As a requirement for the admissibility of this arbitration, Lion has been forced to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding, and to incur certain, still to be quantified, Legal Fees. Full reparation requires that Mexico assume the obligation of reimbursing Lion for such Legal Fees, in the amount finally established by the Mexican Courts and actually paid by Lion to the Debtor.\n\n839.\n\nLion, in turn, has a duty to mitigate its losses, and consequently must continue defending the claim for Legal Fees filed by the Debtor, with the same diligence as it would be defending its own interest, exhausting non-obviously futile local remedies. (There is no suggestion by Mexico that Lion up to now has breached its duty to mitigate).\n\n**VII.3.****EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n840.\n\nLion claims that, apart from the costs incurred in the arbitration864, it is also entitled to recover its legal fees and expenses incurred in the Mexican proceedings, which amount to USD 2,212,004.53865.\n\nSee Section IX *infra.*\n\nCPHB, para. 317, CR, para. 611, Exh. C-193. of Clarion Partners indicating the attorney's fees incurred by LMC, 20 February 2019, Exhibit C-193.\n\n841.\n\nMexico disputes the number proposed by Lion. According to Mexico, Lion initially averred that its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in local proceedings amounted to USD 1,262,650, to suddenly increase that number to USD 2,212,004.53 without justification866.\n\nRPHB, para. 135, RR, para. 612-616.\n\n842.\n\nMexico additionally argues that the sole evidence supporting Lion's claim, an affidavit by Ms. Rodriguez, the Senior Vice President/Controller of Lion's parent company, providing that\n\n\"[t]o the best of [her] knowledge, the true and accurate amount of fees incurred by L[ion] for these matters to date is US 2,2,12,004.53\"867,\n\nis insufficient. Mexico points out that the affidavit is not accompanied by any explanation or supporting documentation, which confirms the accuracy of the proposed number. Additionally, Ms. Rodriguez was not a witness in the arbitration and since she was not cross-examined at the Hearing, Mexico would be severely prejudiced if the Tribunal took her statement to be accurate.\n\nExh. C-193.\n\n843.\n\nThus, Mexico requests that the Tribunal dismiss the claim for damages for the legal fees and expenses incurred by Lion in the local proceedings868.\n\nRR, para. 616.\n\nDecision of the Tribunal\n------------------------\n\n844.\n\nLion asks that Mexico reimbursed it an amount of USD 2,212,004.53, representing legal fees incurred in the Mexican proceedings.\n\n845.\n\nClaimant has provided a detailed statement summarizing the expenses and fees incurred in this arbitration (this claim will be analysed in Section IX *infra*)869*.* However, for the costs incurred in the Mexican proceedings, Claimant has not provided a breakdown of the costs incurred, nor has it marshalled any invoices or receipts. The only evidence marshalled is a two-paragraph affidavit, executed by Ms. Karen Rodriguez, the Senior Vice President/Controller of Lion's parent company, stating that\n\n\"to the best of my knowledge and belief, the true and accurate amount of fees incurred by [Lion] for these matters [the Amparo Proceeding and the defense against Sr. C\u00e1rdenas' claim for Legal Fees] is US$2,212,004.53\"870.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019.\n\nExh. C-193.\n\n846.\n\nMs. Rodriguez has not provided any further evidence or details. No invoices are attached. The evidence was not submitted by means of a witness statement confirming her calculations, nor has Ms. Rodriguez appeared before this Tribunal to aver her declaration.\n\n847.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the evidence submitted by Claimant is sufficient to support a claim for legal fees of more than USD 2 M, allegedly incurred before the Mexican Courts, in the course of defending its rights in the *Amparo* and in the Foreclosure Proceeding.\n\n848.\n\nIn any case, even assuming *arguendo* that Lion would have satisfied its burden of proving the legal fees incurred in the local proceedings, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mexico should bear these costs. The Tribunal has already established that a claim for denial of justice requires the aggrieved party to exhaust local remedies871. If the exhaustion of local remedies had resulted in the Mexican judiciary correcting the wrongful cancellation of the Mortgages, the denial of justice would have been prevented - but Claimant would still have incurred local legal fees. Whether legal fees incurred in municipal procedures filed by the investor can be recovered and from whom, is a question to be settled by municipal law872.\n\nSee para. 543 *supra.*\n\n*Petrobart,* p. 87.\n\n**VII.4.** **CONCLUSION**\n-------------------------\n\n849.\n\nClaimant is seeking three categories of compensation:\n\n850.\n\nThe first category is the impairment suffered by Lion's investment (the Nayarit and the Guadalajara Mortgages), caused by Mexico's breach of the NAFTA obligations, such impairment to be calculated as the difference in the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario and in the As Is Scenario.\n\n851.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that in the But For Scenario the value of the Claimant's investment would have amounted to USD 47 M, while the value of the investment in the As Is Scenario is nil, the Mortgages having become extinguished and worthless. The compensation due to Lion, for the impairment suffered by its protected investment, amounts to the difference between both values, i.e., **USD 47,000,000** - and this is the sum awarded in Claimant's favour under this heading.\n\n852.\n\nThe second category are certain Legal Fees which Claimant says could arise as a consequence of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding.\n\n853.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, Lion was forced to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding in order to commence this NAFTA arbitration and to incur certain, still to be quantified, Legal Fees as a requirement for the admissibility of this arbitration under the NAFTA. Full reparation requires that Mexico assume the obligation of reimbursing Lion for such Legal Fees, in the amount finally established by the Mexican Courts and actually paid by Lion to the Debtors.\n\n854.\n\nLion, in turn, has a duty to mitigate its losses, and consequently must continue defending the claim for Legal Fees filed by the Debtors, with the same diligence as it would be defending its own interest, exhausting non-obviously futile local remedies.\n\n855.\n\nThe third category are certain expenses and fees incurred in the exhaustion of local remedies, which Claimant says amount to more than USD 2 M.\n\n856.\n\nThe Tribunal has dismissed this claim for lack of evidence and, subsidiarily, because the question of whether legal fees incurred by the investor in pursuing municipal procedures can be recovered, and from whom, is a question to be settled by municipal law in the very proceedings where the legal fees arise.\n\n**VIII.** **INTEREST**\n----------------------\n\n857.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal should award interest as part of the compensation, if a breach is found to have occurred and the payment of compensation is ordered. They disagree, however, on the applicable interest rate, and whether the interest should be compounded.\n\n**1.** **C****laimant****'****s position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nClaimant seeks interest under the following conditions873:\n\nCM, paras. 481-487; CR, paras. 612-624, CPHB, paras. 295-298.\n\n859.\n\n*First,* full reparation requires payment of appropriate interest on any amounts awarded, in accordance with Art. 38(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. If the Claimant is to be kept economically whole, the amount of the final damages awarded must accrue interest874:\n\nCCM, para. 64.\n\n860.\n\n*Second,* the Mexican legal rate for commercial debts in default provided by Art. 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code (i.e., 6% per year) compounded on a monthly basis is warranted. Alternatively, Lion's interest should be that used by Mexican *Amparo* courts when awarding damages, i.e., the 28-day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE)875.\n\nCM, para. 487.\n\n861.\n\n*Third,* interest should accrue from 31 March 2015 until the date of full and effective payment876.\n\nCPHB, paras. 318 and 320.\n\n**2.** **R****espondent****'****s position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n862.\n\nMexico does not dispute that the Claimant would be entitled to interest on any amounts awarded, should the Tribunal hold Mexico liable for a breach of its obligations under the NAFTA. It also does not dispute that interest would be due from the date of the breach until the date in which the award is paid. Yet Mexico disagrees about the following aspects877:\n\nRCM, paras. 328-334; RR, paras. 621-633, RPHB, para. 137.\n\n863.\n\n*First,* the interest rate must be consistent with the currency in which the award is granted. Thus, for an award denominated in U.S. dollars, a relatively low or risk-free rate would be that of the U.S. Treasury Bills, and for an award denominated in Mexican pesos, it should be the 28-day CETES rate - *Certificados de la Tesorer\u00eda de la Federeci\u00f3n*878. In any case, it would be utterly inappropriate to apply a Mexican peso rate to a U.S. denominated amount, as the Claimant proposes.\n\nRR, para. 621. The rate applicable to 28 day Certificados de la Tesorer\u00eda de la Federaci\u00f3n\n\n864.\n\n*Second,* on the issue of how pre- and post-award interest should be calculated, there is no international consensus on whether interest should be calculated using simple or compounded interest. In the circumstances of this case, the Claimant should not be rewarded with compound interest879.\n\nRR, para. 632.\n\n865.\n\n*Third,* there is no consensus among the tribunals that have ordered compound interest as to the compounding period, although the vast majority have opted for annual compounding. Thus, should the Tribunal opt for compounded interest, it should be annual compounding and not monthly compounding880.\n\nRR, para. 632.\n\n**3.** **T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s decision**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n866.\n\nArticle 1135 NAFTA says that\n\n\"Where a Tribunal makes a final award against a Party, the Tribunal may award [...]\n\n(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest [...]\".\n\n867.\n\nIn line with this provision, prior NAFTA tribunals have recognized that interest forms an essential limb of the compensation due for a breach of the Treaty. The tribunal in *Metalclad,* for instance, stated that881:\n\n\"interest becomes an integral part of the compensation itself, and should run consequently from the date when the State's international responsibility became engaged\".\n\n*Metalclad,* para. 128, quoting *Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka* (4 ICSID Reports 245).\n\n868.\n\nThe Parties also agree that this Tribunal may award interest over the compensation ordered. The Parties, however, disagree on the applicable rate and the method of calculation of interest.\n\n869.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision on interest, thus, must determine the applicable interest rate and the methodology for their calculation. The Tribunal must also fix the *dies a quo, dies ad quem* and the principal amount.\n\n870.\n\nSince the Tribunal has determined that the compensation due to Lion is USD 47 M, that is the **\"Principal Amount\"**.\n\n**3.1** **I****nterest** **R****ate**\n-------------------------------------\n\n871.\n\nClaimant has requested that interest be granted over the Principal Amount at the Mexican legal rate for commercial debts in default provided for by Art. 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code (i.e., 6% per year); or alternatively, the 28-day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE), used by the Mexican *Amparo* courts when awarding damages.\n\n872.\n\nRespondent says that the Tribunal should grant the rate applicable to U.S. Treasury Bills; and if the compensation is awarded in Mexican pesos, the rate should be the 28-day CETES rate.\n\n873.\n\nThe NAFTA does not establish an applicable interest rate for the compensation awarded by a tribunal for breaches of Article 1105 NAFTA. But Article 1110(4) NAFTA, which governs the appropriate compensation in cases of expropriation, provides that if payment is made in any G7 currency (and the USD forms part of this group of currencies), interest is to accrue at a commercially reasonable rate:\n\n\"If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency [...]\". [Emphasis of the Tribunal]\n\n874.\n\nIn *Archer Daniels* the tribunal by analogy applied a \"commercially reasonable rate\" to a compensation due for breach of Article 1102 NAFTA (national treatment) and 1106 NAFTA (performance requirement)882. In this case, the Tribunal shares the opinion that Article 1110(4) NAFTA may serve as guidance in a case consisting in the breach of the FET standard.\n\n*Archer Daniels,* para. 296.\n\n875.\n\nThe rates proposed in this case by the Parties are not appropriate:\n\n876.\n\n*First,* Claimant is claiming compensation denominated in USD, but it is requesting the Tribunal to award interests at a rate intended to be applied to a much weaker currency, the MEX, to debts denominated in MEX. This proposal is a *non sequitur.* The principle that the interest rate must be consistent with the currency of the principal is acknowledged in Article 1110(4) of the NAFTA, which states that \"[i]f payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency ..\".\n\n877.\n\n*Second,* Respondent does propose a rate applicable to debt in USD, such as the rate applicable to U.S. Treasury Bills; however, this is not a \"commercially reasonable rate\" - it is the rate accrued for financing the US Government, not for financing commercial enterprises.\n\n878.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that LIBOR is the most widely use \"commercially reasonable rate\", since it is universally accepted as a valid reference for the calculation of variable interest rates. LIBOR is determined by the equilibrium between supply and demand, representing the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market; it is fixed daily by the British Bankers' Association for different maturities and for different currencies.\n\n879.\n\nSince the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for the calculation of interest should be LIBOR rates for six-month deposits denominated in USD.\n\n880.\n\nLIBOR reflects the interest rate at which banks lend to each other money. Loans to customers invariably include a surcharge, and this surcharge must be inserted in the calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Lion by the temporary withholding of money. In the present market situation, the Tribunal finds that a margin of 2% is an appropriate margin, reflecting the surcharge that an average borrower would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR883.\n\n*Lemire (Award),* para. 356; *PSEG,* para. 90; *Sempra,* para. 137; and *Rumeli,* para. 227\n\n**3.2** **C****alculation methodology**\n---------------------------------------\n\n881.\n\nLion has requested that interest should be compounded monthly, while Mexico proposes that simple interest be applied. Alternatively, Mexico says that if the Tribunal were to award compound interest, compounding ought to be carried out annually.\n\n882.\n\nThe question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal has been the subject of diverging decisions in international investment case law. Older case law884 tended to repudiate this possibility, but more recent case law tends to accept annual or semi-annual capitalisation of unpaid interest.885\n\n*CMS,* paras. 470-471.\n\n*MTD,* para. 251; *PSEG,* para. 348; *Lemire (Award),* para. 361.\n\n883.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the more recent decisions. Loan agreements in which interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a provision that unpaid interest must be capitalized at the end of the interest period, and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market in order to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender's additional funding costs have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.\n\n884.\n\nThis principle implies that, if Claimant had taken out a LIBOR loan to anticipate the amount to which it is entitled under this Award, the bank would have insisted that unpaid interest be capitalised at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if Claimant is to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the Award should be capitalised at the end of each 6-month interest period.\n\n885.\n\nThe Tribunal, thus, decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalized semi-annually, from the *dies a quo*.\n\n**3.3** ***D******ies a quo*** **and** ***dies ad quem***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nThe Parties agree that interest shall accrue from the date of the breach until the date in which the award is paid886.\n\nCM, para. 482; RCM, para. 328.\n\n887.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that Mexico's denial of justice occurred over several instances, beginning with the Cancellation Judgment issued by the *Juez de lo Mercantil,* which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the Mortgages on September 7 and October 16, 2012. The Tribunal has taken these dates as the valuation dates for establishing the value of the investments887. These dates also represent the proper *dies a quo.* To simplify calculation, the Tribunal decides that interest should start to accrue on October 1, 2012.\n\nSee para. 632 *supra.*\n\n888.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal determines that the *dies a quo* shall be October 1, 2012 and the *dies ad quem* the date of effective payment.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n889.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that from October 1, 2012 until the date of payment, the principal amount of USD 47 M shall accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR for 6-month deposits denominated in USD, plus a 2% margin, compounded semi-annually, from the *dies a quo*.\n\n**IX.** **COSTS**\n-----------------\n\n890.\n\nArt. 1135 NAFTA states that\n\n\"A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules\".\n\n891.\n\nArt. 58 of the Arbitration Rules of the Additional Facility establishes that\n\n\"(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.\n\n(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form part of the award\".\n\n892.\n\nThe Parties submitted their second statements of cost on October 22, 2019888. Neither of the Parties challenged the items or the amounts claimed by the counterparty.\n\nThe Parties have presented their first statement of costs on April 23, 2018.\n\n893.\n\nThe Parties have incurred two main categories of costs:\n\n\"- the lodging fee and advance on costs paid to ICSID [the \"**Costs of the Proceeding**\"]; and\"\n\n- the expenses incurred by the Parties to further their position in the arbitration [the \"**Defense Expenses**\"].\n\n**1.** **C****laimant****'****s position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n894.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs, Claimant quantified its costs and expenses to a total of USD 8,040,276.32 for the entirety of the arbitral proceedings, which can be broken down to USD 2,093,647.41 incurred in the jurisdictional phase and USD 5,946,628.91 on merits and *quantum*.\n\n895.\n\nClaimant requests the following amounts:\n\nCosts of the proceedings\n\n- ICSID Administrative costs: USD 625,000889.\n\nDefense expenses\n\n\"- Legal Fees: USD 7,193,071.72;\"\n\n\"- Fees of legal and valuation Experts: USD 635,659.60;\"\n\n- Expenses: USD 211,545.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019; ICSID's Interim Financial Statement 25 May 2021, recording Claimant's advance payment totalling USD 525,000; and ICSID Secretariat's letter of June 7, 2021, confirmin Claimant's additional advance payment of USD 100,000.\n\n896.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal to order Mexico to pay the entirety of its costs890.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019.\n\n**2.** **R****espondent****'****s position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n897.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs, Respondent claims that is has incurred costs and expenses amounting to a total of USD 2,962,113.35 in the current proceedings, which may be broken down to USD 1,469,033.57891 for the jurisdictional phase and USD 1,493,079.78 for the merits phase892.\n\nCosts of Proceedings\n\n- ICSID Administrative costs: USD 625,000893.\n\nDefense Expenses\n\n\"- Legal Fees: USD 2,166,845.36;\"\n\n\"- Fees of legal and valuation Experts: USD 227,083.34;\"\n\n- Expenses: USD 18,184.65.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs of April 23, 2018.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019 and ICSID's Letter of August 31, 2021.\n\nICSID's Interim Financial Statement May 25, 2021 and ICSID's Letter of August 31, 2021.\n\n898.\n\nMexico requests the Tribunal to order that Lion to pay for the entirety of its costs894.\n\nRR, para. 634.\n\n**3.** **T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s decision**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nArt. 58 of the Arbitration Rules of Additional Facility establishes that\n\n\"(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne [...].\n\n**3.1** **C****riteria for the decision on costs**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n900.\n\nNeither the Arbitration Rules of Additional Facility nor the NAFTA establish defined criteria for the apportionment of costs. Art. 58 of the Arbitration Rules of Additional Facility grant wide discretion to the Tribunal to decide how the costs of this arbitration shall be allocated.\n\n901.\n\nBoth Parties have requested that the other bear the costs of the proceedings. Claimant suggests that the Tribunal should apply the principle of \"costs follow the event\"895. Respondent has not opposed this proposition.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019, para. 14.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal will adopt the principle that costs follows the event.\n\n903.\n\nAs regards the outcome of this procedure, each Party can legitimately claim that it has succeeded in part:\n\n\"- Claimant partially succeeded in the jurisdictional phase, because the Tribunal accepted that the Mortgages qualified as a protected investment; however, Respondent also partially prevailed, to the extent that the Tribunal accepted Mexico's objection that the Notes were not protected investments.\"\n\n\"- On the merits of the case Lion succeeded in its claim that Mexico breached Article 1105 NAFTA;\"\n\n\"- On damages, Claimant requested compensation of USD 98.2 M896. Respondent argued that, if any compensation was due, it could not be greater than USD 47 M897; the Tribunal concluded, albeit with a different argumentation than that defended by Mexico, that the proper amount of compensation was indeed USD 47M.\n\nCPHB, para. 320: USD 81,992,752 as compensation for the cancellation of the Mortgages, UDS 2,212004,53 as legal fees incurred in the Mexican court proceedings and USD 14,853,013.73 for the cost of waiving the Foreclosure Proceedings.\n\nRR, para. 635,\n\n904.\n\nTaking into account that Lion has partially prevailed in its request for relief, the Tribunal decides that Mexico shall bear part of Claimant's costs.\n\n**3.2** **A****pplication of the** **\"C****ost** **F****ollow the** **E****vent****\"** **principle**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n905.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the principle that costs follow the event to the two main categories of Claimant's costs: the Costs of the Proceedings and the Defence Expenses.\n\nCosts of the Proceedings\n------------------------\n\n906.\n\nThe Costs of the Proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |\n| Prof. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto | USD 424,684.78 |\n| Prof. Laurence Boisson de Chazournes | USD 132,136.64 |\n| Mr. David. J.A. Cairns | USD 156,003.69 |\n| Mr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez | USD 39,675.00 |\n| Mr. Luis Fernando Rodr\u00edguez (expenses) | USD 12,777.47 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 242,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | USD 159,920.24 |\n| Total | USD 1,167,197.82 |\n\n907.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts898. As a result, each Party's share of the Costs of the Proceedings amounts to USD 583,598.91.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n908.\n\nLion claims the Costs of the Proceedings, i.e., the advances made by the Parties to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees of ICSID.\n\n909.\n\nClaimant has succeeded in the overall outcome of the proceedings. The Tribunal, thus, finds that these costs should be assumed by Respondent.\n\n910.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Mexico must reimburse Claimant the totality of the Costs of the Proceeding paid by Claimant to ICSID (net of any final reimbursements made by ICSID).\n\nDefense Expenses\n----------------\n\n911.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must establish the amount of reasonable defense expenses which a standard claimant has to incur, in order to properly present and defend its claim [\"**Reasonable Defense Expenses**\"]. Taking into consideration the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and the work legal counsel and experts, the Tribunal considers that the Parties' Reasonable Defense Expenses amount to USD 3M.\n\n912.\n\nMexico must only assume that part of Claimant's Reasonable Defense Expenses that results from applying the principle that costs follow the event. To determine such amount, the Tribunal must:\n\n\"- First, determine the main issues that have been decided;\"\n\n\"- Second, give each legal issue a ponderation; and\"\n\n- Third, determine the success rate of Claimant's claims in each legal issue and apply it to Claimant's Reasonable Defense Expenses.\n\n913.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Tribunal has made two significant decisions:\n\n\"- Whether it had jurisdiction over the Mortgages and the Notes;\"\n\n- Whether Mexico breached the NAFTA and the consequences thereof.\n\n914.\n\nClaimant declared to have dedicated approximately 25% of their costs to the jurisdiction phase, while the remaining 75% to merits and quantum899. Thus, the Tribunal will assign each of the legal issues the weight apportioned by Claimant:\n\n\"- Jurisdiction: 25% of USD 3 M amounts to USD 750,000;\"\n\n- Merits and quantum: 75% of USD 3M amounts to USD 2,250,000.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019.\n\n915.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine Claimant's rate of success in each legal issue:\n\n\"- Jurisdiction: Claimant was successful in 50% of the jurisdictional objections, since the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over the Mortgages, but rejected jurisdiction over the Notes; the Tribunal considers Claimant's success rate in the jurisdiction phase of 50%.\"\n\n\"- Merits and quantum: Claimant was successful in its relief regarding Mexico's liability for denial of justice; with respect to the assessment of damages, the Tribunal granted approximately half of the amount claimed; in light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds Claimant's success rate in the merits and quantum phase to be 60%.\n\n916.\n\nThe Tribunal will now apply the success rate to Claimant's Reasonable Defense Expenses for each legal issue:\n\n- Jurisdiction: 50% of USD 750,000, which amounts to **USD 375,000**.\n\n- Merits and Quantum: 60% of USD 2,250,000, which amounts to **USD 1,350,000**.\n\n**3.3** **I****nterest**\n------------------------\n\n917.\n\nClaimant has requested that interest be granted over the amounts awarded as costs900.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs of October 22, 2019, para. 24, b).\n\n918.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees.\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the compensation awarded to Lion shall accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR for 6-month deposits denominated in USD plus a 2% margin, compounded semi-annually.\n\n920.\n\nThe same shall apply to the amounts Mexico is ordered to reimburse as costs.\n\n921.\n\nThe *dies a quo* shall be the date of issuance of this Award.\n\n922.\n\nThe *dies ad quem* shall be the date of effective payment.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n923.\n\nIn summary, Mexico shall reimburse Claimant (i) the Costs of the Proceedings paid by Claimant in the amount of USD 583,598.91 and (ii) USD 1,725,000 as Defense Expenses, plus (iii) interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-months deposits denominated in USD, with a margin of 2%, compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award until the date of payment.\n\n**X.** **DECISION**\n-------------------\n\n924.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n1. DECLARES that the United Mexican States has breached NAFTA Art. 1105 by reason of denial of justice and a failure to provide Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. with fair and equitable treatment.\n\n2. ORDERS the United Mexican States pay to Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. USD 47,000,000 as compensation for the breach declared in point 1 *supra.*\n\n3. ORDERS the United Mexican States to reimburse to Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. the Legal Fees arising out of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding, in the amount finally established by the Mexican Courts and actually paid by Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. to the Debtor.\n\n4. ORDERS the United Mexican States to pay Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. interest on the compensation awarded in point 2 *supra,* at the LIBOR rate applicable to six-months deposits denominated in USD, plus a margin of 2%, compounded semi-annually, from 1 October 2012 until the date of effective payment.\n\n5. ORDERS the United Mexican States to pay to Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. (i) USD 583,598.91 as the Costs of the Proceedings and (ii) USD 1,725,000 as Defense Expenses.\n\n6. ORDERS the United Mexican States to pay Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. interest on the amounts awarded in point 5 *supra*, at the LIBOR rate applicable to six-months deposits denominated in USD, plus a margin of 2%, compounded semi-annually, from the date of this Award until the date of effective payment.\n\n7.
