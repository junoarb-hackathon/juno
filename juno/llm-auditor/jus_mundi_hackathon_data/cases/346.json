PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** received a Request for Arbitration **(\"Request\")** filed by Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela **(\"Venezuela\").**\n\n5.\n\nIn its Request, Claimant invokes Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\")** and the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which entered into force on 15 April 2004.\n\n6.\n\nThe Centre registered Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration on 15 June 2012.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing appointment by Claimant, Judge Charles N. Brower accepted his appointment as arbitrator on 4 October 2012. Following appointment by Respondent, Mr. Gabriel Bottini accepted his appointment as arbitrator on 25 October 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn 29 October 2012, Claimant submitted a proposal to disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules **(\"Claimant\u2019s Proposal\").** The Centre acknowledged receipt of Claimant\u2019s Proposal on 30 October 2012.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties agreed to appoint Dr. Klaus Michael Sachs as President of the Tribunal. Dr. Sachs accepted his appointment on 26 November 2012.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal was constituted on 26 November 2012. As provided for by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(2), on the same date the Centre transmitted Claimant\u2019s Proposal to the three members of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), on 27 November 2012, the proceeding was suspended until Claimant\u2019s Proposal was decided.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 28 November 2012, Dr. Sachs and Judge Brower (for the purposes of this Decision referred to as the **\"Arbitral Tribunal\")** set the following schedule:\n\n*\"(i) The Respondent shall submit a reply to Claimant\u2019s disqualification proposal by Friday, December 7, 2012;*\n\n*(ii) Mr. Gabriel Bottini shall furnish any explanations that he may wish to provide, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), within 10 days from receipt of Claimants\u2019 submission;*\n\n*(iii) Both parties are invited to simultaneously file, within 10 days from the date of any explanations furnished by Mr. Bottini, any further observations they wish to make in connection with the disqualification proposal. The parties are requested to submit this presentation only to the Secretary of the Tribunal on the due date. The Secretary of the Tribunal will circulate the submissions upon receipt of both parties\u2019filings.\"*\n\n13.\n\nThe Parties and Mr. Bottini filed their written observations according to the schedule indicated above.\n\n**C. THE PARTIES' AND MR. BOTTINI'S POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe background to Claimant's challenge of Mr. Bottini is his employment by the Argentine Government until 31 December 2012. As of 1 January 2013, Mr. Bottini has resigned from his position to pursue doctoral studies in the United Kingdom.\n\n**I. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimant submits that as a current employee of the Argentine Government at the point in time when he was appointed, Mr. Bottini may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and to act impartially in this proceeding.\n\n**1. Mr. Bottini's Position with the Government of Argentina**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nClaimant is of the view that Mr. Bottini's role as *National Director of International Matters and Disputes for the Office of the Attorney General of Argentina* was of a political nature and that he had specific political duties *vis-a-vis* the Argentine Government. In particular, Claimant points out that Argentine Decree 1755/2008 describes the role held by Mr. Bottini as follows:\n\n*\"Plan and propose a strategy for defending the interests of Argentina in cases where it is either plaintiff or defendant before the courts or arbitration, international or foreign. \"*\n\n17.\n\nClaimant suggests that it should give rise to concern that Respondent appointed Mr. Bottini at a time when he was still employed by the Argentine Government and before Mr. Bottini had announced that he would leave his position.\n\n18.\n\nWhile Claimant appreciates that it is appropriate for a party to an ICSID arbitration to appoint an arbitrator who is capable of understanding and appreciating its position, Claimant submits that it is untenable to appoint an arbitrator of whom the party knows that he *must* agree with its position.\n\n19.\n\nClaimant is concerned that, on the one hand, Mr. Bottini was a government employee and advocate for Argentina and, as such, had an interest that certain issues were decided in a way which is favorable to Argentina and, on the other hand, Mr. Bottini now is supposed to be an arbitrator without any prejudice to the issues which stand to be decided in this arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant submits that its concerns as to Mr. Bottini's impartiality and independence are not alleviated by the fact that Mr. Bottini has taken up studies in the United Kingdom because\n\n*\"[B]efore and after he moves to Cambridge, Mr. Bottini is, first and foremost, an advocate for Argentina.\"*1\n\nClaimant's Final Observations dated 21 December 2012, page 2.\n\n21.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant alleges that Mr. Bottini will be influenced by specific duties with regard to his access to sensitive information, confidentiality and national defense.\n\n22.\n\nGiven the above, Claimant submits that there is a manifest danger that Mr. Bottini will avoid making decisions which would be prejudicial to his positions taken in the cases in which he was working on Argentina's behalf.\n\n23.\n\nClaimant further points out that, contrary to what the Respondent alleges, it is not Claimant's case that *no* public servant can sit as an arbitrator in ICSID proceedings. Claimant is rather concerned with the fact that Mr. Bottini\u2014at the time of his appointment\u2014was a public servant whose then current job was to defend Argentine interests from, in material part, precisely the same or similar issues which will be relevant to this case. In doing so, Claimant alleges, *Mr. Bottini has acted as a zealous advocate for the most recalcitrant State party in ICSID history. \"2*\n\nClaimant's Final Observations dated 21 December 2012, page 4.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant argues that situations like the present one are the reason that Article 16 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice **(\u2019\u2019ICJ\u2019\u2019)** generally prohibits its Judges to exercise any political or administrative function.\n\n25.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Bottini's observations, Claimant states that the reason for Claimant\u2019s Proposal is not merely a narrow view of the nature of Mr. Bottini's job with the Argentine Government *(i.e.* whether it is political or not) but rather the fact that Mr. Bottini repeatedly pleaded on issues on Argentina\u2019s behalf upon which also this proceeding will touch. In this context, Claimant refers the Arbitral Tribunal to *Republic of Ghana v. Telekom Malaysia Berhard,* Decision of the District Court of the Hague (Civil Law Section), 18 October 2004. In this decision, the court ruled that Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard could not simultaneously represent an Italian consortium in its ICSID arbitration against Morocco and serve as arbitrator in a separate investor-State arbitration between Telekom Malaysia and Ghana which turned on similar issues. Claimant suggests that this case is similar to the current case because Mr. Bottini would be faced with issues of law similar to those which he had to argue for Argentina. In Claimant's view, Mr. Bottini's resignation from his government position as of 1 January 2013 is insufficient to alleviate the appearance of bias.\n\n**2. Mr. Bottini's Relationship with Mr. Guglielmino**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimant further relies on the fact that Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino (Argentina's former Attorney General and Mr. Bottini's former direct superior) is currently acting as counsel to Venezuela in the case *Flughafen Zurich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingener\u00eda IDC S.A.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19).\n\n**II. Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant's Proposal should be rejected and that Claimant should be required to bear all costs associated with Claimant\u2019s Proposal.\n\n**1. The Applicable Standard**\n------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nRespondent submits that Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention require arbitrators to be independent and impartial. The applicable standard for disqualification under the ICSID Convention is, however, the existence of a *\"manifest lack\"* of independence and impartiality. Respondent is of the view that there is a high burden of proof.\n\n**2. Mr. Bottini's Position with the Government of Argentina**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nRespondent points out that Argentina and Venezuela (as Respondent) are two different countries.\n\n30.\n\nFurther, Respondent asserts that Mr. Bottini, in his post with the Argentine Government, did not exercise any political functions, and in any event, he has now left his position as of 1 January 2013 in order to attend an academic program at Cambridge University. Generally, Respondent submits that Mr. Bottini's general or specific duties *vis-a-vis* the Argentine Government are of no relevance in a case that involves Venezuela, and not Argentina.\n\n31.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's Proposal is paramount to submitting that\n\n(1) no public servant can act as an arbitrator in ICSID proceedings even if that public servant is employed by a State other than the State involved in the proceedings; and\n\n(2) no person who has ever worked for a government can sit as arbitrator in an ICSID proceeding even if such person has left his or her post.\n\n32.\n\nRespondent points out that while Article 16 of the ICJ Statute does require its Judges to abstain from participating in any national government, the ICSID Convention does not contain such incompatibility rules. When the ICSID Convention was drafted the drafters were aware of the ICJ Statute and decided\u2014insofar as ICSID is concerned\u2014that government employees are not as such excluded from acting as arbitrator in ICSID proceedings.\n\n33.\n\nRespondent has submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal as Exhibit R-l a list of members of the ICSID panels of conciliators and arbitrators who held political functions. The list includes former members of all three branches of government, namely government officials, judges, as well as members of parliament.\n\n34.\n\nFurther, Respondent asserts that Article 16 of the ICJ Statute does not only prevent ICJ Judges from exercising any political or administrative function, but virtually any other professional activity. Respondent submits that this provision is interpreted very widely so as to include and thus declare incompatible, *inter alia,* any professional occupation, be it in a commercial concern, in the practice of law, in teaching or in the administration of a university or faculty of law.\n\n35.\n\nIn contrast to the ICJ's rules, international arbitrators frequently engage in some, or several, of those activities. Applying Article 16 of the ICJ Statute to ICSID by analogy would result in the disqualification of most arbitrators currently sitting. Respondent notes that the prohibition of Article 16 of the ICJ Statute does not extend to those within the ICJ who are most analogous to arbitrators, namely Judges *ad hoc.*\n\n36.\n\nRespondent submits that in order to understand the background of Article 16 of the ICJ Statute, one needs to consider the preparatory works of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice **(\"PCIJ\"),** the predecessor of the ICJ. The wording of Article 16 has not materially changed from the Statute of the PCIJ to the Statute of the ICJ.\n\n37.\n\nA review of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* reveals, Respondent says, that the main reason for the inclusion of the incompatibility provision in Article 16 was that serving as a Judge at the PCIJ would require a full time commitment. Further, the *travaux* show that the prohibition was only meant to apply to the simultaneous *exercise* of the functions. The prohibitions of Article 16 thus do not constitute reasons which represent lack of impartiality and independence *per se,* but only reasons for temporal incompatibility. The latter can be remedied if the concerned Judge suspends his or her other functions.\n\n38.\n\nThus, even if one applied Article 16 of the ICJ Statute, Claimant's challenge would be without merit as Mr. Bottini has left his post with the Argentine Government before the very first act of office as a member of the present Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent concludes that there should be no issue with a government appointing an arbitrator from a different country's government if the other government is not involved in the same dispute.\n\n**3. Mr. Bottini's Relationship with Mr. Guglielmino**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Bottini's connection to Mr. Guglielmino, Respondent submits that it should be evident that Mr. Bottini's impartiality and independence are not compromised in any way. The professional relationship with Mr. Guglielmino ended over two years ago and had nothing to do with the present proceedings.\n\n**III. Observations by Mr. Bottini**\n------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nMr. Bottini states that he sees no reason why he should not be able to serve as arbitrator in this case and act independently and impartially. He states that he has never been involved in a dispute based on the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivian Republic of Venezuela on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments.\n\n**1. Mr. Bottini's Position with the Government of Argentina**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nMr. Bottini states that his position with the Argentine Attorney General's Office, which he left at the end of 2012, was not a political position. Mr. Bottini further states that he has never exercised any political function or performed any political task for the Argentine Government, or for any other government.\n\n43.\n\nMr. Bottini points to the Argentine regulatory framework of national public employment according to which all public servants, including him, have a public employment relationship. This framework does not, however, apply to political appointments, such as the Chief of Staff, the Ministers, the Secretaries and the Under Secretaries.\n\n44.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's reference to Decree 1755/2008, Mr. Bottini explains that his primary responsibility, according to the Decree's Annex II, was to\n\n\"[a]ssist *the Treasury Attorney-General in the planning, organization, supervision and execution of the strategy of defense of the interests of the Argentine Republic in cases before judicial or arbitral tribunals, foreign or international, and participate in the representation and defense of the Argentine Republic before said tribunals\"*\n\nand to\n\n*\"[e]laborate opinions on issues of Public and Private International Law and legal opinions that have to be issued in connection with foreign debt transactions.\"*\n\n45.\n\nMr. Bottini states that his post did not involve making any decisions (whether or not political in nature) but only to advise and assist the Treasury Attorney General in legal matters.\n\n46.\n\nWith regard to confidential information Mr. Bottini submits that he had only access to information which every lawyer would receive. Furthermore, most of the proceedings in which Mr. Bottini was involved were not confidential. Mr. Bottini further declares that he has never worked in national defense.\n\n47.\n\nMr. Bottini explains that his work for the Argentine Government has always been that of a lawyer. Apart from Argentina, he has over the last years advised other parties, including investors and corporations in ICSID, ICC and commercial law cases. Mr. Bottini intends to continue working as an independent advisor also to States, which *\"may include Argentina.\"3* Mr. Bottini further intends to remain an active member of the City of Buenos Aires Bar.\n\nExplanation from Mr. Bottini dated 14 December 2012, p. 2.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, Mr. Bottini asserts that he has not made any arrangements with the Argentine Government for his return into government service after the completion of his doctoral studies. The resignation at the end of 2012 has full effect under Argentine law and he has neither any obligation nor any rights or privileges with regard to a potential return into government services. Mr. Bottini assures that he has received no support from the Argentine Government in connection with his doctoral studies in Cambridge University.4\n\n*See* Letter from Mrs. Alison Hirst, Degree Committee Administrator and External Relations Administrator, Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge, Explanation from Mr. Bottini dated 14 December 2012, Exh. 1 *(\"I am writing to confirm that Mr Gabriel Bottini holds an unconditional offer of admission to the PhD programme in Law at the University of Cambridge from January 2013. Mr Bottini is self-financing and is receiving no funding from the University.\").*\n\n**2. Mr. Bottini's Relationship with Mr. Guglielmino**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nMr. Bottini asserts that he has no current professional relationship with Mr. Guglielmino or any connection with the cases on which Mr. Guglielmino is currently working. In the last three years since Mr. Guglielmino left his position, Mr. Bottini does not remember to have seen him more than twice.\n\n**D. DECISION BY THE UNCHALLENGED ARBITRATORS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first address the applicable standard which needs to be fulfilled by a challenge in order to be successful **(I.).** The Arbitral Tribunal will then turn to the two grounds for challenge, namely Mr. Bottini's former employment with the Argentine Government **(II.)** as well as his professional relationship with Mr. Guglielmino **(III.).**\n\n**I. The Applicable Standard**\n------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe starting point in this regard is Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n52.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in turn provides:\n\n*\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"*\n\n53.\n\nIt follows from the above that, in order to be successful, Claimant\u2019s Proposal must be (i) based on *\"facts\"* which (ii) indicate a *\"manifest lack of qualifications\"* pursuant to Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.5\n\nUniversal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Brigitte Stem and Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil, Arbitrators) ICSID Case No. ARB/10/9, para. 72; GEMA International, NCT Necotrans, GETMA International Investissements & NCT Infrastructure & Logistique c. La R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e (D\u00e9cision sur la demande en r\u00e9cusation de Monsieur Bernardo M. Cremades, Arbitre) ICSID Case No. ARB/11/29, para. 58; see also Karel Daele, *Challenge and Disqualification of Arbitrators in International Arbitration,* p. 218.\n\n54.\n\nThe issue to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal is therefore whether the facts submitted by Claimant indicate a manifest lack of Mr. Bottini's capacity to exercise independent judgment within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in the present case.\n\n55.\n\nIn this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal observes that, while the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to *\"independent judgment\"6*, the Spanish version requires *\"imparcialidad de juicio\"* (impartiality of judgment). Since both versions are equally authentic,7 it is therefore generally accepted that, under the ICSID Convention, arbitrators have to be both, impartial and independent.8\n\nThe French version refers to *\"ind\u00e9pendance dans l\u2019exercice de lews fonctions\".*\n\n*See* note subsequent to Article 75 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSuez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stem, Arbitrator) ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, para. 37.\n\n56.\n\nIndependence is characterized by the absence of external control, in particular of relations between the arbitrator and a party which may influence the arbitrator\u2019s decision.9 Impartiality, on the other hand, means the absence of bias or predisposition towards one party and requires that the arbitrator hears the parties without any favor and bases his or her decision only on factors related to the merits of the case.10\n\nCf. Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v. The Argentine Republic (Decision on Second Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, para. 29; GEMA International, NCT Necotrans, GETMA International Investissements & NCT Infrastructure & Logistique c.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator) ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, para. 54.\n\nCf. Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator) ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, para. 54.\n\n57.\n\nAnother issue for the Arbitral Tribunal is the question when the *\"lack of qualities\"* (including impartial and independent judgment) becomes *\"manifest\"* within the meaning of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. There seems to be no unequivocal answer.\n\n58.\n\nIn several decisions on proposals for disqualification under the ICSID Convention it has been stated that, because the lack of qualifications pursuant to Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention has to be *\"manifest\",* Article 57 of the ICSID Convention sets a relatively high bar for challenging an arbitrator.11 In *Suez v. Argentina,* the unchallenged arbitrators stated that, from the perspective of an *\"informed reasonable person\",* facts must be established which *\"make it obvious and highly probable, not just possible that* [the challenged arbitrator] *is a person who may not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\"12*\n\nOPIC Karimum Corporation v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Philippe Sands, Arbitrator) ICSID Case No. ARB/10/14, para. 45; Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v. The Argentine Republic (Decision on Second Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Cases Nos ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, para. 29; GEMA International, NCT Necotrans, GETMA International Investissements & NCT Infrastructure & Logistique c. La R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e (D\u00e9cision sur la demande en r\u00e9cusation de Monsieur Bernardo M. Cremades, Arbitre) ICSID Case No. ARB/11/29, para. 60; Conoco Philipps Company et al. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator) ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, para. 56; see also Reed/Paulsson/Blackaby, *op. cit.,* p. 134.\n\nSuez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v. The Argentine Republic (Decision on Second Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Cases Nos ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, para. 29.\n\n59.\n\nHowever, in other decisions the word *\"manifest\"* has been interpreted so as to relate to the ease with which the alleged risk of lack of independence or impartiality can be perceived. In *EDF International S.A. v. Argentina* the unchallenged arbitrators decided that the challenged arbitrator should have ceased to serve in the proceedings if *\"reasonable doubts exist\"* with regard to whether she could be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.13 Referring to the Commentary of Professor Schreuer, they stated that the word *\"manifest\"* in Article 57 of the Convention *\"relates not to the seriousness of the allegation, but to the ease with which it may be perceived.\"14*\n\nEDF International S.A.; SAUR International S.A.; Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic (Challenge Decision Regarding Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler) ICSID Case No. ARB/03/03, para. 64; see also Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee) ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, para. 25.\n\nEDF International S.A.; SAUR International S.A.; Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v.

Ukraine (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz) ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, para. 37.\n\n60.\n\nHence, there is no clear-cut guideline as to the degree to which the facts invoked by the challenging party must substantiate the alleged lack of qualification. Irrespective of the required degree, the body deciding on the proposal must first analyze the facts submitted by the challenging party and decide whether these facts (in contrast to speculation and inferences) could lead a reasonable person to conclude that there is a possibility that the challenged arbitrator is not independent and/or impartial. Only if the answer is yes, the further question has to be decided of how probable the lack of independence and impartiality must be.\n\n**II. Mr. Bottini's Position with the Government of Argentina**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nClaimant's reasons for proposing the disqualification of Mr. Bottini are: First, that Mr. Bottini's position was a position which was, in fact, political and would disqualify him as a Judge under the ICJ Statute **(1.)** and, second, irrespective of whether or not his position was political in nature, that Mr. Bottini is to be disqualified on the basis of \"issue conflict\" because in his previous capacity he has argued from Argentina\u2019s perspective issues which may arise in this case **(2.).**\n\n**1. The General Nature of Mr. Bottini's Position**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that under Argentine law, Mr. Bottini's position was not ranked amongst \"political appointments\", but amongst positions of public service. While this point might be an indicator of the nature of his work, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that for the purposes of this Decision, it cannot be decisive on its own.\n\n63.\n\nAssuming, *arguendo,* that the test of Article 16 of the ICJ Statute could be applied to ICSID arbitrations, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that Mr. Bottini\u2014while in office\u2014 would indeed have been unsuitable to serve as a Judge at the ICJ.\n\n64.\n\nAt the time of the PCH, the Court took the view that a function was incompatible with Article 16 if it was a *\"function which compelled a person to follow the instructions of his government, regardless of his personal views.\"15*\n\nAndreas Zimmermann *et al., The Statute of the International Court of Justice: A Commentary* (2006), at 330.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 2 of the ICJ Statute requires that the Court be composed of a body of *\"independent\"* Judges. In 1945, the San Francisco Conference described this requirement as follows: the Judges *\"should be not only impartial but also independent of control by their own countries or the United Nations Organization. \"16*\n\nShabtai Rosenne, *The Law and Practice of the International Court, 1920-2005* (2006), at 359 (2006).\n\n66.\n\nShabtai Rosenne explains in his commentary:\n\n*\"That interpretation does not preclude the nomination or election of a candidate who, at the time of nomination or election, was in the service of a government or of an international inter-government organization - although if no generally recognized 'cooling off\u2019 period is not introduced, at the least it would be desirable for candidates in that situation to disengage themselves from their official activities as soon as their candidatures are established.17*\n\nIbid. The double negative appearing in the quotation, which is an exact quotation from the book as published, doubtless should be disregarded.\n\n67.\n\nIn 1995, the ICJ adopted a memorandum entitled *\"Incompatibilities in the Practice of the International Court of Justice\",* which reflects the most recent form of ICJ practice regarding general incompatibilities. The Memorandum notes that Article 16 prohibits Judges from exercising any political or administrative function *\"whether international, national, or local, whether commercial or otherwise.\"* It further prohibits them from engaging in any other occupation of a professional nature, including *\"holding a position in a commercial concern, engaging in the practice of law, maintaining membership in a law firm or rendering legal or expert opinions, or holding a permanent teaching or administrative position in a university. \"18*\n\nZimmermann *et al., op. cit.,* at 332.\n\n68.\n\nIn commenting on the Court\u2019s Memorandum, Philippe Couvreur notes:\n\n*\"[T]he prohibition applicable to political and administrative functions in the broad sense (including, since the revision of the PCI J Statute in 1929, parliamentary and judicial functions and permanent academic duties) concerns only the exercise of those functions, which would place the individual in a position of direct or indirect dependency vis-a-vis a government. A member of the Court is thus entitled to retain vested rights acquired in the course of national public service (different forms of 'leave\u2019 exist for this purpose). Likewise, while judges must refrain from participating in any way actively or directly in national political life (including by publicly expressing political opinions), it has always been clear that they are entitled to exercise their rights as citizens in their home countries (in particular, to vote and even, subject to the foregoing, to hold membership of a political party).* \"19 (Emphasis added.)\n\nZimmermann *et al., op. cit.,* at 334-335.\n\n69.\n\nAgainst this background it appears that even though Mr. Bottini has stated that his position was not a political position and that he never exercised any political function or performed any political task, he in fact would have fallen within the list of incompatible occupations, as he was:\n\n- *\"engaging in the practice of law*\n\n- *\"compelled [...] to follow the instruction of his government regardless of his personal views\";*\n\n- *\"in a position of direct or indirect dependency vis-\u00e1-vis\"* the Argentine Government; and\n\n- directly responsible to his superior, the Attorney General.\n\n70.\n\nHowever, this situation changed as of 1 January 2013, when Mr. Bottini left his position.\n\n71.\n\nAs Philippe Couvreur notes, only the simultaneous *exercise* of the administrative or political function is incompatible with Article 16 of the ICJ Statute. If the individual concerned suspends his other functions and takes \"leave\", he or she can sit as a Judge at the ICJ. This, of course, must apply *a fortiori* if the administrative or political function is not only suspended but, as in our case, given up completely. As Mr. Bottini was not involved in a single decision in his role as arbitrator from the time of appointment up to the termination of his position, there should be no concern flowing alone from his former position.\n\n72.\n\nHowever, and more generally, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that the ICJ Statute is only of limited relevance for the present dispute.\n\n73.\n\nAs Respondent correctly points out, the position of an ICJ Judge is a full time position and thus the broad interpretation of the incompatibility rule is understandable. In fact, applying the ICJ's Memorandum20 would disqualify most arbitrators currently sitting in ICSID cases, and certainly all arbitrators on this Tribunal. This shows that the occupations included in the Memorandum are not necessarily included only because they raise doubts with regard to a Judge's impartiality and independence *per se,* but also because the ICJ requires that its Judges devote their entire professional time and attention to the Court. In addition, cases may come to the Court involving any State, including the ICJ Judges\u2019 own States of nationality.\n\n*Cf* paragraph 67 above.\n\n74.\n\nBy contrast, arbitrators sitting in ICSID cases are intended to be appointed *ad hoc.* It follows that most will hold a different main occupation.21 Thus a main occupation in itself cannot establish incompatibility between the main occupation and the role as arbitrator.\n\nIndeed, a number of ICJ Judges have sat in the past and currently sit as ICSID arbitrators.\n\n75.\n\nFinally, the Arbitral Tribunal wishes to point out that Claimant's reference to alleged access to sensitive information, confidentiality and national defense is not supported by any facts and can thus be no reason for the disqualification of Mr. Bottini.\n\n**2. No \"Issue Conflict\"**\n--------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal thus has to analyze the specific former functions of Mr. Bottini and whether Claimant has established any *manifest* danger that Mr. Bottini would not be able to make an independent and impartial judgment.\n\n77.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that Claimant has not alleged that Mr. Bottini is subject to any current control by either the Argentine or the Venezuelan Government. Claimant's concerns are entirely based on the issue of so-called abstract \"issue conflict\", *i.e.* on the assumption that there is a danger that Mr. Bottini will decide a certain issue in favor of Venezuela because he has argued the same, or similar, issues in favor of Argentina in the past and potentially in the future, and in doing so, that he will not have sufficient regard to the merits of this case.\n\n78.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not find that Claimant's arguments support a case of a *\"manifest\"* danger in this regard. Claimant has presented no facts which cast *\"reasonable doubt\"22* on Mr. Bottini's impartiality and independence, let alone facts which *\"make it obvious and highly probable\"23* that Mr. Bottini lacks these qualities.\n\n*Cf.* EDF International S.A.; SAUR International S.A.; Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic (Challenge Decision Regarding Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler) ICSID Case No. ARB/03/03, para. 64; see also Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee) ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, para. 25.\n\n*Cf.* Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v. The Argentine Republic (Decision on Second Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Cases Nos ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, para. 29.\n\n79.\n\nMr. Bottini is currently not acting for the Argentine Government, or, to the Arbitral Tribunal's knowledge, for any government. Nor is the Arbitral Tribunal aware of any other connections to the Argentine Government.\n\n80.\n\nEven if one assumes *arguendo* that Mr. Bottini did in fact vigorously advocate Argentina's positions in other investment treaty arbitrations, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot see why Mr. Bottini would be locked in to the views he presented at the time. It is at the core of the job description of legal counsel\u2014whether acting in private practice, in-house for a company, or in government\u2014that they present the views which are favorable to their instructor and highlight the advantageous facts of their instructor's case. The fact that a lawyer has taken a certain stance in the past does not necessarily mean that he will take the same stance in a future case.\n\n81.\n\nThere is no indication in the file, or otherwise, why this should be any different for Mr. Bottini or why he should not be in a position to freely form a view on the merits presented to him in this arbitration. Absent any specific facts which indicate that Mr. Bottini is not able to distance himself in a professional manner from the cases in which he was acting as counsel, Mr. Bottini has the assumption in his favor that he is a legal professional with the ability to keep a professional distance. The same assumption is granted in favor of many arbitrators who today sit as arbitrators in ICSID cases but who started their career as counsel or who still act as counsel in such cases.\n\n82.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also notes that Mr. Bottini has stated that he has not only advised Argentina, but also other parties, including investors.\n\n83.\n\nFurther, the present case is distinguishable from the case *Republic of Ghana v. Telekom Malaysia Berhard,* Decision of the District Court of the Hague (Civil Law Section), 18 October 2004, on which Claimant relies.\n\n84.\n\nIn the cited case, Prof. Gaillard was acting simultaneously as counsel for a party in one arbitration and as arbitrator in another case. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees that this constellation can potentially raise doubts as to the impartiality and independence of the concerned individual in his role as arbitrator. It seems possible that the arbitrator in such a case could take a certain position on a certain issue, having in mind that if he took a different position as arbitrator, he could undermine his credibility as counsel as which he is arguing on the same, or very similar, issue.\n\n85.\n\nHowever, this case is different. The Arbitral Tribunal has no present information that Mr. Bottini currently is advocating for or advising Argentina in any way. Doubtless Mr. Bottini is aware of the obligation of someone in his position to make appropriate disclosures as needed of any potential conflict of interest, including an issue conflict, for which process the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration provide widely accepted guidance.\n\n86.\n\nRecognizing that the present challenge to Mr. Bottini arose due to the unfortunate timing of his appointment and the disclosure requirement imposed by Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s Proposal to disqualify Mr. Bottini on the condition that Mr. Bottini completes, signs, and transmits to the ICISD Secretary-General a new Declaration under Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules within 10 days of the date of this Decision. By signing a new Declaration, Mr. Bottini will have certified that he *\"assume[s] a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any [... ] relationship* [with the Parties] *or* [any other] *circumstance* [that might cause his reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party] *that subsequently arises during this proceeding.\"24*\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 6(2).\n\n**3. Mr. Bottini's Relationship with Mr. Guglielmino**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr. Guglielmino has ceased to be Mr. Bottini's superior about three years ago, and that Mr. Bottini cannot remember having seen him more than twice since. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that this is no indication for a possible lack of impartiality or independence.\n\n**E. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n88.\n\nClaimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is rejected, on the condition that Mr. Bottini completes, signs, and transmits to the ICSID Secretary-General a new Declaration under Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules within 10 days of the date of this Decision.\n\n89.\n\nThe costs of this challenge proceeding are reserved."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2016-12-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Charles N.

Brower\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE CHARLES N. BROWER**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal's finding (paragraph 908(1)) that Respondent is responsible for a breach of Article 5(1), subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (hereinafter \"the BIT\") in expropriating Claimant's 99.99%-owned Venezuelan subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A. (hereinafter \"Norpro\"), as well as with most of the Tribunal's detailed analysis of the correct elements to guide the discounted cashflow calculation of the compensation to be awarded to Claimant. I must dissent, however, from two aspects of that analysis that, both as an economic matter as well as a matter of the applicable law, deprive the Claimant of much of that to which it is entitled, whether under the BIT or under international law generally. *See Case* *Concerning the Factory at Chorzow (Claim for Indemnity) (Germany v. Poland),* P.C.I.J. Series A No. 17 (1928). Specifically, the Tribunal has failed to enforce the BIT and international law generally in that it:\n\n(a) Has included in the country risk portion of the percentage by which the projected cash flow of Norpro is to be discounted (i.e., 10.26% as per paragraph 753) precisely the risk of uncompensated expropriation, as well as other violations of the BIT (paragraphs 713-714), from which this Tribunal has been constituted to rescue Claimant, and which in the instant Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum (hereinafter \"the Decision\") the Tribunal professes to accomplish, resulting in a country risk factor that is 5.76 points above, hence 228% of, 4.5%, the only country risk factor number either Party has placed before the Tribunal as excluding the risk of BIT violations; and\n\n(b) Has excluded 25% of Norpro's export sales profits on the ground that the Claimant, Norpro\u2019s 99.99% owner, has by tax-related intercompany transfer pricing or other bookkeeping choices charged Norpro approximately that amount of its profits for Claimant's contributions to Norpro\u2019s marketing.\n\nThe vices of these two reductions of Claimant's entitlement under the BIT and general international law should be obvious.\n\n2.\n\nThe first problem, under 1(a) just above, arises from the misunderstanding by the Tribunal of Article 5(1), paragraph 2, which specifies that compensation for an expropriation must be \"equal to the actual value of the investment[] concerned,\" and of general international law, which as per *Chorzow* (page 47 of the Judgment), requires \"that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" The Decision has morphed the applicable law into applying a compensation standard of \"fair market value,\" which, as applied by the Decision, unfortunately has led to injustice to the Claimant.\n\n3.\n\nBy increasing the country risk factor to include precisely the risk against which the Decision undertakes to insulate the Claimant, whom the Tribunal has found to have been injured by the expropriatory breach of the BIT by the Respondent, the Tribunal does an injustice to the Claimant. It takes away with one hand what it has purported to give the Claimant with the other. To reduce the recovery to the injured Claimant by applying a \"fair market value\" that incorporates the very risk of which the Claimant purportedly is being relieved by the Tribunal is to deny the Claimant the full compensation to which it is entitled. It is like undertaking to restore to the owner of a severely damaged automobile a perfectly repaired and restored vehicle but then leaving parts of it missing because it just might be damaged again in the future. The obvious logic of this was recognized by a very distinguished tribunal in *Gold Reserve, Inc. v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award (22 Sept. 2014) \u00b6 841, which should have persuaded my colleagues not to follow the misguided precedent of *Tidewater Investment SRL v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award (13 Mar. 2015). Significantly, the necessity of excluding from the country risk factor the very treaty risk of which a claimant is found to have been a victim was underscored already 27 years ago, in 1989, by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in *Phillips Petroleum Company Iran* v. *The Islamic Republic of Iran, et al.,* Award No. 425-39-2 (29 June 1989) \u00b6\u00b6 111, 152, *reprinted in* 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79, and ten years later, in 1999 by the UNCITRAL Rules Tribunal in *Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. PT. (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara*, Final Award (4 May 1999) \u00b6 357, *in* Yearbook Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XXV (A. Jan van den Berg ed., Kluwer 2000) *.*\n\n4.\n\nApart from the fact that the majority's position deprives the Claimant of the compensation to which it is entitled, it fails to adhere to the Parties' agreement as to what constitutes \"fair market value.\" In paragraph 628 of the Decision the Tribunal points out that \"[t]he Parties agree that the fair market value is equal to the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, *provided that the buyer is informed about all relevant circumstances and none of the parties is under any kind of duress to sell or to acquire the asset*.\" (Emphasis added.) If a willing buyer is, for example, a national of France (Party to the BIT here), or of another State that has equivalent treaty protection as did and should the Claimant here, is that not a part of the buyer being \"informed about all relevant circumstances\"? Might not such status possibly lead the purchaser to pay more for the expropriated asset than would a potential buyer that lacks such protection? \"Fair market value\" cannot as, the Parties to this case have agreed, be determined devoid of \"all the relevant circumstances.\"\n\n5.\n\nAs to paragraph 1(b) above, awarding the 99.99%-owner of the expropriated concern, namely the Claimant, which is entitled to 99.99% of the profits of Norpro, only the lesser compensation derived from 99.99% minus 25% of Norpro's export sales profits means that to that extent the Claimant is deprived of the compensation to which it is entitled. The intercompany bookkeeping practiced by the parent and the subsidiary has no effect whatsoever on the actual profit created for the parent by the subsidiary. Assuming, as an example, that 25% of Norpro's export sales profits adds up to 10% of Norpro\u2019s total profits, then the parent Claimant, which in fact has lost 99.99% of Norpro\u2019s profits, receives as compensation, not that 99.99% of which it was deprived, but instead only 89.99%. How can that be considered to lead to \"fair market value\" by whatever standard?\n\nFor the reasons, and to the extent, stated above I respectfully dissent from the Decision."}], "Content": "Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| App. BF- | Appendixes to the Expert Report on Quantum of Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores |\n| Claimant\u2019s Proposal | Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini submitted by Claimant on 29 October 2012 |\n| Brailovsky/Flores I | First Expert Report on Quantum of Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores dated 21 March 2014 |\n| Brailovsky/Flores II | Second Expert Report on Quantum of Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores dated 18 September 2014 |\n| CETA | EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement |\n| CLA- | Claimant\u2019s Legal Authorities |\n| Claimant\u2019s Cost Submission | Claimant\u2019s Cost Submission of 30 June 2015 |\n| Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission | Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission of 2 April 2015 |\n| Claimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Submission | Claimant\u2019s Simultaneous Second-Round Post-Hearing Submission of 22 May 2015 |\n| Claimant\u2019s Updated Cost Submission | Claimant\u2019s submission of its Updated Cost Submission of 23 November 2015 |\n| Claimant\u2019s Valuation Update | Claimant\u2019s submission of the requested updates of its experts\u2019 valuations of 22 October 2015 |\n| Confidentiality Order | The Confidentiality Order contained in Procedural Order No. 2 issued by the Tribunal on 10 June 2014 |\n| Counter Memorial | Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial dated 21 March 2014 |\n| CVG | Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Guyana |\n| CVG Bauxilum | CVG Bauxilum, C.A. |\n| CVG EDELCA | CVG Electrificaci\u00f3n del Caroni, C.A. |\n| DAC | *Demand\u00e9 d\u2019Autorisation Compagnie* |\n| Decision on Disqualification | Prof. Sachs and Judge Browers Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Bottini from the Tribunal dated 27 February 2013 |\n| Declaration | Mr. Bottini\u2019s new declaration under Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules submitted on 1 March 2013 to the Secretary-General, dated 28 February 2013 |\n| Exhibit C- | Claimant\u2019s Exhibits |\n| Exhibit CLEX- | Exhibits to the Damages Assessment of Saint-Gobain\u2019s Investments in Venezuela of Professor Pablo T.

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I. Arbitration Agreement and Institution of the Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a legal dispute between Saint-Gobain and Venezuela arising out of Venezuela's alleged refusal to compensate Saint-Gobain for the expropriation of Saint-Gobain's investment in its 99.99%1 subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A. **(\"Norpro Venezuela\"** or **\"Norpro\")** following a televised speech of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez on 15 May 2010. Claimant alleges that Respondent breached the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (the **\"France-Venezuela-BIT\"** or the **\"Treaty\"),** which entered into force on 15 April 2004, by refusing to offer compensation for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela's proppants plant in Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, as well as by sanctioning or failing to intervene in the increase of the price for the supply of bauxite allegedly in breach of a contract entered into with a State-owned entity, thus failing to treat Claimant fairly and equitably and to accord its investment full protection and security, in violation of Articles 5(1) and 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.\n\nOne share is held by Mr. Luis Paez, a Venezuelan national and the President of Norpro Venezuela, who subscribed a single share whenNorpro Venezuela was incorporated. The planned transfer of Mr. Paez\u2019s share to Saint-Gobain has not yet been completed.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe following is a summary of the background facts that are not disputed between the Parties, or which have otherwise been established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. The following summary is intended to give a general overview of the present dispute and should not be taken to be exhaustive of all facts that may be relevant. Such additional facts may be discussed in the Tribunal's analysis below.\n\n**I. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n135.\n\nSaint-Gobain is a company incorporated under the laws of the French Republic and was registered on 28 March 1995.11 It is an indirect and wholly-owned subsidiary of Compagnie de Saint Gobain and a member of the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain group of companies.12\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 **1; Exhibit C-46.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 1. Saint-Gobain is wholly-owned by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Participations Financi\u00e8res et Industrielles, which in turn is wholly-owned by Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. Request, \u00b6 11.\n\n136.\n\nNorpro Venezuela is a wholly owned subsidiary of Saint-Gobain and is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Venezuela.13\n\nRequest, \u00b6 4. Saint-Gobain's Foreign Direct Investment in Norpro Venezuela was registered before the Superintendence of Foreign Investments of Venezuela. **Exhibit C-9.** Norpro Venezuela was initially registered on 25 October 2005, under the name Saint-Gobain Proppants Venezuela, C.A., before the Fifth Mercantile Registry of the Capital District and Miranda State Circuit. **Exhibit C-4.** By shareholder agreement, the company subsequently changed its name to Proppants Venezuela, C.A. and moved its seat from Caracas to Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, Venezuela. On 19 December 2005, Proppants Venezuela C.A. was registered before the Mercantile Registry of the Bolivar State Circuit in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela. **Exhibit C-5.** On 15 December 2008, the shareholders agreed to change the company\u2019s name from Proppants Venezuela to Norpro Venezuela, C.A.; this name change was officially registered on 26 December 2008. **Exhibit C-13.** One share in Norpro Venezuela is held by Luis Paez, a Venezuelan national and the President of Norpro Venezuela. The planned transfer of Mr. Paez\u2019s share to Saint-Gobain has not yet been completed.\n\n137.\n\nEffected through its Venezuelan subsidiary, Claimant constructed and operated a plant in Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, Venezuela, designed to produce ceramic proppants - small ceramic beads made from bauxite used as part of the hydraulic fracturing process to *\"prop\"* open fissures within a well induced in reservoir rock formations, in order to speed up and increase the recovery of hydrocarbons from each formation.14\n\nRequest, \u00b6 4. Memorial, \u00b6 2.\n\n138.\n\nClaimant (through its affiliates) has been manufacturing ceramic proppants to support the oil and gas industry for approximately 30 years.15 By the end of the 1990s, Saint-Gobain had developed a strong market position in North America, particularly with respect to high-grade ceramic proppants.16\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 5. **Exhibit C-133.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 8.\n\n139.\n\nIn its Memorial, Claimant described the recent evolution of the proppants business, *inter alia,* as follows:\n\n*\"[T]he market for proppants has developed and expanded significantly in the last ten years and the major driver of this development and expansion has been technological advancement in the oil and gas industry. Specifically, advances have allowed oil and gas producers to: (a) drill deeper wells; (b) drill horizontally; and (c) use hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking,' to permit the extraction of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale rock formations. Fracking is a technique whereby fluids are injected at high pressure into a wellbore drilled into non-permeable shale formations. The fluids create cracks in the shale, which unlocks oil and gas trapped inside. The proppants get inside the microfissures created by the high-pressure fluids injected and hold them open, increasing production. [...]*\n\n*Thus, in an industry increasingly characterized by deeper, horizontal wells and fracking, proppants allow for a more efficient extraction of hydrocarbons.*\n\n*Additionally, by stimulating a well, not only do proppants improve extraction rates for oil and natural gas, but they also contribute to increased well productivity and longevity.*\n\n*There are four grades of proppants. In order of increasing strength, they include: (a) sand; (b) resin-coated sand; (c) ceramic; and (d) resin-coated ceramic. The choice of which proppant to use in a particular well derives largely from the closure stress of that well. Saint-Go-bain makes ceramic proppants, which are suited for the deeper, higher-closure-stress wells typical in shale formations in the United States.* *Other types of proppants, particularly sand proppants, cannot withstand such conditions.\"17*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Internal citations omitted.\n\n**II. Claimant's Decision to Expand Production Capacity and Search for an Expansion Site in South America**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn light of the growing proppants industry in North America, but also internationally, the Saint-Gobain Group began in the early 2000s to research options for increasing its production capacity.18 At that time, there were not sufficient proven bauxite reserves available in the US either for an expansion of the Saint-Gobain proppants plant in Fort Smith, Arkansas (the **\"Fort Smith Plant\")** or for a new North American facility. Therefore, in 2004, Saint-Gobain started to search for a site for the production of proppants in South America, anticipating that 70 to 80% of the proppants to be produced there would be sold in the North American market, while the remaining percentage would go to the South American market.19\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 8.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 10; Pedersen, \u00b6\u00b69, 11, 44.\n\n141.\n\nThe following were identified by Claimant as the main requirements for the production of proppants:\n\n*\"(a) steady supplies of bauxite [i.e.,* the primary raw material required for the production or proppants], *gas and electricity (at competitive prices); (b) proximity to the U.S. market in order to access the largest (current) market for proppants at reasonable transportation costs; (c) access to a skilled workforce capable of dealing with the technical aspects of proppants production; and (d) the ability to build a plant and produce on a short timeline to meet ever-increasing customer needs.\"20*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12. Internal citations omitted. *See* also Pedersen, \u00b615; Larry, 17, 22; **Exhibits C-069** and **C-107.**\n\n142.\n\nOf these requirements, access to bauxite and proximity to the target market were considered to be the key drivers of investment location.21\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12.\n\n143.\n\nInitially, Claimant considered four countries, i.e., Brazil, Guyana, Trinidad and Venezuela, as potential locations for the new proppants plant. However, following several business development explorations trips taken by employees of the Saint-Gobain Group, the locations in Guyana, Trinidad and Brazil were rejected as either unfeasible in the near future or not economically competitive.22\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 11. Pedersen, \u00b6\u00b616, 17. Claimant submits that Guyana lacked readily accessible gas supplies; in addition, electricity costs were high, and shipping options were rather limited. In Trinidad, Saint-Gobain would have been required to import bauxite from Guyana, the steady supply of which could not be guaranteed, and land at the preferred industrial location would not be available for several years. Finally, in Brazil, the domestic bauxite was already being sold to aluminium producers and extractors and, in addition, Saint-Gobain would have had to mine and transport bauxite itself. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; **Exhibits C-063** and **C-071.**\n\n144.\n\nClaimant considered Venezuela an interesting potential site for the construction of a proppants plant given the ready availability of bauxite, electricity and natural gas,23 and, according to Claimant, the prospect of entering into favorable contracts with State-owned entities for the supply of those resources and logistical benefits such as the availability of a well-established shipping route from the local port in Puerto Ordaz to Corpus Christi, Texas - where the finished proppants would be shipped for distribution within the North American market.

Of particular importance, Saint-Gobain\u2019s supplier of bauxite, CVG Bauxilum, was located in Puerto Ordaz.

Mr. Objois was supported on site by a number of experienced employees seconded from the Fort Smith Plant.52\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 32; Pedersen, \u00b640; Larry, \u00b628.\n\n160.\n\nClaimant then started focusing on the technical requirements for the proppants, in particular on the characteristics of the bauxite, *i.e.,* of the primary raw material that was going to be supplied by CVG Bauxilum.53\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 36.\n\n161.\n\nTo that end, on 28 February 2006 and again a year later, at the end of March 2007, representatives of Saint-Gobain visited the CVG Bauxilum facility at Puerto Ordaz in order to develop the technical requirements for the bauxite to be provided under the Bauxite Contract and to learn more about CVG Bauxilum\u2019s business and production.54 While noting that CVG Bauxilum was *\"at present not receptive to providing customer specific Alu-mina/iron levels\"* Claimant\u2019s representatives assessed that CVG Bauxilum\u2019s operation was *\"very well run\"55*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 **37; Exhibits C-078** and **C-087.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 **37; Exhibit C-087.**\n\n162.\n\nIn early April 2007, Saint-Gobain made an additional presentation to CVG Bauxilum and met with its President *\"to discuss about possibilities to supply other grades of Bauxite and potential developments for the future.\"56* Shortly thereafter, in May 2007, Saint-Go-bain submitted its request for bauxite supplies under the Bauxite Contract to CVG Bauxilum.57 In June 2007, Norpro Venezuela reported internally that CVG Bauxilum had confirmed that it would *\"supply up to 30% high Alumina content Bauxite,\"* which assured Claimant that CVG Bauxilum would provide the type of bauxite required to produce ceramic proppants in Venezuela.58\n\n**Exhibits C-089** and **C-088.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 38; **Exhibit C-090.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 38; **Exhibit C-091.**\n\n**IV. VAT Credits**\n-------------------\n\n163.\n\nVenezuelan law requires Venezuelan companies to pay VAT for goods and services they acquire and to collect VAT from Venezuelan, but not from foreign, purchasers of their goods and services, thus exempting exporters of goods manufactured in Venezuela from collecting VAT. When a company makes VAT payments on its purchases of goods and services, it accumulates VAT credits, and when it collects VAT from the buyer, it accumulates VAT debits, which are offset against the credits on a monthly basis. If the company has paid more VAT than it has collected, it carries the net balance forward to the next month.59\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\n164.\n\nNorpro Venezuela was to a large extent an exporter of goods manufactured in Venezuela and thus did not collect VAT from its foreign customers, but it nonetheless incurred VAT on most of its purchases because most of the equipment for the plant acquired during the construction phase as well as the raw materials (such as bauxite) used in the production of proppants and the labor services of the outsourcing companies were acquired in Venezuela and thus subject to VAT. As a result of this imbalance between its VAT payments and its VAT collections, as of 31 December 2009, Norpro Venezuela had accumulated VAT credits of VEF 11.7 million on its balance sheet.60\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 162; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 51.\n\n165.\n\nWhile imported goods, such as equipment for a manufacturing facility, are generally subject to VAT, on 19 October 2006, Respondent issued Decree 4,908, which established a procedure that could result in the exoneration from import taxes and VAT on certain imported equipment.61 If a company wanted to obtain such an exoneration, it had to apply for an exoneration certificate from the Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce (MILCO).62\n\n**Exhibit R-43**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 52.\n\n166.\n\nIn late March 2005, Jorgen Pedersen met with William Canas, Director General of Capital Goods of MILCO, to discuss the proposed proppants plant and, more specifically, the exoneration from VAT and import tax to make the project economically sustainable.63 By e-mail of 1 June 2006, Mr. Pedersen informed Mr. Patrick Millot, Vice President of Corporate Planning, Strategy and Finance for Saint-Gobain's High Performance Materials, that at a meeting on 26 May 2006, MIBAM had agreed to support Saint-Gobain\u2019s efforts to obtain import duty and import tax exemptions.64\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; Pedersen, 24.\n\n**Exhibit C-079.**\n\n167.\n\nIn its 23 October 2006 DAC update, Claimant reported internally that President Chavez had just announced during a press conference the enactment of a Presidential Decree whereby a broad exoneration covering both VAT and import duties, applicable to imported capital goods not currently produced in Venezuela, such as equipment, machinery and spare parts, would be granted to promote the development of the industrial sector. In the same document, Claimant noted that *\"the Ministry of Basic Industries and Mining (MIBAM) has supported us to get an exemption''65* In an e-mail to Mr. Rolli and Mr. Millot dated 2 November 2006, Mr. Pedersen wrote that *\"the new exoneration decree will probably make it more likely we get exoneration and simplify the process.\"66*\n\n**Exhibit C-082.**\n\n**Exhibit C-084.**\n\n168.\n\nClaimant applied for, and was granted on 25 October 2007, an Exemption for Capital Goods, covering VAT and import duties for machinery and other materials, in total 29 specific types of equipment, which Claimant required for the installation and operation of the plant;67 thus, when that equipment was imported, no import tax or VAT was collected. For the rest of its purchases, Claimant had to pay regular import taxes and VAT, thus leading to the net credit balance of VEF 11.7 million.68\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; **Exhibit C-092.**\n\n*Cf.* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b653-54.\n\n169.\n\nVAT credits do not create in themselves a payment liability of the State, but there is a process set out in the Venezuelan VAT law by which exporters of goods can obtain a financial benefit by filing a request on a monthly basis for the recovery of the VAT credits based on the amount of export sales during the month. If the tax authorities grant the request, a special tax recovery certificate is issued, which may be used by the taxpayer to pay its Venezuelan taxes or it may be sold to a third party, who likewise can use the certificate to pay its taxes.69\n\nCounter-Memorial, 57-58 and note 159 referring to Articles 43 and 44 of the *Decreto con rango, valor y fuerza de ley de reforma parcial del decreto n\u00b0 5,189 con rango, valor y fuerza de ley que establece el impuesto al valor agregado,* published in the Official Gazette on 26 February 2007 (Decree No. 5,212) and Article 1 of the *Decreto No. 611, Reforma Parcial del Reglamento Parcial No. 1 de la Ley que Establece el Impuesto al Valor Agregado, en Materia de Recuperaci\u00f3n de Cr\u00e9ditos Fiscales,* published in the OPfficial Gazette No. 37,794 on 10 October 2003. **Exhibits R-41** and **R-47.**\n\n170.\n\nAs of 15 May 2010, Norpro Venezuela had, according to the recollection of Mr. Rond\u00f3n:\n\n*\"notified the authorities of its intention to start the process to recover VAT credits by applying for a special tax recovery certificate based upon export sales, in accordance with the relevant legislation,* [but] *was still in the process of compiling the relevant documentation necessary to support its application.\"70*\n\nRond\u00f3n, 38.

Despite beginning plans in early 2010, the third mixer, scheduled to come online in the beginning of 2013, was never installed.75\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 40.\n\nLarry, \u00b6 32.\n\n**VI.

he invoked the price revision clause in Clause 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract, based on the new tariffs for navigation on the Orinoco River and *\"the significant variation experienced by extraction, transportation, and unloading costs of the bauxite at our Matanzas plant.*\"85 Mr. P\u00e9rez concluded by noting that the new price remained favorable because it *\" correspond[ed to the selling free on board price for the year 2007, and, on the other hand, to a gradual adjustment* [of the price beyond that] *applicable to the present fiscal period.\"86*\n\nClause 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract reads: *\"Las partes acuerdan revisar el precio cuando surja un incremento de manera directa en los costos por concepto de transporte del material desde la mina hasta Matanzas, como consecuencia de la entrada en vigencia de Leyes, Decretos, Reglamentos, Impuestos Nacionales, Estadales o Municipales, tasas y modificaciones de alguna Convenci\u00f3n Colectiva de las contratistas que ejecutan el servicio de transporte de la Bauxita, el cual ser\u00e1 applicable en caso que dicho incremento sea superior al del aumento establecido en el numeral 10.1 anterior\"* **Exhibit C-6,** Clause 10.2.\n\n**Exhibit C-1l.** Quotations from English translations submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-51.** *Cf.* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\n179.\n\nIn his letter dated 4 September 2008, addressed to the Vice Minister of MIBAM, Ms. Isabel Cristina Delgado, Norpro Venezuela's President Mr. P\u00e1ez stated that Norpro Venezuela and MIBAM had *\"agreed that the different contracts for the supply required for the Project, including the* [Bauxite] *Contract, would be structured as long-term agreements.\"* Mr. P\u00e1ez stated that Norpro Venezuela wished to discuss the negative impact of the price increase on the plant and, as a consequence, on PDVSA's plan to substitute imported by locally produced products, MIBAM's investment policies and the France-Ven-ezuela BIT.87\n\n**Exhibit C-096.** English quote from Memorial, \u00b6 170.\n\n180.\n\nOn 9 September 2008, representatives from Norpro Venezuela again met with CVG Bauxilum.88 According to Claimant, they protested against the price increase as being *ultra vires,* but - in the interest of maintaining stable commercial conditions - requested that the new price be maintained through, at least, 31 December 2009.89 In his letter to CVG Bauxilum dated 17 September 2008, Mr. Cid wrote:\n\n*\"Even though* [Norpro Venezuela] *does not share Bauxilum's opinion expressed in the Official Writ with regards to the interpretation and application of item 10.2 of Clause Ten of the Contract in order to justify the Price Increase referred to in the Official Writ,* [Norpro Venezuela] *reaffirms its willingness to discuss with Bauxilum alternatives to guarantee, in the long term, the effective performance of the obligations of both parties under the Contract.*\n\n*Taking into account that the main interest of* [Norpro Venezuela] *is to maintain clear and stable conditions regulating the long-term supply of bauxite under the Contract, in accordance with what was discussed with Mr. Carlos Acosta P\u00e9rez and his advisors during our meeting* [on 9 September 2008], [Norpro Venezuela] *formally requests Bauxilum to consider the possibility of guaranteeing that the [...] US$ 33.80 per ton of bauxite set forth in the Letter be maintained without any change until December 31, 2009.*\n\n[...]\n\n*In any event, while the relevant discussions regarding the revision of this request take place,* [Norpro Venezuela] *wishes to clarify that the issuance of any purchase order of bauxite under the Contract, the payment of any amount owed by* [Norpro Venezuela] *to Bauxilum for such purposes, or the remittance of any correspondence or communication to Bauxilum, as of the Official Writ's date, shall not be deemed as an express or tacit acceptance of the Price Increase mentioned in the Official Writ by* [Norpro Venezuela], *or of any fact, assertion, declaration, circumstance or argument exposed by Bauxilum in the Official Writ.\"90*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 50.\n\n**Exhibit C-12.** English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-52.**\n\n181.\n\nClaimant claims that it received no response to its request that the new price be maintained at least until 31 December 2009;91 Respondent merely submits that the price indeed remained fixed at USD 33.80 per metric ton through 2009.92\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 50.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 68.\n\n182.\n\nIn order to receive the required bauxite shipments for the remainder of 2008 and the whole of 2009, Norpro Venezuela had to submit its purchase order to CVG Bauxilum by 17 October 2008.93 Norpro Venezuela did so and scheduled the deliveries at the increased price in order to secure a continuing supply of bauxite for its plant; however, according to Mr. Pedersen, it reserved its rights.94 In a PowerPoint presentation on 11 October 2008, Claimant also informed MIBAM about the price increase of 2 September 2008, claiming it to be *\"unjustified.\"95*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 52;

Production and Sale of Proppants Prior to the Take-over of the Plant**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nOnce construction had been completed and the necessary permits had been obtained, the proppants plant entered the production ramp-up phase. On 26 September 2008, the plant produced its first saleable proppants, and on 13 December 2008, the first shipment of 1,500 tons of Venezuelan-produced proppants arrived in the US.104\n\nMemorial, 54-55; Pedersen, 45; Larry, 26.\n\n188.\n\nDuring the early part of 2009, Claimant focused on securing a long-term customer base for its Venezuelan proppants production. In the North American market, even though the oil and gas field operators are involved in selecting the type, quantity, etc. of the proppants, the oil service companies are the ones who buy the proppants from the supplier and then pump them into the drilled well.105 Claimant thus intended to secure a long-term supply contract with its biggest client - Halliburton, a large oil services provider - as well as to diversify its customer base in North and South America.106\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 57.\n\nMillot, \u00b6 17; Memorial, \u00b6 58.\n\n189.\n\nOn 1 April 2009, Norpro Venezuela, along with two other Saint-Gobain proppants facilities, entered into a Master Purchase Agreement with Halliburton (the **\"Halliburton MPA\").107** Pursuant to this agreement, Halliburton agreed to a *\"take or pay\"* arrangement, starting with 40 million pounds of proppants for the second quarter of 2009 rising steadily to a peak of 100 million for every quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.108\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 59; **Exhibit C-106.**\n\nArticle 6, Table 1 of the Halliburton MPA provides that Halliburton had to take those quantities *\"or 45% of Buyer\u2019s total purchases of ceramic proppants from all its suppliers, whichever is less.* **\" Exhibit C-106.** According to Claimant, Halliburton thus had the option to buy 45% of its total purchases of ceramic proppants from all of its suppliers upon giving adequate notice pursuant to Article 6(b) of the Halliburton MPA. Memorial, \u00b6 59, note 126.\n\n190.\n\nThe proppants that Norpro Venezuela produced at Puerto Ordaz were stored at the plant or in an external warehouse near the Venezuelan port. Apart from the proppants that were sold on the South American market (generally 60 to 100 tons per month), the proppants were shipped from Venezuela to Corpus Christi, Texas. Once the Halliburton MPA was in place, the vast majority of the shipped proppants was sold to Halliburton under this contract.109\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 60; Larry, \u00b6\u00b634-36.\n\n191.\n\nPrior to the start of production, Claimant brought a group of manufacturing employees from Venezuela to its Fort Smith, Arkansas proppants plant and trained them in the plant's processes. Norpro Venezuela's managers were sent to Fort Smith for supplemental training and also received training on site in Puerto Ordaz.110 In addition, Claimant sent operators, maintenance and quality control personnel from Fort Smith to Puerto Ordaz to assist during the ramp-up phase, which according to Claimant, continued until August 2009.111\n\nLarry, \u00b6 27.\n\nLarry,\u00b628; Memorial, \u00b6 56.\n\n192.\n\nNorpro Venezuela operated using the *\"overall equipment effectiveness\"* (OEE) production method. This method computes the effectiveness of the plant *vis-\u00e0-vis* its overall capacity. According to Claimant, a plant operating at 85% OEE is considered world-class, and its proppants plants routinely operate at approximately 80 to 87%.112\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 69; Larry, \u00b629.\n\n193.\n\nAs regards the Venezuelan plant during the ramp-up phase, Mr. Larry stated in his first witness statement:\n\n*\"[A]djustments are always necessary during the ramp-up phase, and there is always a learning process for employees and management at a new plant. As expected, therefore, the quality and quantity of the proppants produced at Norpro Venezuela improved throughout ramp-up as the plant perfected production processes relating to time and termper-ature. Specifically, by July 2009, the plant was running quite efficiently on a continuous basis - based on my recollection of OEE numbers, it is clear that production had improved. And by September 2009 [...], all of the technical issues normally associated with the start-up of a new plant had been addressed. Likewise, Norpro Venezuela had developed* *the skills of a critical mass of workers in order to be able to effectively run the plant.*113\n\nLarry, \u00b6 30-\n\n194.\n\nIn the 8 June 2009 update to the DAC, it was noted that *\"[t]he project has encountered delay both in the initial start up of the project and during commissioning and start-up phase in achieving planned production levels.\"114*\n\n**Exhibit C-107.**\n\n195.\n\nIn November 2009, the plant was temporarily shut down, the reason for which is disputed between the Parties.115 As a proppants plant is required to run continuously for six months in order to reach a *\"steady state,\" i.e.,* 85% OEE or in the case of the Venezuelan plant a production of approximately 53,000 tons per year, the plant never reached its full production capacity with two mixers. By May 2010, the plant was producing approximately 3,400 tons of proppants per month, which would have resulted in an annual production of approximately 42,000 tons.116\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 65; Larry, \u00b6 31; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 18; Rondon, \u00b6 20. *See* also \u00b6 207 below.\n\nLarry, \u00b6 31; Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\n196.\n\nIn a presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, dated 18 March 2010, Claimant laid out a \" *Venezuela Action Plan,* \" noting that a *\"Specialist* 'SURGE' [was] *underway to address critical VZ issues\"',* (i) *\"Process Stability\"',* (ii) *\"Additives\"',* (iii) *\"Maintenance pm focus\" ',* and (iv) *\"Operator training\"* and that the *\"Key focus of team\"* was to *\"Audit all processes to insure consistency and adherence to control systems\"* and *\"Stabilize, stabilize, stabilize \"*117\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-80; Exhibit R-9.**\n\n197.\n\nIn a further presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, dated 4 May 2010, Claimant noted that \" *Venezuela plant output has declined since mid-March. Problems linked to several key issues\"',* (i) *\"Elimination of refire addition to maintain production levels\"',* (ii) *\"Significant degradation of systems and controls within plant,* \" caused, *inter alia,* by *\"Labor issues leading to low worker cooperation and productivity\"',* (iii) *\"Batch stability impacted by critical changes\"',* and (iv) *\"High level of electricalfailures during April due to maintenance by EDELCA in Puerto Ordaz.\"118*\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-80; Exhibit R-10.**\n\n**VIII. Labor Unrest**\n----------------------\n\n198.\n\nAs of the operational start-up of the plant, the majority of the workers at the plant was not directly employed by Norpro Venezuela (or any other of Claimant's subsidiaries), but rather by outsourcing companies. Already in the 3 February 2005 DAC, Claimant proposed the establishment of a new subsidiary in Venezuela rather than using SGMC Venezuela (one of Claimant's existing Venezuelan subsidiaries), naming as one of the reasons *\"to avoid the creation of a labor union.\"*119 The DAC stated:\n\n*\"In Venezuela, employees of a company have right to establish a labor union if the total number of employees of the company is more than 25.* *With a Proppants projects, the number of employees of SGMC Venezuela would be more than 25 and a labor union would become inevitable. With a new company, we would keep the number of permanent employees limited to 24, using third parties to supply temporary labor for the balance of our employment, a practice typically used in Venezuela.* *We therefore propose to establish a new company.\"120*\n\nThe second reason was that SGMC Venezuela owned 100% of Carburo Del Caroni, a newly acquired company, whose former owner still had significant liabilities to some third parties, including employees, and it was considered that there was some risk that some of the former owner's creditors might sue Carburo del Caroni *\"potentially implicating its mother company SGMC Venezuela\"* in case of failure of the former owner to pay the liabilities. **Exhibit C-057.**\n\n**Exhibit C-057.**\n\n199.\n\nThe labor outsourcing model referred to in the DAC was indeed being used in Venezuela at that time and was known as *\"tercerizaci\u00f3n.\"121*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 14, note 14. Outsourcing was made illegal in 2012, *cf.* Article 48 of Decree No. 8,938, with Rank, Value and Force of Organic Labor and Workers Law, published in the Official Gazette No. 6,076 (Extraordinary), dated 7 May 2012. **Exhibit R-12.** *See* also \u00b6 209 below.\n\n200.\n\nWhen Norpro Venezuela's operations and maintenance workforce returned from training at Fort Smith, Arkansas in 2008, they were informed that they would have to resign their positions with Norpro Venezuela and they would then be re-hired by RH Consultores, a third-party labor outsourcing company.122 Regarding the terms of the new contracts, Respondent's witness Mr. Eduardo Rond\u00f3n stated in his witness statement:\n\n*\"One of the most significant changes was with respect to job security.* *RH Consultores was offering contracts of only six months' duration.* *These contracts could be renewed for a further six months, and then for a third period of six months. After this, there was a prospect of being hired as an employee under a contract of unlimited duration. Thus, it was as if the workers had a series of trial periods during which they were to be employed by the outsourcing company without the same job security and benefits. Although the basic salary was the same, there were some important differences in terms of benefits. I recall that the workers employed through RH Consultores only received an annual bonus of 15 days' salary (the minimum required by law). They received no performance-based bonus. They had their salary increased when required by law but there were no performance-based increases, and I remember hearing complaints that these increases were not even sufficient to keep up with inflation. Although the approximately 30-40 workers to whom this new policy was applied were unhappy about it, they accepted the new arrangement because it was made clear to them by Oswaldo Luna* [head of HR] *that this was the only way that they would keep their jobs.\"123*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 15; Rond\u00f3n,\u00b6[ 10.\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 11.\n\n201.\n\nIn the course of 2008, Norpro Venezuela recruited further workers that were employed through RH Consultores; according to Mr. Rond\u00f3n's recollection, by the end of 2008, there were close to 70 workers who had contracts with this outsourcing company.124\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 13.\n\n202.\n\nMr. Rond\u00f3n further stated in his witness statement:\n\n*\"Early in 2009, rumblings began among the Plant workers about the possibility of trying to get organized to form a union. The main complaint expressed by the workers was the outsourcing contracts, and the consequent lack of job security. [...] The proponents of the union were employees that were very active among the operations and maintenance personnel at the Plant.\"125*\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 14.\n\n203.\n\nBefore the labor union had been formed, some of the workers who, according to Mr. Rond\u00f3n, \"[p]*lant management identified as being the main union agitators,*\"126 had their contracts terminated. Norpro Venezuela also terminated its relationship with RH Consultores and, on 16 June 2009, entered into an agreement with Outstaffmg Corporation, a different outsourcing company in Venezuela.127 As a consequence, the workers were told that their contracts with RH Consultores would be liquidated, meaning that the remaining time under their six-month contract would be paid out, and that they would have to sign new contracts with Outstaffmg Corporation.128\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 15.\n\n**Exhibit ER-2;** Rond\u00f3n, \u00b615; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 16; Rond\u00f3n, \u00b6 17.\n\n204.\n\nThe change of outsourcing companies led to growing discontent among the workers at the plant. Mr. Rond\u00f3n described the situation in his witness statement as follows:\n\n*\"The Plant workers saw this move [i.e.,* that they had to sign new contracts with Outstaffmg Corporation] *as evidence that their contracts could be manipulated and even terminated at any time, with no justification whatsoever. [...] some of the workers were on their third 6-month contract with RH Consultores and, with this move, their hopes that their next contract would be direct and of unlimited duration vanished because Outstaffmg Corporation was offering only 6 month contracts again. The workers began to realize that the prospect of a direct contract of unlimited duration with Norpro Venezuela was not realistic.* *Although eventually all of the Plant workers signed the new contracts with Outstaffing Corporation, this move led more workers to be sympathetic to the idea of forming a union.\"129*\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 17.\n\n205.\n\nA few months later, union organizers managed to obtain the required signatures to form a labor union and created the *Sindicato Profesional de Trabajadores de Abrasivos y Cer\u00e1micos, Conexos y Similares* **(\"SINPROTRAC\").130**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 17; Rond\u00f3n, \u00b6 18.\n\n206.\n\nOn 15 September 2009, Norpro Venezuela terminated the contract of Mr. Luna, head of HR, who had been employed directly by Norpro Venezuela.131 By letter of 10 October 2009, Norpro Venezuela also terminated the contract with Outstaffing Corporation, effective 13 November 2009, resulting in the termination of the contracts of approximately 70 workers at the plant.132 In the termination letter, Norpro Venezuela confirmed that it *\"assume[d] the costs derived from the termination of the Agreement that may be billed by OUTSTAFFING CORPORATION, C.A after November 13, 2009.\"133*\n\nMr. Luna later brought a claim for wrongful dismissal against Norpro Venezuela, which was upheld by the Court of First Instance of Labor Trials, State of Bolivar, territorial extension Puerto Ordaz, dated 14 October 2010. **Exhibit ER-3.** The appeal filed against the decision was held to be meritless, and the decision of 14 Octoboer 2010 was upheld, by the Third Superior Labor Tribunal, State of Bolivar, territorial extension, dated 13 July 2011. **Exhibit ER-4.** Rond\u00f3n, \u00b6 18.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 17. Rond\u00f3n, \u00b6 19; **Exhibit ER-6.**\n\n**Exhibit ER-6.** Thirteen workers whose contracts were terminated in this context, filed a request for reinstallation and payment of accrued wages before the Chamber of Jurisdictions *(Sala de Fueros)* of the Office of the Work Inspector *\"Alfredo Maneiso\"* on 14 December 2009. In the administrative decision of 15 April 2010, Outstaffing Corporation was ordered to perform the immediate r\u00e9installation of all thirteen workers and to pay their accrued wages since the date of their dismissal on 12 December 2009 until the final r\u00e9installation of their work positions, based on the grounds that *\"the dismissals were performed with no authorization for such purpose resulting from a fault qualification proceeding.\"* **Exhibit ER-8.** On 29 July 2010, the same workers filed claims against Outstaffing Corporation before the Judge of First Instance of Substantiation, Mediation and Execution of Labor, State of Bolivar, claiming that the motive for their dismissal was the fact that they had been in the process of negotiating a draft collective bargaining agreement on behalf of the SINPROTRAC union. **Exhibit ER-7.**\n\n207.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the *\"mass dismissal of workers\"* was the true reason for the shutdown of the plant in November 2009 that lasted well into January 2010, not the *\"series of mechanical improvements\"* that Mr. Larry referred to in his witness statement;134 Respondent acknowledges, however, that *\"Norpro Venezuela did make use of the November 2009 Plant shutdown to carry out certain repairs and improvements.\"135*\n\nLarry, \u00b6 31.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 18; Rond\u00f3n, 20.\n\n208.\n\nFollowing the termination of its contract with Outstaffing Corporation, Norpro Venezuela entered into contracts with three new outsourcing companies: Gesti\u00f3n Industrial Bolivar, C.A., Gerencia de Personal Guayana, C.A. and Guayana Internacional Cargo, C.A. Through these companies, half of the plant workers were re-hired. According to Mr. Rond\u00f3n, the other half joined with the SINPROTRAC union leaders, *\"and began staging daily protests in front of the Norpro Venezuela Plant.\"136*\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 21.\n\n209.\n\nThe tension between Norpro Venezuela's management and the SINPROTRAC labor union was not an isolated case in the area, but rather the Ciudad Guayana industrial sector in general was experiencing labor unrest at that time. Workers employed in the iron, steel and aluminum industries were publicly demanding an end to unfair labor practices, one of their main complaints being the outsourcing labor arrangements. In addition, there was a nationwide political initiative to retain control of Venezuela's natural resources and related downstream manufacturing and refining processes in order to ensure that Venezuela would gain from the potential economic and social benefits of those sectors. As a consequence, in mid-2009, working groups were formed who developed and executed the *Plan Guayana Socialista,* aimed at involving the workers in the management and administration of basic industries and, *inter alia,* improving the working conditions.137\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 20, note 57; Rond\u00f3n, 25; **Exhibits C-14** and **ER-9.**\n\n210.\n\nIn Claimant's 18 March 2010 presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, one of the issues was the *\"Heavy focus on safety of away team* [referring to the SURGE team that was to address operational issues]\": (i) *\"All team members at Mara Inn\"',* (ii) *\"Restrictions on activities outside hotel\"',* (iii) *\"Travel to/fromplant controlled\"',* and (iv) *\"Guidelines issued for worker conflicts.\"138*\n\n**Exhibits CLEX-80** and **R-9.**\n\n**IX. Temporary Takeover of the Plant on 24 March 2010**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nOn 24 March 2010, approximately 40 individuals, a group of former workers from an outsourcing company Norpro Venezuela had used, assembled outside the plant, then gained access to it and occupied the operation area of the plant for approximately four hours.139 Among those individuals were, *inter alia,* Mr. Angel Marcano, a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly, and Mr. Asdr\u00fabal L\u00f3pez, a member of the Bolivar State Legislative Assembly and of President Ch\u00e1vez's ruling party.140 Their role within the group is disputed between the Parties.141\n\nLarry, \u00b6 41; Rond\u00f3n, \u00b6 24.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 69.\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 71; Rejoinder, \u00b6 10.\n\n212.\n\nAlso present were Mr. Vicent Acosta Williams Jose, General Secretary of SINPROTRAC, and other leading members of the labor union. In the Request for Judicial Inspection filed by Norpro Venezuela on the same date, Mr. Jose is also listed as the first of five people who were identified to be in control of the takeover; Mr. Marcano and Mr. L\u00f3pez were not among those five people.142 One of the pictures taken by the judicial inspector shows a banner which states: *\"The community of workers (la masa obrera) united in support of our comrades who were fired for a non-justified cause.

They regained control of the plant the next day, but the Parties are in dispute as to the time it took to get the production the plant up and running again.144 According to Claimant, the group also damaged the main gate of the plant, destroyed its lock and blocked the entrance; they further prevented employees from carrying out normal plant activities and forcefully removed Norpro Venezuela employees from the plant production areas.145 The National Guard that Norpro Venezuela had engaged to provide security for the plant did not intervene.146\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 73; Millot, \u00b6 23; Rondon, \u00b6 24.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 69.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 70.\n\n214.\n\nIn response to the takeover, Norpro Venezuela requested a judicial inspection, during which the judge documented the names of the individuals participating in the takeover, identified the leaders of the takeover, and detailed the damages inflicted.147 After the confrontation with the judge, the group left the plant, but several members remained outside and continued to partially block the entrance.148\n\n**Exhibit C-15.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 72; **Exhibit C-15.**\n\n215.\n\nIn its 4 May 2010 presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, Claimant noted that *\"Black Union outsource contract expires May 21\":* (i) *\"Expect unstable work situation for 2nd half of May\":* and (ii) *\"Operator and maintenance experience will again be an issue.\"* With regard to the *\"Key Issue\" \"WorkForce (Unstable => high turnover => influenced by external forces\"* the Plan set out the following actions: (i) *\"Unionize the site - Create 2 unions: One for SG employees, another for outsourced labor => use the unions to reduce external pressure and promote some stability\"',* (ii) *\"Keep the strategy of outsourcing from more than one source\"',* (iii) *\"Lengthen the labor contract from 6 months to 1-3 years\"',* (iv) *\"Study the introduction of an affordable benefit plan to reduce turnover and labor tension\"',* and (v) *\"Promote stability through improved communication with workforce. \"149*\n\n**Exhibits CLEX-80** and **R-10.**\n\n**X.

At that meeting, Mr. Giraud outlined the possibility that Norpro Venezuela enter into a mixed company *(empresa mixta)* arrangement with PDVSA, whereby the latter would retain a 60% interest in the venture.183 The Parties are in dispute as to whether Mr. Giraud presented a *\"sufficiently advanced proposal\"*184 or rather a mere suggestion, which would have had to be supported by concrete documents following the meeting in order to be given serious consideration by Claimant.185\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 102; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 31.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 101.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00a7 23.

Mr. Paez requested that Mr. Giraud present the documents pursuant to which those PDVSA officials were authorized to confiscate Norpro Venezuela's assets, considering in particular that the parties had agreed during the meeting of 26 October 2010 to analyze alternatives to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela. Mr. Paez then reiterated Claimant's offer to provide technical assistance to PDVSA.187\n\n**Exhibit C-122.**\n\n241.\n\nIn a further e-mail to Mr. Giraud dated 19 November 2010, Mr. Paul attached Mr. Paez' letter of 18 November 2010 as well as pictures taken of the confiscated company vehicles and copies of the identification cards of the two PDVSA officials.

He emphasized that Claimant was disposed to meet with PDVSA in order to discuss the mentioned alternatives.189\n\n**Exhibit C-37.**\n\n243.\n\nIn his letter to Mr. Giraud dated 3 March 2011, Mr. Paez stated that he had not received any response to the letters that he had sent following the meeting on 26 October 2010 and reiterated that Claimant had still not received the documents in relation to the suggested *empresa mixta.* Mr. Paez concluded by requesting a meeting to discuss the alternatives that Mr. Giraud had proposed during the 26 October 2010 meeting.190\n\n**Exhibit C-38**\n\n244.\n\nIn his letter to Mr. del Pino dated 21 March 2011, Mr. Paez stated that there had been no communication with PDVSA after the 26 October 2010 meeting as he had not received any response to his follow-up letters. Mr. Paez noted that almost one year had passed since the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela had been announced and, to his surprise, the negotiations that started in August 2010 had stalled. Finally, he reiterated his request for a meeting to solve the dispute in an amicable manner.191\n\n**Exhibit C-39.**\n\n**XII.

Mr. Paez reiterated Claimant's offer of technical assistance and requested that PDVSA Industrial as the expropriating entity pursuant to the Expropriation Decree *\"appoint an authorized speaker to analyze, together with Norpro's representaives, matters related to the future steps of the expropriation process.\"193*\n\n**Exhibit C-41.** Quotation from the English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-16.**\n\n247.\n\nAccording to press reports in *Correo del Caroni* on 13 and 15 April 2011 and in *Nueva Prensa de Guayana* on 15 April 2011, 25,000 tons of bauxite were removed from the plant to cover an emergency of CVG Bauxilum.194 On 25 April 2011, Norpro Venezuela wrote to the President of PDVSA Industrial noting that *\"Norpro, in its role as legitimate proprietor of all the goods that are located inside the facilities, has not authorized or ratified these actions.\"195*\n\n**Exhibit C-124; Exhibit C-125; Exhibit C-126;** Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\n**Exhibit C-127.**\n\n**XIII. The Administrative Expropriation Procedure and Claimant's Notice of Dispute**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nOn 24 June 2011, PDVSA Industrial published the following notifications in *Ultimas Noticias* and *Nueva Prensa de Guayana'.*\n\n*\" 1) [...]; 2) To declare as existent the precautionary order of temporary occupation and operation of the personal property, real estate and other assets including the intangible assets that are the property of or in possession of the company NORPRO VENEZUELA, C.A., and of any other related companies or people, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 of article 112 of the People's Defense in the Access to Property* *and Services Law; (3) to give notice to the aforementioned people through the publishing of this newspaper notice, simultaneously andfor one time, in the newspapers* 'Ultima Noticias' *and* 'Nueva Prensa de Guayana' *in order for them to appear at the headquarters of this Company, located in [...], within the terms of thirty (30) continuous days following the publishing of this notifications in business days and in the time schedule between [...] 8:30 am and [...] 4:30 pm, proving evidence, in each case, of their rights upon the aforementioned affected assets.*\n\n*Also, the interested parties are given notice that 1) [...]; 2) that they can exercise the remedy which is prescribed in article 113 of the People's Defense in the Access to Property and Services Law against the precautionary order; and (3) that in the event that no party appears on their own behalf or through a legal representative in the corresponding authority, this proceeding will be declared as exhausted and the expropriation of the affected assets will be judicially requested.*\n\n*This notice is given pursuant to article 22 of the Law on Expropriation for Reasons of Public or Social Purposes.\"196*\n\nQuotation from the English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-20.**\n\n249.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Claimant notified Respondent of a dispute under the Treaty and requested that *\"adequate compensation equal to the fair value of its investment in Norpro prior to May 15, 2010, be promptly paid by Venezuela pursuant to Article 5.\"* Claimant referred to the meetings held on 30 August, 14 October and 26 October 2010 and stated that *\"Saint-Gobain has made its best efforts to meet and discuss with Venezuelan authorities the terms of an amicable resolution of the current controversy, in accordance with the France-Venezuela Treaty. However, no response has been provided to Saint-Gobain by PDVSA,* /VJUS'4/[ndustrial] *or any other competent Venezuelan authority.\"* Claimant reiterated its willingness to resolve the dispute amicably in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and stated that it was *\"prepared to meet immediately with an authorized representative of Venezuela with the objective of reaching a fair and adequate resolution for both parties.* \" Claimant concluded the letter by emphasizing that *\"in the event that this dispute is not settled amicably within the term of six (6) months starting from the date hereof, Saint-Gobain may refer this matter to arbitration.\"197*\n\n**Exhibit C-42.**\n\n250.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, PDVSA Industrial published a notice declaring the amicable settlement proceeding terminated, \"[c]*onsidering that on June 24, 2011 the press notifications provided for by article 22 of the Law on Expropriation for Reasons of Public or Social Purposes were published, and taking into consideration that the corresponding term expires as of this day, without the appearance of any party or third party, on their own or through a legal representative,\"* and instructed the Legal Department to commence the judicial proceedings under the Expropriation Law for Reasons of Public or Social Purposes (the **\"Expropriation Law\")198**\n\nQuotation from the English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-21.** *Ley de Expropiaci\u00f3n por Causa de Utilidad P\u00fablica o Social,* published in the Official Gazette No. 37,475, dated 1 July 2002. **Exhibit R-4.**\n\n**XIV. Further Negotiations between the Parties**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nOn 26 October 2011, Mr. Carmelo Ursaneta, General Counsel to the Oil and Energy Ministry, wrote to Claimant, seeking to schedule a meeting for 3 November 2011 to discuss the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela.199 Claimant responded to Mr. Urdaneta by letter dated 3 November 2011.200 On the same day, a meeting was held during which the Ministry again proposed to form a mixed company to run the plant in Venezuela; Claimant agreed to consider this proposal.201\n\n**Exhibit C-130.**\n\n**Exhibit C-43.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 113; **Exhibit C-131.**\n\n252.\n\nAs acknowledged by Mr. P\u00e1ez in his follow-up letter of 20 December 2011, Claimant was further requested to prepare a communication including a brief presentation of Norpro Venezuela and the business objectives that had led to its establishment in Venezuela and a summary of the terms of a possible agreement pursuant to which the parties would pursue a joint investment project resulting in an *empresa mixta* in which PDVSA would hold a majority share. In his 20 December 2011 letter, Mr. P\u00e1ez explained that the group was still in the process of analyzing the general conditions and specification of the proposed joint investment project, as well as the modalities and the scope of the technical assistance and training of personnel that the group may be able to provide; they would send the requested communication once this analysis was concluded, which he expected to occur in the first weeks of January 2012.202 According to Respondent, Claimant never provided the requested information to the Ministry.203\n\n**Exhibit C-131;** Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b638-39.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 40.\n\n253.\n\nBy letter to Respondent dated 17 January 2012, Claimant reiterated the existence of a dispute under the Treaty, stating that *\"[d]espite several meeting and communications between representatives of Saint-Gobain and PDVSA to review the status of Norpro's expropriation and future actions to be undertaken by the Government of Venezuela (including the payment of an appropriate compensation in accordance with the Treaty's provisions) during the six-month 'cooling-off period as required by the Treaty, no friendly agreement in relation to this dispute with Venezuela has been reached.* \" Claimant confirmed its acceptance of Respondent's offer provided in Article 8(2) of the Treaty to settle the dispute by arbitration before ICSID and, although it expressed its hope to *\"reach an* *amicable agreement with the Government of Venezuela,\"* it announced that, if such agreement failed, it would, *\"very promptly\"* initiate arbitration proceedings before ICSID.204\n\n**Exhibit C-44.** Quotations from the English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-22.**\n\n254.\n\nOn 24 January 2012, Respondent denounced the ICSID Convention.205 The denunciation became effective on 25 July 2012.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 **114.**\n\n**XV. The Judicial Expropriation Procedure and Parallel Negotiations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nOn 18 April 2012, PDVSA Industrial initiated the judicial expropriation procedure pursuant to Articles 22-24 of the Expropriation Law (the **\"Expropriation Procedure\")** by submitting a claim against Norpro Venezuela before the First Court of First Instance in Civil, Corporate and Agrarian Matter of the Second Circuit of the Judicial Circumscription of the State of Bolivar (the **\"Court\").206** PDVSA Industrial requested that the Court *\"decree the expropriation\"* of Norpro Venezuela's assets and that the interim measure, *i.e.,* the temporary occupation of the plant based on Article 112(1) of the People's Defense in the Access to Property and Services Law *(see* PDVSA's notification of 24 June 2011 above), be upheld. In addition, it requested that Norpro Venezuela, in the person of its legal representative Dr. Jorge Pa\u00fal, be summoned.207\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 **41; Exhibit R-23.**\n\n**Exhibit R-23.**\n\n256.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, Claimant initiated the present arbitration proceedings by filing its Request for Arbitration under the France-Venezuela Treaty with ICSID.\n\n257.\n\nOn 20 June 2012, the Court issued a public notice ordering *\"to summon [...] the alleged owners, holders, tenants, creditors and, in general, any other person who might have any right over the assets owned by NORPRO VENEZUELA, C.A.* \" The Court stated that the public notice would be published three times in the newspapers *Primicia* and *Correo del Orinoco,* in an interval of ten calendars between the publications, in order for the interested parties to appear within ten business days following the date of the last publication or, in case no person appeared within the specified term, the Court would appoint a public defendant in Norpro Venezuela's favor.X208 On 10 July 2012, the notice of summons was personally served to the secretary at the office of Dr. Pa\u00fal.209\n\n**Exhibit R-24**\n\n**Exhibit R-25**\n\n258.\n\nBy e-mail of 17 July 2012, Mr. Carmelo Urdaneta (General Director of PDVSA Industrial's Legal Department Office) sought to schedule a meeting with Dr. Pa\u00fal, who replied by e-mail of 20 July 2012; the meeting took place on 15 August 2012.210\n\n**Exhibit R-26; Exhibit R-27; Exhibit R-29.**\n\n259.\n\nOn 23 August 2012, Mr. Urdaneta sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Dr. Paul as it had been discussed during the meeting.211 The agreement was to be concluded with Respondent, *\"by means of its Ministry for the Popular Power of Petroleum and Mining,\"* and included the following passage: *\"the*  ***PARTIES***  *and their respective affiliates have maintained and shall continue to maintain negotiations in order to reach an agreement in connection with the provisions of the*  ***DECREE,***  *including without limitation any compensation to which*  ***xxxxxx***  *or its affiliates may be entitled.\"X212*\n\n**Exhibit R-30.**\n\n**Exhibit R-31**\n\n260.\n\nBy letter of 4 September 2012, Dr. Paul inquired whether the Ministry had begun the selection of the experts who would undertake the valuation of Claimant's investment in Venezuela, as Mr. Urdaneta had stated during the 15 August 2012 meeting, and attached a revised version of the confidentiality agreement.213\n\n**Exhibit R-29**\n\n261.\n\nOn 26 September 2012, the Court issued a second public notice again summoning the interested parties on the part of Norpro Venezuela under the same terms as in the 20 June 2012 notice; the notice was published on 2, 12 and 22 November 2012 in the newspapers *Primicia* and Vea.214\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 44, note 122; **Exhibit R-32.**\n\n262.\n\nApproximately one year later, on 11 October 2013, the judicial inspection pursuant to Article 57 of the Expropriation Law was carried out,215 and on 13 November 2013, the Court issued a public notice ordering, pursuant to Articles 19, 56 and 57 of the Expropriation Law and *\"taking notice that the relevant proceedings for summoning the defendant have been duly taken\"* that the appointment of the Valuators forming the Valuation Committee shall take place five business days later.216\n\n**Exhibit R-33**\n\n**Exhibit R-34**\n\n263.\n\nOn the same day, PDVSA Industrial requested that the Court appoint a public defender in accordance with Article 27 of the Expropriation Law to represent Norpro Venezuela in the Expropriation Procedure.217 Two days later, on 15 November 2013, the Court issued a public notice appointing Mr. Jos\u00e9 Neptali Blanco as Judicial Defender for Norpro Venezuela in the Expropriation Procedure and ordering him to appear before the Court on the third business day following his notification to accept or refuse his appointment.218 On 22 November 2013, the Court noted that the Expropriation Procedure was *\"currently at a stage of notification to the appointed Judicial Defender\"* and thus decided that the order of 13 November 2013 was *\"left without effect\"* until Mr. Neptali had been duly notified and his summon had been incorporated into the record.219\n\n**Exhibit R-35**\n\n**Exhibit R-36**\n\n**Exhibit R-37**\n\n264.\n\nOn 3 February 2014, Mr. Neptali formally accepted his appointment as judicial defender for Norpro Venezuela.220 On the next day, 4 February 2014, Norpro Venezuela, represented by its Venezuelan counsel Dr. Paul, appeared for the first time before the Court, requesting the Stay, Suspension and Extinction of the Judicial Expropriation Proceeding and challenging the Court's jurisdiction based on the fact that Claimant had begun the present ICSID arbitration proceedings.221 On 12 March 2014, the Court dismissed Norpro Venezuela's request.222\n\n**Exhibit R-38**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 **45; Exhibit R-39.**\n\n**Exhibit R-40.**\n\n**E. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n265.\n\nIn the following, the positions of the Parties as argued in their written submissions and during the Hearing will be briefly summarized.\n\n**I. Summary of Claimant's Position and Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent committed several breaches of the Treaty and therefore claims compensation in the amount of the higher of the Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of the award (calculated at USD 90.3 million as of 31 August 2015), or the Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of the expropriation (calculated at USD 99.5 million) plus pre-award interest, as well as post-award interest.\n\n**1. Admissibility**\n--------------------\n\n267.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's admissibility objections regarding (i) the claims related to the bauxite price increase; and (ii) the claim for breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty, should be dismissed.\n\n268.\n\nWith regard to the claims related to the bauxite price increase, Claimant emphasizes that its claims are not based on the Bauxite Contract as such, but they are rather based on the fact that Respondent sanctioned or could have prevented CVG Bauxilum's conduct and thereby breached the Treaty.223\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 **67-68.**\n\n269.\n\nAs to its claim for breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty that it raised for the first time during the Hearing, Claimant submits that this claim was informed by Respondent's statement in its Rejoinder *\"that what happened between May of 2010 and March of 2011 was not the expropriation, and that the expropriation only occurred in* [March] *of 2011.*\"224 Claimant further claims that its claim is *\"neither new nor untimely\"* because the argument that the expropriation was not carried out in a fair and equitable manner and failed to accord Claimant due process was raised from the outset of the proceedings.225\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 881 lines 18-21.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b630, 44-45 referring to Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 180-184 and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-95, \u00b6\u00b6 125-130.\n\n**2. Breach of the Treaty**\n---------------------------\n\n270.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent committed breaches of\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligations regarding expropriation **(a));**\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment **(b));** and\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to grant full protection and security **(c)).**\n\n**a) Expropriation (Article 5(1) of the Treaty)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent was in breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty **(aa))** as well as subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the same provision **(bb)).**\n\n**aa) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent's conduct prior to the publication of the Expropriation Decree in March 2011 amounted to an *\"expropriation\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. During the Hearing,226 Claimant raised the argument that this conduct was in conflict with Respondent's obligations under Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty. In particular, Claimant contends, first, that the expropriation was not carried out with a formal expropriation instrument and hence not pursuant to a *\"measure\" (\"mesures\" / \"medidas\")227* Second, Claimant argues that the physical taking of the plant prior to March 2011 was not conducted following due process and granting full protection to Claimant's investment, contrary to Respondent's obligations under Article 3(1) and Article 3(2) of the Treaty, and therefore violated a *\"particular undertaking\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \" compromiso especial\")* within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.228\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 83 line 16 - p. 84 line 21.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b638-39.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b640-47.\n\n**bb) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nIn addition, Claimant contends that Respondent is in breach of its obligation to provide prompt and adequate compensation and to specify the amount of compensation on the date of the expropriation pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.\n\n274.\n\nIt is Claimant's position that Respondent expropriated Claimant's investment with respect to the plant on 15 May 2010 or shortly thereafter.229 Claimant submits that, in view of the law, the takeover by the SINPROTRAC union following President Chavez' announcement and the subsequent active management of the plant by the state-owned PDVSA amounted to an *\"expropriation\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.230 Claimant emphasizes that it constantly asserted its rights with regard to the plant, i.e. that it attempted to re-enter it but was denied access.231\n\nReply, \u00b6 25.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b621-24; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b619-32.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission,\u00b6 32.\n\n275.\n\nWith regard to the specification requirement pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty, Claimant submits that, despite the clear wording of the Treaty, Respondent was far from having determined compensation at the time of the expropriation, given that Respondent has never communicated the amount or method of payment to be made to Claimant and has yet to offer any compensation for the expropriation, despite numerous attempts by Claimant to negotiate.232 In particular, Claimant contends that the specification requirement is not met by the mere existence of, or reference to, a procedure in domestic law.233\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 140; Reply, \u00b6 75; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission,\u00b6\u00b6 50-54.\n\nReply, \u00b6 83.\n\n276.\n\nWith respect to the promptness requirement pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty, Claimant similarly contends that the Treaty is very specific about the requirement that an expropriation be accompanied by *\"prompt\"* compensation and that the Contracting Parties left no room for doubt as to the interpretation of the prompt compensation requirement: The Treaty provides that *\"the amount and method of payment of compensation should be specified on the date of expropriation*  *at the latest* \" and *\"payments shall be made without delay.*\"234 Claimant argues that, over four years after the expropriation, such compensation is long overdue and can in no way be considered *\"prompt\"* in accordance with the Treaty language.235\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 137. Emphasis added by Claimant. *See* also Reply, \u00b6 75.\n\nReply, \u00b6 76.\n\n277.\n\nAssuming *arguendo* that Article 5(1) of the Treaty did not require Respondent to make an offer of compensation on the date of the expropriation, Claimant submits that for two separate reasons, Respondent may not invoke, with recourse to its domestic law, that it *\"acknowledge[d] its compensation obligation\"* and provided a mechanism for the determination of compensation in the Expropriation Decree.236\n\nReply, \u00b6 84.\n\n278.\n\nFirst, Claimant argues that Respondent cannot rely on municipal law to excuse its obligations under international law;237 in any event, Claimant considers the domestic rules on expropriation followed by Respondent *\"a State-instigated generic procedure\"* which Respondent *\"takes no steps to effectuate.\"238*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\nReply, \u00b6 83.\n\n279.\n\nSecond, Claimant contends that Respondent's conduct was not in line with the provisions of its own domestic laws on expropriation. In particular, Claimant argues that neither the administrative occupation of the plant by PDVSA on 4 April 2011 nor the judicial occupation issued on 20 June 2012 was conducted in accordance with Article 56 of the Expropriation Law. This provision allows for *\"anticipatory occupation\"* only in cases involving urgent circumstances and only after the (probable) amount of the compensation, as determined by an evaluation commission, has been deposited with the expropriation court. Moreover, Claimant submits that the measures taken by Respondent could not properly be based on Articles 6 and 112(1) of the Law on the Defense of Access to Goods and Services (the **\"Law on Access\").239**\n\nReply, \u00b6 87; Brewer-Carias II, 14-26; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 64-68. *Ley para la Defensa de las Personas en el Acceso a los Bienes y Servicios,* published in the Official Gazette No. 39,358 dated 1 February 2010. **Exhibit R-76**\n\n280.\n\nIn the event that, due to the provisions of its domestic expropriation law, Respondent was not required under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty to make a prompt compensation offer on the date of the expropriation, Claimant contends that Respondent is nevertheless in breach of the Treaty because it failed to make any attempt to negotiate compensation for the expropriation with Claimant in good faith.240 In particular, Claimant submits that (i) it received *\"no direct word from Venezuela concerning the expropriation during the entire period between the President\u2019s announcement on 15 May 2010 and the issuance of the Expropriation Decree on 29 March 2011\".,* (ii) Respondent never acknowledged an obligation to pay compensation; and (iii) Respondent refused to engage in good faith negotiations even after the publication of the Expropriation Decree.241\n\nReply, \u00b6 89.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b634-37.\n\n281.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's failure to meet the specification and/or promptness requirements pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty renders its expropriation unlawful, and claims that the belated issuance of the Expropriation Decree did not rectify the violation of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.242 In support of this submission, Claimant cites several commentators as well as a number of arbitral decisions as authorities *(see* in more detail below).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 141; Reply, \u00b6\u00b677-83; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b658-63.\n\n282.\n\nIn its Reply, Claimant also submitted that there was an expropriation with regard to the Bauxite Contract and the VAT credits it had accrued, and claimed that this expropriation also has to be compensated.243 During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, however, Claimant no longer dealt with this issue as a matter of expropriation, but rather focused on the argument that Respondent's conduct with respect to the Bauxite Contract and the VAT credits was in conflict with its obligations to ensure fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\")** and to grant full protection and security **(\"FPS\")** under Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.244\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 96-100.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 93 line 1 - p. 95 line 18; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 79-88.\n\n**b) Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nClaimant submits that the FET standard provided for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty refers to the prevailing concepts of FET in international law - and not only to the minimum standard of treatment -, including *\"contemporary notions of due process, goodfaith, and legitimate expectations,\"* and that Respondent breached its obligations thereunder with respect to both the takeover of the plant and the Bauxite Contract, in light of any reading of Article 3(1) of the Treaty.245\n\nReply, \u00b6 112.\n\n284.\n\nWith regard to the union takeover of the plant following President Chavez' statement on 15 May 2010 and Respondent's conduct thereafter, Claimant asserts that Respondent failed to follow due process in the expropriation and thereby violated its FET obligation.246 Claimant contends that the expropriation was effectively carried out *\"overnight,\"* with a *\"public and sudden announcement\"* on TV, and that despite Claimant's attempts to negotiate in good faith on the terms of the expropriation, Respondent *\"gave Saint-Gobain* *no indication of what process would be followed to ensure that Saint-Gobain would receive adequate compensation\"* and even *\"failed to follow its own expropriation procedure.\"247*\n\nMemorial, 180-184; Reply, 125-130.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 183; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 42 (with note 116); Reply, \u00b6 126.\n\n285.\n\nDuring the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant included this FET claim in the expropriation claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.248 The Tribunal notes, however, that Claimant thereby did not intend to abandon its separate FET claim relating to the taking of the plant, given that it maintains in its relief sought the request for a separate declaration that Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty.249\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 82 line 13; p. 93 lines 5-7.

In this context, Claimant asserts that the FPS standard requires the State to take all reasonable measures *\"to ensure a secure investment environment,* \" including not only physical but also commercial and legal security.253 Claimant contends that, contrary to this standard, Respondent made no attempt to investigate or take action to protect Claimant's rights under the Bauxite Contract, despite Claimant's repeated calls for action.254\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 186.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 131-142.\n\n**3.

As this is not the case here, the appropriate standard of compensation, including the appropriate date at which the value is to be assessed, is set by customary international law.256\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 197; Reply-Memorial, \u00b6 152.\n\n292.\n\nIn support of its argumentation, Claimant refers to the *Chorz\u00f4w Factory* judgment rendered by the Permanent Court of International Justice **(\"PCIJ\")** as well as several arbitral awards *(see* in more detail below).\n\n**b) Calculation of damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n**aa) Valuation Method**\n------------------------\n\n293.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent must pay full compensation for the expropriated plant and refers to the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment of 1992257 and the commentary on the ILC Draft Articles.258\n\nMemorial, \" 203-204 referring to The World Bank Group, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment* (1992) **(CLA-090),** p. 11.\n\nReply, \u00b6 154 quoting from James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries (2002) **(CLA-027),** p. 225.\n\n294.\n\nClaimant refers to its expert on quantum, Prof. Spiller, who suggests that a third-party buyer would pay the lower of (i) the net present value of the cash flows that a willing buyer could obtain from acquiring a 100% stake in Norpro Venezuela; and (ii) the opportunity cost that a willing buyer would incur if it constructed a similar plant outside Venezuela, which consists of the sum of contruction costs plus the foregone cash flows during the construction period.259\n\nReply, 155-156 referring to Prof. Spiller's Second Damages Assessment dated 18 June 2014 **(\"Spiller II\"), \u00b6** 5; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 90.\n\n295.\n\nAccording to the calculation of Prof. Spiller as of 15 May 2010, the opportunity cost for the construction of a similar plant in the US would be lower than the net present value of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows (USD 99.5 million compared to USD 115.1 million). Consequently, Claimant is of the view that the Tribunal should determine the fair market value of the expropriated plant based on the construction cost approach.260 In any event, Claimant made the following submissions with regard to the DCF calculation.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6157, 187 and 196; Claimant's letter to the Tribunal dated 6 November 2015; Spiller II, Table 12.\n\n**bb) Discount Rate**\n---------------------\n\n296.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied *\"an absurdly high discount rate of 26%,\"* which results in a value that implies that *\"no reasonable investor would invest in a new proppant plant, or add capacity to an existing proppant plant.\"261*\n\nReply, \u00b6 158 quoting from Spiller II, \u00b628.\n\n297.\n\nIn particular, Claimant argues that the *\"exorbitant\"* country risk premium of 13.92% that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied for Venezuela is a *\"desperate way for a State to try to evade responsibility for its actions.\"* According to Claimant, this spike reflects President Chavez's threats to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela without compensation.262 Claimant argues, however, that a State *\"may not use its own propensity to violate the law to reduce the value of compensation for the expropriation.*\"263 It therefore takes the position that the *\"generalized threat of confiscation\"* has to be eliminated from the calculation of the fair market value because Respondent would otherwise be rewarded for the unlawful conduct that this arbitration is meant to remedy.264\n\nReply, \u00b6 161; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 104 and \u00b6 111; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission,\u00b6 55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 162 quoting from *Occidental v.

Claimant argues that one way to *\"check\"* this is to look at the CDS spreads outstanding on countries' sovereign debts and notes that on Prof. Damodaran's list of 63 countries as of January 2014, Prof. Spiller's proposed premium of 4.5% would rank as the fourth-highest after Argentina (14.73%), Venezuela (10.8%) and Tunisia (4.57%) and thus *\"far above the typical country risk premium in a developing country.\"* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, 61-62 referring to **App. BF-66,** pp. 23-25.\n\n299.\n\nClaimant further contends that it also took Venezuela's *\"heightened country risk\"* into account when it assigned a discount rate of 15% to the project in 2006 and undertook significant efforts to secure meaningful support of the Venezuelan Government, in reliance on the fact that the France-Venezuela Treaty had entered into force in 2004.266 Claimant emphasizes that the *\"high risk\"* discount rate of 12%, which included a country risk premium of 4%, was not assigned by the members of the project team (they even added a further 3% *\"to be conservative\"),* but rather served as a *\"company-wide objective measure to consider the potential risks and rewards of proposed ventures in various locations.\"267*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 107, \u00b6 116 and \u00b6 130.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6131-134 referring to the oral testimony of its witness Patrick Millot.

In Claimant's view, the fair market valuation is *\"not dependent on idiosyncratic qualities of the buyer or seller\"',* therefore, it must be assumed that the highest-bidding willing buyer would most likely be a strategic investor that already has a distribution and marketing network similar to that of Saint-Gobain and is thus in a position to accrue 100% of the profits.268\n\nReply, 170-172; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175 referring to Prof. Spiller's oral testimony during the Hearing.

As to the administrative delays invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that such delays have been found to be in breach of the FET standard and claims that it had a legitimate expectation that Respondent would follow its own VAT credit procedure, given that this issue was specifically discussed with the Venezuelan Government before Claimant invested in Venezuela.273\n\nReply, note 381 referring to Spiller II, 93 and \u00b6\u00b6 115-116 and *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

Claimant's Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal:274\n\n(i) DECLARE that: (A) Venezuela has breached Article 5 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating Saint-Gobain\u2019s investment in Venezuela; and (B) Venezuela has breached Articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty by failing to accord Saint-Gobain\u2019s investment in Venezuela fair and equitable treatment, and full protection and security;\n\n(ii) ORDER Venezuela to pay Saint-Gobain the higher of the Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of the award (calculated at USD 90.3 million as of 31 August 2015), or the Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of the expropriation (calculated at USD 99.5 million) plus pre-award interest at the rate of 13.04%, or, subsidiarily, 9.08% per annum until the date of the Tribunal\u2019s Award, compounded annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation;\n\n(iii) ORDER Venezuela to pay post-award interest at the rate of 9.08% per annum from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s Award, compounded annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation;\n\n(iv) DECLARE that: (A) the award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes; and (B) Venezuela may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest;\n\n(v) ORDER Venezuela to indemnify Saint-Gobain in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in France or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela\u2019s adverse measures;\n\n(vi) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(vii) ORDER Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this Arbitration, including Saint-Gobain\u2019s legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID\u2019s additional costs.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 116. The fair market value that Claimant claims Norpro Venezuela had as of the date of the award has been updated in Claimant's Valuation Update submitted on 22 October 2015. Given that as of the Valuation Update, the date-of-the-award valuation yields a value that is lower than the date-of-the-expropriation valuation, Claimant now claims compensation in the amount of the value Norpro Venezuela had as of the date of the expropriation. *See* Claimant's letter dated 6 November 2015.\n\n**II. Summary of Respondent's Position and Relief Sought**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that it fully complied with its Treaty obligations, in particular with respect to the expropriation of the plant, and that Claimant is merely entitled to compensation based on Article 5(1) of the Treaty in the amount of USD 9.5 million, the fair market value of the plant as of 15 May 2010, plus pre-award simple interest at a rate equal to the rate of a three-month US Treasury Bill plus 1.1 percentage points.275 To the extent that Claimant's claim exceeds this amount, Respondent submits that it should be dismissed.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 64. This position has remained unchanged following the submission of Respondent's Valuation Update on 22 October 2015.\n\n**1. Admissibility Objections**\n-------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nRespondent contends that (i) the claims relating to the Bauxite Contract; and (ii) the claims relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty are inadmissible.\n\n308.\n\nWith respect to the Bauxite Contract, Respondent argues that, even if Claimant could establish that the bauxite prices were increased in breach of the Bauxite Contract, this could not, in itself, give rise to a responsibility of Respondent under international law because CVG Bauxilum, an entity legally distinct from Respondent, is party to the Bauxite Contract.276 Respondent maintains that Claimant is unable to identify any legal instrument entered into with the State, or any relevant act on the part of the State, on which it can base its claims regarding bauxite pricing.277\n\nCounter-Memorial, Brief, \" \u00b6\u00b673-74; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n309.\n\nAs regards the alleged breach of the Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty, Respondent submits that this claim should be dismissed as Claimant never raised its *\"new theory\"* with regard to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty prior to the Hearing. Respondent further contends that Claimant's change of position is in conflict with Rule 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.278\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b621-23.\n\n**2.

In particular, Respondent submits that, on the basis of a good faith interpretation of Article 5(1) of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **(\"Vienna Convention\"),** asking for a specified figure on the date of expropriation is *\"not a good faith interpretation and cannot be correct, as it would establish an obligation that the Contracting States could not satisfy except by pure chance.\"286*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\n320.\n\nRespondent points out that the Treaty does not require that the State *\"must, before it announces an expropriation, engage in discussions with the expropriated entity to obtain the facts necessary to determine the precise figure\"* of compensation, and that *\"without such information, it would be impossible [...] to determine that figure in good faith.* \" For this reason, Respondent suggests a, in its view, more reasonable interpretation of the word *\"amount\"* that does not refer to a *\"precise dollar or Euro figure, but rather to the required concept (i.e., a 'sum [...] equal to the actual value of the investments').\"287*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 83.\n\n321.\n\nWith respect to the promptness requirement, Respondent submits that Article 5(1) of the Treaty does not require the State to pay compensation to the investor on the date of the expropriation: While subparagraph 2 provides that \" *[a]ll measures of expropriation which could be taken must result in payment of a prompt and adequate compensation,* \" it is only subparagraph 3, which requires that, after compensation has been determined, *\"payments shall be made without delay.\"288*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 155.\n\n322.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that it fully complied with these requirements. First, Respondent submits that Decree No. 8,133 and the Venezuelan Expropriation Law indeed provided the mechanism for the determination and payment of compensation in the event of an expropriation, consistent with Respondent\u2019s obligations under Article 5(1) of the Treaty and international law.289\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 36-39, 169-170, 172.\n\n323.\n\nMoreover, contrary to Claimant's contentions, Respondent asserts that it has been duly following the mandatory procedures required by the national laws on expropriation to determine compensation, namely Article 56 of the Expropriation Law and the provision of the Law on Access. Respondent contends that the fact that those procedures are yet to come to a close and Claimant is yet to receive payment of compensation is largely due to Claimant\u2019s own failure to participate in those procedures and Claimant\u2019s attempts to have them discontinued.290\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 171, 173-187.\n\n324.\n\nFinally, Respondent also rejects Claimant's good faith argument and submits that, apart from its continued efforts to determine compensation in accordance with the Expropriation law, it met regularly with Claimant to negotiate compensation, including the option of forming an *\"empresa mixta.\"291*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 44-56, 188.\n\n325.\n\nIn any event, it is Respondent's submission that the mere fact that compensation is yet to be paid does not render the expropriation unlawful, taking into account that Respondent acknowledged its obligation to pay compensation and commenced the expropriation procedure in consistency with its domestic law.292 Respondent refers to several commentators and decisions rendered by arbitral tribunals in order to substantiate its submission *(see* in more detail below).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-173; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 159-168.\n\n**b) Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nRespondent submits that Article 3(1) of the Treaty calls only for the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. In any event, Respondent contends that even under more expansive formulations, there would be no FET violation.\n\n327.\n\nWith regard to the Bauxite Contract, Respondent submits that it did not give any *\"guarantee\"* or *\"commitments\"* to Saint-Gobain regarding bauxite supply or price and claims that Claimant is *\"unable to identify a single legal instrument or document containing any so-called State guarantees and commitments regarding bauxite supply or price.\"293* In Respondent's view, Claimant refers to CVGBauxilum\u2019s commercial decision to accomplish an increase in the bauxite price under the Bauxite Contract, even though C VG Baux-ilum's conduct is not attributable to Respondent under international law.294\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 127, 131.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 132-134; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 77-81.\n\n328.\n\nIn response to Claimant's contention that Respondent did not accord Saint Gobain due process in the expropriation, Respondent emphasizes that PDVSA established a presence on the plant after 15 May 2010 only in a caretaker capacity and pending the publication of the formal Expropriation Decree, which was in full accordance with Venezuelan law. Respondent further points out that, after the takeover of the plant, PDVSA met with Claimant for negotiations as soon as possible.295\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 140; Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n329.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that due process does not require discussions with the expropriated party prior to the expropriation announcement and that due process is fully satisfied if there is access to the judiciary to be heard - which is the case in Venezuela. Again, Respondent contends that Claimant could have challenged the occupation of the plant by the union or PDVSA prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree before Venezuelan courts. It is Respondent's position that *\"the fact that Claimant chose not to avail itself of remedies in the Venezuelan courts does not equate with a denial of due process.\"296*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 11.\n\n**c) Full Protection and Security (Article 3(2) of the Treaty)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that an analysis of a breach of the FPS standard requires consideration of whether the investment has been physically interfered with or harmed and whether the State complied with its due diligence obligation, and that the FPS standard does not entail the concept of *\"legal security.\"297* In any event, Respondent rejects Claimant's FPS claims with regard to both the Bauxite Contract and the plant takeover.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 149; Rejoinder, \u00b6 143.\n\n331.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that it was not responsible for CVG Bauxilum's price increases under the Bauxite Contract. Moreover, Respondent contends that an investor, *\"by communicating its discontent with the behavior of a commercial partner to a government representative,* \" cannot create an obligation of the State under international law *\"to investigate the merits of its commercial complaint and make the government responsible for any damages\"* if the investor's commercial partner continues its unpleasant behavior.298\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\n332.\n\nWith respect to the plant takeover, Respondent submits that it fully complied with its FPS obligations prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree. Respondent emphasizes that, had it *\"not established a presence through PDVSA Industrial pending the issuance of Decree No. 8,133, and had the assets been destroyed or stolen or had people been injured, Venezuela very well may have been subject to a claim for non-compliance with its FPS obligations.\"299*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 11 (note 42).\n\n**3. Quantum**\n--------------\n\n**a) Compensation Standard and Valuation Date**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nRespondent submits that, irrespective of whether or not Venezuela complied with the requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the proper valuation date is the *\"date prior to the threat of expropriation,\"* as required by Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty.300\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 241 lines 7-8.\n\n334.\n\nRespondent refers to the wording of Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty, according to which the value of the expropriated asset is to *\"be assessed in relation to the normal economic situation prevailing before any threat of expropriation was of public knowledge.\"* It is Respondent's position that this standard relates to both lawful and unlawful expropriations and is not limited to expropriations that comply with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.301\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 190; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 174 *et seq.*\n\n335.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that, in case of a mere failure of the State to promptly specify and pay compensation, even the compensation standard under customary international law does not allow for calculating damages by way of *\"constructing a 'but-for' world in which the possibility of expropriation is excluded until the date of the award.\"302*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 109.\n\n**b) Calculation of Damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n**aa) Valuation Method**\n------------------------\n\n336.\n\nRespondent agrees that the amount of compensation to be paid should reflect the fair market value of the plant, *i.e., \"the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller.\"303*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 185-187; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 137.\n\n337.\n\nRespondent sees no need to consider Prof. Spiller's approach to compare the DCF-based valuation with the opportunity costs of constructing a similar plant in any detail because according to its experts on quantum, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, those costs would exceed the price that a willing buyer would pay for Claimant's plant (USD 43.7 million plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010 compared to USD 9.5 million).304\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 188; Rejoinder, \u00b6 201; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 138 and \u00b6 204-208; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 63: Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' Second Expert Report on Quantum **(\"Brailov-sky/Flores II\"),** \u00b6\u00b6 227 and 242.\n\n338.\n\nIn any event, Respondent emphasizes that the asset to be evaluated in the present case is a stand-alone plant in Venezuela, not in the United States, and therefore argues that the only appropriate way of assessing the compensation to be paid to Claimant is to apply a DCF analysis, including a discount rate that accounts for the fact that the plant is located in Venezuela.305\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.\n\n339.\n\nWith regard to the DCF calculation, Respondent made the following submissions.\n\n**bb) Discount Rate**\n---------------------\n\n340.\n\nRespondent submits that the discount rate calculated by Prof. Spiller would be *\"low even for a company such as Norpro Venezuela operating in a mature economy.* \" Respondent argues that (i) Prof. Spiller deviated from the risk-free-rate suggested by Ibbotson/Momingstar for long-term projects, i.e. the 20-year US Treasury bond yield as of the valuation date; (ii) he deviated from the general market risk premium (MRP) calculated by Ibbot-son/Momingstar; and (iii) he *\"ignore[d] the empirical evidence establishing that the CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of equity for financial assets,\"* which is corrected by the *alpha* coefficient.306\n\nCounter-Memorial, 234-236; Rejoinder, 206. For an overview of the diffences regarding the US cost of equity components, *see* also the table in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, following 140.\n\n341.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the biggest difference between the experts' estimates concerns the applicable country risk premium. Respondent claims that this premium is *\"far higher\"* than the 4.5% applied by Prof. Spiller, which in fact does not reflect Venezuelan country risk but rather the default risk on US corporate bonds.307 Respondent refers to the calculations of its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores who primarily relied on the Country Risk Rating Model (CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Morningstar and cross-checked their results by using the so-called *\"bludgeon method\"* devised by Prof. Damodaran.308\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 240; Rejoinder, 207 and \u00b6 228. In Respondent's view, Prof. Spiller should at least have used corporate bonds from other emerging countries with the same rating as Venezuela, which would have resulted on a spread of about 9%. Rejoinder, \u00b6 221; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 169.\n\nRespondent submits that its experts used the same methodology to determine the appropriate discount rate for both valuation dates. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 259.\n\n342.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the valuation must exclude the impact of the actual expropriation of the Plant, Respondent argues that this *\"should not be confused with the expropriation risk inherent in any project from its very inception,\"* which is part of the *\"normal economic situation prevailing\"* prior to the announcement of the expropriation of the Plant and therefore also a risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its assessment of the purchase price it would be willing to pay for the Plant.309\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 227.\n\n343.\n\nRespondent argues that the country risk premium must be based on the buyer's perception of risk; the elimination of the risks inherent to an investment in Venezuela would result in *\"the use of a discount rate that a willing buyer would not use and derive a value that a willing buyer would not pay, thereby granting Claimant a windfall that it could never achieve in an arm's-length transaction.\"* In Respondent's view, this would further be punitive to Venezuela and thus *\"impermissible under any theory of compensation in international law.\"310*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 157.\n\n344.\n\nIn any event, Respondent claims that *\"there is no way to isolate, and thus quantify\"* the risk of uncompensated expropriation. According to Respondent, Prof. Spiller did not propose any method to do so in his expert reports but argued only at the Hearing that one could take the difference between the EMBI spread for Venezuela and his 4.5% country risk premium.311\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief.\" \u00b6\u00b6 163-164, 171.\n\n345.\n\nAs to Claimant's emphasis during the Hearing on the 15% discount rate reflected in its 23 October 2006 DAC, Respondent notes that the significance and purpose of this rate remains unclear and further argues that at that time, Venezuela's default risk was *\"at one of its all-time lowest points\"* with the yield of its sovereign bonds being only 2.18% higher than US Treasury bonds. At that point, Respondent submits, the 3% country risk premium could have been justified. More importantly, however, Respondent emphasizes that Claimant took Venezuelan default risk into account in its assessment of the country risk, just like a buyer would in its assessment of an appropriate discount rate for determining the fair market value of the Plant. In Respondent's view, there is then no reason for excluding such risk when such risk increased with the passage of time.312\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 158-162. Respondent further notes that the same documents reflect that Claimant was willing to invest in Venezuela at an internal rate of return of 26.4%. Therefore, Respondent argues that, while still being 3% higher than Prof. Spiller's discount rate, the 15% discount rate is not relevant in this case. Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 132.\n\n**cc) Future Cash Flows**\n-------------------------\n\n346.\n\nRespondent submits that it is undisputed between the Parties that prior to the expropriation Norpro Venezuela received only 27% of the profits, while the remaining 73% were allocated to Claimant's US affiliate SGCP.313 Consequently, Respondent rejects Prof. Spiller's assumption that Norpro Venezuela would retain 100% of the profits as of the valuation date. It claims that a willing buyer would not pay for 100% of the profits because it would not be acquiring the capabilities of SGCP and would not be willing to transfer the profits it expects to earn through its own existing marketing, logistics and distribution network.314\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199 and \u00b6 256 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35);** Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 238-242; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 200-202. *See* also Rejoinder, 244. Respondent emphasizes that, while such a buyer might achieve 100% of the revenues from the ultimate sale of the proppants, it would not benefit from 100% of the profits because *\"a substantial portion of the profits* \" would be tied to the marketing, distribution and logistics functions that were not part of the transfer from Claimant in consideration for the purchase price. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 184-185.\n\n347.\n\nRespondent therefore refers to the assumption of its experts that a buyer of the Plant would achieve *\"at the very most\"* 75% of the profits as Claimant itself concluded in its transfer pricing study that the 25% portion of *\"marketing intangibles\"* was contributed 100% by SGCP.315\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 203 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 5; Rejoinder, 243; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 54.\n\n348.\n\nAs to the bauxite price to be paid by Norpro Venezuela to CVG Bauxilum, Respondent submits that there is no basis for Claimant's instruction to Prof. Spiller to reduce the agreed price of USD 33.8 per MT to the original contract price, given that Norpro Venezuela agreed to the increased price as long as there would be no further increase throughout 2009. Therefore, Respondent instructed its experts to base their calculation on the increased price, escalated by the US PPI-Commodities.316\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u2018210 and \u00b6 256; Rejoinder, \u00b6 251 quoting from the letter from Oscar Cid to CVG Bauxilum, 17 September 2008 **(Exhibit R-52).**\n\n349.\n\nWith regard to the transportation costs, Respondent submits that Claimant's own budgeted cost for transportation from Venezuela to Alice, Texas amount to EUR 110 (converted to USD 154) per MT. According to Respondent, this figure is also supported by Claimant's transfer pricing study.317 Respondent further rejects Prof. Spiller's estimate for the shipping costs within the US and claims that Claimant's budgeted cost and the Halliburton SPA reflect a *\"significantly higher\"* cost, which is why its experts based their estimate on the budgeted cost.318\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 214 and \u00b6 256 referring to the 4 May 2010 Presentation, 2011-2015 Strategic Plan **(Exhibit R-10 / CLEX-80),** pp. 10 and 42 and Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 1; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 195-198; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 1.\n\n350.\n\nIn relation to the capital expenditures, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's assumption up to and including 2018 but argues that annual capital expenditures would significantly increase *\"as the Plant aged and equipment reached the end of its useful life.\"319* While Prof. Spiller included only maintenance expenditures, Respondent claims that expenditures for *\"health and safety, technology or improvements to reduce breakdowns and process disruptions\"* are also required to assume operation in perpetuity and therefore takes the position that all four capexes as foreseen for the claimant's Fort Smith plant should be included in the calculation.320\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218 and \u00b6 256.\n\nRejoinder, 262.\n\n351.\n\nIn respect of the working capital, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's calculation except for the VAT credits. Respondent contends that as of 15 May 2010 Norpro Venezuela had not even applied for the tax recovery certificates and claims that the recovery procedure is usually a *\"lengthy and comple\"x* process. Respondent submits that its experts therefore assumed that the outstanding VAT credits as of 15 May 2010 would have been monetized in 2013 and further VAT credits accumulated thereafter would have been monetized on a two-year rolling basis and thus been part of working capital that a buyer would not separately value.321\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 269-271; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 201.\n\n**4. Respondent's Relief Sought**\n---------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nRespondent concludes that the Tribunal should declare that the expropriation of the plant was lawful and award Claimant compensation based on Article 5(1) of the Treaty in the amount of USD 9.5 million, the fair market value of the plant as of May 15, 2010, plus pre-award simple interest at a rate equal to the rate of a three-month US Treasury Bill plus 1.1 percentage points. The claims based on the bauxite price increase should be declared inadmissible, or, if they were to be entertained, dismissed on the facts and the law. All other claims should be dismissed on the facts and the law. The costs of these proceedings incurred by Respondent (including legal fees and disembursements) should be deducted from the amount of compensation awarded to Claimant.322\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 64. Respondent's relief sought has not changed through its Valuation Update submitted on 22 October 2015 because this submission related exclusively to the date-of-the-award valuation of the Plant, which was updated to 31 August 2015. Respondent, however, maintains its position that the Plant's value must be assessed as of the date of the first threat of expropriation, in accordance with Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty. *Cf.* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 137.\n\n**F. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n353.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the Tribunal's jurisdiction derives from Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(2) of the Treaty. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"*\n\n354.\n\nArticle 8(2) of the Treaty provides:\n\n*\"If such a dispute* [between a national or a company of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, regarding an obligation of the latter relating to an investment under the terms of the present Agreement] *cannot be settled within six months from the time it was raised by either of the parties to the dispute, at the request of the national or the company in question it shall be submitted to either the competent court of the State in which the investment was made or to arbitration by the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Washington on March 18, 1965. This decision is the choice of the national or the company concerned.

During the Hearing, Respondent stated in this regard: 'Wow *we\u2019re here. Now this Tribunal will have to determine compensation as well. That\u2019s fine.\"* Transcript (Day 1), p. 160 lines 17-18.\n\n*Cfi* Memorial, \u00b6 123; RfA, H 69.\n\n357.\n\nSecond, this dispute arises directly out of an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which includes *\"all assets, such as the property rights and interests of any nature\"* and, in particular, *\"[s]hareholdings [...] in companies incorporated in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties,\" \"rights in rem such as mortgages\"* and *\"all entitlements having an economic value.\"326* In this case, Claimant submits that (i) it holds 99.99% of the shares in Norpro Venezuela, a company organized and existing under the laws of Venezuela; (ii) it provided debt financing to Norpro Venezuela, which was secured by a mortgage on Norpro Venezuela; and (iii) it held property, contractual rights with local suppliers and rights pursuant to the law such as licenses and permits.327 None of these submissions was contested by Respondent. Therefore, the dispute between the Parties arises directly out of Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela.\n\nArticle 1 (1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Treaty.

Claimant notes that the ICSID Convention entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995 and Venezuela was therefore a Contracting State at the time (i) it consented to ICSID Arbitration under the Treaty on 2 July 2001; (ii) Claimant sent its notices of dispute to Respondent on 4 July 2011 and 17 January 2012; and (iii) Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration on 25 April 2012, given that Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention only took effect on 25 July 2012.329 Further, Claimant is a national, z'.e., a juridical person within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICISD Convention, of another Contracting State because Claimant is a corporation incorporated and organized under the laws of France, for which the ICSID Convention entered into force on 20 September 1967.330\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 114.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126, 128.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 126; RfA, \u00b6 69.\n\n359.\n\nFinally, both Parties gave their consent in writing to submit this dispute to ICSID. Respondent' consent is comprised in Article 8(2) of the Treaty. The requirements of this provision have also been satisfied: (i) The dispute was raised by a national or a company of a Contracting Party to the Treaty (company incorporated in France) against the other Contracting Party (Venezuela); (ii) a notice of dispute (4 July 2011) was sent at least six months before submission of the dispute to arbitration (25 April 2012) and no amicable settlement has been reached during that time period; and (iii) the dispute under the Treaty has not been submitted to Venezuelan courts by the national or company.331\n\n*Cf* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121; RfA, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n\n360.\n\nClaimant gave its consent in its notice of dispute dated 4 July 2011, which was, *inter alia,* addressed to the President of Venezuela, and reiterated this consent in its second letter to the President dated 17 January 20 1 2.332\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 127; RfA, \u00b6 69. **Exhibits C-42** and **C-44.**\n\n361.\n\nAsa result, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention have been satisfied and that it has jurisdiction to decide over the dispute submitted to it.\n\n**II. Admissibility**\n---------------------\n\n362.\n\nRespondent raises objections with regard to the admissibility of the following two claims raised by Claimant in these proceedings: (i) that, by virtue of the increase of the bauxite price that had initially been agreed upon in the Bauxite Contract between Claimant and CVG Bauxilum, Respondent failed to accord to Claimant fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Treaty and to protect and secure Claimant's investment pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Treaty (the **\"Bauxite Claims\");333** and (ii) that Respondent acted *\"contrary to a particular agreement\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.334\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 165-177; 190-194.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 38-47.\n\n**1. Bauxite Claims**\n---------------------\n\n**a) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nRespondent submits that the Bauxite Claims are inadmissible. Even if Claimant could establish that the bauxite prices were increased in breach of the Bauxite Contract, this could not, in itself, give rise to the responsibility of Respondent under international law given that it is not party to the Bauxite Contract.335 Respondent claims that Claimant is unable to identify any legal instrument entered into with the State, or any relevant act on the part of the State, on which it can base its Bauxite Claims.336\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n364.\n\nIn particular, Respondent contends that the price increases invoked by CVG Bauxilum are not attributable to Respondent under the ILC Draft Articles.337 Respondent argues that CVG Bauxilum, which has a legal personality distinct from that of Respondent and does not wield any executive power under Venezuelan law, cannot be considered as a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles. Respondent further submits that CVG Bauxilum did not exercise governmental authority pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles because, while acting as a commercial company in the mining sector for the benefit of Respondent, it neither possesses nor exercises governmental authority when carrying out its activities.338\n\nCounter-Memorial, 76-106; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 89.\n\n365.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that CVG Bauxilum did not act on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of Respondent within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles; even though CVG Bauxilum is ultimately subject to the administrative oversight *(\"tutela'j* of MIBAM, this is not sufficient for establishing direct State control within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.339\n\nCounter-Memorial, 104-105.\n\n**b) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nClaimant submits that the arguments raised by Respondent do not affect the admissibility of the Bauxite Claims, but are rather related to the merits of the case. Claimant contends that admissibility merely concerns *\"whether the claim, as presented, can or should be resolved by an international tribunal, which otherwise has foundjurisdiction.*\"340 Claimant emphasizes that its Bauxite Claims are not based on the Bauxite Contract as such, but rather on Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, and are therefore *\"analytically distinct\"* from any claim that Norpro Venezuela could have brought under the Bauxite Contract.341\n\nReply, \u00b6 67, citing from V. Heiskanen, *Jurisdiction, Admissibility, and Competence in Investment Treaty Arbitration,* ICSID Review (2013), **CLA-126,** p. 237.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67.\n\n367.\n\nClaimant refers to its position that during the negotiation of the Bauxite Contract, Venezuela made it clear that *\"it controlled CVG Bauxilum and that all material decisions concerning the conduct of CVG Bauxilum would be made at the ministerial level.* \" Claimant submits that its Bauxite Claims are based on the fact that CVG Bauxilum's conduct was either sanctioned or could have been prevented by the competent ministry; therefore, they are claims for breach of the Treaty.342\n\nReply, \u00b6 68.\n\n**c) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nOn the admissibility level, the Tribunal's analysis is limited to the question whether *\"it cannot be ruled out, at least prima facie,\"* that the alleged conduct of Respondent with respect to Claimant's rights under the Bauxite Contract is, *\"if proven,* \" capable of falling within the scope of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty.343\n\nCitations from *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* 246. **Exhibit CLA-009.** Arbitrator Bottini would favor a broader definition of admissibility, under which the Bauxite Claims could be dealt with as an admissibility matter. Yet given the Tribunal\u2019s decision on these claims, he thinks that nothing turns on this observation.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent's objections to the admissibility of the Bauxite Claims are related, to a certain extent, to the common and important distinction between treaty claims and contract claims. This distinction is particularly relevant in cases where the investor enters into contractual relations directly with the State; in these cases, the investor's contractual rights may very well fall within the scope of a bilateral investment treaty. However, the same distinction may also play a role in case such a contractual relationship has been entered into with a State-owned entity, as is the case here.\n\n370.\n\nTribunals in investment treaty disputes are often called upon to clearly distinguish between mere contract violations and treaty violations. In this regard, Respondent correctly pointed to the holding of the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan:*\n\n\"[B]*ecause a treaty breach is different from a contract violation, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant must establish a breach different in nature from a simple contract violation, in other words one which the State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power.\"344*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135 (note 288). *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* \u00b6 180. **Exhibit CLA-009.**\n\n371.\n\nWhile Claimant does contend in the present case that, *inter alia,* CVG Bauxilum was acting in breach of the Bauxite Contract and that such conduct is attributable to Respondent,345 it does not claim that the alleged breach of contract as such constituted, at the same time, a breach of the Treaty. Claimant rather argues that Respondent had a monopoly over the production and sale of bauxite in Venezuela, which is why Norpro Venezuela did not have a choice but to accept the newly imposed terms.346 In addition, Claimant claims that Respondent made *\"specific promises\"* and *\"commitments\"* and thereby *\"created specific expectations,\"* which Claimant relied on in making its investments, and further claims that Respondent *\"repudiated these expectations, failing to address [...] CVG Bauxilum\u2019s actions in raising the bauxite price.\"347*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 169 and \u00b6\u00b6 173 *et seq.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 171.\n\nReply-Memorial, \u00b6 120; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 80.\n\n372.\n\nBased on these allegations, Claimant contends that Respondent breached its obligations under Article 3(1) of the Treaty (Fair and Equitable Treatment) and Article 3(2) of the Treaty (Full Protection and Security).348\n\nReply-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 122, 137-142.\n\n373.\n\nFor the purpose of deciding on the admissibility of the Bauxite Claims, the Tribunal will *\"accept pro tern the facts as alleged\"* by Claimant *\"to be true,\"349 i.e.,* that Respondent indeed made specific promises and commitments to Claimant with regard to the Bauxite Contract, which went beyond general incentives offered in order to promote a general investor-friendly environment. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that, *prima facie,* the alleged conduct of Respondent does fall within the scope of its obligations to ensure fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the Treaty and to grant full protection and security under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. Whether or not the Respondent in fact made any such promises or commitments will be discussed in the merits section of the present decision.\n\nCitations from *Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v US),* Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins on Preliminary Objections of 12 December 1996, (1996) ICJ Reports, 847 (856). **Exhibit CLA-017.**\n\n**2. Claim Relating to Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nDuring the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submissions, Claimant argues that Respondent was in breach not only of the Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, but also of subparagraph 1. Specifically, Claimant contends, first, that the expropriation was not pursuant to a *\"measure\" (\"mesures\" / \"medidas\")* and, second, that it violated a *\"particular undertaking\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \" compromiso especial\").350*\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 22 line 19 - p. 23 line 8; p. 309 line 17 - p. 311 line 21; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 38-47.\n\n**a) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nRespondent submits that the claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty should be dismissed. Respondent argues that Claimant never raised its *\"new, untimely, theory\"* with regard to subparagraph 1 prior to the Hearing - neither in its Memorial, nor in its Reply, nor during the pre-hearing conference or in any pre-hearing request. Respondent contends that Claimant's change of position is therefore in conflict with Rule 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.351\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21-23.\n\n376.\n\nIn particular, Respondent contests that this claim has been triggered by a change of position in its Rejoinder and emphasizes that, already in its Counter-Memorial, it took the position that the expropriation took place when the Decree was issued on 29 March 2011, as Claimant recognized in its summary of the *\"Facts in Dispute\"* in its Reply.352\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 6 referring to Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 2 and Reply, \u00b6 9(c).\n\n**b) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nClaimant argues that its arguments relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty were informed by the fact that, for the first time in its Rejoinder, Respondent raised the argument *\"that what happened between May of 2010 and March of 2011 was not the expropriation, and that the expropriation only occurred in* [March] *of 2011.\"353*\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 881 lines 18-21.\n\n378.\n\nClaimant further claims that its claim is *\"neither new nor untimely\"* because Claimant never limited its expropriation claim to the argument that there was a lack of compensation. Rather, Claimant had raised the argument that the expropriation was not carried out in fair and equitable manner and failed to accord Claimant due process from the outset of the proceedings.354\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 44-45 referring to Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 180-184 and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-95, 125-130.\n\n379.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that even if it had raised a new claim during the Hearing, Respondent failed to establish *\"why this is problematic*.\" According to Claimant, Rule 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules *\"assumes some natural evolution of argument\"* in the course of the proceedings. In addition, Claimant notes that Respondent had the opportunity to present its views in its opening statement and throughout the Hearing as well in its two Post-Hearing Briefs.355\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\n**c) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the provisions relating to written submissions contained in Rule 31 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules are closely related to a party's fundamental procedural right to be heard. Rule 31(3) provides in this regard:\n\n*\"A memorial shall contain: a statement of the relevant facts; a statement of law; and the submissions. A counter-memorial, reply or rejoinder shall contain an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last previous pleading; any additionalfacts, if necessary; observations concerning the statement of law in the last previous pleading; a statement of law in answer thereto; and the submissions.\"*\n\n381.\n\nIn this case, each of the Parties claims that the other Party raised, at an advanced stage of the proceedings, a new issue which was not part of the other Party's earlier submissions, and that it should have the opportunity to duly respond to the new issue.\n\n382.\n\nIn order to give full effect to the Parties' procedural rights, the Tribunal suggested, at the end of the Hearing, that there should be two rounds of post-hearing submissions.356 This way, both Parties had the opportunity to react to what they considered to be a new position of the other Party, and to respond to the other Party's reaction. The Tribunal also suggested that there should be no fixed page limits for the post-hearing submissions so that each Party could elaborate on the issues as they saw fit, but both Parties preferred to have, and agreed on, page limits for both submissions.357\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1267 line 17 - p. 1268 line 4.\n\nTranscript (Day 4) p. 1268 line 15 - p. 1269 line 21.\n\n383.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal finds that, even though it may have been rather late for Claimant to raise a claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty at the Hearing, both Parties had sufficient opportunity to react to, and elaborate on, the positions of the other Party as part of their post-hearing submissions. Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to reject this claim without considering whether it has legal merit.\n\n**III. Breach of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------\n\n384.\n\nIn the following, the Tribunal will consider whether or not Respondent was in breach of the Treaty. Claimant submits that Respondent committed breaches of\n\n- Article 5(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligations regarding expropriation (1.);\n\n- Article 3(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to fair and equitable treatment **(2.);** and\n\n- Article 3(2) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to grant full protection and security **(3.).**\n\n**1. Expropriation (Article 5(1) of the Treaty)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent was in breach of the Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty **(a))** as well as subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the same provision **(b)).**\n\n**a) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nClaimant's argumentation with respect to its claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty is twofold:\n\n387.\n\nFirst, Claimant submits that the expropriation was not pursuant to a *\"measure.* \" According to Claimant, a *\"measure\"* of expropriation or nationalization within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty has to consist of *\"any type of administrative, legislative or judicial act, taken by any of the powers that form the Bolivarian Republic,* \" and that there was no such formal act in the present case until Respondent issued the Expropriation Decree in March 2011. According to Claimant, a State that takes property without any legal instrument supporting such expropriation is not expropriating pursuant to a measure, and thus not in accordance with any notion of due process.358\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission,\u00b6 39, citing from *OI European Group v. Venezuela* \u00b6\u00b6 324. **Exhibit CLA-156** (free translation).\n\n388.\n\nSecond, Claimant contends that the expropriation of the plant was not in line with Respondent's obligation under Article 3(1) of the Treaty to treat Claimant's investment fairly and equitably and hence violated a *\"particular undertaking\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \" compromiso especial\")* within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.359 In particular, Claimant submits that Respondent *\"took the Plant in direct violation of Saint-Gobain\u2019s due process rights\"* and *\"without a measure of any kind establishing a legal framework for the expropriation or an effort to engage in good faith* *negotiations concerning compensation.* \" Claimant contends that the expropriation was hence unlawful.360\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 42 citing the tribunal in *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* \u00b6396. **Exhibit CLA-046.**\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nRespondent submits that the claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty is without legal merit. With regard to Claimant's argument relating to the term *\"measure,\"* Respondent argues that the term *\"has a far broader meaning than that suggested by Claimant\"* and alleges that even if, contrary to Respondent's position, President Ch\u00e1vez' TV announcement were to constitute the expropriation, it would constitute a *\"measure\"* under the Treaty and international law.361\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29 (note 40); Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 7.\n\n390.\n\nRespondent further argues that the reference to a *\"particular agreement\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \"compromiso especial\")* is *\"not intended to mean the Treaty itself, but rather an agreement external to the Treaty.* \" In this regard, Respondent notes that Claimant did not cite any legal precedent for its position and emphasizes that in the sole case cited by Claimant in this regard, the tribunal had to decide on a treaty provision, which - unlike Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty - explicitly included the requirement that the expropriation be *\"carried out under due process of law\"* as a condition of the lawfulness of an expropriation.362\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 referring to *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* \u00b6 386. **Exhibit CLA-46.**\n\n391.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent further refers to: (i) the use of the term *\"agreement\" (\"accord\" / \"acaterdo\")* where the Treaty refers to itself; (ii) the distinct use of the term *\"particular agreement\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \"compromiso particuliar\")* for an external agreement in Article 10 of the Treaty; and (iii) the language of other investment treaties, which state explicitly that the expropriation has to be carried out in accordance with other substantive provisions of the treaty in question.363\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nIn deciding on this first claim for breach of the Treaty, the Tribunal will examine Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty in light of its wording and its context within the Treaty. In the French and Spanish original versions, the provision reads as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *\"Les Parties contractantes ne prennent pas de mesures d'expropriation ou de nationalisation ou toutes autres mesures dont l'effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der, directement ou indirectement, les nationaux et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'autre Partie des investissements leur appartenant, sur leur territoire et dans leur zone maritime, si ce n'est pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique et \u00e0 condition que ces mesures ne soient ni discriminatoires, ni contraires \u00e0 un engagement particulier.\"364* | *\"Las Partes Contratantes no adoptar\u00e1n medidas de expropriaci\u00f3n o de nacionalizaci\u00f3n ni cualquier otra medida cuyo efecto sea despojar, directa o indirectamente, a los nacionales y sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante de las inversiones que les pertenezcan, en su territorio y en su zona mar\u00edtima, a menos que sea por causa de utdidad p\u00fablica y siempre que esas medidas no sean discriminatorias ni contrarias a un compromiso especial.\"365* |\n\n*Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise n\u00b0102 du 30 avril 2004,* **Exhibit C-1, p. 7775.**\n\n*Gaceta Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela N\u00famero 37,896, jueves 11 de marzo de 2004,* **Exhibit** **C-1,p. 332,354.**\n\n393.\n\nThe English translation submitted by Claimant reads:\n\n*\"The Contracting Parties shall not take any direct or indirect measures to expropriate or nationalize or any other measures with the aim of seizing investments belonging to nationals and companies of the other Party, in their territory and in maritime area, except in the public interest and provided that these measures are neither discriminatory, nor contrary to a particular agreement.\"366*\n\nFree translation submitted in **Exhibit C-1.**\n\n394.\n\nWith regard to the first argument advanced by Claimant, the Tribunal is of the view that the term *\"measures\" (\"mesures\"* / *\"medidas\")* of expropriation or nationalization referred to in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty does not in itself constitute any requirement as to the lawfulness of the expropriation or nationalization, but is rather meant to include all acts or omissions by the State that could amount to expropriatory conduct. The Tribunal agrees with the description given by the ICJ in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case:\n\n\" [I]n *its ordinary sense the word is wide enough to cover any acts, step or proceedings, and imposes no particular limit on their material content or on the aim pursued thereby.\"367*\n\nCited in *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6 **459****. Exhibit CLA-071.**\n\n395.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal considers that a breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty cannot result from a State's failure to act in the form of a *\"measure,\"* but only from a failure to observe the three substantive requirements of that subparagraph, *i.e.,* that the measure must be justified by a public purpose, be non-discriminatory and not be in conflict with any particular undertaking or agreement.\n\n396.\n\nWith respect to the meaning of the term *\"particular agreement\"* or *\"particular undertaking\" (\"engagement particulier\" / \"compromiso especial\")368* the Tribunal is not convinced by Claimant's interpretation pursuant to which the term includes undertakings both external and internal to the Treaty. Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, which both Parties refer to in relation to the interpretation of the Treaty provisions, Article 5(1) of the Treaty should *\"be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"369* In the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of the attributes *\"particulier\"* and *\"especial\"* in connnection with an *\"engagement\"* or *\"compromiso\"* entails a reference to obligations arising from agreements distinct from, or external to, the Treaty.\n\nThe Parties agree that a more precise translation of the terms used in the Spanish and French texts would be *\"particular undertaking,\" \"specific undertaking\"* or *\"specific commitment.\"* Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u201838 (note 109); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24 (note 35). However, none of the Parties has made an argument that any of these translation would have resulted in a different meaning of the term. In fact, Claimant stated at the Hearing and again in its Post-Hearing Submission that *\"it's a distinction without a difference\"* Transcript (Day), p. 147 line 10; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 40 (note 113).\n\n**Exhibit CLA-086,** Article 31(1).\n\n397.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Respondent, this understanding is confirmed by the language used in Article 10 of the Treaty (which forms part of the context of Article 5(1), in accordance with Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *\"Les investissements ayant fait l'objet d'un engagement particulier de l'une des Parties contractantes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des nationaux et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'autre Partie contractante sont r\u00e9gis, sans pr\u00e9judice des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent accord, par les termes de cet engagement dans la mesure o\u00f9 celui-ci comporte des dispositions plus favorable que celles qui sont pr\u00e9vues par le pr\u00e9sent accord.\"370* | *\"Las inversiones que hubiesen sido objeto de un compromiso particular de una de las Partes Contratantes referente a nacionales y sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante ser\u00e1n administradas, sin perjuicio de las disposiciones del presente Convenio, por los t\u00e9rminos de este compromiso en caso que este incluya disposiciones m\u00e1s favorables que las previstas por el presente Convenio.\"371* |\n\n*Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise n\u00b0102 du 30 avril 2004.* **Exhibit C-1,** p. 7776.\n\n*Gaceta Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela N\u00famero 37,896, jueves 11 de marzo de 2004.* **Exhibit** C-1,p. 332,354.\n\n398.\n\nWhile the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 and that of Article 10 of the Treaty are not entirely identical in the Spanish version because Article 10 refers to *\"compromiso*  *particular*\" instead of *\"compromiso*  *especial,*\" the wording of the French version is indeed identical *(\"engagement particulier\").* In the context of Article 10, these terms clearly refer to an agreement external to the Treaty, which applies to the investment if the agreement contains more favorable provisions than the Treaty itself, the Treaty being referred to as *\"pr\u00e9sent accord\"* and *\"presente Convenio.\"* In the Tribunal's view, there is no reason in this case to assume that the Contracting Parties to the Treaty intended to assign different meanings to the same (or in the Spanish text, very similar) term in the two provisions.\n\n399.\n\nFinally, Respondent correctly pointed out that Contracting States that wish to make the lawfulness of an expropriation subject to the satisfaction of other substantive provisions of the BIT, in particular the requirement to carry out the expropriation in accordance with due process, usually include an explicit requirement to this effect in the expropriation provision. For example, in the case cited by Claimant, *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* the tribunal's finding was based on Article 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which states:\n\n*\"Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subject to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation [...] except where such Expropriation is: [...] (c) carried under due process of law.\"372*\n\n*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* \u00b6386. **Exhibit CLA-046.**\n\n400.\n\nIn the present case, the Contracting Parties did not include such a requirement in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty (or any other subparagraph or paragraph of Article 5); thus, there is no indication that the contracting Parties nevertheless intended to make the lawfulness of an expropriation subject to the compliance with due process. It rather appears that any breach of an investor's right to be accorded due process, which is included in the FET standard *(see* in more detail below), was to be addressed within the context of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, but was not meant to affect the lawfulness of the expropriation.\n\n401.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the term *\"particular agreement\"* or *\"particular undertaking\" (\"engagementparticulier\" / \"compromiso especial\")* does not include a reference to other substantive provisions of the Treaty itself, but only to agreements, which are distinct from the Treaty. Given that Claimant does not invoke a breach of any such agreement, apart from the Treaty provisions itself,373 the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not breached Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 312 lines 20-22.\n\n**b) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the second claim for breach of the Treaty. It is Claimant's position that Respondent violated its obligations under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty with respect to the requirement of prompt compensation and the specification of the amount and method of payment. In its analysis, the Tribunal will first determine the precise scope and content of Respondent's Treaty obligations **(aa));** the Tribunal will then assess whether or not R\u00e9pondent complied with these requirements **(bb))** and finally determine whether its finding has any impact on the lawfulness of the expropriation **(cc)).**\n\n**aa) The Scope of Respondent's Obligation to Pay \"*****Prompt\"*** **Compensation and to Specify the** ***\"Amount and Method of Payment\"*** **for Compensation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nIt is Claimant's position that the requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty must be accorded their plain meaning.374 Claimant contends that the Treaty is very specific about the requirement that an expropriation be accompanied by *\"prompt\"* compensation, given that it provides that *\"the amount and method of payment for compensation should be specified on the date of expropriation at the latest\"* and *\"payments shall be made without delay.\"375* In Claimant's view, this leaves no room for doubt as to the interpretation of the prompt compensation requirement.376\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 51.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 137; **Exhibit C-1.**\n\nReply, \u00b6 75.\n\n404.\n\nClaimant refers to the decisions of other international tribunals in order to demonstrate that the promptness requirement is a well-established principle of international law. For example, in *Norwegian Shipowners,* the tribunal spoke of *\"the right of the claimants to receive immediate and full compensation,* \" holding that *\"full compensation should have been paid, including loss of progress payments, etc., at the latest on the day of the effective taking* [...].\"377 In *Goldenberg,* the tribunal held that, while international law authorizes the State to interfere with private property when the public interest so requires, *\"it does so on the condition sine qua non that fair payment shall be made for the expropriated or requisitioned property as quickly as possible.\"378*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 138; **Exhibit CLA-057.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 139; **Exhibit CLA-040.**\n\n405.\n\nClaimant therefore submits that payment of compensation should be *\"contemporaneous with a taking\"* or should at least *\"follow it as quickly as possible,* \" and that *\"the passage* *of several months after the taking without the furnishing by the State of any real indication that compensation would shortly be forthcoming would raise serious doubt that the State intended to make prompt compensation at all.\"379*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 139, citing from L. B. Sohn and R. R. Baxter, *Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens,* 55 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 545, 558 (1961), **Exhibit CLA-079.**\n\n406.\n\nIn particular, Claimant contends that the specification requirement is not met by the mere existence of, or reference to, a certain expropriation procedure in domestic law.380 Claimant further rejects the proposition that *\"a sovereign\u2019s obligation to make adequate provision for just compensation in due time\"* can be satisfied under international law *\"by its mere willingness to discuss the possibility of a compromise. To so rule is to deprive the obligation of any meaning.\"381*\n\nReply-Memorial, \u00b6 83.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 55, citing from *Amoco v. Iran,* p. 83 (concurring, J. Brower). **Exhibit CLA-004.**\n\n407.\n\nIn relation to the discussion of an *empresa mixta* arrangement, Claimant contends that this *\"lacked sufficient details to be considered adequate negotiation of compensation terms.* \" Claimant refers to Mr. Millot's testimony during the Hearing that Claimant understood this to be a *\"suggestion\"* rather than a *\"concrete proposal\"* because it was unsupported by documentation that Claimant never received, in particular as regards any compensation for the loss of Claimant's 100% ownership in Norpro Venezuela.382\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 56 citing from Transcript (Day 2) p. 418 line 13 - p. 419 line 9, p. 420 lines 5-9.\n\n**(ii) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nWith regard to the specification requirement, it is Respondent's position that the provisions contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty have to be read in conjunction and should be interpreted to mean that *\"compensation shall be assessed so that the amount is equal to the* 'actual value' *of the investments as of the date set forth in the second sentence of the second paragraph of Article 5(1) and that as of the* 'date of expropriation at the latest,' *the expropriating party shall acknowledge its obligation to make payment in such equivalent amount and establish the modalities of payment.\"383*\n\nRepondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 82.\n\n409.\n\nRespondent contends that clauses such as Article 5(1) of the Treaty merely require that *\"the law or the expropriation decision mention the criteria and procedures that will allow to assess compensation.\"384*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 156, citing from J.-P. Laviec, PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF INVESTMENTS, p. 207, **Exhibit RL-155.**\n\n410.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's interpretation of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty that the precise figure constituting the *\"amount\"* must be determined on the date an intention to expropriate is announced, Respondent makes two arguments. First, Respondent refers to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention and alleges that asking for a specified figure on the date of expropriation is *\"not a good faith interpretation and cannot be correct, as it would establish an obligation that the Contracting States could not satisfy except by pure chance.* \" Respondent further points out that the Treaty does not require that the State *\"must, before it announces an expropriation, engage in discussions with the expropriated entity to obtain the facts necessary to determine the precise figure that equates to the actual value of the assets in question\"* and that *\"without such information, it would be impossible [...] to determine that figure in goodfaith.\"385*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 83-84.\n\n411.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that an interpretation as proposed by Claimant would lead to *\"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\"* results and hence would conflict with Article 32 lit. b) of the Vienna Convention, as neither French nor Venezuelan expropriation law requires compensation to be determined at the time the expropriation process is initiated - which would place each of the Contracting States in breach of their Treaty obligations.386\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87.\n\n412.\n\nAgainst this background, Respondent suggests what is, in its view, more reasonable interpretation of the word *\"amount,* \" which does not refer to a *\"precise dollar or Euro figure, but rather to the required concept (i.e., a* 'sum [...] equal to the actual value of the investments').\"387\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 83.\n\n413.\n\nWith respect to the promptness requirement, Respondent submits that neither the case law cited by Claimant nor, by its clear terms, Article 5(1) of the Treaty require the State to pay compensation to the investor on the date of the expropriation. While subparagraph 2 provides that \"[a]*ll measures of expropriation which could be taken must result in payment of a prompt and adequate compensation,* \" it is only subparagraph 3, which requires that, after compensation has been determined, *\"payments shall be made without delay.\"388* In determining whether or not payment of *\"prompt and adequate compensation\"* is made *\"without delay,\" \"the particularities of each national legislation, the eventual delays caused by internal remedies, and the specificity of each situation\"* are to be taken into account.389 Further, Respondent argues that it should be taken into consideration whether the *\"State has made good faith efforts to comply with its obligation to pay compensation.\"*390\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 167; Rejoinder, 155.\n\nRejoinder, **K** 157, citing from J.-P.

In determining the precise requirements with respect to compensation under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the Tribunal will first and foremost take into account the wording of the Treaty provisions and their systematic context.\n\n415.\n\nIn the French and Spanish original versions, Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty read:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *\"Toutes les mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient \u00eatre prises doivent donner lieu au paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate dont le montant, \u00e9gal \u00e0 leur valeur r\u00e9elle des investissements concern\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la situation \u00e9conomique normale pr\u00e9valant avant que toute menace d'expropriation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique.*  *Cette indemnit\u00e9, son montant et ses modalit\u00e9s de versement sont fix\u00e9s au plus tard \u00e0 la date d'expropriation. Cette indemnit\u00e9 est effectivement r\u00e9alisable, vers\u00e9e sans retard et librement transf\u00e9rable.

The sum of this compensation should be equal to the actual value of the investments concerned, and must be assessed in relation to the normal economic situation prevailing before any threat of expropriation was of public knowledge.*\n\n*The amount and method ofpayment for compensation should be specified on the date of expropriation at the latest. This compensation is indeed realizable, payments shall be made without delay and shall be freely transferable. The compensation will accrue interest calculated at the appropriate market interest rate until the date of payment.\"393*\n\n**Exhibit C-1,** p. 7775.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Treaty requires not only the payment of *\"prompt\"* compensation, but according to the unusually strict wording of subparagraph 3, that the amount for compensation (\"[c]*ette indemnit\u00e9, son montant*\" / \"[e]*sa indemnizaci\u00f3n, su monto\")* be specified - or more precisely: fixed *(\"fix\u00e9s\"/ \"fijados\") -* on the date of expropriation at the latest. The ordinary meaning of the language used in subparagraph 3 suggests that the expropriating State indeed has to indicate a specified figure constituting the amount of compensation at the time of the expropriation; there is no indication that the term *\"amount\" (\"montant\"/\"monto\")* refers only to a certain concept or method of calculation. The sole reference to *\"method\" (\"modalit\u00e9s\"/\"modalidades\")* in subparagraph 3 is made with respect to *\"payment\" (\"versement\"/\"pago\"),* implying that *\"payment of a prompt and adequate compensation\" (\"paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate\"/\"pago de una pronta y adecuada indemnizaci\u00f3n\")* as referred to in subparagraph 2 does not require payment to be made to the investor on the very date of the expropriation.\n\n418.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that subparagraph 3 has to be read in conjunction with subparagraph 2, which indeed provides more details as to the calculation of the compensation *(\"d'une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate dont le montant [...]\"/\"una pronta y adecuada indemnizaci\u00f3n cuyo monto* [...]\"), this connection does not imply in any way that the term *\"amount\" (\"montant\"/\"monto\")* in subparagraph 3 has to be interpreted restrictively in terms of requiring only an acknowledgment of the applicable concept of compensation. Rather, subparagraph 3 contains a more precise specification further to the widely used term *\"prompt\" (\"prompte\"/\"pronta\")* in subparagraph 2.\n\n419.\n\nIn light of the unambiguous wording and structure of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds that, *prima facie,* subparagraph 3 required Respondent to specify a precise figure constituting the *\"amount\" (\"montant\" / \"monto\")* of compensation at the time of the expropriation. Subsequently, the amount of compensation as fixed *(\"fix\u00e9s\" / \"fijados\"')* on the date of expropriation had to be paid *\"without delay\" (\"sans retard\" / \" sin retraso\").* Only if both of these requirements were satisfied, the compensation could be considered *\"prompt\"* within the specific meaning intended by the Contracting Parties in to Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty.\n\n420.\n\nAs indicated above, Respondent raised objections to this interpretation of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal considers, however, that none of these objections is compelling. In particular, to require the State to specify a certain figure constituting the amount of compensation on the date of the expropriation neither contravenes the principle of good faith interpretation as set out in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, nor does it lead to *\"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\"* results within the meaning of Article 32 lit. b) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n421.\n\nThe requirement of fixing the exact amount of compensation on the date of expropriation is not an absurd ambition, as Respondent intends to demonstrate. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the date of the expropriation (i.e. the formal expropriation decision and/or seizure of the asset) does not (necessarily) correspond to the date on which the expropriation procedure is initiated,394 this does not mean that the State may *de facto* take the property of the investor in the meantime and thereby circumvent the provision of the Treaty. In many jurisdictions, including France and Venezuela as Respondent correctly pointed out, the formal expropriation decision and the taking of the asset do not commence but rather occur only at the end of the expropriation procedure. In the course of such an expropriation procedure, the State usually asserts and ensures that the requirements of a lawful expropriation are met, including the verification of a sufficient public purpose as well as the fixation of an adequate amount for compensation, based on a proper valuation of the asset.\n\n*Cf* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87 (with note 187).\n\n422.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is apparent that the drafters of Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty indeed envisaged such a design of the expropriation procedure as it is in place in both Contracting States. This does not mean, however, that the term *\"amount\"* refers only to the concept to be applied in the course of such an expropriation procedure, but rather that the expropriation procedure has to be carried out prior to the taking of the asset.\n\n423.\n\nThe fact that the Treaty does not provide for detailed procedural rules as to how the expropriating State shall obtain the facts necessary to determine the precise figure to be fixed on the date of the expropriation does not conflict with the proposed interpretation of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Subparagraphs 2 and 3 merely stipulate the fundamental requirements, which have to be met in case of an expropriation. The Treaty is not designed to establish a detailed expropriation procedure. Rather, it is up to the Contracting States to ensure that the expropriation proceedings are conducted in conformity with the fundamental Treaty requirements.\n\n424.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal is of the view that it does not have to examine whether Venezuelan law actually implements a standard expropriation procedure as set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty. First, Claimant has not raised a claim that the Expropriation Law does not conform to the requirements of the Treaty. In addition, any agreement in bilateral investment treaties would be redundant if the Parties were only to agree on protection standards which are already part of their respective legal systems. Interpreting Article 5(1) of the Treaty as providing stricter expropriation standards than the Venezuelan Expropriation Law (and possibly also the French equivalent) would therefore not produce *\"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\"* results within the meaning of Article 32 lit. b) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n425.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the compensation requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 required the Respondent to specify a precise figure constituting the amount of compensation on the date of the expropriation.\n\n**bb) Compliance with, or breach of, the Compensation Requirements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nWhether or not Respondent complied with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) sub-paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty depends, to a certain extent, on the date on which the expropriation of the plant took place, z'.e., the date of expropriation within the meaning of subparagraph 3. This question will hence be examined first **(i).** On this basis, Respondent's conduct will then be assessed **(ii)**\n\n**(i) Date of Expropriation of the Plant**\n------------------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe Parties' positions differ as to the date on which the expropriation of the plant occurred. In particular, it is in dispute whether the expropriation was effected only once the Expropriation Decree was formally issued or whether the takeover of the plant on 15 May 2010 already amounted to an expropriation within the meaning of the Treaty. Although the Parties exclusively deal with this issue as a matter of facts, it appears that it also involves questions of law.\n\n**(1) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nIt is Claimant's position that the expropriation with respect to the plant was effected on 15 May 2010. Claimant submits that the takeover following President Ch\u00e1vez' announcement and the subsequent active management of the plant by PDVSA amounted to an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.395\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n\n429.\n\nClaimant submits that, following the one-day takeover of the plant on 24 March 2010, it was President Ch\u00e1vez\u2019 announcement that caused local workers to take over the plant on 15 May 2010, the effect of which was to force out Norpro Venezuela\u2019s management. Further, Claimant submits that there were politicians among those who effected the plant takeover - National Assemblyman Angel Marcano, the President of the Sub-commission on Basic Industries, and Representative Asdr\u00fabal L\u00f3pez, the President of the Commission on Social Development - acting on behalf of the State and pursuant to the instructions of the President. Therefore it was President Ch\u00e1vez who practically *\"commanded the takeover of the Plant by union members and sympathizers\"* on 15 May 2010.396 As Claimant never regained control of its investment after that date, the Expropriation Decree published on 29 March 2011 simply formally notified what the Government had already effected.397\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 134.\n\n430.\n\nWith respect to the status of the plant after these events, Claimant contends that PDVSA took control over the plant in order to *\"coordinate the expropriation process.\"398* In this context, Claimant refers to various circumstances of PDVSA's occupation of the plant, including *inter alia:*\n\n- documents authored by PDVSA reflecting that PDVSA was carrying out the ongoing expropriation process on behalf of Respondent, in particular the minutes of meetings between PDVSA and Norpro Venezuela dated 2 and 8 June 2010 which were entitled *\"Proceso de Nacionalizaci\u00f3n Norpro Venezuela, C.A. \";399*\n\n- changes in the appearance of the plant and its personnel, with the PDVSA flag flying in tandem with the Venezuelan flag over the plant and workers wearing PDVSA uniforms;400 and\n\n- PDVSA's efforts to get the plant back into operation, e.g., its attempt to ready the plant to produce so-called green proppants.401\n\nReply, \u00b6 30; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 23-32.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 24.

In Claimant's view, the burden should not be on the foreign company after having *\"witnessed the President's order and been denied access to its property, to do more in order to preserve its rights.\"402*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b629, 31.\n\n432.\n\nFinally, Claimant emphasizes that it constantly asserted its rights with regard to the plant, *i.e.,* that it attempted to re-enter the plant but was denied access, as evidenced by the judicial inspections it initiated on 17 May 2010 and again on 5 August 2010 as well as the letters that Norpro Venezuela's President sent to PDVSA's General Counsel on 18 November 2010 and to the President of PDVSA Industrial on 25 April 2011.403\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b632 referring to **Exhibit C-20, Exhibit C-119, Exhibit C-122** and **Exhibit C-127.**\n\n**(2) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nRespondent submits that the date of expropriation within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty was 29 March 2011, *i.e.,* the date of the issuance of the Expropriation Decree, which triggered the procedures under the Venezuelan Expropriation Law.404 In response to Claimant's assertions with respect to the takeover of the plant on 15 May 2010 and the events thereafter, Respondent contends, first, that it was the labor union SINPROTRAC, not the State, which occupied the Claimant's plant both on 24 March and on 15 May 2010, and, second, that PDVSA's presence at the plant thereafter was a *\"responsible and necessary action pending the expropriation decree to assure the safety and security of the plant\"* after Norpro Venezuela\u2019s management had effectively abandoned it.405\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87 (with note 187).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 26 (with note 68); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 60-65.\n\n434.\n\nWith regard to the first point, Respondent denies that there was an intrinsic causal link between President Chavez' *\"announcement\"* and the takeover of the plant. Respondent emphasizes that it was union discontent, which caused Norpro Venezuela\u2019s name to appear in the *Plan Guayana Socialista 2009-2019,* ultimately leading to the proposal that Norpro Venezuela pass to State control, which President Chavez read live on television on 15 May 2010. Moreover, Respondent contends that it was actually a phone call from shift workers at the plant to SINPROTRAC\u2019s leadership reporting that Plant management was removing laptops and documents from the premises, which prompted union officials and Norpro Venezuela\u2019s ex-workers to act on 15 May 2010. Against this background, Respondent argues that the 15 May 2010 plant takeover cannot be considered as an act of the State.406\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b612-13.\n\n435.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contests Claimant's allegations that certain individuals among those that effected the plant takeover were actually acting on behalf or under the instructions of Respondent. Respondent argues that the mere fact that politicians sympathetic to the plight of the workers were present does not mean that Respondent itself took over the plant.407\n\nRejoinder, \u00b616: Counter-Memorial, note 68.\n\n436.\n\nWith respect to the second point, i.e., PDVSA's presence on the plant after the events of 15 May 2010, Respondent maintains that PDVSA's presence prior to the publication of the expropriation decree was arranged for the purpose of ensuring plant safety and stability, as a *\"caretaker.\"* Respondent contends that Norpro Venezuela effectively abandoned the plant after 15 May 2010, and that the plant was *\"in the hands of the union and the workers who took over on May 15, without supervision.* \" Respondent asserts that these were legitimate grounds for concern regarding worker safety and the proper operation of the plant\u2019s equipment.408\n\nRejoinder, 20-22; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 25.\n\n437.\n\nIn this context, Respondent emphasizes that Claimant neither challenged the legal foundation of PDVSA's presence nor did it demand return of the plant or request access to it after 15 May 2010.409 In particular, Respondent contends that *\"none of the other letters that were sent on May 17, 2010 or thereafter demanded the return of the Plant,* \" and that Claimant never raised such a claim during the meetings of 30 August 2010 and of 14 October 2010 between Claimant and PDVSA. It is therefore Respondent's position that *\"PDVSA Industrial was at the Plant because Norpro Venezuela was not present and the Plant posed risks to the workers and community.\"410*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b623; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 60 (with note 108), \u00b6\u00b6 42-51.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50.\n\n438.\n\nAt the same time, Respondent does not contest that, in the aftermath of 15 May 2010, *\"there*  *was* *a 'process of nationalization' to the extent that, as everyone recognized, the Plant had not been expropriated but that it would be transferred to State control in the future.\"* Respondent submits that the Parties also recognized (i) that a formal expropriation decree was being drafted at that time; (ii) that the decree was supposed to mark the starting point of the expropriation procedure under Venezuelan law; and (iii) that the Parties would consider, in the meantime, alternatives to expropriation, including the formation of a mixed company, with PDVSA as a majority shareholder and the Claimant holding a minority stake.411\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 61. Emphasis in the original.\n\n439.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that this ongoing nationalization process was not in conflict with PDVSA's *\"caretaker\"* role. Respondent points out that PDVSA had *\"instructions from the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to carry out the transfer of Norpro to State control,* \" but *\"until the publication of the Decree, it may not act or intervene in Norpro. Its presence at the plant is in response to the necessity to enter into possession formally, once the Decree is published.\"412*\n\nRejoinder, 32 (note 135), citing from Draft Minutes of a Meeting among PDVSA Industrial S.

Canada* noted, the term *\"expropriation\"* has to be interpreted *\"in light of the whole body of state practice, treaties and judicial interpretations of that term in international law cases.* \" The tribunal went on to find that, in general,\n\n*\"the term* 'expropriation' *carries with it the connotation of a* 'taking' *by a governmental-type authority of a person\u2019s* 'property' *with a view to transferring ownership of that property to another person, usually the authority that exercised its de jure or de facto power to do the* 'taking'.\"413\n\n*SD* *Myers v. Canada \u00b6* 280. **Exhibit RL-119.**\n\n442.\n\nThese considerations are confirmed, for example, by the tribunal in *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* which described (direct) expropriation as *\"resulting from a deliberate formal act of taking\"*414 and referred to the reasoning of the tribunal in *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* which in turn stated that a direct expropriation is characterized by a *\"transfer* [of the investor's] *proprietary rights in its investment to the State or to a third party.\"415*\n\n*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* \u00b6700. **Exhibit CLA-069.**\n\n*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* \u00b6\u00b620.21. **Exhibit CLA-039.**\n\n443.\n\nAgainst this background, the term *\"expropriation\"* is clearly characterized by a number of elements, including: (i) the act of a State; (ii) in relation to a person's property; (iii) consisting in a *de jure* or *de facto* taking of the property; and (iv) to the benefit of the State or of a third party.\n\n444.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties as to the applicable standard with regard to the definition of the legal term *\"expropriation,\"* as they did not deal with this issue in their submissions. On the contrary, the Parties agree that, at some point, Claimant was expropriated within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Rather, the Parties' disagreement relates to the exact point in time at which the expropriation occurred.\n\n445.\n\nWith respect to the elements of an expropriation referred to above in paragraph 443, Claimant contends that all those criteria were already fulfilled when the plant was taken over on 15 May 2010 or, at least, shortly thereafter.416 Respondent, in contrast, argues that: (i) the takeover on 15 May 2010 was not an act of State; and (ii) the subsequent occupation of the plant by PDVSA was not a taking of the asset to the benefit of Respondent but rather a compelling necessity imposed on Respondent by Claimant's abandonment of the plant, which required PDVSA's presence in order to restore and ensure safety on the plant, as a *\"caretaker,* \" not as the *\"owner\"* of the plant.417 In this context, Respondent emphasizes that PDVSA had instructions *\"not* [to] *act or intervene in Norpro\" (\"no puede actuar o intervenir en Norpro\").418* In conclusion, it is Respondent's position that the criteria of an *\"expropriation\"* were not fulfilled until the expropriation decree was formally issued on 29 March 2011.419\n\n*Cf.* Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\n*Cf.* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60.\n\nRejoinder, 32 (note 135), citing from Draft Minutes of a Meeting among PDVSA Industrial S.

This general principle is clearly reflected, *inter alia,* in Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles which states that, as an exception from that principle, the\n\n*\"conduct of a person or group ofpersons shall* [only] *be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct.\"421*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), **Exhibit CLA-044.** *Cf* J. Crawford, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION\u2019S ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY: INTRODUCTION, TEXT AND COMMENTARIES (2002), **Exhibit CLA-119** and **Exhibit RL-021,** p. 110.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it plausible that there was a certain causal link between President Chavez' TV announcement on 15 May 2010 and the plant takeover. As Mr. Eduardo Rondon testified, the *\"members of the SINPROTRAC union\"* who took over the plant on 15 May 2010 *\"came directly from the event at which President Chavez had spoken.*\"422 While the takeover may have further been triggered by Norpro Venezuela management's removal of documents and computers from the plant and the tensions between the management of the plant and the unions,423 the Tribunal is of the view that the union members and sympathizers would most probably not have taken over the plant on 15 May 2010 if President Chavez had not stated on this very day that the plant would eventually be handed over to PDVSA. The President's announcement of this prospect therefore appears to have been *conditio sine qua non* of (and therefore a causal factor in relation to) the plant takeover.\n\nRondon, \u00b628.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b615, 137, 140 (note 352); Rejoinder, \u00b68 *etseq.,* 14.\n\n450.\n\nPlain causality, however, does not establish State responsibility under international law. Conduct of private persons can be attributed to the State only if there exists *\"a specific factual relationship between the person or entity engaging in the conduct and the State.\"424* The Tribunal is of the view that there was no such specific factual relationship between President Chavez' announcement and the takeover of the plant carried out by union members and sympathizers.\n\nJ. Crawford, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION\u2019S ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY: INTRODUCTION, TEXT AND COMMENTARIES (2002), **Exhibit CLA-119** and **Exhibit RL-021,** p. 110.\n\n451.\n\nDuring the broadcast on 15 May 2010, President Chavez read out and approved a number of proposals prepared by the *Plan Guayana Socialista* working groups, an association of unions in the Guayana region.425 One of these recommendations was related to Norpro Venezuela. President Ch\u00e1vez read out and approved this proposal as follows:\n\n*\"Discuss with PDVSA the purchase of the Proppants produced and commercialized by the company Norpro Venezuela, a product produced with Bauxite, Cornstarch and water, used for mud and drilling. It is suggested here [in the document] that should it become necessary, this company should become state-controlled and transferred to the hands of PDVSA. Let the company Norpro Venezuela become state controlled and transfer it to the hands of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela.\"426*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 19; Counter-Memorial, **\u00b6** 24.\n\n*Record and Transcript of Opinion Programs and Special Transmissions of Venezuelan Tv,* TVRADIO 2021, C. A., May 15, 2010 (English translation), **Exhibit R-15.** The original announcement was made in Spanish, *see Grabaci\u00f3n y Transcripci\u00f3n de Programas de Opini\u00f3n y Transmisiones Especiales de la Tv Venezolana,* TVRADIO 2021, C. A., 15 de mayo de 2010, **Exhibit R-15,** p.14. In relevant parts, the announcement reads as follows:\n\n*\"Consultar con PDVSA sobre la compra de Propan producido y comercializado por empresa Norpro de Venezuela, producto elaborado con Bauxita, Almid\u00f3n y agua utilizado para lodos y perforaciones. De ser necesario -aqu\u00ed se sugiere - la estatizaci\u00f3n y transferir esta empresa a manos de PDVSA. Estat\u00edcese la empresa Norpro de Venezuela y p\u00e1sese a manos de Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela.\"*\n\n452.\n\nWithout context, the President's statement *\"Estat\u00edcese la empresa Norpro de Venezuela y p\u00e1sese a manos de Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela\"427* could indeed be understood as an invitation, or even a command, addressed to all listeners, including the members of the union and sympathizers, to take over the plant. Taking into account the aforementioned circumstances, however, it appears that the language used by President Ch\u00e1vez was meant to express and emphasize his general approval and affirmation of the working groups' proposals. President Ch\u00e1vez' statements, including the approval of the union proposal related to the nationalization of Norpro Venezuela and *\"simdar announcements regarding other foreign-owned businesses,\"428* implied a promise to the people that the State would nationalize the businesses referred to in the statement in the future; the President did not, however, actually give specific orders or instructions for an immediate physical takeover of the plant.\n\n*Grabaci\u00f3n y Transcripci\u00f3n de Programas de Opini\u00f3n y Transmisiones Especiales de la Tv Venezolana,* TVRADIO 2021, C. A., 15 de mayo de 2010, **Exhibit R-15,** p.14.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b619.\n\n453.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, President Ch\u00e1vez did not empower the unions to take over the businesses concerned with governmental authority by virtue of his announcements. Moreover, even though members of the SINPROTRAC union may have actually taken President Ch\u00e1vez *\"at his word,*\"429 the Tribunal considers that they did not act *\"on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of'* President Ch\u00e1vez within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 77.\n\n454.\n\nThe fact that national and/or local politicians were sympathizing with the union members and may have been participating in the takeover of 15 May 2010 is not sufficient in itself to establish Respondent's responsibility for these actions. Assuming that the individuals referred to by Claimant actually did participate in the takeover of 15 May 2010,430 the Tribunal finds that there is not sufficient evidence that they were acting on behalf, or under the instructions, of Respondent. Moreover, as to the presence of the Venezuelan National Guard, which was, as Claimant contends, involved in the occupation of the plant on and after 15 May 2010,431 the Tribunal cannot exclude that it was present at the plant *\"in order to preserve order and public safety,\"* as Respondent asserts.432\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6 77; Reply, \u00b6 22.\n\nReply, T(23, citing from Internal Memorandum, PDVSA Industrial, *Situaci\u00f3n actual del proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A.

In particular, the Tribunal finds that, first, by means of the conduct of the State-owned PDVSA, the Respondent took effective control of the plant on 15 May 2010 or shortly thereafter **(aa).** Second, the Tribunal holds that PDVSA's conduct constituted a taking of the plant to the benefit of Respondent as required by the term *\"expropriation\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty; the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argumentation that there was no taking of the plant to the benefit of the State because PDVSA was merely acting as a *\"caretaker\"* **(bb).**\n\n**(aa) Respondent's Effective Control of the Plant**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nWith regard to the first point, the Tribunal finds that, by means of its conduct after the plant takeover of 15 May 2010 carried out by the members of the SINPROTRAC union, PDVSA acknowledged and adopted the union's actions as its own. On the basis of the applicable principles of customary international law on State responsibility as reflected in Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles, the plant takeover on 15 May 2010 therefore has to be considered as an act of Respondent. In any event, PDVSA took effective control over the plant and started the expropriation process shortly after 15 May 2010, as confirmed by its internal memoranda and reports of early June 2010.\n\n**(1) Attribution of PDVSA's Conduct to Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nBefore examining PDVSA's conduct relating to the plant more closely, the Tribunal notes that, although PDVSA is a State-owned company with distinct legal personality, its conduct is attributable to Respondent pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles, which states that the\n\n*\"conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\"433*\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), **Exhibit CLA-044.**\n\n458.\n\nBoth in its alleged function as a *\"caretaker\"* and in its capacity as supervisor and promoter of the nationalization of the plant, PDVSA was vested with governmental authority. This is not contested by Respondent; on the contrary, Respondent emphasizes in the context of the negotiations that took place in late 2010 that PDVSA *\"had been instructed to carry out the transition of the Plant to a State-controlled operation\"434* This is further confirmed by PDVSA's contemporaneous statement during the meeting on 30 August 2010 that *\"it had received specific instructions from the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to carry out the transfer of Norpro to State control.\"435*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 29.\n\nQuotation from the English translation submitted by Respondent with **Exhibit R-17.**\n\n459.\n\nIn an internal memorandum prepared by PDVSA, entitled *\"Situaci\u00f3n actual del proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A. (Norpro)\"* dated 2 June 2010, reference was also made to the instructions of the President:\n\n***\"En fecha Martes 25 de Mayo,***  *personal de PDVSA bajo instrucciones de la Gerencia General EyP Divisi\u00f3n Oriente y en el marco del ordenamiento emitido por el Comandante Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica, se present\u00f3 en las instalaciones de la empresa NORPRO Venezuela C.A. con miras a iniciar la fase de levantamiento y verificaci\u00f3n de toda la informaci\u00f3n asociada a dicha empresa.*  \n [...]  \n***27 de mayo 2010,***  *se incorpora al proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n de la empresa NORPRO Venezuela,C.A., el equipo multidisciplinario de PDVSA Industrial, S.A. por instrucciones de nuestro Ministro-Presidente.\"436*\n\n**Exhibit C-143.**\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that in light of PDVSA's undisputed mandate from the President of Venezuela to carry out the nationalization of Norpro Venezuela, there should and cannot be a distinction between PDVSA's conduct aimed at carrying out its mandate and conduct that was possibly aimed at ensuring the safety of workers and maintenance of the equipment at the plant in the meantime. Rather, all of PDVSA's actions with regard to the plant can and have to be attributed to Respondent.\n\n**(2) Adoption of the Union's Actions by PDVSA as its Own**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nAs a rule of customary international law, laid down in Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles, *\"[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State\"* at the time of its commission *\"shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.*\"437 In contrast to cases of mere State support, endorsement or general acknowledgment of a factual situation created by private individuals, attribution under this rule requires that the State clearly and unequivocally *\"identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.\"438*\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), **Exhibit CLA-044;** J.

After the plant takeover of 15 May 2010, PDVSA was able, without any disturbance, to assess the current situation of the plant and to determine how it could be restructured and operated by PDVSA.446 Respondent further acknowledges that, in June and July 2010, PDVSA established *\"a permanent presence, as it had been assigned responsibility for ensuring Plant safety and stability pending the determination of the precise mechanism and timing by which State control of the Plant was to be achieved.\"447*\n\n*Cf* Memorandum, PDVSA E&P, Preliminary Report from the Valuation Committee, *Evaluaci\u00f3n global de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la empresa Norpro Venezuela C.A.,* May 2010, **Exhibit C-141;** Diagnostic of the Current Situation and Restructuring Plan for Optimization of the Productive Processes of Norpro Venezuela, C.A., June 2010, **Exhibit C-142;** Internal Memorandum, PDVSA Industrial, *Situaci\u00f3n actual del proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A.

In any event, even if PDVSA's conduct were not to be considered as an acknowledgment and adoption of the union's plant takeover as its own action, Respondent effectively took control of the plant in June and July 2010 when it established *\"apermanent presence\"* at the plant, as Respondent acknowledges.449 In the Tribunal's view, the 2 June 2010 memorandum prepared by PDVSA, entitled *\"Situaci\u00f3n actual del proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A. (Norpro),*\"450 as well as the 4 June 2010 prepared by PDVSA's *\"Comisi\u00f3n de Evaluaci\u00f3n\"*, entitled *\"Informe de avance \u2018Restructuraci\u00f3n empresa Norpro*\"451 confirm that the expropriation process started at least shortly after 15 May 2010.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 28.\n\n*Cf.* Internal Memorandum, PDVSA Industrial, *Situaci\u00f3n actual del proceso de estatizaci\u00f3n empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A.

In this context, Respondent maintains that PDVSA's presence at the plant was arranged for the purpose of ensuring plant safety and stability, as a *\"caretaker,\"* not as an owner.452 Furthermore, Respondent contends that, although PDVSA was instructed at the same time *\"to carry out the transfer of Norpro to State control,* \" it was not allowed to *\"act or intervene in Norpro\" (\"no puede actuar o intervenir en Norpro\")* until the publication of the formal expropriation decree.453 However, as the reasoning relating to the plant takeover above indicates, the Tribunal finds that PDVSA actually did, in Respondent's own words, *\"act\"* and *\"intervene in Norpro\"* and hence took control of the plant, not as a *\"caretaker,* \" but to the benefit of Respondent, thereby excluding Norpro Venezuela as the owner of the plant.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 29 and 140;

By August 2010, the PDVSA flag was flying together with the Venezuelan flag over the plant and the workers were wearing PDVSA uniforms.464 As detailed above in **(aa),** later in October 2010, PDVSA's Angel Salvarria was installed as Plant General Manager and *\"reorganized the supervisory structure which had been in place at the Plant since the union takeover, and began readying the Plant to re-start production.* \" In November 2010, plant workers officially became employees of PDVSA. Finally, between November 2010 and March 2011, *\"after operations re-started, the Plant produced and stockpiled green proppants.\"465* Again, these measures are not typical for ensuring safety and stability; they illustrate that PDVSA was making the plant ready for operation and production under the *aegis* of Respondent.\n\nRequest by Norpro Venezuela, C.A. for Judicial Inspection, 5 August 2010, **Exhibit C-119,** p. 11; Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez Cabello, *Norpro de Venezuela inicia fase de prearranque,* Correo del Caron\u00ed, 23 July 2010, **Exhibit C-117.**\n\nRond\u00f3n, 33-34; Transcript (Day 3), p. 712 lines 15-18; p. 714 line 19 - p. 715 line 8.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, contrary to Respondent's submissions, it is not relevant whether or not the formal expropriation decree was still being drafted at that time and property rights were yet to be formally transferred, and whether or not Claimant took legal steps in order to regain control.466 The fact that the expropriation decree was *\"being drafted\"* at that time *\"by the competent governmental authorities, within the process provided for in the applicable laws\" (\"El Decreto que ordena la expropiaci\u00f3n de Norpro y sus activos industriales est\u00e1 siendo elaborado por las autoridades gubernamentales competentes, dentro del proceso previsto en las leyes aplicables.* \")467 does not exclude a finding that Claimant had already been expropriated within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b660-61.\n\nDraft Minutes of a Meeting among PDVSA Industrial S.A., Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and the French Embassy in Venezuela, 30 August 2010, **Exhibit C-34** and **Exhibit R-17,**\n\n474.\n\nThe concepts and formalities of domestic law and compliance with its rules are not decisive for the purpose of determining whether or not an expropriation within the meaning of international law has occurred. Rather, it is decisive under Article 5(1) of the Treaty that Respondent had *de facto* control of the plant on or shortly after 15 May 2010, with no prospect of giving it back to its owners, and used it to prepare and restart operation and production of proppants. While the assessment of the plant's economic situation, including its inventory and payment obligations, was also relevant for preparing the (formal) expropriation decree and determining the fair compensation as required under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, Respondent did not collect this data within the framework of a formal administrative procedure. Rather, it availed itself of the plant takeover carried out by the union, established a permanent presence on the plant and started the nationalization process without providing for any significant participation of Claimant or the Norpro management at that time.\n\n475.\n\nWith respect to the second point, *i.e.,* whether Claimant attempted to regain control of the plant after the takeover on 15 May 2010, the Tribunal notes that Norpro Venezuela filed two requests for judicial inspection of the plant on 17 May 2010 and on 5 August 2010.468 Moreover, Norpro Venezuela and Claimant repeatedly attempted to enter into negotiations with Respondent concerning the nationalization of the plant, requested the assignment of an interlocutor, offered technical assistance and reserved their right to indemnification, starting with a letter from Norpro's former president Luis P\u00e1ez to Rafael Ramirez, dated 19 May 2010:\n\n*\"Considerando el inter\u00e9s que posee el Grupo Saint-Gobain en preservar la seguridad del personal de la planta y la condici\u00f3n de los activos de Norpro nos permitimos solicitar que PDVSA, en caso de ser designado como ente que llevar\u00e1 a cabo la estatizaci\u00f3n, designe a un interlocutor v\u00e1lido para analizar con los representantes del Grupo Saint-Gobain, la forma bajo la cual la misma se desea llevar a cabo.*\n\n*Debe destacarse que el Grupo Saint-Gobain sin prejuicio* [sic] *a sus derechos en materia de indemnizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 abierto a proporcionar a corto y mediano plazo asistencia t\u00e9cnica una vez que lleve a cabo la estatizaci\u00f3n, a los fines de preservar la seguridad del personal y evitar la degradaci\u00f3n del estado de los activos de Norpro.\"469*\n\nRequest by Norpro Venezuela, C.A. for Judicial Inspection, 17 May 2010, **Exhibit C-20;** Request by Norpro Venezuela, C.A. for Judicial Inspection, 5 August 2010, **Exhibit C-119.**\n\nLetter from Luis E. P\u00e1ez to Rafael Ramirez, 19 May 2010, **Exhibit C-22,** pp. 1-2.\n\n476.\n\nOther letters from Claimant and Norpro Venezuela, written in the course of 2010, contain similar statements.470 These messages do not convey the impression that Claimant and Norpro Venezuela, still being the rightful owners of the plant, had access to the plant at any time, but had decided *\"to disclaim responsibility for anything that happened at the Plant\"* and to leave the plant to the State, as alleged by Respondent.471 It rather appears that, in view of President Ch\u00e1vez' announcement of 15 May 2010 and the subsequent takeover of the plant, Claimant accepted as a fact that the plant was *de facto* nationalized and tried to make the best of the situation by cooperating with Respondent rather than exhausting its legal remedies, such as, *e.g.,* an *\"amparo\"* in order to preserve its constitutional rights.472 This cooperative attitude does not, however, preclude Claimant from asserting that an *\"expropriation\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty occurred already at that time.\n\n*Cf.* Letter from Luis E. P\u00e1ez to Jos\u00e9 Khan, 27 May 2010, **Exhibit C-23;** Letter from Guy Rolli to Temir Porras, 8 June 2010, **Exhibit C-26;** Letter from Luis E.

This conduct amounts to an *\"expropriation\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty and is therefore decisive for the expropriation date within the meaning of subparagraph 3.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Compliance with, or Breach of, its Treaty Obligations after the Expropriation Date**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nFrom the findings made above in **aa)** with regard to the requirements as to the specification and promptness of the compensation under Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 and 3 of the Treaty and in **(i)** with regard to the *\"date of expropriation\"* within the meaning of subparagraph 3, it follows that Respondent did not comply with its Treaty obligations under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 after 15 May 2010.\n\n479.\n\nRespondent has never communicated the amount of payment to be made to Claimant and has yet to offer any compensation for the expropriation, despite the aforementioned attempts by Claimant to negotiate the terms of the nationalization. The Tribunal is aware that it is Respondent's position that it offered compensation in the context of its offer to form an *\"empresa mixta,\"* in which PDVSA would become the major shareholder.473 However, regardless of whether Respondent's offer was sufficiently concrete in order for Claimant to be considered,474 Respondent did in any event not specify any amount that it would pay to Claimant in consideration for its acquisition of a majority stake in the mixed company. Therefore Respondent failed to specify the amount of compensation within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty and thus also failed to pay prompt compensation as required under subparagraph 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 53-54 referring to the letter from Gabriel Rojas to Luis Paez, dated 22 October 2010. **Exhibit R-071.** Respondent also refers to the meeting between PDVSA and Claimant on 26 October 2010 discussed by Claimant's witness Mr. Millot in his witness statement. Millot, \u00b6 31.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to whether the offer corresponded to a concrete proposal that Claimant agreed to consider or whether it was a mere *\"suggestion\"* that PDVSA promised to substantiate before it would have been for Claimant to consider it. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 35; Millot, H 31 ; Transcript (Day 2), p. 418 line 9 - p. 419 line 9; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54 (with note 101).\n\n**c) Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n480.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation of the plant was not carried out in accordance with the compensation requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3. As to the consequences of this finding, *i. e.*, the question whether this breach renders the expropriation unlawful, the Tribunal notes that the dispute between the Parties is focused on the question of which compensation standard is to be applied in this case. The Tribunal will thus address this issue in the section on quantum *(see* below in **III.1.),**\n\n**2. Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the FET claims. After briefly defining the applicable FET standard **(a),** the Tribunal will assess the FET claims with respect to the plant **(b)** and the Bauxite Contract **(c).** As to the additional claims based on Respondent's failure to provide VAT refunds that it allegedly owed to Claimant under Venezuelan law and on Respondent's alleged arbitrary restriction of the proppants production through the 24 March 2010 takeover of the plant,475 the Tribunal notes that Claimant has not continued to pursue these arguments as independent FET claims following its Memorial. Therefore, the Tribunal will also refrain from addressing these arguments in the present section.476\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, 162-164 and \u00b6\u00b6 178-179.\n\nThe argument relating to the VAT refunds will be discussed in the section on quantum at paragaphs 824 *et seq.* below.\n\n**a) Applicable FET Standard**\n------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nClaimant submits that the FET standard provided for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty refers, in a broad sense, to the prevailing concepts of FET in international law - and not only to the minimum standard of treatment -, including the following:477\n\n- The ensurance of a *\"stable legal and business environment,\"* with treatment *\"in a manner that is consistent, predictable, and transparent\"',*\n\n- The creation of an *\"appropriate legal, administrative, and regulatory framework, the legal environment that modern investment theory has come to recognize as a conditio sine qua non of the success of private enterprise\"',*\n\n- *\"due process\"* to the exclusion of a *\"lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process\"',*\n\n- The absence of *\"arbitrary or discriminatory conduct\"',* and\n\n- A conduct *\"in accordance with the principle of good faith.\"*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152-156.\n\n483.\n\nClaimant submits that the reference in Article 3(1) of the Treaty to the *\"rules and principles of international law* \" does not constitute a cap but rather the baseline for the treatment to be accorded to foreign investors.478\n\nReply, \u00b6 104.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nRespondent submits that, by virtue of the reference to the *\"rules and principles of international law,* \" Article 3(1) of the Treaty calls only for the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. For the purpose of defining this restrictive FET standard, Respondent refers to an early decision of the tribunal in Neer *v. Mexico* (1926), which held that, to violate this standard, the treatment of an alien\n\n*\"should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"479*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 125, citing from *Neer v.

However, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding in this regard because, as discussed in the following paragraphs, at least certain aspects of Respondent's involvement in the price increases under the Bauxite Contract and the expropriation of the plant as alleged by Claimant could, if proven, also be in breach of the more restrictive FET concept as described by Respondent in this case.\n\n489.\n\nWith regard to the takeover of the plant, Claimant argues that Respondent failed to follow due process in the expropriation procedure. As Respondent's reference to the FET standard under the draft CETA illustrates, Respondent apparently accepts that a *\"[f]undamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings\"* forms part of the FET standard contained in Article 3(1) of the Treaty.484\n\nRejoinder 121, citing from European Commission, *Investment Provisions in the EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement,* dated December 3,2013, **Exhibit RL-142;** European Commission, Vote *for the Attention of the Trade Policy Committee re \"CETA Consolidated text, \"* dated August 5, 2014, **Exhibit RL-143.**\n\n490.\n\nAs to the price increases under the Bauxite Contract, it is Claimant's position that Respondent made, through MIBAM and other State organs, *\"specific promises\"* and *\"commitments\"* and thereby *\"created specific expectations,* \" which Claimant relied on in making its investments, and which were subsequently frustrated.485 Respondent advances that the FET standard includes protection of *\"legitimate expectations,\" \"limited to situations where the investment took place only because of a promise made by the State that was subsequently not honoured.\"486*\n\nReply, \u00b6 120; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 80.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 121, citing from European Commission, *Investment Provisions in the EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement,* dated December 3, 2013, **Exhibit RL-142;** European Commission, *Note for the Attention of the Trade Policy Committee re \"CETA Consolidated text,\"* dated August 5, 2014, **Exhibit RL-143.**\n\n491.\n\nIn light of the Parties' positions in this case, the Tribunal will consider *\"due process\"* and protection of *\"legitimate expectations\"* as being, in principle, undisputed elements of the FET under Article 3(1) of the Treaty. If necessary, the Tribunal will further detail the precise scope of these two elements below.\n\n**b) Due Process in the Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent failed to treat Claimant's investment fairly and equitably because its actions in relation to the expropriation were not transparent and did not satisfy the standard of good faith under the Treaty. Claimant argues that its investment was *\"effectively expropriated overnight\"* without any forewarning and its employees were *\"kicked out the same day\"* as a result of the *\"public and sudden announcement\"* on television by President Chavez on 15 May 20 1 0.487\n\nMemorial, 180-181; Reply, \u00b6 127.\n\n493.\n\nClaimant claims that the tribunal in *Middle East Cement v. Egypt* confirmed that the manner in which the investment was expropriated can in itself violate the FET standard and further refers to the tribunal's finding in *Tecmed v. Mexico* that a failure to consult with the claimant prior to the expropriatory action gave rise to a breach of the FET obligation.488 In addition, Claimant relies on the tribunal's statement in *OI European Group v. Venezuela* that it is difficult to imagine an unlawful direct expropriation, which does not at the same time imply a violation of the FET standard.489\n\nMemorial, **\u00b6** 182 referring to *Middle East Cement v. Egypt* **(CLA-053), \u00b6** 143 and *Tecmed v. Mexico* **(CLA-082),** \u00b6\u00b6 173-174.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 47 referring to *OI European Group v. Venezuela* **(CLA-156), \u00b6** 501.\n\n494.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it repeatedly approached Respondent in order to negotiate the amount of compensation to be paid under the Treaty but its efforts were to no avail. Respondent failed to make any offer and further failed to give any indication as to the process it intended to follow in order to ensure the payment of adequate compensation. Claimant refers to the tribunal's statement in *ADC v. Hungary* that the claimant's legitimate expectation included to receive fair treatment and just compensation.490 By contrast, Claimant claims, Respondent took the plant without establishing a legal framework for the expropriation or an effort to engage in any good faith negotiations on compensation for a period of over ten months.491\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 183-184 referring to *ADC v. Hungary* **(CLA-001), \u00b6** 424.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 42.\n\n495.\n\nClaimant argues that due process requires that the affected investor be granted *\"a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard.* \" In Claimant's view, the *\"significant delays\"* and the *\"opaque process\"* together with Respondent's insistence on continuing with its domestic expropriation proceedings despite Claimant's choice to pursue its claims before an ICSID tribunal constitute a violation of Respondent's obligation to accord Claimant due process during the expropriation.492\n\nReply. \u00b6\u00b6 128-130.\n\n496.\n\nClaimant maintains that Respondent did not respect *\"anyone's understanding of due process\"* when it (i) *\"abruptly declared the Plant national property in a television announcement\"',* (ii) failed to take *\"any legal measure, decree or procedure\"* for almost a year and could not even outline a timeframe for the start of the process; (iii) failed to provide any authority for PDVSA's *\"occupation and control\"* of the plant; (iv) refused to negotiate in good faith despite Claimant's repeated efforts and made *\"only unsubstantiated 'suggestions' of a mixed enterprise\"* which cannot be considered a good-faith offer given that the suggestion did not include any compensation for the loss of the 60% ownership that would be taken by PDVSA; (v) did not offer any compensation as required by both the Treaty and its domestic Expropriation Law; and (vi) failed to act in accordance with the terms of the Expropriation Law as confirmed by its legal expert Dr. Brewer-Carias who states that under Venezuelan law, compensation has to be paid prior to expropriation.493\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29; Reply, \u00b6 126 referring to Brewer-Carias II, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's claim that the expropriation was not carried out following due process and argues that there is no requirement under international law to give prior warning of its intention to announce an expropriation because this would effectively undermine the State's sovereign right to expropriate.494 Respondent submits that when PDVSA had established a caretaker presence at the plant, it met with Claimant as soon as possible to negotiate the formation of an *empresa mixta* and, even before the Expropriation Decree was issued, PDVSA *\"took active steps to engage with Claimant, to collaborate with Claimant, and ensure that Claimant was aware of the available legal remedies\"495*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 137.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140.\n\n498.\n\nIn response to Claimant's argument that Respondent failed to abide by its domestic Expropriation Law, Respondent maintains that PDVSA was authorized to enter into provisional possession of the plant under Venezuelan law and, in any event, not every failure of the host State to *\"comply strictly with the requirements of its laws\"* constitutes a breach of its FET obligation under international law.496\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 136 (with note 469).\n\n499.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that after the Decree was issued, PDVSA initiated the administrative amicable expropriation procedure required by the Expropriation Law, which is aimed at determining the compensation to be paid. According to Respondent, Claimant was well aware of the Expropriation Decree and its role in resolving the question of compensation; nevertheless, it chose not to participate in the amicable settlement procedure and to ignore the subsequent judicial procedure. In Respondent's view, the present case is therefore not comparable to the cases cited by Claimant because it neither challenged the expropriation nor did it participate in the determination of just compensation and therefore cannot complain about the resulting delays.497\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 138-139.\n\n500.\n\nSpecifically with regard to *OI European Group v. Venezuela,* Respondent notes that the applicable expropriation provision in that case included an explicit requirement to carry out the expropriation *\"under due process of law\"* and emphasizes that the tribunal rejected all but one of the claimant's due process arguments. In particular, Respondent emphasizes that the tribunal found that due process does not require prior discussions with the expropriated party and is fully satisfied if the party is subsequently granted the right to be heard before the judiciary.498 Respondent maintains that this possibility would have been open to Claimant at any time and concludes that *\"the fact that Claimant chose not to avail itself of remedies in the Venezuelan courts does not equate with a denial of due process.\"499*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11 referring to *OI European Group v. Venezuela* (CLA-156), \u00b6322 and \u00b6\u00b6 388, 392.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b611.\n\n501.\n\nFinally, Respondent is of the view that Claimant's argument that the ongoing judicial procedure ignores Claimant's choice to initiate ICSID arbitration is rendered moot by the Tribunal's decision to deny Claimant's request for provisional measures that was based on the same argument.500\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 139.\n\n502.\n\nIn any event, Respondent submits that Claimant did not suffer any damage during the ten-and-a-half-month period until the Expropriation Decree was issued that is not already included in the calculation of the compensation for the expropriation as of 15 May 2010. According to Respondent, even a finding of an FET violation would not give rise to any change in the manner in which compensation is to be calculated in the present case.501\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 108, 112; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 32\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nDuring the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant included this FET claim in the expropriation claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.502 The Tribunal notes, however, that Claimant thereby did not intend to abandon its separate FET claim relating to the taking of the plant, given that it maintains in its relief sought the request for a separate declaration that Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty.503\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 82 line 13; p. 93 lines 5-7. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6116. This is confirmed by the cross-reference in Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission (\u00b642 with note 116) to the relevant section in the Memorial 180-184) and Claimant's submission of its FET arguments in its Second Post-Hearing Submission 30-45).\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties' positions on Claimant's claim for breach of due process during the expropriation process. However, as correctly pointed out by Respondent, Claimant does not allege that it suffered any damage from the alleged breach that would not be included in the compensation for the expropriation itself. Therefore, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding on whether the FET has indeed been breached in this regard because it would not alter the amount of compensation to which Claimant will be entitled pursuant to the Award.\n\n**c) Price Increases under the Bauxite Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(i) CVG Bauxilum's Conduct Is Attributable to Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nClaimant claims that CVG Bauxilum's actions are attributable to Respondent because it is *\"wholly-owned by, and subject to the direction and oversight of CVG,\"* which is an autonomous institute under Venezuelan law and thus forms part of the *\"functionally decentralized\"* public entities of Respondent. Claimant adds that CVG enjoys the same privileges and prerogatives as the State, is subject to the coordination of the President of Venezuela and was *\"ascribed\"* to MIBAM. Consequently, Claimant argues that the same applies to its subsidiary CVG Bauxilum whose activities and services have been declared of public utility and public interest under Venezuela's Mining Law.504\n\nMemorial, 173-174; Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\n506.\n\nClaimant therefore argues that (i) CVG Bauxilum should be considered an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles; and even if this were not the case, (ii) its conduct would be attributable under Article 5 as it is *\"empowered by the law of [the] State to exercise elements of governmental authority\"* and *\"was acting in that capacity in the particular instance\"* because it contracted with Norpro Venezuela on the basis of the State-granted monopoly.505\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6176-177 referring to International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) **(CLA-044),** Articles 4 and 5.\n\n507.\n\nTo the extent that CVG Bauxilum is considered an organ of the State, Claimant argues that its breach of the Bauxite Contract in itself amounts to an internationally wrongful act rising to the level of a Treaty breach because Claimant is entitled to the same treatment afforded to third-party nationals under the most-favored nation clause in the Treaty. According to Claimant, the scope of the MFN clause includes umbrella clauses found in other treaties such as the UK-Venezuela BIT.506\n\nMemorial, note 340; Reply, note 253.\n\n508.\n\nClaimant also refers to Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles and notes that this provision does not even require governmental activity.507 In addition, Claimant claims that Respondent, through MIBAM, adopted the Bauxite Contract as its own and then *\"sanctioned the contractual breach by refusing to address it when approached directly by Norpro Venezuela]* which creates its responsibility under Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles.508\n\nReply, note 252.\n\nReply, \u00b6 118.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Conduct (Through MIBAM) Created Legitimate Expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nClaimant further submits that, even if CVG Bauxilum's conduct were not attributable under the ILC Draft Articles, Respondent's State officials gave *\"specific promises\"* and thus created *\"specific expectations]* which they then repudiated by failing to address CVG Bauxilum's actions in raising the bauxite price in violations of the terms of the Bauxite Contract.509\n\nReply, \u00b6 120.\n\n510.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent *\"induced\"* its investment through *\"a series of promises,\"* including a guarantee that its State-owned entities would enter into long-term supply contracts for the required inputs (gas, electricity and bauxite). According to Claimant, the *\"long-term supply of bauxite at a competitive price\"* was *\"of critical importance\"* to Claimant, which is why it discussed the supply of bauxite directly with MIBAM in 2005.510\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 165; Reply, \u00b6 114.\n\n511.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent *\"regularly discussed and promoted the Bauxite Contract\"* and that MIBAM gave \"*express assurances [...] that it had directed CVG Bauxilum to fulfill Norpro Venezuela's bauxite needs on the terms agreed.\"511* In this regard, Claimant refers, *inter alia,* to a meeting on 10 May 2005 in which the Vice-Minister \"[c]*onfirmed the terms that will guide the bauxite and gas supply\"* as well as a meeting on 20 October 2005 in which the Vice-Minister confirmed that he had asked *\"the president of* [CVG] *Bauxilum to finalize the contract asap.\"512*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 79-80 referring to the oral testimony of its witness Mr. Pedersen. Transcript (Day 2), pp. 499-501 and pp. 567-577.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 165-166 referring to Minutes of a Meeting among Saint-Gobain, MIBAM and CVG Bauxilum **(Exhibit C-3)** and a Memo from Michel Boyer-Chammard to Guy Rolli, et al., 20 October 2005 **(Exhibit C-074).**\n\n512.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the Government was aware of the importance to secure bauxite supply and therefore *\"directly committed to Saint-Gobain that it would secure such a supply at the Bauxite Contract price.\"* Claimant claims that CVG Bauxilum entered into the Bauxite Contract *\"[a]t MIBAM's direction,\"* as confirmed by the fact that the Contract was concluded *\"under the auspices of the Ministry of Basic and Mining Industries (MIBAM) and the Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Guayana (CVG)\"* and embossed with *\"Ministry of Basic Mining Industries\"* in the header.513 Consequently, Claimant argues that its legitimate expectations, as *\"memorialized\"* in the Bauxite Contract with CVG Bauxilum, were created by MIBAM prior to the signing given that it *\"controlled and orchestrated\"* the negotiations on the supply of bauxite and confirmed the parameters of the contract.514\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6167-168; Purchase and Sale Agreement between CVG Bauxilum, C. A. and Proppants Venezuela, C.A., 27 January 2006 **(Exhibit C-6).**\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117 and \u00b6 123.\n\n513.\n\nClaimant alleges that even though the Bauxite Contract provides that the bauxite price can be increased only (i) by an automatic annual adjustment by the US PPI for commodities (Article 10.1); and (ii) in the event of increased transportation costs by a jointly reviewed price adjustment (Article 10.2), CVG Bauxilum unilaterally increased the price in violation of these terms. Claimant notes that it objected to the price increase by separate letters to both MIB AM and CVG Bauxilum, as confirmed by its witness Mr. Millot during his oral testimony.515\n\nMemorial, 169-170; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 15 referring to the letter from Luis Paez to MIB AM, 4 September 2008 **(Exhibit C-096)** and the letter from Oscar Cid to CVG Bauxilum, 17 September 2008 **(Exhibit C-12);** Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 82 referring to Transcript (Day 2), pp. 373-381.\n\n514.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that the price increase was based on the increased transportation costs, in particular the raised tariffs for navigating the Orinoco River, and thus justified under Article 10.2, Claimant submits that, despite *\"extensive efforts\"* from Norpro Venezuela's management, CVG Bauxilum failed to adequately document the alleged reasons for the price increase, several of which were *\"inadequate on their face\"516*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b683-85.\n\n515.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's conduct does not merely amount to a breach of contract but a violation of its legitimate expectation that Respondent would ensure compliance with the contract. In this regard, Claimant claims that the tribunal in *Nykomb v. Latvia \"clearly established the relevance of market-dominance for attribution purposes.\"517* Claimant argues that, in light of Respondent's monopoly over the bauxite production in Venezuela, MIB AM and CVG Bauxilum could impose their terms on Norpro Venezuela, knowing that bauxite was the critical raw material for the production of Claimant's ceramic proppants. While emphasizing that it protested against the increase, Claimant submits that it therefore *\"simply had no other choice\"* than to pay the increased price.518\n\nReply, \u00b6 123 (note 251).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 171; Reply, \u00b6 124 (with note 251 referring to *Nykomb v. Latvia* (CLA-058), Section 4.2); Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 82.\n\n516.\n\nContrary to what Respondent suggests, Claimant submits that it could not change the supplier of bauxite because the process had been calibrated to the quality of the raw bauxite required for the production proppants and delivery was scheduled only once a year. According to Claimant, the availability of bauxite in sufficient quantities at prices that made the proppants production economically feasible was the entire reason for choosing Venezuela as its investment location. Under these circumstances, Claimant argues that the unilateral price increase was *\"antithetical to the transparentand stable legal environment Saint-Gobain was promised\"* and thus *\"eviscerated\"* its legitimate expectations.519\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 172; Reply, note 49; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's claim and emphasizes that neither Claimant nor Venezuela was party to the Bauxite Contract, which was rather a *\"purely commercial arrangement\"* between CVG Bauxilum and Norpro Venezuela and cannot give rise to any obligations of Respondent under international law.\n\n**(i) CVG Bauxilum's Conduct Is Not Attributable to Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nRespondent contests that the actions of CVG Bauxilum are attributable to the State under the ILC Draft Articles because these provisions apply only to *\"internationally wrongful acts.\"* As there is no allegation that the conclusion of the Bauxite Contract in itself was an internationally wrongful act, Respondent contends that the ILC Draft Articles do not apply.520\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6131-132 and \u00b6\u00b6 74-81; Rejoinder, \u00b680.\n\n519.\n\nRespondent submits that, even if the ILC Draft Articles were applicable, CVG Bauxilum cannot be considered an organ of the State under Article 4 because CVG is an autonomous institute and its subsidiary, CVG Bauxilum, is a State-owned company. According to Respondent, neither of them has any executive power but they are decentralized entities of the Public Administration and thus separate and distinct legal persons under Venezuelan commercial law.521 Respondent argues that if the status is as clearly defined under internal law as is the case here, the internal law is decisive for the classification as an *\"organ\"* under Article 4.522\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b682-85; Rejoinder, \u00b684 and \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n520.\n\nRespondent further takes the position that CVG Bauxilum's conduct is not attributable under Article 5. In Respondent's view, the exercise of *\"governmental authority\"* means the *\"authority to exercise sovereign prerogatives\"* and cannot be equated with *\"activities of a commercial character that are routinely carried out by State companies for the benefit of the State.\"* Respondent submits that, while CVG Bauxilum is a commercial company acting for the benefit of Respondent in the mining sector, it does not possess or exercise any governmental authority in carrying out its activities.523\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 86-90 referring to *Homester v. Ghana* (RL-27), \u00b6\u00b6 251-255.\n\n521.\n\nWhile acknowledging that CVG Bauxilum indeed has a State-granted monopoly in Venezuela, Respondent notes that Claimant had identified three alternative sources in Guayana and the Dominican Republic and was *\"perfectly free\"* to import the bauxite from any of those countries. According to Respondent, CVG Bauxilum's monopoly is irrelevant because CVG Bauxilum's decision to increase the price due to the fact that its own performance had become unviable is not a sovereign act, but rather a \" *quintessentially\"* commercial act.524\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b691-98; Rejoinder, \u00b696.\n\n522.\n\nRespondent is further of the view that CVG Bauxilum's conduct cannot be attributed to Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles because Claimant cannot show a particular act that was internationally wrongful and the result of the State's *\"instructions, directions or control.\"525* Respondent refers to the commentary to the ILC Draft Articles in which Prof. Crawford states:\n\n*\"Questions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterprises which are State-owned and controlled. If such corporations act inconsistently with the international obligations of the State concerned the question arises whether such conduct is attributable to the State. In discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those cases where the* 'corporate veil' *is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law or otherwise, is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article* 5.\"526\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b699-101.\n\n*James Crawford,* The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries **(RL-21),** Article 8, p. 112.\n\n523.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's argument that CVG (and therefore effectively also CVG Baux-ilum) is under the administrative guardianship and oversight *(tutelaj* of MIBAM, Respondent notes that under Venezuelan law, *control de tutela* is a form of *\"general oversight\"* to ensure that the activities of decentralized entities or State-owned companies are carried out in line with State policy, but argues that it cannot make the State responsible for the commercial decisions of a State-owned company.527\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 102-106.\n\n524.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that Claimant's reference to Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles contradicts its previous arguments related to Article 4, 5 and 8 because Article 11 is premised on the absence of any governmental or sovereign conduct. In addition, Respondent submits that Claimant has not identified any *\"clear and unequivocal\"* statement or act of adoption on the part of Respondent and still cannot overcome the hurdle of an internationally wrongful conduct.528\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 99-102.\n\n**(ii) Claimant's Claim is Factually Inaccurate**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nIn any event, Respondent claims that Norpro Venezuela was not forced to accept any price increase but, after initial protest, *\"appreciated the underlying reasons\"* given by CVG Bauxilum for the increase, i.e., the new tariffs for navigation on the Orinoco River and the significant variation of extraction, transport and unloading costs at the Matanzas plant. According to Respondent, Norpro Venezuela made a business decision to agree to the price increase, subject to its request that the price be maintained at that level through 2009. Respondent emphasizes that CVG Bauxilum honored that request and did not seek a further price increase until 2010.529 Respondent further claims that none of the documents invoked by Claimant reflect its alleged request that additional reasons or documentation of such reasons be provided.530\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 133; Rejoinder, 132; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124 referring to letter from Oscar Cid to CVG Bauxilum, 17 September 2008 **(Exhibit R-52).**\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n526.\n\nRespondent argues that Norpro Venezuela could have decided not to purchase any bauxite from CVG Bauxilum and could instead have imported bauxite from any of the three alternative resources it had identified in Guayana and the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, Respondent notes, it could have resorted to arbitration proceedings under the Bauxite Contract against CVG Bauxilum.531\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 134; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 125.\n\n527.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimant's submission that its investment hinged on the expectation that it would receive a stable supply of bauxite from CVG Bauxilum at the same price. According to Respondent, Claimant *\"certainly never received any guarantee from the Republic regarding supply or price\"* but even advised its parent company in 2005 that there were considerable risks associated with the supply of bauxite, which they could mitigate by securing multiple viable alternative sources. Respondent notes that Claimant therefore stated internally that they were in need of an *\"alternative supply of bauxite from Guayana if tomorrow CVG no longer supplies us with any.\"532*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 135 referring to February 2005 DAC **(Exhibit R-5),** p. 5 and quoting from Email from Guy Rolli to Jorgen Pedersen, 16 February 2005 **(Exhibit C-059);** Rejoinder, \u00b6127.\n\n528.\n\nRespondent argues that in the absence of any specific promises or guarantees from the State, Claimant's *\"expectations\"* are not protected and claims that even the cases relied on by Claimant support this. According to Respondent, none of the documents referred to by Claimant with regard to the alleged commitments of the State show any involvement *\"beyond support of a general nature for the proppant plant project,\"* which does not suffice to give rise to legitimate expectations, or that Respondent *\"sanctioned\"* CVG Bauxilum's decision to increase the bauxite price.533 In Respondent's view, this is confirmed by Mr. Pedersen's oral testimony because he could not point to any specific documents or communications in which the alleged guarantees or commitments were made. In particular, Respondent notes that Mr. Pedersen could not identify a specific meeting in which the wording *\"under the auspices of [...] MIBAM\"* was discussed and given the meaning that Claimant now alleges.534\n\nRejoinder, 128-133; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 128-132 referring to Transcript (Day 2), pp. 500-510 and pp. 576-579. See also Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n529.\n\nConsequently, Respondent maintains that the Government *\"did nothing more than to facilitate the discussions with CVG Bauxilum\"* and made no commitments regarding the supply or price of bauxite to Norpro Venezuela. Therefore and apart from the fact that it considers the price increase justified under the Bauxite Contract, Respondent is of the view that it had no obligation to intervene and assist in the resolution of the dispute between CVG Bauxilum and Norpro Venezuela.535\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6129 and 134.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimant's argument on the bauxite price increase is twofold: First, Claimant argues that at the time it made the decision to invest in Venezuela in 2005, Respondent (through its own State officials, in particular from MIBAM) created a legitimate expectation that CVG Bauxilum would supply Norpro Venezuela with bauxite at stable prices in the long term, but then failed to intervene when CVG Bauxilum unilaterally increased the price in 2008 and thus breached those expectations. Second, Claimant argues that CVG Bauxilum's conduct in breach of the Bauxite Contract can be attributed to Respondent in accordance with the ILC Draft Articles and, in light of its State-granted monopoly over the supply of bauxite in Venezuela, amounts to a violation of Respondent's international obligations.\n\n531.\n\nAs to the first argument, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties that, while Respondent generally supported Claimant's investment in 2005 and 2006, this alone cannot give rise to Respondent's liability under international law. Rather, a legitimate expectation can be created only by specific promises or commitments made by the State. The dispute between the Parties relates to whether Respondent has made such specific promises in relation to the supply of bauxite at stable prices.\n\n532.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the evidence presented by Claimant in this regard does not establish that the State (through MIBAM) made any specific commitments in relation to the terms of the Bauxite Contract and in particular the prices at which CVG Bauxilum would supply the bauxite. In his written witness statement, Mr. Pedersen described that MIBAM was very involved in the negotiations with CVG Bauxilum and repeatedly voiced its support for the project.536 Mr. Pedersen did not, however, make reference to any specific commitment made by MIBAM in relation to the bauxite price. When he was asked about this during the Hearing, Mr. Pedersen clarified:\n\n*\"I don't think, frankly, it was\u2014if you look at it from that way, was the bauxite price negotiated with MIBAM. No, it was not, but the support to get a contract with Bauxilum was discussed and agreed with MIBAM.* *And then later on there are, of course, commercial negotiations between us and Bauxilum.\"537*\n\nPedersen, \u00b6\u00b621-33.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 504 lines 11-17.\n\n533.\n\nMr. Pedersen's oral testimony confirms the Tribunal's impression from the record that MIBAM indeed facilitated and supervised the negotiations with CVG Bauxilum and even approved the general terms that would govern the supply of bauxite. However, Respondent correctly pointed out that none of the statements made can be qualified as a commitment that the State would guarantee CVG Bauxilum's compliance with the pricing terms of the Bauxite Contract.\n\n534.\n\nClaimant further argues that the term *\"bajo el auspicio del [...] MIBAM'\"538* can be equated to an *\"express assurance\"* that CVG Bauxilum would supply Norpro Venezuela with bauxite at the agreed terms.539 When asked about this term at the Hearing, Mr. Pedersen testified that it was discussed in the meetings with MIBAM that *\"they were basically standing behind this contract and standing behind Bauxilum in agreeing this with us.\"* Mr. Pedersen could not, however, identify a concrete meeting at which, or a concrete person by whom, such statement was made.540 The Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the term was subject to any discussion before the Bauxite Contract was signed and, more importantly, there is no indication that it was to be assigned such a far-reaching meaning as to ensure compliance with the Bauxite Contract and/or to guarantee stable prices in the long term.\n\nPurchase and Sale Agreement between CVG Bauxilum, C.A. and Proppants Venezuela, C.A., 27 January 2006 **(Exhibit C-6),** Preamble.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 79.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 577 line 5 - p. 579 line 1.\n\n535.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not established that there were any promises or commitments made by Respondent (through MIBAM) specifically in relation to the supply of bauxite at the price agreed with CVG Bauxilum under the Bauxite Contract. Consequently, MIBAM's conduct did not give rise to a legitimate expectation of Claimant that it would guarantee CVG Bauxilum's compliance with the Bauxite Contract.\n\n536.\n\nAs to Claimant's second argument, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether CVG Bauxilum's conduct is attributable to Respondent under the ILC Draft Articles and whether a breach of contract could give rise to Respondent's liability under international law in light of CVG Bauxilum's State-granted monopoly over the supply of bauxite in Venezuela. Even if this were the case, Claimant has not established that the price increase in September 2008 amounted to a breach of contract.\n\n537.\n\nCVG Bauxilum based the increase on Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract, which provides:\n\n*\"Las partes acuerdan revisar el precio cuando surja un incremento de manera directa en los costos por concepto de transporte del material desde la mina hasta Matanzas, como consecuencia de la entrada en vigencia de Leyes, Decretos, Reglamentos, Impuestos Nacionales, Estadales o Municipales, tasas y modificaciones de alguna Convenci\u00f3n Colectiva de las contratistas que ejecutan el servicio de transporte de la Bauxita, el cual ser\u00e1 aplicable en caso que dicho incremento sea superior al del aumento establecido en el numeral 10.1 anterior,\"541*\n\nPurchase and Sale Agreement between CVG Bauxilum, C. A. and Proppants Venezuela, C. A., 27 January 2006 **(Exhibit C-6),** Article 10.2.\n\n538.\n\nDuring the first meeting in which the price increase was discussed, CVG Bauxilum invoked the following reasons: (i) increase in the Orinoco River toll by 600%; (ii) impact of the extraction and production cost that were higher than the selling price; (iii) increase of the freight costs due to increased labor costs; (iv) international market analysis according to which CVG Bauxilum's price was lower than in the international market.542\n\nEmail from Oscar Cid to Jorgen Pedersen, 30 July 2008 **(Exhibit C-093).**\n\n539.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that not all of those reasons justified a price increase under the terms of the Bauxite Contract, the letter of 2 September 2008 by which CVG Bauxilum informed Claimant about the price increase to USD 33.8 per MT relies on *\"las nuevas tarifas del canal de Navegaci\u00f3n del Rio Orinoco\"* and *\"la apreciable variaci\u00f3n que ha experimentado el costo de extracci\u00f3n, transporte y descarga de la bauxita en nuestra Planta de Matanzas*,\"543 These reasons are explicitly provided for in Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract and would therefore, if proven, justify an increase of the bauxite price.\n\nLetter from Carlos Acosta P\u00e9rez to Oscar Cid, 2 September 2008 **(Exhibit C-1l).**\n\n540.\n\nClaimant does not dispute that the tariffs on the Orinoco River were indeed raised by 600% by decree of 31 July 2008.544 Neither does it dispute that the extraction, transportation and unloading fees at the Matanza plant had increased. Claimant rather argues, as repeatedly confirmed by Mr. Pedersen during the Hearing,545 that it was never provided with documentation or a calculation for the price increase. While it claims that it repeatedly requested to receive such information, Claimant has not identified any occasion on which it ever voiced such a specific request but only refers to requests for *\"further discussion of the proposed price increase,\"* its emphasis on the applicability of Article 10.2 to any price increase and its protests against the increase which they considered to be outside the terms of the Bauxite Contract.546 When Mr. Pedersen was asked during the Hearing whether Claimant had ever requested to receive such documentation, he stated:\n\n*\"Yes. I don't know if it was in here, but I mean, yeah, I mean in the meetings with them, we certainly asked for to let us know.*\n\n*Arbitrator Brower: So, did that company refuse to provide such information, or it just did not provide it, and you moved on?*\n\n*The Witness: Yeah, I mean, we never got something, I mean, which was unfortunate. Every now and then it's difficult to get information. This is* *also back to why it took 15 months to actually sign the Contract* [...]\"547\n\nDecreto No. 6,220 con Rango, Valor y Fuerza de Ley de Canalizaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento de la V\u00edas dee Navegaci\u00f3n), published in the Official Gazette No. 5,891 (Extraordinary), 31 July 2008 **(Exhibit R-50).**\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 526 line 14 - p. 527 line 1; p. 530 lines 14-19; p. 532 line 21 - p. 533 line 12; p. 585 lines 13-18; p. 587 lines 15-18.\n\nCf. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b684.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 596 lines 2-15.\n\n541.\n\nIn light of this rather vague testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant ever expressly voiced the request to be provided with documentation for the reasons invoked by CVG Bauxilum. From the record, in particular Claimant's letter of 17 September 2008, it rather appears that Norpro Venezuela made the decision to accept the price increase, albeit under protest, under the condition that it would remain at that level throughout the following year, *i.e.,* until 31 December 2009.548 It is undisputed between the Parties, and confirmed by CVG Bauxilum's invoices to Claimant in 2009,549 that CVG Bauxilum adhered to this request and did not request a further price increase until early 2010. While Claimant emphasized in its letter that this should not be considered a tacit acceptance of the price increase, the Tribunal notes that Norpro Venezuela never took action against CVG Bauxilum in this regard under the dispute resolution clause provided for in the Bauxite Contract.\n\nLetter from Oscar Cid to CVG Bauxilum, 17 September 2008 **(Exhibit C-12).**\n\nCVG Bauxilum Invoices, Doc. R Bates numbers 0041 - 0046 **(Exhibit CLEX-83).**\n\n542.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not established that the price increase of September 2008 was not justified under Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract. In the absence of a breach of contract on the part of CVG Bauxilum, in the circumstances of this case it can therefore be left open whether Respondent could be held liable for such breach under international law.\n\n**3. Full Protection and Security (Article 3(2) of the Treaty)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will address Claimant's claim based on the full protection and security provision contained in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. Following a brief analysis of the applicable FPS standard **((a)),** the Tribunal will turn to Claimant's FPS claims as regards the Bauxite Contract **((b))** and the takeover of the plant **((c))**.\n\n**a) Applicable FPS Standard**\n------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nClaimant submits that the FPS standard imposes an obligation of *\"due diligence\"* and *\"vigilance\"* on the host State, which requires *\"reasonable measures of prevention\" that a \"well-administered government could be expected to exercise in similar circum-stances.\"550*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 185 quoting from.1.1/7. *v. Sri Lanka* **(CLA-005),** 77.\n\n545.\n\nClaimant submits that, in the *\"modern commercial and business context\"* investment treaty tribunals have not confined the FPS standard to physical security, but rather extended it to encompass legal security.551 Claimant argues that the FPS standard has evolved to include *\"more generally, the rights of investors\"* and applies *\"at least in situations* 'involving either physical violence or the discard of legal rights.'\"552\n\nReply, \u00b6 133 citing various legal authorities.\n\nReply, \u00b6 134 quoting from *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela.* **Exhibit CLA-150, \u00b6** 223.\n\n546.\n\nEven if Article 3(2) were to be limited to physical security, Claimant submits that it would still benefit from the *\"full legal protection\"* that Respondent granted to third-party nationals in the Uruguay-Venezuela BIT on the basis of the most-favored nation clause contained in Article 4 of the Treaty.553\n\nMemorial, note 379 referring to the Agreement between the Oriental Republic of Uruguay and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for zhe Promotion and Protection of Investments (20 May 1997, in force on 18 January 2002) **(Exhibit C-050),** Article 4; Reply, \u00b6 135.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n547.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that an analysis of a breach of the FPS standard requires consideration of whether the investment has been physically interfered with or harmed and whether the State complied with its due diligence obligation.554 According to Respondent, this limitation is required in order *\"to maintain a meaningful distinction\"* between the FPS standard and other protection standards set out in the Treaty, in particular the FET standard.555\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 144 referring to various legal authorities.\n\n548.\n\nWhile acknowledging that it has a duty of diligence under the FPS standard, Respondent claims that a breach of this duty requires *\"a degree of negligence, defective administration or bad faith\"* that reflects the relationship between the FPS standard and the international minimum standard of treatment.556\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 145.\n\n549.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's argument that the FPS standard entails the concept of *\"legal security\"* and claims that international case law is rather in favor of the view that the FPS obligation *\"relates primarily, and perhaps exclusively, to the physical integrity of the investment.\"557* Respondent emphasizes that unlike other treaties, which expressly refer to *\"full protection and legal security,\"* the present Treaty does not make reference to legal security and is therefore not designed to turn contract breaches into treaty claims.558\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 146-148 referring to various legal authorities; Rejoinder, \u00b6 143.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152, 156.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Treaty provides:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *\"Les investissements effectu\u00e9s par des nationaux ou des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'une ou l'autre des Parties contractantes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient, sur le territoire et dans la zone maritime de l'autre Partie contractante, d'une protection et d'une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pleines et enti\u00e8res.\"559* | *\"Las inversiones efectuadas por nacionales o sociedades de una o otra de las Partes Contratantes gozar\u00e1n, en el territorio y en la zona mar\u00edtima de la otra Parte contratante, de una protecci\u00f3n y de una seguridad plenas y completas.\"560* |\n\nJournal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise n\u00b0102 du 30 avril 2004, **Exhibit C-1,** p. 7775.\n\nGaceta Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela N\u00famero 37,896, jueves 11 de marzo de 2004, **Exhibit C-1,** pp. 332-353-332,354.\n\n552.\n\nThe English translation submitted by Claimant reads:\n\n*\"Investments made by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory or the maritime area of the other Contracting Party, benefit from full protection and security.\"561*\n\nFree translation submitted as **Exhibit C-1.**\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while there is common ground between the Parties that Article 3(2) of the Treaty imposes a duty of due diligence on Respondent, there is a dispute as to (i) the exact scope of such duty; and (ii) whether the FPS standard extends to legal security. These issues can be left open if Claimant's two claims based on the FPS standard in Article 3(2) are to be dismissed in any event, i.e., even under the broader standard advanced by Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal will make a decision on the exact scope of Article 3(2) only if and to the extent necessary to make a finding on Claimant's claims.\n\n**b) Claimant's Rights under the Bauxite Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nClaimant submits that in light of MIBAM's involvement in the negotiations and conclusion of the Bauxite Contract, it considered MIBAM as a *\"key interlocutor capable of addressing any concerns they might have with the Government.\"* For that reason, Claimant contends, Norpro Venezuela first wrote to MIBAM and copied MIBAM on its correspondence to CVG Bauxilum when it was faced with the price increase in 2008. However, Claimant notes that MIBAM ignored Claimant's requests to intervene and Respondent thus failed to protect Claimant's investment from CVG Bauxilum's actions in spite of its FPS obligation.562\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6190-192; Reply, \u00b6 138.\n\n555.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the tribunal in *Nykomb v. Latvia* found *\"in similar circumstances\"* that Latvia's failure to protect the foreign investor against contractual breaches of a State-owned entity, despite being fully aware of them, constituted a breach of the FPS obligation.563 Claimant further refers to the tribunal's emphasis in *CME v. Czech Republic* on the obligation to *\"ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment withdrawn or devalued.\"564*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 193 referring to *Nykomb v. Latvia* **(CLA-058),** Section 4.2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 188 referring to *CME v. Czech Republic,* **(CLA-019), \u00b6** 613.\n\n556.\n\nClaimant therefore argues that Respondent's failure to act upon notification of CVG Bauxilum's breaches of the Bauxite Contract constitutes a violation of its obligation to accord Claimant's investment legal security under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.565\n\nReply, \u00b6 142.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's allegation pursuant to which the price increase was not in accordance with the Bauxite Contract, despite the fact that it was accepted by Norpro Venezuela, *\"does not even come close to triggering a State's duty of due diligence\"566*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 150.\n\n558.\n\nRespondent maintains that it is not responsible for CVG Bauxilum's decision to increase the price under the Bauxite Contract. In response to Claimant's argument that it wrote to MIBAM to seek its intervention, Respondent argues that Claimant thereby attempts to create an obligation of the State by *\"communicating its discontent with the behavior of a commercial partner to a government representative,\"* which Respondent considers clearly untenable. In Respondent's view, Claimant's position would render the dispute resolution clause in the Bauxite Contract pointless and in any event the dispute was resolved amicably by the parties to the Contract when C VG Bauxilum explained the reasons for the price increase and Norpro Venezuela accepted the increase on the condition that the price would remain at the same level until the end of 2009.567\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6140-142 and\u2019 \u00b6 150. *See* also Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 124-126.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined above in the context of Claimant's FET claim that Claimant has not established that Respondent (through MIBAM) made any specific commitments in relation to the supply of bauxite at the price agreed with CVG Bauxilum under the Bauxite Contract. The Tribunal has also found that CVG Bauxilum's conduct in relation to the price increase in September 2008 did not amount to a breach of contract.\n\n560.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether the FPS standard contained in Article 3(2) of the Treaty extends to the concept of *\"legal security\"* as alleged by Claimant. In any event, Respondent did not have an obligation to intervene in relation to the bauxite price increase and thus has not breached its obligation to accord Claimant's investment full protection and security in the manner invoked by Claimant.\n\n**c) Takeover of the Plant**\n----------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nIn the alternative that the Tribunal should follow Respondent's position that the expropriation occurred only on 29 March 2011 when the Expropriation Decree was issued, Claimant further claims that Respondent has breached its FPS obligation because PDVSA took over and remained in control of the plant between the takeover on 15 May 2010 and the issuance of the Expropriation Decree.568\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 48; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, note 3.\n\n562.\n\nClaimant argues that if there was no expropriation on 15 May 2010, PDVSA had no right to occupy the plant on any date prior to 29 March 2011 and thus should have contacted Claimant *\"[t]he minute it obtained control\"* and should have allowed it to reoccupy the plant. Instead, Claimant contends that its personnel was barred by the National Guard from re-entering the plant and PDVSA started production for its own benefit. According to Claimant, this conduct amounts to a clear breach of Respondent's FPS obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.569\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 49.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nRespondent maintains that the expropriation occurred when the Expropriation Decree was issued on 29 March 2011. Respondent acknowledges that PDVSA was present during the time period prior to that date but argues that this was *\"both appropriate and necessary given the dangers associated with the Plant\"* Respondent further submits that there was no contemporaneous evidence of any complaints about PDVSA's role and claims that not only did Claimant never ask for the return of the plant but it even encouraged PDVSA's presence at the plant and the appointment of an interlocutor, precisely because it was not present and the plant was *\"a dangerous facility in the hand of unsupervised workers.\"570*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 42.\n\n564.\n\nTherefore, Respondent is of the view that it complied with its FPS obligation and adds that, by contrast, if it had not established a presence at the plant and the equipment had been damaged or workers had been issued, Claimant may well have had a claim for non-compliance with Respondent's FPS obligation.571\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 42.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant has raised this claim in the alternative that the Tribunal should find that the expropriation did not occur on or shortly after 15 May 2010, but only on 29 March 2011 when the Expropriation Decree was issued. Given the Tribunal's finding at paragraph 477 above that PDVSA's presence at the plant and its memos in early June 2010 mark the start of the expropriation process, there is thus no need to decide on this alternative claim.\n\n**IV. The Principles of Quantum**\n---------------------------------\n\n566.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the principles of quantum applicable as a result of the expropriation and Respondent's non-compliance with Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty. The Parties' positions differ significantly as to the applicable compensation standard, in particular with respect to the appropriate valuation date **(1.),** and the criteria for the calculation of damages **(2.).**\n\n**1. Compensation Standard and Valuation Date**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nOne of the key legal questions in dispute between the Parties is the applicable compensation standard and, in this context, particularly the applicable valuation date. As noted above, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not comply with the compensation requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty. Whether this finding renders the expropriation unlawful and whether this would have any impact on the compensation standard to be applied in the present case is therefore going to be addressed first in this section.\n\n**a) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Unlawfulness of the Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's failure to meet the specification and/or promptness requirements renders the expropriation unlawful.572\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 141; Reply, \u00b6\u00b677-83.\n\n569.\n\nClaimant contends that several awards rendered by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal *\"recognize the payment of prompt compensation to be a consideration relevant to the lawfulness of a taking under customary international law.\"573*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 141; **Exhibit CLA-014.**\n\n570.\n\nIn the investment treaty context, Claimant submits that the tribunal in *Unglaube v. Costa Rica* found an expropriation to be unlawful when compensation was not paid *\"within a reasonable period of time after the State declare[s] its intention to expropriate.\"574*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 141; **Exhibit CLA-051.**\n\n571.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador* confirmed that, in a case where a State has expropriated a foreign investor\u2019s property and *\"has neither paid nor offered compensation [...] the Tribunal cannot but conclude that* [the] *expropriation was unlawful.\"575*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 141; **Exhibit CLA-015.**\n\n572.\n\nClaimant further refers to the tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,* which recently found that while *\"payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation* [...] [p]*arties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set [...] if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset. \"* In that case, the tribunal found that *\"the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate* *in goodfaith for compensation for its taking\"* and thus, that the expropriation was unlawful.576\n\nMemorial, **\u00b6 141; Exhibit CLA-025.**\n\n573.\n\nMoreover, Claimant submits that in *Siemens v. Argentina,* the arbitral tribunal stated:\n\n*\"[C]ompensation has never been paid on grounds that [...] the Tribunal finds that are lacking in justification. For these reasons, the expropriation did not meet the requirements of Article 4(2)* [of the Argentina-Germany BIT] *and therefore was unlawful.\"577*\n\nReply, **\u00b6** 78; **Exhibit CLA-077.**\n\n574.\n\nSimilarly, in *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* the tribunal reasoned:\n\n*\"If we conclude that the challenged measures are expropriatory, there will be violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, even if the measures might be for a public purpose and non-discriminatory,*  *because no compensation has been paid.**\"578*\n\nReply, \u00b6 78; **Exhibit CLA-024.** Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n575.\n\nFinally, Claimant contends that, in *Gemplus v. Mexico,* the tribunal concluded:\n\n*\"[T]hese expropriations were unlawful under the BITs and international law, given the facts found by the Tribunal and*  *the further fact that the Respondent did not meet the condition required by Article 5 of both treaties regarding the payment of adequate compensation.**\"579*\n\nReply, \u00b6 78; **Exhibit CLA-125.** Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n**bb) Compensation Standard to Be Applied**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nIt is Claimant's submission that the appropriate remedy for an unlawful expropriation is the customary international law standard of restitution, *i.e.,* the higher compensation as between that valued at the date of expropriation and the date of the award.580\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 73.\n\n577.\n\nIn support of its approach, Claimant emphasizes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides for the appropriate standard of compensation only in case all of the conditions for a lawful expropriation are met. As this is not the case here, the appropriate standard of compensation, including the appropriate date at which the value is to be assessed, is set by customary international law.581\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 197; Reply, \u00b6 152.\n\n578.\n\nClaimant initially argued that Respondent must either return the plant to Claimant - which is impossible here - or pay the cash equivalent of such a return, both of which would therefore have to occur as of the date of the award.582 During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant emphasized, however, that, in case the Tribunal were to find that the value as of the date of the expropriation is higher than the value as of the date of the award, the Tribunal should determine the compensation based on the value as of the date of expropriation.583\n\nMemorial, 199, 208; Reply, \u00b6 152.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 30 line 22 - p. 31 line 14; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b677.\n\n579.\n\nAccording to Claimant's Valuation Update, Norpro Venezuela's value as of 31 August 2015 (the assessment date for the date-of-the-award valuation that the Tribunal is ultimately to take into account for its decision) is lower than the value as of 15 May 2010.584 Therefore, Claimant now claims that it is entitled to compensation in the amount of Norpro Venezuela's value as of 15 May 2010.585\n\nClaimant's Valuation Update, Table 1.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 6 November 2015.\n\n580.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the *rationale* behind the investor's right of selecting the valuation date is the aim to award full compensation to the investor who was deprived of making the choice whether to retain the investment and enjoy the fruits derived therefrom or whether to sell it at the optimal moment. As a result, the investor *\"must be accorded the upside since that time, but cannot be forced to shoulder the downside.\"586*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b675-76.\n\n581.\n\nClaimant submits that this argumentation is consistent with the approach taken by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the landmark *Chorzow Factory* decision.587 In support of its argumentation, Claimant particularly refers, in its written submissions,588 to the cases *Biwater v. Tanzania,589 Siemens v. Argentina,590 ADC v. Hungary,591 Kar-dassopoulos v. Georgia,592 Unglaube v. Costa Rica,593 ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,594 Texaco v. Libya,595 CMS v. Argentina,596 Vivendi v. Argentina II,597 Siag v. Egypt,598 Sai-pem v. Bangladesh,599 Funnekotter v. Zimbabwe600* and *Yukos v. Russia.601*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 209; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b673. **Exhibit CLA-033.**\n\nMemorial, 210-212 (with notes \u00b6\u00b6408, 409); Reply, \u00b6 146 (note 302); Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b674-75.\n\n**Exhibit CLA-013.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-077.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-001.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-046.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-051.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-025**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-083**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-021.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-024.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-144**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-070.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-036.**\n\n**Exhibit CLA-153**\n\n**b) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Lawfulness of the Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nRespondent submits that the mere fact that compensation is yet to be paid does not render the expropriation unlawful, taking into account that Respondent acknowledged its obligation to pay compensation and commenced the expropriation procedure in consistency with its domestic law.602\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6161-173; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6159-168.\n\n583.\n\nRespondent points out that, in his separate opinion in *Sedco v. Iran,* Judge Brower noted:\n\n*\"Likewise I must express doubt as to whether, under customary international law, a State\u2019s mere failure, in the end, actually to have compensated in accordance with the international law standard set forth herein necessarily renders the underlying taking ipso facto wrongful.* *If for example, contemporaneously with the taking the expropriating State provides a means for the determination of compensation which on its face appears calculated to result in the required compensation, but which ultimately does not, or if compensation is immediately paid which, though later found by a tribunal to fall short of the standard, was not on its face unreasonable, it would appear appropriate not to find that the taking itself was unlawful but rather only to conclude that the independent obligation to compensate has not been satisfied.\"603*\n\nCounter-Memorial, **\u00b6** 162; **Exhibit RL-099.** Judge Brower further noted: *\"If, on the other hand, no provision for compensation is made contemporaneously with the taking, or one is made which clearly cannot produce the required compensation, or unreasonably insufficient compensation is paid at the time of taking, it would seem appropriate to deem the taking itself wrongful. It is in such cases that restitutio in integrum may be appropriate as a remedy that, in addition to that, or to a monetary award of damages, should that alternative be selected, a tribunal might consider an award of punitive damages.\"*\n\n584.\n\nMoreover, in *Mondev v. USA,* the tribunal found:\n\n\"[F]or *a taking to be lawful under Article 1110 [NAFTA], at least the obligation to compensate must be recognised by the taking State at the time of the taking, or a procedure must exist at that time which the claimant may effectively and promptly invoke in order to ensure compensation.\"604*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit RL-100.**\n\n585.\n\nFurther, Respondent contends that in *CDSE v. Costa Rica,* the fact that Costa Rica had expropriated the property and had not paid compensation for 20 years did not render the expropriation unlawful.605 In *Amoco,* the tribunal held that there was no unlawful expropriation even though there was no payment of compensation at the time of the taking.606\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit RL-102.**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit CLA-004.**\n\n586.\n\nRespondent also submits that, in *American International Group v. Iran,* the tribunal held that the nationalization of shares in an Iranian insurance company was lawful where Iran had recognized the obligation to compensate, even though no compensation had been paid.607\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit RL-104.**\n\n587.\n\nIn *Southern Pacific Properties v. Egypt,* the tribunal did not consider the expropriation of the claimant unlawful, although no compensation had been paid for 13 years.608\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit CLA-80.**\n\n588.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that in *LIAMCO v. Libya,* the tribunal held that even though no compensation had been paid, the nationalization of the claimant's concession interests was lawful because Libya had recognized its obligation to compensate.609\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit RL-105.**\n\n589.\n\nSimilarly, in *Aminoil v. Kuwait,* the tribunal held that the nationalization of Aminoil\u2019s concession was lawful despite the fact that compensation had not been paid.610\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 162; **Exhibit RL-106.**\n\n590.\n\nFinally, Respondent observes that, analyzing Article 5(2) of the France-Poland Treaty, which is in material respects similar to Article 5(1) of the France-Venezuela Treaty, the tribunal in *Servier v. Poland* specifically found that the question whether the expropriation was legal or not did not turn on whether compensation had been paid.611\n\nRejoinder, 159; **Exhibit RL-165.**\n\n**bb) Compensation Standard to Be Applied**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n591.\n\nRespondent submits that, regardless of whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful, the proper valuation date is prior to the *\"threat of expropriation,\"* as set out in Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty.612 During the Hearing, Respondent emphasized that, while it maintains its position that the expropriation occurred only on 29 March 2011, it nevertheless considers 15 May 2010 to be the correct valuation date because the expropriation was announced by President Ch\u00e1vez on that date.613\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b696, 100.\n\nTranscript (Day 1), p. 239 line 17 - p. 241 line 8, p. 243 lines 1-4.\n\n592.\n\nRespondent refers to the, in its view, clear and unambiguous wording of Article 5(1) sub-paragraph 2 of the Treaty, according to which the value of the expropriated asset is to *\"be assessed in relation to the normal economic situation prevailing before any threat of expropriation was of public knowledge.*\"614 It is Respondent's submission that the reference to *\"[t]outes les mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient \u00eatre prises\", \"[t]odas las medidas de expropiaci\u00f3n que pudieran tomarse\"* (\"[a]*ll measures of expropriation which could be* *taken\")* comprises both lawful and unlawful expropriations and is, in particular, not limited to expropriations in compliance with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 174; Rejoinder, \u00b6190.\n\n593.\n\nRespondent argues that any delay in payment of compensation can be fully compensated by an award of interest and claims that an evaluation of the asset as of the date of the award would impose a pecuniary penalty on Respondent.615 In particular, Respondent contends that Claimant has not established that it suffered any damage that could not be compensated in full by an amount determined as of 15 May 2010.616\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6190; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6175 and 180.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 112.\n\n594.\n\nMoreover, it is Respondent's position that, in case of a mere failure of the State to promptly specify and pay compensation, even the compensation standard under customary international law does not allow for calculating damages by way of *\"constructing a 'but-for' world in which the possibility of expropriation is excluded until the date of the award,\"* as Claimant contends. Respondent refers to the *\"fundamental distinction\"* between a situation in which the expropriation is prohibited no matter how it is carried out and the situation in which the expropriation as such is permitted but the manner in which it is carried out fails to comply with the conditions set out in the treaty.617 According to Respondent, this position is in line with the PCIJ's *Chorzow Factory* decision, which also distinguishes between those two situations.618\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 109.\n\nCounter-Memorial, 177-179; Rejoinder, 193; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 110. **Exhibit CLA-033.**\n\n595.\n\nIn support of its argumentation, Respondent refers in its written submissions,619 in particular, to the cases *Middle East Cement v.

This indicates that the individual circumstances of each case as well as the individual BIT standard played a decisive role for the respective tribunal's finding.\n\n598.\n\nIn the present case, it could be argued, on the one hand, that Respondent's failure to carry out the expropriation in accordance with the compensation requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty renders the expropriation unlawful, z'.e., in violation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty. If the Tribunal were to follow this argument, the label of *\"unlawfulness\"* would not entail any indication that Respondent was precluded from expropriating Norpro Venezuela *per se,* it would simply serve as a synonym for an expropriation that was carried out in breach of a provision that the Contracting Parties agreed on in relation to the manner in which the expropration was supposed to be carried out.\n\n599.\n\nOn the other hand, it must be noted that Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty explicitly stipulates certain conditions under which an expropriation is permitted, *i.e.,* the existence of a public purpose as well as the absence of discriminatory treatment and of a conflict with a particular agreement. This subparagraph does not, however, make any reference to compensation, which is rather addressed in two separate subparagraphs. As a result, it could be argued that there should be a difference between the conditions set out in subparagraph 1, in the absence of which Respondent would have been precluded from expropriating Norpro Venezuela *per se,* and the requirements set out in subparagraphs 2 and 3, which relate to the manner in which the expropriation has to be carried out.\n\n600.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the distinction between a lawful and an unlawful expropriation should not be an end in itself, but the question whether an expropriation is labelled *\"unlawful\"* should rather be considered in light of the consequences resulting from such a finding.\n\n601.\n\nAs noted above, the dispute between the Parties as to these consequences is focused on the question of which compensation standard has to be applied: While a lawful expropriation undisputedly results in an obligation to pay compensation, which is calculated pursuant to the standard set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty, the Parties are in dispute as to whether the same compensation standard also applies in case the Tribunal finds that the expropriation was unlawful.\n\n602.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not appropriate to make a finding on whether the label *\"unlawfulness\"* should be attributed to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela, without at the same time taking into account the consequences that such a finding would have for the compensation standard to be applied. Moreover, this question can be left open if, due to the recent developments on the proppants market, both compensation standards advanced by the Parties would result in the same amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant.\n\n603.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal will now turn to the question whether the compensation standard set out therein also applies in case of a breach of the compensation requirements set out in its subparagraphs 2 and 3.\n\n**bb) Analysis of Article 5(1) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Treaty provides in its original French and Spanish versions:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *\"Les Parties contractantes ne prennent pas de mesures d'expropriation ou de nationalisation ou toutes autres mesures dont l'effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der, directement ou indirectement, les nationaux et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'autre Partie des investissements leur appartenant, sur leur territoire et dans leur zone maritime, si ce n'est pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique et \u00e0 condition que ces mesures ne soient ni discriminatoires, ni contraires \u00e0 un engagement particulier.*  *Toutes les mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient \u00eatre prises doivent donner lieu au paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate dont* *le montant, \u00e9gal \u00e0 leur valeur r\u00e9elle des investissements concern\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la situation \u00e9conomique normale pr\u00e9valant avant que toute menace d'expropriation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique.*  *Cette indemnit\u00e9, son montant et ses modalit\u00e9s de versement sont fix\u00e9s au plus tard \u00e0 la date d'expropriation.

However, such measures can be justified if: (i) they are based on a sufficient public purpose; (ii) they are not discriminatory; and (iii) they are not contrary to a particular agreement. Subparagraphs 2 and 3 provide for additional requirements and/or consequences of an expropriation, namely prompt and adequate compensation (subparagraph 2) as well as specification of the amount and effectiveness of compensation (subparagraph 3).\n\n607.\n\nWhether or not the compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty applies only to an expropriation that is in conformity with the requirements set out in subparagraph 1 and/or the additional requirements set out in the very same subparagrahs 2 and 3 depends in particular on the interpretation of the terms *\"[t]outes les mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient \u00eatre prises\"* / *\"[t]odas las medidas de expropiaci\u00f3n que pudieran tomarse.\"*\n\n608.\n\nOn the one hand, the organization of Article 5(1) with three unnumbered subparagraphs suggests that they must be read to be compatible with each other. While subparagraph 1 contains the requirements *\"in the public interest\"* and *\"neither discriminatory, nor contrary to a particular agreement,\"* it does not make reference to compensation, which is addressed in subparagraphs 2 and 3. It could be argued that \"[a]*ll measures of expropriation which could be taken\"* refers to all *\"lawful\"* measures, *i.e.,* those taken within the terms laid out in Article 5(1) as a whole. This view could further be supported by the fact that the requirements set out in subparagraph 3 are tied, by the words *\"[c]ette indemnit\u00e9\" / \"[e]sa indemnizaci\u00f3n,\"* to the valuation as set out in subparagraph 2. As a result, a failure to fix the amount and payment method of the value as calculated according to subparagraph 2 not later than on the date of expropriation could result in the inapplicability of the compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) because the compensation was not *\"prompt\"* and therefore in breach of this very same provision.\n\n609.\n\nOn the other hand, the structure of Article 5(1) could also be interpreted to distinguish between (substantive) requirements set out in subparagraph 1, in the absence of which the expropriation would be precluded *per se* and thus be *\"unlawful\"* and (additional) compensation requirements set out in subparagraphs 2 and 3, which do not relate to the lawfulness of the expropriation. It could be argued that \"[a]*ll measures of expropriation which could be taken\"* refers to any measures, whether in compliance with Article 5(1) or not, *i.e,* without adding any qualifications extraneous to the text itself. The fact that sub-paragraphs 2 and 3 are linked by the words *\"[c]ette indemnit\u00e9\" / \"[e]sa indemnizaci\u00f3n\"* could also indicate that the absence of such an explicit link between subparagraphs 1 and 2 should be interpreted to mean that the compensation requirements apply to all expropriations.\n\n610.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Tribunal is faced with competing interpretations of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. In particular, the phrase \"[a]*ll measures of expropriation which could be taken\"* and more specifically, the word *\"could,\"* is equally susceptible to two interpretations: either it includes all measures that the State is permitted to take, or it includes all measures that the State could possibly take.\n\n611.\n\nHowever, the question of the precise relationship between the three subparagraphs of Article 5(1) and the compensation standard to be applied need not be decided if, as noted above, both compensation standards advanced by the Parties would result in the same amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant. In this regard, it has to be emphasized that both Parties are in agreement that, in case the date-of-expropriation valuation yields a higher value than the date-of-the-award valuation, the Tribunal should determine the amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant based on the value as of the date of expropriation.634\n\n*Cf.* Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b677; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106.\n\n612.\n\nAs per the Tribunal's request dated 13 August 2015, both Parties instructed their experts to update their date-of-the-award valuations and to evaluate the plant as of 31 August 2015. These Valuation Updates were simultaneously submitted on 22 October 2015,635 and both Parties had the opportunity to simultaneously submit comments on the opposing Party's Valuation Update.636 As per this date, both experts calculated a value of the plant that was lower than the value they had calculated for the plant as of the date of expropriation. Specifically, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller calculated the value of the plant as of 31 August 2015 at USD 90.3 million (compared to USD 99.5 million as of 15 May 2010).637 According to Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, the plant had a negative value ofUSD 27.6 million as of 31 August 2015 (compared to a positive value of USD 9.5 million as of 15 May 2010).638\n\n*See* Claimant's Valuation Update and Respondent's Valuation Update, both dated 22 October 2015.\n\n*See* Claimant's letter and Respondent's letter, both dated 6 November 2015.\n\nGiven Prof. Spiller's approach to consider the lower of (i) the DCF-based value including historical but-for cash flows (if applicable); and (ii) the construction costs for a comparable plant including lost cash flows during the construction period, as the value to be compensated by Respondent, the figure as of 15 May 2010 reflects the construction costs (compared to a DCF-based value ofUSD 116.4 million including the bauxite price increase). By contrast, the value as of 31 August 2015 reflects the DCF-based value (compared to construction costs of USD 94.8 million). *See* Claimant's Valuation Update, Table 1.\n\nIn Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky's calculation, both figures reflect the DCF-based value of the plant including historical but-for cash flows (if applicable). Respondent's Valuation Update, Table 1 and \u00b6 8 (note 18).\n\n613.\n\nIn light of these developments, Claimant explicitly requested in its letter dated 6 November 2015 that it be awarded compensation in the amount ofUSD 99.5 million plus preaward interest, z'.e., the value that it claims Norpro Venezuela had as of 15 May 2010.639\n\nClaimant's letter dated 6 November 2015, p. 3.\n\n614.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding in this context as to whether the compensation standard to be applied is the standard contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty or rather the customary international law standard of restitution. In any event, the amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant will be based on the valuation of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of expropriation, z'.e., 15 May 2010.\n\n**2. Criteria for the Calculation of Damages**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the criteria for the calculation of Claimant's damages. In this context, the Tribunal will first determine the relevant valuation method **(a)),** then determine the criteria for assessing the value of Norpro Venezuela based on that method **(b))** and finally deal with the alleged historical losses associated with the increase of the bauxite price **(c)).**\n\n**a) Valuation Approach**\n-------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent must pay full compensation for the expropriated plant and refers to the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment of 1992 (the **\"World Bank Guidelines\")** pursuant to which compensation for expropriation *\"will be deemed* 'adequate' *if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset.\"640*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 203-204 referring to The World Bank Group, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment* (1992) **(CLA-090),** p. 11.\n\n617.\n\nWhile Claimant maintains that the compensation standard in Article 5(1) of the Treaty is not applicable in the present case, but that compensation must rather be determined in line with the standard of full reparation standard of customary international law, Claimant emphasizes that the Treaty itself reflects the *\"fair market value\"* principle in its standard for calculating the compensation for a lawful expropriation.641\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6197-198 and \u00b6 206; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6143-146.\n\n618.\n\nClaimant also refers to the commentary on the ILC Draft Articles pursuant to which *\"[c]ompensation reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed as the result of an internationally wrongful act is generally assessed on the basis of the* 'fair market value' *of the property lost.\"642*\n\nReply, \u00b6 154 quoting from James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries (2002) **(CLA-027),** p. 225.\n\n619.\n\nClaimant further refers to the definition of fair market value in *Starret Housing Corp v. Iran:*\n\n*\"the price that a willing buyer would buy given goods at and the price at which a willing seller would sell it in on the condition that none of the parties* [is] *under any kind of duress and that both parties have good information about all relevant circumstances involved in the purchase.\"643*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 105 quoting from *Starrett Housing Corp. v. Iran* **(CLA-081), \u00b6** 18.\n\n620.\n\nAs the investment was a *\"going concern*,\" Claimant argues that the assessment of the fair market value must take into account the plant's future profitability and prospects. In this regard, Claimant refers to its expert on quantum, Prof. Spiller, who suggests that a third-party buyer would pay the lower of (i) the net present value of the cash flows that a willing buyer could obtain from acquiring a 100% stake in Norpro Venezuela; and (ii) the opportunity cost that a willing buyer would incur if it constructed a similar plant outside Venezuela, which consists of the sum of construction costs plus the foregone cash flows during the construction period.644\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 155-156 referring to Prof. Spiller's Second Damages Assessment dated 18 June 2014 **(\"Spiller II\"),** \u00b6 5; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 90.\n\n621.\n\nAs to the second approach, Claimant submits that the *\"most accurate information available\"* is the actual construction costs of Claimant's ceramic proppants plant in Little Rock, Arkansas (United States) finished in late 2013 which - like Norpro Venezuela - produces the highest quality bauxite-based ceramic proppants by means of a dry-process technology.645 Claimant argues that apart from the fact that there is no comparable plant in Venezuela, the costs are the same regardless of whether the similar plant is built in the US or in Venezuela because *\"the plants have similar risk-adjusted cost structures\"* and *\"the cost advantages and disadvantages associated with a particular location can offset one another.\"646*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6189-191; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b692 and 93.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b691 and 95.\n\n622.\n\nAccording to the calculation of Prof. Spiller as of 15 May 2010, the opportunity cost for the construction of a similar plant in the US would be lower than the net present value of Norpro Venezuela s future cash flows (USD 99.5 million compared to USD 115.1 million). Consequently, Claimant is of the view that the Tribunal should determine the fair market value of the expropriated plant based on the construction cost approach.647\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6157, 187 and 196; Claimant's letter to the Tribunal dated 6 November 2015; Spiller II, Table 12.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nRespondent agrees that the amount of compensation to be paid should reflect the fair market value of the plant as a going concern, *i.e., \"the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller.\"* Respondent further agrees that this figure can be determined by assessing the *\"projected cash flows [...] based on reasonable assumptions as of May 15, 2010 and discounted to their net present value as of that date using an appropriate discount rate,\"648*\n\nCounter-Memorial, 185-187; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 137.\n\n624.\n\nIn response to Claimant's reliance on the full reparation standard of customary international law, Respondent claims that the standard set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty is *\"consistent with both traditional and contemporary notions* of 'full' *or* 'adequate' *compensation,\"649*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 197.\n\n625.\n\nRespondent sees no need to consider Prof. Spiller's approach to compare the DCF-based valuation with the opportunity costs of constructing a similar plant in any detail because according to its experts on quantum, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, those costs would exceed the price that a willing buyer would pay for Claimant's plant (USD 43.7 million plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010 compared to USD 9.5 million).650\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 188; Rejoinder, 201; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 138 and \u00b6\u00b6 204-208; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 63: Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' Second Expert Report on Quantum **(\"Brailov-sky/Flores II\"), \u00b6\u00b6** 227 and 242.\n\n626.\n\nIn any event, Respondent emphasizes that the asset to be evaluated in the present case is a stand-alone plant in Venezuela, not in the United States, and therefore argues that the only appropriate way of assessing the compensation to be paid to Claimant is to apply a DCF analysis, including a discount rate that accounts for the fact that the plant is located in Venezuela.651 If one were to assess the construction costs, Respondent argues that one would have to assess the costs in Venezuela (not in the US) and based on assumptions *\" consistent with the DCF analysis that is being usedfor comparative purposes.\"652*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 138 and 202.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n627.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes the Parties' agreement that the compensation to be paid by Respondent for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela should reflect the fair market value of the plant as a going concern as of 15 May 2010.653 First, this value reflects the compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, which provides that compensation must be equal to the *\"actual value\" (\"valeur r\u00e9elle\" / \"valor real\")* of the going concern Norpro Venezuela. Second, the fair market value also reflects the compensation standard under customary international law as reflected in the ILC Draft Articles and the World Bank Guidelines. While Article 35 of the ILC Draft Articles provides that, primarily, the State has to make restitution for the damage caused, Article 36 states that, subsidiarily *(\"insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution\"),* the State has to pay compensation, which *\"shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.*\"654 As correctly pointed out by Claimant, the ILC states in the Commentary to Article 36 that \"[c]*ompensation reflecting the capital value ofproperty taken or destroyed as the result of an internationally wrongful act is generally assessed on the basis of the* 'fair market value' *of the property lost.\"655* The World Bank Guidelines similarly provide with regard to expropriations that \"[c]*ompensation will be deemed* 'adequate' *if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset.\"656* Consequently, the Tribunal again does not have to decide on the applicable compensation standard in the present case because both standards require the determination of Norpro Venezuela's fair market value as of 15 May 2010.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties repeatedly refer to *\"the Plant\"* as the expropriated asset. As Respondent correctly stated in its Counter-Memorial (\u00b6\u00b6188), however, the asset to be valued in the present case is *\"the Plant being operated as a going concern.\"* The Tribunal will thus refer to the expropriated asset as *\"Norpro Venezuela\"* or *\"the going concern.\"*\n\nJames Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries (2002) **(CLA-027),** Article 36.\n\nJames Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries (2002) **(CLA-027),** Article 36, 22.\n\nThe World Bank Group, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment* (1992) **(CLA-090),** Section IV, \u00b63.\n\n628.\n\nThe Parties further agree that the fair market value is equal to the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, provided that the buyer is informed about all relevant circumstances and none of the parties is under any kind of duress to sell or to acquire the asset.657 This is confirmed by the World Bank Guidelines, which also refer to the *\"amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller\"* taking into account all relevant circumstances.658\n\n*Cf.* the definition provided by the tribunal in *Starrett Housing Corp. v. Iran,* which has been quoted in paragraph 619 above.\n\nThe World Bank Group, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment* (1992) **(CLA-090),** Section IV, \u00b6 5.\n\n629.\n\nFinally, the Parties are in agreement that, as the plant was a going concern prior to its expropriation, its fair market value can be assessed by calculating the net present value of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows. Consequently, both Parties' experts have calculated the future cash flows of the going concern and then applied a discount rate to those cash flows in order to obtain their net present value.\n\n630.\n\nHowever, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller has advanced a further approach to calculate the value, i.e., by assessing the opportunity cost of constructing a comparable plant in the US (consisting of the construction cost plus lost cash flows during the construction period). According to Prof. Spiller, a willing buyer would pay only the lower of the amounts obtained by applying the DCF-method on the one hand and the construction cost approach on the other hand. Therefore, he has compared the two values and concluded that the construction cost value as of 15 May 2010 (USD 99.5 million) is lower than the DCF value as of that date (USD 115.1 million) and thus reflects the value to be compensated by Respondent.659\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 5 and Table 12.\n\n631.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that Respondent does not contest Prof. Spiller's approach to compare the two values as such but rather (i) claims that the comparison would have to be made to a plant located in Venezuela and consistent with the assumptions applied in the DCF calculation; and (ii) in any event considers the construction cost approach irrelevant in light of its experts' conclusion that the DCF value of Norpro Venezuela (USD 9.5 million) is lower than the opportunity costs of a similar plant in the US (USD 43.7 million plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010).660\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 138 and 202; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 227 and 242.\n\n632.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal wishes to express its doubts as to the general applicability of the approach to determine the fair market value of a particular asset, such as the going concern in this case, by assessing the opportunity cost of constructing a different plant. In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced that, even if the opportunity costs were to be lower than the DCF-based value of Norpro Venezuela, this would result in a lower fair market value of Claimant's investment under any of the compensation standards advanced in this case.\n\n633.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not have to form a definite opinion on the general suitability of this approach because, in any event, the Tribunal considers that the calculations of the opportunity cost performed by the Parties' experts are inconclusive under the present circumstances. Specifically, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a plant located in Little Rock, Arkansas, cannot be compared to the going concern to be evaluated in this arbitration. The same must apply to the comparison made by Respondent's experts to an average of other plants located in the US.\n\n634.\n\nClaimant itself acknowledges that there are *\"cost advantages and disadvantages associated with a particular location\"* but argues that these *\"can offset one another.\"661* The Tribunal is aware that Prof. Spiller explained during the Hearing that he applied an adjustment factor to account for *\"Economies of Scale and Scope Differences,\"* which in his view offset one another.662 However, the Tribunal is not convinced that this adjustment factor accounts for all differences to be taken into account when looking at highly specialized production facilities in two markets, which are as different as the mature US market and the emerging Venezuelan market.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 91.\n\nProf. Spiller's Opening Presentation, slide 32.\n\n635.\n\nAs neither Party alleges that there exists a comparable plant in Venezuela, the Tribunal will therefore disregard the construction cost approach and determine the criteria for assessing the fair market value of Norpro Venezuela on a going concern basis, *i.e.,* based on the DCF calculation performed by the experts of both Parties for the valuation date of 15 May 2010.\n\n**b) DCF-Based Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nWhile the Parties agree that the discounted cash flow analysis is in principle an appropriate method to determine the value of Norpro Venezuela, their experts arrive at significantly differing results for such value as of 15 May 2010, *i.e.,* between USD 115.1 million as calculated by Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller and USD 9.5 million as calculated by Respondent's experts Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky. The biggest point of disagreement between the experts relates to the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows; therefore, the Tribunal will address this issue first **(aa)).** In a second step, the Tribunal will address the additional points of disagreement regarding the calculation of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows **(bb)).** As determined above, the Tribunal will assess both the applicable discount rate and the future cash flows from the perspective of a willing buyer as of 15 May 2010.\n\n**aa) Discount Rate**\n---------------------\n\n**(i) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n637.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied *\"an absurdly high discount rate of 26%,\"* which results in a value that implies that *\"no reasonable investor would invest in a new proppant plant, or add capacity to an existing proppant plant.\"663*\n\nReply, \u00b6 158 quoting from Spiller II, \u00b6 28.\n\n638.\n\nClaimant claims that the 26% discount rate is unprecedented and more than double the discount rate that tribunals typically adopt in ICSID arbitrations. According to Claimant, the US cost of equity they propose is *\"entirely afield of any other estimate found in the record'* and further inconsistent with Claimant's own calculation for the project in 2006, considering that interest rates have fallen since then.664\n\nReply, \u00b6 160; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 103 referring to Prof. Spiller's Opening Presentation, slide 5; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, 73.\n\n639.\n\nIn particular, Claimant rejects Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' use of a 2.66% *\"sizepremium\"* because (i) literature is *\"inconclusive\"* as regards the applicability to foreign investments; (ii) Prof. Damodaran has rejected it as duplicative; and (iii) its application would double count the country risk in Venezuela where Norpro Venezuela cannot be classified as a small company.665 Claimant further rejects the use of a risk-free rate based on the spot yield to maturity of 20-year US Treasury bonds on the valuation date and notes that the 10-year bond used by Prof. Spiller is recommended by Prof. Damodaran and reflects the fact that majority of cash flows in the experts' models are received in ten years or less.666\n\nReply, T(165; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 103 referring to Prof. Spiller's Opening Presentation, slide 22, which quotes the following statement of Prof. Damodaran: *\"Adding a small cap premium strikes me as not only a sloppy (and high error) way of adjusting expected returns but also an abdication of the mission in intrinsic valuation, which is to build up your numbers from fundamentals.\"* **Exhibit CLEX-114,** p. 2. *See* also Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 81.\n\nReply, \u00b6 166; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, 82.\n\n640.\n\nWith regard to the market risk premium (MRP), Claimant alleges that the average historical premium used by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores is not appropriate in light of the proximity of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which *\"distorts the MRP from historical returns.\"* According to Claimant, this development led Prof. Damodaran to replace this method by a recommendation that is based on *\"an extensive study of methods* which still includes the historical average as the highest premium.667\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b676-77 referring to Spiller II, Table 15\n\n641.\n\nClaimant further argues that the *\"exorbitant\"* country risk premium of 13.92% that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied for Venezuela is a *\"desperate way for a State to try to evade responsibility for its actions.* \" According to Claimant, this spike reflects President Chavez's threats to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela without compensation.668 Claimant argues, however, that a State *\"may not use its own propensity to violate the law to reduce the value of compensation for the expropriation.\"669* It therefore takes the position that the *\"generalized threat of confiscation\"* has to be eliminated from the calculation of the fair market value because Respondent would otherwise be rewarded for the unlawful conduct that this arbitration is meant to remedy.670\n\nReply, \u00b6 161; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6104 and \u00b6 111; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 162 quoting from *Occidental v. Ecuador* **(CLA-061),** 564; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 110 referring in particular to *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* **(CLA-152), \u00b6** 841.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6104 and \u00b6111: Claimant's Second Post-Hearing submission, \u00b6 56 and \u00b6 59.\n\n642.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that this logic should apply for both lawful and unlawful expropriations because both the Treaty standard and the customary international law standard require that *\"any valuation of the asset taken eliminate the State's threats to confiscate the asset taken.\"* While acknowledging that the tribunals in *Tidewater v. Venezuela, Mobil v. Venezuela* and *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* have chosen not to follow this approach in case of a lawful expropriation, Claimant claims that no tribunal has done the same in case of a treaty breach and refers in particular to the tribunal's finding in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* that *\"it is not appropriate to increase the country risk premium to reflect the market's perception that a State may have a propensity to expropriate investments in breach of BIT obligations*.\"671 In Claimant's view, a country would otherwise be allowed to *\"benefit from a regime of committing to fair treatment in order to attract foreign investors, and then subsequently revoking those commitments across the board.\"672*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6113 and \u00b6 117 quoting from *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* **(CLA-152), \u00b6** 841. Claimant notes that the tribunal in that cause ultimately applied a country risk premium of 4% for Venezuela. Claimant also refers to the tribunal in *OI European v. Venezuela* who agreed with the claimant that the country risk premium had to exclude the effect of the *\"negative messages in the business environment about potential expropriations\"* put out by Venezuela, but found no evidence that the 6% premium proposed by Venezuela was affected by these negative messages. Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 57 and note 87 referring to *OI European v. Venezuela* **(CLA-156), \u00b6** 782.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 114. *See* also Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 64.\n\n643.\n\nClaimant claims that, unlike the claimant's expert in *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* Prof. Spiller has excluded only the confiscation risk from the country risk premium but appropriately took into account *\"other risks of investing in Venezuela, such as the risks of a volatile* *economy, civil disorder, less developed infrastructure, and other issues.* \" Claimant submits that Prof. Spiller took the average spread of sovereign bonds of countries with a BI rating such as Venezuela, which includes many developing countries with *\"significant country risk, including political risks.\"673*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 105-106; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, 60 and \u00b6 67. Claimant argues that one way to *\"check\"* this is to look at the CDS spreads outstanding on countries' sovereign debts and notes that on Prof. Damodaran's list of 63 countries as of January 2014, Prof. Spiller's proposed premium of 4.5% would rank as the fourth-highest after Argentina (14.73%), Venezuela (10.8%) and Tunisia (4.57%) and thus *\"far above the typical country risk premium in a developing country.\"* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission,\u00b6\u00b6 61-62 referring to **App. BF-66,** pp. 23-25.\n\n644.\n\nClaimant alleges that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' approach based on the Country Risk Rating Model (CRRM), on the other hand, *\"by definition incorporates* [institutional] *investors' perception of the risk of investing in Venezuela under the current politico-economic conditions, including that of uncompensated expropriations.* \" Similarly, Claimant contends that the *\"extremely high\"* Venezuelan sovereign bond spread pursuant to the EMBI Index does not reflect Venezuela's lack of capacity to pay (as reflected in its BI rating) but rather its lack of willingness to pay.674\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6118; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b663.\n\n645.\n\nIn relation to the CRRM, Claimant submits that it is not only *\"inherently unreliable\"* but particularly inapt in the present *\"complex politico-economic situation\"* in Venezuela. In response to the argument that the CRRM has produced *\"constant\"* rates over the last twenty years, Claimant argues that this is inconsistent with Respondent's argument that the country risk has increased since 2005 when Claimant invested in Venezuela and the EMBI was around 2%.675 Claimant also rejects Respondent's argument that the EMBI has been at an average of 10% over the same time period because this time horizon includes a number of *\"outliers\"* in the country's history, which had *\"extreme effect\"* on the government but not on private investors, and therefore renders the EMBI an *\"artificial rate that reflects political expectations rather than economic assessments.\"676*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6120-121.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing submission, 122. Claimant argues that Venezuela is approaching default and refers to the tribunal's finding in *EDF International v. Argentina* that the country debt spread approach becomes *\"an unrealistic measure for a cost of equity calculation\"* when countries approach *\"default-like situations\"* as Argentina did in 2001. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6126 quoting from *EDF International v. Argentina* **(CLA-122), \u00b6\u00b6** 634, 1264, 1266-1268. Claimant further refers to the tribunal in *Sempra Energy v. Argentina,* which found that in 2001, *\"the country risk premium required by an investor in a private company in Argentina was significantly lower than the Governments\u2019 credit risk premium during the same period.\"* Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 128 quoting from *Sempra Energy v. Argentina* **(Exhibit CLEX-106), \u00b6** 433.\n\n646.\n\nTherefore, Claimant concludes that the difference between the country risk premia calculated by Prof. Spiller and Mr. Brailovsky, respectively, is *\"largely attributable to Venezuela's confiscation threats.\"677* It emphasizes that in *OI European v. Venezuela,* Venezuela's own experts calculated a 2010 country risk premium of 6%.678\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6119.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b665 referring to *OI European v. Venezuela* **(CLA-156),** \u00b6\u00b6 772- 773.\n\n647.\n\nClaimant further contends that it also took Venezuela's *\"heightened country risk\"* into account when it assigned a discount rate of 15% to the project in 2006 and undertook significant efforts to secure meaningful support of the Venezuelan Government, in reliance on the fact that the France-Venezuela Treaty had entered into force in 2004.679 Claimant emphasizes that the *\"high risk\"* discount rate of 12%, which included a country risk premium of 4%, was not assigned by the members of the project team (they even added a further 3% *\"to be conservative\"),* but rather served as a *\"company-wide objective measure to consider the potential risks and rewards of proposed ventures in various locations.\"680*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6107, \u00b6 116 and \u00b6 130.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6131-134 referring to the oral testimony of its witness Patrick Millot. Transcript (Day 2), p. 428 lines 14-17 and p. 438 lines 13-16.\n\n648.\n\nIn Claimant's view, an investor like Saint-Gobain is *\"immune from the vast majority of risk factors\"* that are included in Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' country risk premium. Claimant contends that (i) the proppants produced by Norpro Venezuela's activity were to be exported under a long-term take-or-pay contract; (ii) Norpro Venezuela had concluded long-term supply contracts for bauxite and energy; and (iii) Venezuela's sovereign credit risk, which forms the basis for Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' calculation, is influenced by its risk of entering into default and therefore does not accurately reflect the country risk of Claimant's long-term, non-speculative investment in Venezuela.681\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 163-164.\n\n649.\n\nIn Claimant's view, particularly the fact that Norpro Venezuela derived more than 80% of its revenues from exports made it subject to a lower country risk than the average Venezuelan company, which has to face the stagnant consumer demand. Claimant refers to a statement made by Prof. Damodaran that *\"[t]he most obvious determinant of a company's risk exposure to country risk is how much of the revenues it derives from the country.\"682* Claimant further emphasizes that Norpro Venezuela was not a natural resources company but a manufacturing company *\"twice removed from the oil industry\"* and thus was not affected by the *\"typical reasons for political risk\"* affecting oil companies.683 As to the further risks invoked by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, Claimant claims that they either do not apply to Norpro Venezuela or they were already taken into account in the country risk premium as derived by Prof. Spiller from the sovereign bond rating.684\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 136-139 quoting from **Exhibit CLEX-108.**\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 140-141.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6142-144.\n\n**(ii) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n650.\n\nRespondent submits that the discount rate calculated by Prof. Spiller would be *\"low even for a company such as Norpro Venezuela operating in a mature economy.* \" Respondent argues that (i) Prof. Spiller deviated from the risk-free-rate suggested by Ibbotson/Mom-ingstar for long-term projects, i.e., the 20-year US Treasury bond yield as of the valuation date; (ii) he deviated from the general market risk premium (MRP) calculated by Ibbot-son/Momingstar; and (iii) he *\"ignore [f] the empirical evidence establishing that the CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of equity for financial assets,\"* which is corrected by the *alpha* coefficient.685\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6234-236; Rejoinder, \u00b6206. For an overview of the diffences regarding the US cost of equity components, *see* also the table in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, following 140.\n\n651.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that it is appropriate to use the 20-year US Treasury bond as the risk-free rate in this case, given the *\"perpetuity\"* nature of the cash flows that are being valued.686 Second, Respondent claims that the view of Prof. Damodaran as to the appropriate MRP that Prof. Spiller relies on *\"fluctuates from year to year and sometimes even within the same year, is not based on an analysis of the underlying empirical data, and cannot be replicated.*\"687 Respondent further refers to the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* which determined that an equity risk premium of 6.5% was reasonable in a valuation as of May 2009.688 Third, Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that the *alpha* coefficient is a size premium and notes that this coefficient, while *\"more pronounced in small companies (which is why it attracts the* 'size premium' *label),\"* applies to companies of all sizes. In any event, Respondent claims that Norpro Venezuela would indeed qualify as a small company in the US, which is why the *alpha* coefficient should be added to the US cost of equity.689\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 141; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 118.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 142 quoting from *Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207),** \u00b6 181.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 145; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 120.\n\n652.\n\nRespondent contends that these differences cause Prof. Spiller's estimate of the cost of equity in the US to be considerably lower than *\"a range of independent results for SIC Code 1381, using the basic CAPM and varations thereon,\"* which are very similar to the cost of equity estimated by Respondent's experts and in fact almost equal to the total discount rate applied by Prof. Spiller.690\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 237 referring to Brailovsky/Flores I, Table 10; Rejoinder, 204 referring to Brailovsky/Flores II, Table 15 and \u00b6 205; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 147; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35. As to the numbers presented by Prof. Spiller during the Hearing, Respondent contends that the source he relies on are \"irrelevant to the determination of the discount rate in this case,\" as Claimant's internal estimate dates of 2005 and the round figures derived from two analyst reports indicate that they were not the result of detailed calculations but simply part of a \"buy\" recommendation and further relate to the market for financial instruments, which is \"entirely different\" from the market for physical assets. Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 36.\n\n653.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the biggest difference between the experts' estimates, however, concerns the applicable country risk premium. Respondent claims that this premium is *\"far higher\"* than the 4.5% applied by Prof. Spiller, which in fact does not reflect Venezuelan country risk but rather the default risk on US corporate bonds.691 Respondent refers to the calculations of its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores who primarily relied on the Country Risk Rating Model (CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Momingstar and cross-checked their results by using the so-called *\"bludgeon method\"* devised by Prof. Damodaran.692\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 240; Rejoinder, 207 and \u00b6 228. In Respondent's view, Prof. Spiller should at least have used corporate bonds from other emerging countries with the same rating as Venezuela, which would have resulted on a spread of about 9%. Rejoinder, \u00b6 221; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 169.\n\nRespondent submits that its experts used the same methodology to determine the appropriate discount rate for both valuation dates. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 259.\n\n654.\n\nIn response to Claimant's criticism on the CRRM, Respondent refers to Prof. Ibbotson who stated that the CRRM has the following advantages over other cost of equity models: *\" 1. Breadth of coverage; 2. Reasonable results; 3. Stability of results.\"693* Respondent further refers to its experts who demonstrate that the results the CRRM has produced over the last 20 years for Venezuela are stable and in line with Prof. Damodaran's methodology.694\n\nRejoinder, 212 quoting from Ibbotson/Momingstart, SBBI2013 Valuation Yearbook **(App. BF-44),** pp. 136-137.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 213 referring to Brailovsky/Flores, Figure 19.\n\n655.\n\nWith regard to Claimant's criticism on the EMBI spread that Respondent's experts used to derive the yield on Venezuela's sovereign debt over the US treasury bond yield, Respondent acknowledges that the spread is indeed *\"very high\"* but argues that it is in no way comparable to an actual default situation as Argentina experienced in 2001 through 2003 when the EMBI increased to 50% and more.695\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6216-217 referring to Brailovsky/Flores, Figure 20.\n\n656.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent claims that the 4.5% premium applied by Prof. Spiller does not reflect Prof. Damodaran's methodology because Prof. Damodaran's interactive spreadsheet demonstrates that his *\"best estimate\"* is actually based on the *\"bludgeon method,\"* including the application of the 1.5 multiplier, and is thus in line with the estimate of Respondent's experts.696 According to Respondent, Prof. Damodaran establishes in his writings *\"a hierarchy of methods to derive a country default spread\"* and states that if a country has USD-denominated bonds, the default spread should be derived by looking at the yield of those bonds over the risk-free bond in the same currency or the spread in the CDS market. Respondent further claims that Prof. Damodaran suggests the alternative approach based on comparably rated US corporate bonds *(\"synthetic spread\")* only *\"as a last resort\"* in case the country in question - unlike Venezuela - does not have USD-denominated bonds.697\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 243-244 referring to the spreadsheet from June 2013 **(App. BF-65);** Rejoinder, 210 referring to Brailovsky/Flore II, Table 10 and the spreadsheet from January 2014 **(App. BF-66).**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 246; Rejoinder, \u00b6 208 referring to *Aswath Damodaran,* Equity Risk Premiums (ERP): Determinants, Estimation and Implications - The 2013 Edition, updated: March 2013 **(App. BF-64),** pp. 53, 55; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 168; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b645-47.\n\n657.\n\nRespondent claims that Prof. Damodaran's preferred method is an *\"obvious first choice\"* because *\"specific data for the country in question is undoubtedly a better indicator of [the market's perception of] risk than a synthetic indicator.* \" According to Respondent, both Venezuela's EMBI spread and its spread in the CDS market would have yielded a default spread of about 10%, to be converted into an equity risk premium of about 15%. According to Respondent, the same applies to the second method advanced by Prof. Damodaran, *i.e.,* the *\"Average (Normalized) spread on bond,\"* as the average spread on Venezuela's sovereign bonds over the entire life of the EMBI since 1993 was 10%.698\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6164-166; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 47.\n\n658.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimant's allegation that Norpro Venezuela was immune from the majority of risk factors reflected in the country risk premium and claims that none of the arguments advanced by Claimant materially influences Norpro Venezuela's risk exposure. As to the exporter argument, Respondent refers to its experts' statement that\" [c]*ountry risk is a much larger concept than exposure to domestic demand, involving taxation, regulation and other government actions in the economy, especially in the hydrocarbon sector\"* and adds *\"the disproportionate effect of natural phenomena such as storms, floods and droughts.*\"699 Respondent further notes that the invoked long-term contracts expire in 2016 (gas and electricity) and 2018 (bauxite) without any automatic right of renewal or a guaranteed price under a renewal and, in any event, they would not protect Norpro Venezuela from a disruptions in supply. Finally, Respondent alleges that the existence of the France-Venezuela BIT has *\"no discernible impact on the country risk assessment\"* as confirmed by political risk insurers.700\n\nRejoinder, 226 quoting from Brailovsky/Flores, \u00b6 201; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175.\n\nRejoinder, 226 referring to Brailovsky/Flores, Figure 23 and **App. BF-166;** Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 177-179.\n\n659.\n\nIn Respondent's view, there are therefore no factors specific to Norpro Venezuela that would reduce its country risk exposure compared to the average Venezuelan company but, *\"if anything, the factors relating to Norpro Venezuela would increase it.\"* Respondent refers to the possibility of exchange controls on the export of raw materials and further to Prof. Damodaran's statement that \"[a] *company can be exposed to country risk, even if it derives no revenues from that country, if its production facilities are in that country.\"701* Respondent quotes from the oral testimony of Mr. Brailovsky, who stated that *\"natural resource projects, particularly oil or oil-related, bear more Country Risk than the average company\"* and cited as an example the suspension of bauxite supply combined with import restrictions.702\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 172-175 quoting from.Aswath *Damodaran,* Measuring Company Exposure to Country Risk: Theory and Practice, September 2003 **(App. BF-55),** p. 18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 176 quoting from Transcript (Day 4), p. 1142.\n\n660.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the valuation must exclude the impact of the actual expropriation of the plant, Respondent argues that this *\"should not be confused with the expropriation risk inherent in any project from its very inception,\"* which is part of the *\"normal economic situation prevailing\"* prior to the announcement of the expropriation of the plant and therefore also a risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its assessment of the purchase price it would be willing to pay for the plant.703\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6227.\n\n661.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty requires compensation to be equal to the *\"actual value,\" i.e.,* the fair market value, of the plant, which takes into account *\"all of the generalized risks associated with an investment in Venezuela,\"* including *\"the risk that after the acquisition is completed, Venezuela might expropriate and either not compensate at all or compensate only in an amount and in a manner that the buyer might deem unfair.\"704*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 148. In Respondent's view, Claimant's position on the risk of *\"uncompensated expropriation\"* remains unclear because it could either include each case in which the obligation to compensate or the amount to be paid is in dispute, i.e., every case litigated under bilateral investment treaties, or it could be limited to cases in which the State refuses to acknowledge its compensation obligation and to participate in the determination of the amount due - which is not the case here. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 149.\n\n662.\n\nContrary to what Claimant appeared to suggest during the Hearing, Respondent is of the view that the determination of fair market value does not change depending on whether the expropriation is lawful or unlawful. According to Respondent, the willing buyer would be indifferent to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the expropriation because the particular expropriation is to be excluded from the buyer's consideration. Respondent adds that the buyer would, however, take into account the underlying risks, including the risk of expropriation without compensation that the buyer deems adequate.705\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 150-152.\n\n663.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal's finding in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* that the claimant's expert, who had advanced the same argument as in the present case, *\"conflates two separate elements in a legal claim of this kind,\" i.e.,* the question of liability and the economic question as to the value that the market would attribute to the investment in question; the tribunal then referred to the World Bank Guidelines, which *\"specifically invite a consideration of'the,* risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances'.\"706 Respondent further quotes the tribunal's following statement:\n\n*\"This is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its own wrong. On the contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empowered by virtue of the Treaty to award are designed to ensure that the private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But, in determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis, the Tribunal should consider the value that a willing buyer would have placed on the investment. In determining this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associated with investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. [...] Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including political risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow of the business going forward.\"707*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 153-155 quoting from *Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207), \u00b6\u00b6** 184-185. Respondent notes that the tribunal found in that case that the failure to pay compensation did not render the expropriation unlawful.\n\n*Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207), \u00b6** 186. Respondent submits that the Tidewater tribunal then adopted the approach by Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky who also acted as Venezuela's experts in that case and used the same approach as in this case, i.e., the CRRM benchmarked against Prof. Damodaran's bludgeon method, and thus concludes that a country risk premium of 14.75% was a *\"reasonable, indeed conservative, premium.\"* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156 quoting from *Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207), \u00b6** 190.\n\n664.\n\nRespondent argues that the country risk premium must be based on the buyer's perception of risk; the elimination of the risks inherent to an investment in Venezuela would result in *\"the use of a discount rate that a willing buyer would not use and derive a value that a willing buyer would not pay, thereby granting Claimant a windfall that it could never achieve in an arm's-length transaction.\"* In Respondent's view, this would further be punitive to Venezuela and thus *\"impermissible under any theory of compensation in international law.\"708*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 157.\n\n665.\n\nAs to Claimant's emphasis during the Hearing on the 15% discount rate reflected in its 23 October 2006 DAC, Respondent notes that the significance and purpose of this rate remains unclear and further argues that at that time, Venezuela's default risk was *\"at one of its all-time lowest points\"* with the yield of its sovereign bonds being only 2.18% higher than US Treasury bonds. At that point, Respondent submits, the 3% country risk premium could have been justified. More importantly, however, Respondent emphasizes that Claimant took Venezuelan default risk into account in its assessment of the country risk, just like a buyer would in its assessment of an appropriate discount rate for determining the fair market value of the plant. In Respondent's view, there is then no reason for excluding such risk when the risk increased with the passage of time.709\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 158-162. Respondent further notes that the same document reflects that Claimant was willing to invest in Venezuela at an internal rate of return of 26.4%. Therefore, Respondent argues that, while still being 3% higher than Prof. Spiller's discount rate, the 15% discount rate is not relevant in this case. Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, note 132.\n\n666.\n\nRespondent further claims that *\"there is no way to isolate, and thus quantify\"* the risk of uncompensated expropriation. According to Respondent, Prof. Spiller did not propose any method to do so in his expert reports but argued only at the Hearing that one could take the difference between the EMBI spread for Venezuela and his 4.5% country risk premium. Respondent takes the position that Prof. Spiller's argument is based on his flawed understanding of Prof. Damodaran's hierarchy of methods and argues that *\"country risk is composed of elements that are mutually interrelated and influence one another, and therefore are not separable\"710*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6163-164, 171.\n\n667.\n\nIn response to Claimant's allegation that Venezuela's sovereign spread was too wide because it openly declared that it would not comply with its international obligations, Respondent notes that Claimant cannot cite any evidence for those *\"incredible propositions\"* and claims that *\"Venezuela has not defaulted on any of its sovereign debt obligations, and Venezuela has paid compensation in its expropriation cases,\"711*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b639-42.\n\n668.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimant's argument that Prof. Spiller took into account country-specific risks except for the risk of uncompensated expropriation and claims that he just applied an assumption that every country with a BI rating could be assigned a 4.5% yield spread, without doing any analysis whether this actually reflected the average sovereign bond spread of other countries with the same rating.712 In particular, Respondent emphasizes that Prof. Spiller did not assess the yield on developing countries with the same rating that Claimant refers to but simply accepted Prof. Damodaran's 4.5% spread applied to all BI-rated countries on the assumption that their sovereign ratings are comparable to US corporate ratings. According to Respondent, however, the yields for those 15 countries according to the CRRM were actually around 15%, just like the yield for Venezuela.713\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b643-44.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b648-51.\n\n**(iii) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------------\n\n669.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties and their experts that the discount rate is derived by (i) determining the cost of equity for a proppants plant in the US using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), consisting of the risk-free rate plus a market risk premium; (ii) adding a country risk premium for Venezuela; and (iii) taking into account the debt-to-equity ratio of the cost of capital.714\n\nSpiller I, Appendix C; Spiller II, \u00b6 3 1 and \u00b6 139; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 235 referring to Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6179-180; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6154-155.\n\n670.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore follow this structure in the present analysis and determine in a first step the cost of equity for a company in the same business as Norpro Venezuela in the US by assessing the risk-free rate in the US ((1)); and the market risk premium in the US, consisting of a general market risk premium, a *beta* coefficient and, possibly, an *alpha* coefficient **((2)).** In a second step, the Tribunal will determine the applicable country risk premium to account for the fact that the plant is not located in the US but rather in Venezuela **((3)).** Finally, the Tribunal will convert the so derived equity risk premium into the discount rate for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the basis of Norpro Venezuela's debt-to-equity ratio **((4)).**\n\n**(1) Risk-Free Rate in the US**\n--------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nThe first element of the cost of equity for a company operating in the US is the risk-free rate. Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller used the average yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rate during the 12 months preceding the valuation date, which amounted to 3.6% as of 15 May 2010.715 Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on the 20-year US Treasury bond rate prevailing on the valuation date, i.e., on 15 May 2010, which amounted to 4.1%.716 The experts thus agree on the use of the US Treasury bond but differ as to the appropriate maturity and the point in time or term over which the yield is to be taken into account.\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6156; Spiller II, \u00b6 148.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 184; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 221.\n\n672.\n\nProf. Spiller explained his choice by stating that the 10-year bond is more liquid and less sensitive to unexpected changes in inflation than bonds with a longer maturity and thus avoids *\"a non-risk-based upward bias\"* to the cost of capital. He added that the use of the 10-year bond is recommended by academics and practitioners for long-term valuation purposes *\"fundamentally, but not exclusively, because of duration matching.\"* Prof. Spiller further stated that he used the 12-month average yield because it smoothes out volatilities resulting from short-term fluctuations and is thus more stable and reliable than the spot yield on the valuation date.717\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6156; Spiller II, \u00b6\u00b6149-151 referring to **Exhibits CLEX-180, CLEX-181** and **CLEX-17.**\n\n673.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that the 20-year bond on the valuation date is recommended by Ibbotson/Momingstar for long-term projects and is thus appropriate for a DCF valuation of cash flows that continue in perpetuity. As to their choice of the yield on the valuation date, they stated that it gives credit to the notion of fair market value, which requires a valuation *\"immediately before the time at which the taking occurred,\"* and the fact that an actual transaction cannot be based on a 365-day average.718\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6184-185 referring to **App. BF-42,** p. 5 and quoting from the World Bank Guidelines **(App. BF-43),** Chapter 4, \u00b6 3.\n\n674.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not respond to Prof. Spiller's statement that the 10-year bond is the more commonly recommended measure of the risk-free rate, which is particularly due to duration matching. While the Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that the 20-year bond reflects the duration because the present valuation assumes that cash flows will be generated in perpetuity,719 it must be noted that this is usually the case in DCF valuations and therefore does not justify a deviation from a commonly recommended measure. In addition, Claimant correctly points out that the majority of Norpro Venezuela's expected future cash flows would have been generated in the next ten years and thus within the duration of the 10-year bond.720\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 146.\n\n*Cf.* Reply, \u00b6 166.\n\n675.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with Prof. Spiller that the use of a spot yield on a certain date is less reliable than a 12-month average because it may reflect short-term or even daily fluctuations. The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that the recommendation contained in the World Bank Guidelines to determine fair market value *\"immediately\"* prior to the expropriation makes it necessary to consider only the spot yield on the valuation date. While it is of course the purpose of this valuation to determine the purchase price that a willing buyer would have paid on that date, the Tribunal considers it doubtful that a willing buyer would have based its assessment of the risk-free rate exclusively on data from that day, given that the buyer would be interested to obtain a reliable result for its long-term investment.\n\n676.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal follows Prof. Spiller's approach to determine the risk-free rate based on the 12-year average yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond rate, which results in a risk-free rate of 3.6% as of 15 May 2010.\n\n**(2) Market Risk Premium in the US**\n-------------------------------------\n\n677.\n\nThe second element to be determined for the US cost of equity is the market risk premium, which consists of a general market risk premium multiplied by an industry-specific *beta* coefficient. It is in dispute between the Parties and their experts whether this premium should then be increased by a further *alpha* coefficient.\n\n**General Market Risk Premium**\n-------------------------------\n\n678.\n\nAs for the general market risk premium, Prof. Spiller relied on the recommendation of a prominent scholar in the field, Prof. Damodaran, to apply a premium of 4.5% for the year 2010.721 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on Ibbotson/Momingstar's use of the arithmetic mean over historical market risk premia as from 1926, which resulted in a general market risk premium of 6.7% as of 15 May 2010.722\n\nSpiller I,\u00b6\u00b6 157-158; Spiller II, \u00b6 152.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 186; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 221.\n\n679.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the market risk premium is *\"commonly estimatedfrom historical data using the largest historical period available\"* Prof. Spiller explained that the financial crisis in 2008-2009 tends to distort the results of this method in light of the large negative returns suffered during this period, which made the historical average fall, which is why Prof. Damodaran suspended his practice of using historical returns and replaced it with the above recommendation.723 Prof. Spiller further referred to various scholars taking the position that the discount factor for long-term projects should be determined by using the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean applied by Respondent's experts.724 Finally, he noted that the market risk premium derived by Respondent's experts is not supported by any recent research, which yielded much lower results, e.g., a 2011 study conducted by Dimson *et al.* that resulted in a world-wide market risk premium of 3-3.5% on a geometric mean basis and 4-4.5% on an arithmetic mean basis.725\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6 157 referring to **Exhibits CLEX-71** and **CLEX-72;** Spiller II, 152 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-72.**\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 153-156 quoting from **Exhibits CLEX-84, CLEX-181, CLEX-185** and **CLEX-72.**\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 157-158 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-186.** Prof. Spiller's other references concern market risk premia for 2014, which are in the range of 4.14-6.18%. *Cf.* Spiller II, \u00b6\u00b6158-161 and Table 15.\n\n680.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that they used the historic average to *\"reduce as much as possible the variability of the mean estimate,\"* while Prof. Spiller simply relied on the opinion of Prof. Damodaran. They further noted that, for the US, Dimson *et al.* actually estimated an arithmetic market risk premium of 6.4-7.2% for 2011, which is in line with their estimate for 2010.726 Finally, they stated that the scholars referred to by Prof. Spiller do not generally favor the geometric mean over the arithmetic mean and referred to further scholars who prefer the arithmetic mean.727\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 186; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 221 referring to **App. BF-170,** p. 169.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 221 referring to **App. BF-171,** p. 156, **BF-172,** p. 56 and **BF-173,** p. 159.\n\n681.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller in principle acknowledged the approach used by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores as a recognized and commonly used method to determine the market risk premium. While the Tribunal is of course aware that the financial crisis in 2008-2009 had a serious impact on the US stock market, it is not convinced by Prof. Spiller's argument that falling returns in the stock market have necessarily rendered the historic average unreliable. In particular, the Tribunal notes that, while falling returns may indeed have led to a suggestion that investors were willing to invest at lower returns and thus lower risk premia, this does not explain why the risk premium derived by Respondent's experts from the historical average is higher than the recommendation provided by Prof. Damodaran.\n\n682.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers the data from proven market developments over a time period of more than 80 years more reliable than the recommendation of one scholar. While it is undisputed that Prof. Damodaran is a highly accomplished authority in this regard, this does not elevate his recommendation above the necessity for an evidentiary basis supporting Prof. Spiller's choice. In the document that Prof. Spiller relied on, Prof. Damodaran simply states that \"[a]s *risk premiums came down in 2009, I moved back to using a 4.5% equity risk premium for mature markets in 2010\"728* In the Tribunal's view, this statement cannot be considered sufficient to justify a deviation from an established method.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-72,** p. 77.\n\n683.\n\nWhile Prof. Spiller did refer to additional sources in his second report, there is only one document, the study of Dimson *et al.* dating from 2011, which can provide relevant information for the valuation date of 15 May 2010. In this regard, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores correctly pointed out, however, that the figures presented by Prof. Spiller (3-3.5% geometric mean; 4-4.5% arithmetic mean) do not relate to the US market but rather to a world-wide analysis of different markets.729 They further pointed to a different document authored by the same scholars dating from the same year, which reports higher figures for the US market (4.4-5.3% geometric mean; 6.4-7.2% arithmetic mean).730 Therefore, the Tribunal does not have any evidence before it that would support Prof. Damodaran's estimate for 2010.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-186**\n\n**App. BF-170**\n\n684.\n\nAs to the dispute between the Parties relating to the question whether it is appropriate to use the geometric mean or rather the arithmetic mean of a certain method, it appears to the Tribunal that this is a disputed issue among scholars. The Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with the geometric mean of the historical premia for the valuation date of 15 May 2010. However, the Ibbotson/Momingstar report on which Respondent's experts relied as a source for their 6.7% premium provides for different premia for shortterm, mid-term and long-term horizons, with 6.7% being the premium for the long-term horizon. In light of the fact that both Parties's experts rely on data from Ibbotson/Momingstar in relation to various aspects of their calculation, the Tribunal has no reason to consider Ibbotson/Momingstar's choice to derive the equity risk premium on the basis of the arithmetic mean unwarranted.\n\n685.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal follows Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' approach to derive the general market risk premium for the US from the arithmetic mean of the historical premia since 1926, which results in a premium of 6.7% for the valuation as of 15 May 2010.\n\n**Industry-specific** ***Beta*** **Coefficient**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n686.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties and their experts that the general market risk premium has to be multiplied by an industry-specific component, z'.e., the *beta* coefficient. They further agree that the appropriate raw *beta* for Norpro Venezuela is to be derived from SIC Code 1381 Drilling Oil and Gas Wells, as calculated by Ibbotson/Momingstar.731 The Parties' experts also use the same method for adjusting and levering the raw *beta* in order to arrive at the final *beta* to be used for the present purposes.732\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 236; Spiller I, \u00b6 161; Brailovsky/Flores I, note 318 and \u00b6 190.\n\nSpiller 1,162-164; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 191.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is a difference between the Parties' experts with regard to the particular raw *beta* they chose from the Ibbotson/Momingstar data. While Prof. Spiller used the 5-year average of the composite company,733 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on the median raw *beta.734* However, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion on this issue because both the composite and the median raw *beta* as reported by Ibbotson/Momingstar for March 2010 amount to 1.3, which results in an adjusted levered *beta* of 1.2.735\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 190.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 147; Brailovsky/Flores II, Table 8; Ibbotson/Momingstar, Statistics for SIC Code 1381, Drilling Oil and Gas Wells, 31 March 2010 **(App. BF-37).**\n\n688.\n\nFor its valuation of Norpro Venezuela as of 15 May 2010, the Tribunal will thus multiply the general market risk premium by an industry-specific factor of 1.2.\n\n***Alpha*** **Coefficient**\n---------------------------\n\n689.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has to deal with the question whether the industry-specific market risk premium has to be increased by a further *alpha* coefficient, as alleged by Respondent.\n\n690.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores explain that the CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of capital for financial assets and therefore has to be adjusted to capture the actual performance of the stocks of publicly traded companies, z'.e., the *alpha* coefficient. Despite their view that Norpro Venezuela qualifies as a small company within the industry captured in SIC Code 1381, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores emphasized that they used the *alpha* for the median company, as reported by Ibbotson/Momingstar for March 2010, i.e., 1.3%.736 They explained that the *alpha* accounts for *\"systemic volatilities of companies both large and small\"* and noted that, even though *\"many practitioners, including Prof. Spiller, forget this finding\"* the *alpha* is routinely reported by financial data services providers such as Bloomberg.737 While acknowledging that the *alpha* is greater in smaller companies, which is why it is also labelled *\"sizepremium\", e.g.,* by Ibbotson/Morningstar, they stated that large companies may also have a significant *alpha,* which is why it should be added to the market risk premium.738\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6192-193; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6206-207; Ibbotson/Momingstar, Statistics for SIC Code 1381, Drilliing Oil and Gas Wells, 31 March 2010 **(App. BF-37).**\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6209-213.\n\nBrailobsky/Flores I, \u00b6 192; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 214.\n\n691.\n\nProf. Spiller considered it inappropriate to add a *\"size premium\"* to the market risk premium and noted that it is contested among financial practitioners and academics, including Prof. Damodaran. With reference to various scholars, he further stated that the *alpha* has been found to be *\"empirically unreliable across regions and time periods\"* and is understood to reflect underlying market risk factors rather than the inherent effect of size.739 In addition, Prof. Spiller took the view that the addition of a *\"size premium\"* would potentially be duplicative of the country risk premium because Venezuelan firms are smaller than firms in the US and Norpro Venezuela cannot be qualified as a small or even medium company within Venezuela.740\n\nSpiller II, 48-49 referring to **Exhibits CLEX-113** through **CLEX-119,**\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52 and Table 6.\n\n692.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are two issues to be distinguished with regard to the *alpha* coefficient: (i) whether it reflects in general an established phenomenon to be accounted for the cost of equity; and (ii) whether it would in this particular case be duplicative of country risk to be determined in the next section.\n\n693.\n\nAs to the second argument, the Tribunal is not convinced that the *alpha* coefficient amounts to a size premium for smaller companies, which would be double-counting the fact that companies in Venezuela are in general smaller than US companies. While it is apparent from the Ibbotson/Morningstar data and also acknowledged by Respondent's experts that the *alpha* is greater for smaller companies than for larger companies, Prof. Spiller also recognized that the *alpha* does not capture an inherent size effect but rather underlying market risk factors. These factors may be more pronounced for smaller companies but they do exist for larger companies as well. Contrary to what Claimant appears to suggest, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not apply the *alpha* for the small composite but rather chose the median. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant thus has failed to establish that the application of the median *alpha* would be duplicative of the country risk for Norpro Venezuela.\n\n694.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is aware of Prof. Spiller's general criticism of the *alpha,* which is supported by various references to scholars and practitioners. The Tribunal also notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores even acknowledged that *\"manypractitioners [...] forget\"* to apply the *alpha* coefficient to the market risk premium. It therefore appears to be undisputed that the *alpha* cannot be considered a well-established element of determining the market risk premium. On the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal is thus not convinced that the *alpha* coefficient should be added to the US cost of equity rate.\n\n**Conclusion on Cost of Equity for a Company in the US**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n695.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal's findings result in the following cost of equity for a company in the US as of 15 May 2010: (i) a risk-free rate of 3.6%; plus (ii) a market risk premium of 8%, consisting of the general market risk premium of 6.7%, to be multiplied by the industry-specific *beta* coefficient of 1.2. For the reasons laid out above, the Tribunal does not make any further addition in relation to an *alpha* coefficient.\n\n696.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the US cost of equity to be used to determine the applicable discount rate in this case amounts to 11.6%.\n\n**(3) Country Risk Premium for Venezuela**\n------------------------------------------\n\n697.\n\nThe Parties agree that the cost of equity as determined above for a company in the US operating in the same business as Norpro Venezuela has to be increased by a country risk premium to account for the fact that the plant is located in Venezuela. However, the Parties' experts have applied different methods to determine this country risk premium, which lead to significantly differing results.\n\n698.\n\nProf. Spiller relied on a method devised by Prof. Damodaran, which is based on the local currency sovereign rating assigned to Venezuela by Moody's (BI as of 15 May 2010), converted into a default spread pursuant to Prof. Damodaran's estimate for the BI rating class (4.5% in 2010). Prof. Spiller applied this default spread as the country risk premium without making any further adjustments for equity risk.741\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6\u00b6165-166; Spiller II, \u00b6 33 relying on **Exhibit CLEX-75.**\n\n699.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores primarily relied on the Country Risk Rating Model (CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Momingstar, which is based on an ongoing survey of 75-100 bankers conducted every six months by the publication *Institutional Investor.* In this survey, the bankers are asked to rate 170 countries on a scale of 0 to 100 and the editors of *Institutional Investor* weigh the responses based on their perception of the banks' level of global performance and sophistication of their credit research methods. These country risk ratings are then converted into equity discount rates based on a study conducted by Erb, Harvey and Viskanta, which is updated on a regular basis. For Venezuela, the CRRM resulted in a country equity risk premium of 14.3% as of 15 May 2010.742\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6197-199.\n\n700.\n\nFor cross-checking purposes, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further used the so-called *\"bludgeon method\"* devised by Prof. Damodaran, which is based on the spread on Venezuela's sovereign bond denominated in US Dollars. They chose JP Morgan's Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI), which measures the difference between the USD-nominated sovereign bond yields of Venezuela and those of the US and amounted to 10.26% as of 15 May 2010. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores then applied the global multiplier (1.5) suggested by Prof. Damodaran to account for the fact that investment in equity is riskier than investment in bonds and arrived at a country risk premium of 15.4% as of 15 May 2010.743\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6201-204.\n\n701.\n\nWhile acknowledging that experts may disagree on data and methodology, Prof. Spiller stated that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' choice does not reflect Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure because they failed to take into account three factors specific for its business: (i) Norpro Venezuela exported its products and was therefore not subject to domestic demand conditions and risks; (ii) it had secured the supply of its key production inputs through long-term contracts with State-owned companies; and (iii) it was protected by a bilateral investment treaty, which requires that risks related to expropriation and *\"crisis conditions\"* be excluded from the present valuation.744 According to Prof. Spiller, Venezuela's current *\"very high\"* EMBI spreads reflect the possibility of it entering into default due to its lack of willingness to pay its obligations, but not the company-specific risks faced by a private long-term investor that is not subject to the Government's willingness or ability to pay. He added that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' choice to use the EMBI spread of only one day amplifies the contrast between their short-term measure of risk and Norpro Venezuela's long-investment.745 Prof. Spiller took the view that, by contrast, his own assessment of the country risk captures the *\"long-term impact of country risk on Norpro Venezuela's operations\"* consistent with Prof. Damodaran's assessment.746 Prof. Spiller further took the position that it is *\"neither necessary under the CAPM nor advisable\"* to calculate a separate country risk for equity because the equity risk converges to debt risk in the long term, which is why Prof. Damodaran recommends the application of a mutiplier only for the short term.747 As to the CRRM, Prof. Spiller raised several points of criticism, including (i) a lack of transparency; (ii) the subjective and qualitative nature of the ratings; (iii) claims that the surveys are biased towards specific regions of the world; (iv) a lack of statistical or economic explanations; and (v) unreliability for small or illiquid stock exchanges with unreliable stock market data, such as Venezuela.748\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 and \u00b6\u00b6 40-44.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b637, 46 and \u00b6\u00b6140-141.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 47.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6142 and 144.\n\nSpiller II,\u00b6143.\n\n702.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores pointed out that Prof. Spiller's country risk premium is in fact equal to a 10-year B-rated generic US bond over the corresponding US Treasury bond and therefore reflects US corporation debt risk but not Venezuelan country risk.749 They further stated that, contrary to what he suggested, Prof. Spiller did not apply Prof. Damodaran's method because Prof. Damodaran has a hierarchy of methods: his first choice is to use the spread on sovereign bonds denominated in *\"strong currencies\"* such as the US Dollar or Euro (i.e., the *\"bludgeon method\")* and only for those countries that do not issue such bonds, he suggests an alternative approach of assuming that sovereign ratings are comparable to corporate ratings.750 In any event, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores considered it necessary to scale the default spread by a multiplier because their analysis of both the US and Venezuelan market over a period of 20 years did not support a convergence of the risk but rather yielded volatilities of 2.05 and 2.74, respectively, as of 15 May 2010.751 Finally, they took the view that Norpro Venezuela is not less exposed to country risk than other companies operating in Venezuela because (i) country risk is a much larger concept than exposure to domestic demand, involving taxation, regulations and other government actions such as currency controls; (ii) the invoked long-term contracts expire in 2016 and 2018, respectively, and do not contain any renewal option; and (iii) the risk of expropriation forms part of fair market value and would be taken into account by any willing buyer; in any event, bilateral treaties do not have a discernible impact on country risk according to political risk insurers.752 As to Prof. Spiller's criticism on the CRRM, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores acknowledged that the criteria are subjective (albeit based on economic fundamentals) but stated that their consequences are objective, given that they form the basis for banks' lending practices. In addition, they pointed out that the model has produced stable results over the last 25 years.753 They further took the position that the EMBI spread on 15 May 2010 was not out of the ordinary but rather *\"almost exactly in the middle of the distribution of the daily data since 1993 - a total of 5,336 observations.\"754*\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I \u00b6\u00b6 213, 215.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 210, 216 referring to **App. BF-64,** pp. 51, 53; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 161, 182. According to Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, Prof. Damodaran's best estimate of the equity country risk premium is in fact in line with their own estimate. Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 212; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 185, 190.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 199 and Table 14. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores emphasize that they nevertheless use (only) Prof. Damodaran's generic multiplier of 1.5 as a benchmark for their calculation.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6200-205 referring to **App. BF-166.**\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6169, 174-179 and Figure 19.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6166, 172.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are several points of disagreement between the Parties' experts in relation to the determination of an appropriate country risk premium for Norpro Venezuela as of 15 May 2010. However, it appears that a large portion of them depends on a fundamental issue that the Tribunal will therefore address at the outset, *i.e.,* whether the risk of being expropriated without the payment of (sufficient) compensation as required by the Treaty should be excluded from the country risk premium applicable to Venezuela.\n\n704.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, in principle, it agrees with Respondent that the country risk premium to be applied in the present case should be a realistic estimate of the premium that a willing buyer would have applied in May 2010. At the same time, the Tribunal understands Claimant's position that the risk of being expropriated with no or insufficient compensation should be excluded from the valuation of Norpro Venezuela in the context of this arbitration.\n\n705.\n\nIn this context, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller stated in his second expert report that protections from the France-Venezuela BIT served as *\"an additional mitigation of country risk\",755* however, he neither quantified the impact of such mitigation nor did he present any evidence in support of this statement. By contrast, Respondent's experts presented a study conducted by Lauge N. Skovgaard Poulson, who has examined whether political risk insurers placed any weight on the possiblity whether bilateral investment treaties reduce risk and concluded that \"[bilateral investment] *treaties have very little impact on political risk insurance (PRI) providers' coverage and pricing policies.\"756* While the Tribunal would not go as far as to consider that Respondent has thereby established that protection of investments by bilateral investment treaties has *\"no discernible impact on country risk\"757* it must be noted that Claimant never addressed the evidence presented by Respondent's experts, nor has it, or its expert Prof. Spiller, presented any evidence to the contrary of its own. Against this background, the majority of the Tribunal cannot conclude that the existence of the France-Venezuela BIT would have had a quantifiable impact on the risk assessment of a willing buyer - from a strictly economical point of view.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 41.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 205 quoting from **App. BF-166,** p. 1.\n\n*Cf.* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 179.\n\n706.\n\nNevertheless, it could be argued that if the Tribunal were not to make any adjustment as regards the risk of expropriation with no or insufficient compensation, this would allow Respondent to benefit from its own internationally wrongful conduct, i.e., not only the breach of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, but its alleged general policy to expropriate investments without paying adequate compensation. As compensation is a crucial aspect of Respondent's obligations in connection with an expropriation and Respondent would be responsible for its alleged failure to comply with this obligation, the risk of expropriation without (sufficient) compensation should be eliminated from the country risk. The Tribunal notes that this argument is no longer based on a strictly economic perspective, but includes a normative element reflecting the ambition that treaty protection should be respected and enforced. According to this argument, the notion of fair market value under the Treaty would thus have to be interpreted in the context of its own protection standards.\n\n707.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this rationale would apply not only to expropriation-related risks, but also to risks related to other provisions of the Treaty, such as the risk of unfair regulation, adoption of arbitrary measures, serious due process violations, etc. According to Claimant's rationale, all of these risks should be excluded from the country risk because they emerge from Respondent's alleged tendency not to live up to its international obligations.\n\n708.\n\nThis position is supported in particular by the tribunal in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,* which held that the country risk premium should not reflect *\"the market's perception that a State might have the propensity to expropriate in breach of BIT obligations.*\"758 While the tribunal found in that case that no expropriation had occurred, it nevertheless considered that risks related to expropriation should be excluded from the country risk for the purposes of determining the compensation to be paid to the claimant. At the same time, the tribunal emphasized that political risks other than the expropriation risk must be reflected in the country risk premium. As it considered that these risks were not reflected in the 1.5% country risk premium applied by the claimant's expert, it relied on the 4% premium used in an analyst report instead, without however giving any further reasons for its choice.759\n\n*Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* **(CLA-152), \u00b6** 841.\n\n*Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* **(CLA-152),** \u00b6\u00b6 841-842.\n\n709.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that there are also arguments in favor of Respondent's position that the country risk premium should include all political risk associated with investing in Venezuela, including the alleged general risk of expropriation with no or insufficient compensation.\n\n710.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recalls that both Parties agree that, regardless of the compensation standard to be applied, the Tribunal has to determine Norpro Venezuela's fair market value, i.e., the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller. Taking into account this definition, it could be in accordance with the economic notion of fair market value to maintain the risk of expropriation without (sufficient) compensation as one of the risks that a willing buyer would realistically take into account.\n\n711.\n\nIn addition, as noted by the ILC in the commentary to Article 36 of its Draft Articles, *\"the function of compensation is to address the actual losses incurred as a result of the internationally wrongful act\"* and is thus *\"purely compensatory\"',* \" [i] *t is not concerned to punish the responsible State, nor does compensation have an expressive or exemplary character.*\"760 It could be argued that if one were to exclude the risk of uncompensated expropriation from the present valuation, Claimant would be granted a windfall because it would receive compensation in an amount that it would not have been able to obtain as a purchase price if it had actually sold Norpro Venezuela to a willing buyer in 2010, and thus more than *\"the actual losses incurred\"* as a result of Respondent's breach of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.\n\n**CLA-027,** Article 36, \u00b6 4.\n\n712.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Respondent, this position is supported in particular by the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* which concluded based on these arguments that, while the particular State measure giving rise to the claim must of course be excluded from the valuation, the country risk premium reflects *\"the general risks, including political risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date\"761* The tribunal concluded that a country risk premium of 14.75% was appropriate under the circumstances.762\n\n*Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207), \u00b6** 186.\n\n*Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207),** \u00b6 190.\n\n713.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fundamental issue to be resolved in this regard is thus whether in its determination of the compensation to be paid to Claimant, the Tribunal should disregard only the impact of the particular breach of Article 5(1) that it has found under the present Treaty, or whether it should also eliminate the risk of further potential breaches of international law that generally reduce the value of all investments in Venezuela because Respondent would otherwise be allowed to take advantage of its alleged policy not to respect its international obligations.\n\n714.\n\nThis question cannot be answered without taking into account the circumstances prevailing when Claimant made its decision to invest in Venezuela. Specifically, the Tribunal considers it relevant whether the risk, which Claimant now seeks to be excluded from the country risk premium, already existed in 2006 or whether there was an apparent change of policy since the investment was made, i.e., from an investor-friendly environment towards establishing a tendency to expropriate foreigners without adequate compensation as alleged by Claimant.\n\n715.\n\nIn this context, it is undisputed that when the team surrounding Patrick Millot sought approval of the project from Claimant's mother company Compagnie de Saint-Gobain in 2006, a discount rate of 15% was used, consisting of the 12% rate usually assigned within Claimant's group to *\"high risk\"* countries plus a 3% premium to account for *\"additional risks by conservatism.\"763* While this rate cannot simply be equated to an objective assessment that a willing buyer might have conducted, it serves as an indication that Claimant already considered Venezuela a *\"high risk\"* country and even added 3% for additional risk when it made its investment decision in 2006. In its own words, Claimant invested *\"during the height of the Bolivarian Revolution.\"764* In the Tribunal's view, this demonstrates that, already in 2006, Claimant factored in certain risks that are not covered by the usual risk of investing in *\"high risk\"* countries and most probably relate to a risk of being expropriated with no or insufficient compensation.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6130-133; DAC: Grains and Powders - Venezuela 70 kt Greenfield proppants update 38 M$ revised capex, 23 October 2006 **(Exhibit C-082)** and Financial Mopdel for DAC #3 **(Exhibit CLEX-166).**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 2.\n\n716.\n\nIt must further be noted that it is undisputed between the Parties that the country risk has increased since 2006.765 The question is whether such increased risk must, or rather must not, be taken into account in the present valuation of Norpro Venezuela because the increase is due to Respondent's alleged practice to expropriate investments without (sufficient) compensation and would thus allow it to benefit from its own wrongful conduct.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 121; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 159-162.\n\n717.\n\nIn this regard, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* that Claimant's argument *\"conflates two separate elements in a legal claim of this kind\" i.e.,* (i) the question of liability where the Tribunal has found that Respondent failed to carry out the expropriation in accordance with the compensation requirements of the Treaty; and (ii) the quantum stage where the Tribunal must determine the fair market value of Claimant's investment. As the *Tidewater* tribunal has found, *\"the second element in the claim is in essence an economic question. It depends upon the value that the market would attribute to the investment in question.*\"766 The tribunal further held:\n\n*\"This is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its own wrong. On the contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empowered by virtue of the Treaty to award are designed to ensure that the private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But, in determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis, the Tribunal should consider the value that a willing buyer would have placed on the investment. In determining this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associated with investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. [...] Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including political risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow of the business going forward.\"767*\n\n*Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207), \u00b6\u00b6** 184-185.\n\n*Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(RL-207),\u00b6** 186.\n\n718.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal agrees with this finding and therefore cannot follow Claimant's argument that a failure to exclude the risk of expropriation with no or insufficient expropriation would allow Respondent to benefit from its own wrongful conduct. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant's own risk assessment in 2006 shows that, from an economic perspective, any *\"additional risks\"* associated with investing in Venezuela would be taken into account by an investor or a willing buyer - irrespective of the existence of the present Treaty.\n\n719.\n\nThe notion of fair market value, which the Tribunal has identified above as the applicable compensation standard,768 requires the elimination of the specific measure that was subject of the Tribunal's finding on liability, *i.e.,* in this case Respondent's failure to comply with its obligation to pay prompt and adequate compensation to Claimant. However, it does not require, and in fact does not allow for, a correction of the economic willing-buyer perspective on the basis of normative considerations. In particular, the majority of the Tribunal is of the view that the Treaty and this arbitration do not serve the purpose of insuring Claimant against the general risks of investing in Venezuela that a willing buyer would take into account in its assessment of the purchase price it would pay for Norpro Venezuela.\n\n*See* paragraph 627 above.\n\n720.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that, while acknowledging the increased country risk, Respondent strongly contests Claimant's allegation that it is making generalized threats to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela and/or public statements that it does not intend to honor its obligations under international law. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant has not presented any evidence with regard to these allegations and claims that *\" Venezuela has not defaulted on any of its sovereign obligations, and Venezuela has paid compensation in its expropriation cases.\"769* In its letter of 6 November 2015, Respondent again contested that there is any divergence between Venezuela's willingness to pay and its ability to pay and referred to the director of the Venezuelan economic consulting firm Ecoanalitica who stated on 28 October 2015 that PDVSA's debt payments in the total amount of USD 5 billion over the last 15 days confirmed *\"Venezuela's strong willingness to pay.\"770*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b639-42.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 6 November 2015; **Exhibit R-131.**\n\n721.\n\nConsequently, it is very much in dispute between the Parties whether there is a general risk of uncompensated expropriation in Venezuela. While Respondent correctly pointed out that Claimant has not presented any specific evidence in support of its allegation, in the Tribunal's view the high country risk in Venezuela may be due, at least in part, to the uncertain situation surrounding certain of Respondent's expropriation measures. Respondent does not contest that it is involved in several disputes with investors that relate to the payment of adequate compensation.\n\n722.\n\nHowever, in light of its finding above that the determination of fair market value has to be made in accordance with economic principles and thus factor in all risks that a willing buyer would take into account, the Tribunal does not have to make a decision on Respondent's expropriation measures in general (assuming it had jurisdiction to adopt such a finding).\n\n723.\n\nConsequently, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the country risk premium must reflect all political risks associated with investing in Venezuela, including the alleged general risk of being expropriated without payment of (sufficient) compensation.\n\n724.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not have to decide the further question whether it is possible to quantify and thus eliminate the expropriation risk from the country risk, without at the same time excluding other country-specific risks that undisputedly have to be accounted for in the country risk premium. Instead, the Tribunal must assess from the perspective of the willing buyer, which of the various methods presented by the Parties' experts adequately reflects the country risk to which Norpro Venezuela was in fact exposed as of 15 May 2010.\n\n725.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal notes that it is in dispute between the Parties whether the difference between the approach applied by Prof. Spiller and the two approaches applied by Respondent's experts is due (exclusively) to the risk of uncompensated expropriation. While Respondent claims that it is not possible to isolate and thus quantify the risk of uncompensated expropriation,771 Claimant contends that Prof. Spiller's method based on Venezuela's local currency rating excludes the risk of uncompensated expropriation but includes *\"other risks of investing in Venezuela, such as the risks of a volatile economy, civil disorder, less developed infrastructure, and other issues.\"772* Claimant explicitly states that, as Venezuela's *\"extremely high\"* USD-denominated bond spread reflects its lack of willingness to pay, the difference between the country risk premia computed by the Parties' experts is *\"largely attributable to Venezuela's confiscation threats\"773* It is thus apparently Claimant's position that the approach selected by Prof. Spiller does not include the alleged general risk of uncompensated expropriation and thus does not capture the actual country risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its valuation of Norpro Venezuela.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 163.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6105-106.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119.\n\n726.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller did not state at the Hearing that Prof. Damodaran's local currency rating method is in fact designed to eliminate the risk of uncompensated expropriation from the country risk premium. However, he gave the following explanation for the fact that the alternative approach selected by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores based on Venezual's EMBI spread renders much higher results than the rating-based method:\n\n*\"The investors in Venezuelan bonds all the way up to December 2013 were assessing that although the fundamental economics of Venezuela were comparable to BI credit-rating countries, they were fearing that Venezuela may not be willing to uphold its international obligations, not dissimilar to, what for example, Ecuador did when it defaulted recently on its debt, which was based on willingness to pay to uphold the international obligations rather than economic fundamentals, as may be the case now with Greece, which cannot repay the debt.\"774*\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 903 lines 5-16.\n\n727.\n\nProf. Spiller thus confirms Claimant's position that the divergence between the results yielded by the two methods is due to Venezuela's alleged unwillingness to live up to its international obligations. Prof. Spiller further argues that in the case of Venezuela, there is a significant discrepancy between the country's ability to pay (reflected in its local currency rating) and its willingness to pay (reflected in its USD-denominated bond spreads). Prof. Damodaran's spreadsheet as of 1 July 2013775 indeed shows that the divergence between the two methods amounted to 7.62% for Venezuela, but less than 1% for most other countries. The only other countries with a divergence of more than 2% are Tunisia (2.22%) and Argentina (31.72%).776\n\nWhile Prof. Damodaran's excel sheet for 2010 is on file as **App. BF-62,** it does not contain a calculation of the country risk premium based on the CDS spreads. For comparison purposes, the Tribunal therefore refers to the excel sheet as of July 2013.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-75,** pp. 5-6 and **App. BF-65,** pp. 3-4.\n\n728.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the unusual divergence between the results yielded by the two methods supports Prof. Spiller's explanation that the CDS spreads (just like the EMBI spread) might reflect a risk that is not usually associated with countries that are assigned a BI rating. While this additional risk could indeed be the risk associated with Venezuela's alleged policy not to live up to its international obligations, the Tribunal has already found above that it is beyond the scope of this arbitration to make a finding on Venezuela's general policy towards foreign investors and to make any corresponding adjustment to the country risk premium in this regard.\n\n729.\n\nRespondent further pointed out in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief that Prof. Spiller did not analyze the spreads on USD-denominated bonds of countries with the same rating as Venezuela but rather took the 4.5% spread that Prof. Damodaran applied to all Bl-rated countries on the assumption that sovereign ratings are comparable to US corporate ratings, without making any analysis on market data relating to these countries.777 Already in its Rejoinder, Respondent raised the argument that, instead of relying on the spreads of US corporate bonds, Prof. Spiller should at least have analyzed corporate bonds from emerging countries and referred to the analysis of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, which yielded an average debt spread of 9%.778\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief 44-45 and \u00b6 48.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 221 referring to Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6194-195 and Table 12.\n\n730.\n\nEven though Respondent's argument was again raised by Mr. Brailovsky during the Hearing,779 Claimant did not respond to it in its Post-Hearing Submission, but argued for the first time in its Second Post-Hearing Submission that the accuracy of Prof. Spiller's measure of country risk could be checked by looking at the CDS spreads outstanding on other countries' sovereign debts. Claimant noted that pursuant to Prof. Damodaran's list as of January 2014, the 4.5% premium applied by Prof. Spiller would rank as the fourth-high-est, *\"far above the typical country risk premium in a developing country.\"780*\n\nTrascript (Day 4), p. 1210 line 21 to p. 1211 line 3.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b661-62 referring to **App. BF-66,** pp. 23-25.\n\n731.\n\nRespondent replied to this argument by a separate letter pointing out that (i) Prof. Spiller had never referred to CDS spreads in the context of the method he applied; (ii) more than half of the countries with CDS spreads in Prof. Damodaran's list could not be classified as *\"developing countries\"',* and (iii) *\"typicality\"* was not a valid concept for the valuation of a project in particular country for which country-specific data was readily available, *i.e.,* in the case of Venezuela, a CDS spread of 10.8%.781\n\nRespondent's letter dated 2 June 2015, pp. 1-2. The Tribunal admitted Respondent's submission relating to the CDS spreads into the record by letter of 19 June 2015.\n\n732.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it would indeed have been helpful to have a comprehensive analysis of market data from other countries with the same BI rating that Venezuela was assigned as of 15 May 2010. In particular, Claimant should have raised the argument relating to CDS spreads of other countries at an earlier stage of the proceedings, which would have allowed Respondent and its experts an adequate opportunity to respond to this argument. In addition, the Tribunal could have consulted the Parties' experts on this issue during the Hearing. In the absence of a proper discussion on this issue, the Tribunal does not consider it fair to rely on the data that Claimant pointed to, which in any event relates to 2014 and not to the valuation date in 2010.\n\n733.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal recalls Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' analysis of corporate bond spreads in emerging markets based on data from Merrill Lynch, which they converted into a generic emerging market corporate bond yield of 9.11% as of May 2014.782 While they did not provide a figure for the valuation date of 15 May 2010, this undisputed calculation raises doubts as to whether the 4.5% premium calculated by Prof. Spiller reflects even the country risks typically associated with a B-l rated country that should undisputedly be taken into account in the present valuation - apart from the issue of the expropriation risk.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6191-197.\n\n734.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore now turn to the two alternative approaches that Respondent's experts relied on, *i.e.,* the CRRM and the *\"bludgeon method,\"* which both undisputedly include any risk of uncompensated expropriation and yielded a country risk premium of 14.3% and 15.4% respectively.\n\n735.\n\nAs to the *\"bludgeon method,\"* which is based on USD-denominated sovereign spreads, Respondent's experts have chosen to rely on data from the EMBI. While Prof. Spiller criticized in his second report that it is not appropriate to rely on the EMBI in the present case because Venezuela's sovereign credit risk does not reflect Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure, he did not contest the choice of this particular index as such. Prof. Spiller did challenge the use of the spot index on the valuation date rather than a longterm average; however, he did not provide the Tribunal with an alternative figure that would reflect any such average.783\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 32-36 and \u00b6\u00b6140-141.\n\n736.\n\nThe Tribunal is of course aware that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores have applied Prof. Damodaran's *\"bludgeon method\"* only to cross-check their primary calculation, which is based on the CRRM. The Tribunal is also aware that Prof. Spiller has raised various points of criticism in relation to this method, in particular as regards a lack of transparency of the method and a lack of reliability in the results it yields,784 and that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores have addressed these points of criticism in detail in their second expert report.785 The Tribunal is of the view that there is no need to express an opinion as to the reliability of the CRRM as both Parties' positions are reflected in one of the methods devised by Prof. Damodaran, who appears to be recognized as a leading authority by both Parties' experts. The Tribunal will therefore focus on the methods that he recommends.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6142-143.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 169 and \u00b6\u00b6174-179.\n\n737.\n\nRespondent and its experts have taken the position that Prof. Spiller has ignored Prof. Damodaran's hierarchy of methods and that Prof. Damodaran's best estimate is the result yielded by the *\"bludgeon method.\"786* While neither Claimant nor its expert has explicitly addressed this argument, the Tribunal notes that the record does not clearly establish that Prof. Damodaran indeed provides for a ranking of his methods. Contrary to what Respondent and its experts suggest, Prof. Damodaran does not state in his writing on equity risk premiums that the rating-based synthetic approach should be applied only for countries that do not have USD-denominated sovereign bonds. By contrast, he states that the default spread *\"can be estimated in three ways\"* one of which is the synthetic spread.787 While noting that the other two ways are available only for countries with USD-denomi-nated bonds, he does not state that those ways should be preferred over the synthetic spread. He refers to the assumption that sovereign ratings are comparable to corporate ratings as an *\"alternative approach\"* and, after laying out the three possible approaches, concludes that one *\"could choose one of these approaches and stay consistent over time or average across them.\"788*\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 212 and \u00b6 216.\n\n**App. BF-64,** pp. 53-55.\n\n**App. BF-64,** pp. 55, 57 and Figure 8.\n\n738.\n\nIn his spreadsheet that formed the basis for Prof. Spiller's choice of the 4.5% premium for 2013, Prof. Damodaran also states that to *\"[e]stimate the default spread for the country* *in question,* \" he *\"offer[s] two choices, one based upon the local currency sovereign rating for the country from Moody's and the other is the CDS spread for the country (if one exists).*\"789 Again, he does not state that one should prefer the CDS spread approach over the rating approach. Finally, the Tribunal notes that in his spreadsheet for 2010, Prof. Damodaran does not even provide for the CDS spread approach but simply states that \"[t]*o estimate the long term country risk premium, I start with the country rating (from Moody's: www.moodys.com) and estimate the default spread for that rating (U.S. corporate and country bonds) over the treasury rate. This becomes a measure of the added country risk premium for that country.\"790*\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-75,** p. 1 and **App. BF-65,** p. 1.\n\n**App. BF-62,** p. 3.\n\n739.\n\nIn light of these statements, the Tribunal is not convinced that there is a hierarchy of methods that Prof. Spiller failed to observe in his choice to rely on the local currency rating model instead of the USD-denominated bond spreads. However, the Tribunal recalls that (i) according to Claimant's own submissions, Prof. Spiller's approach aims to exclude the risk of uncompensated expropriation and therefore does not reflect the actual country risk that a willing buyer would take into account; and (ii) it remains unclear whether it includes even the country risks that are typically associated with a B-l rated country, as demonstrated by Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' analysis of corporate bond spreads in emerging markets.\n\n740.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Prof. Damodaran's *\"bludgeon method\"* includes both the risk of uncompensated expropriation and the typical country risks that should undisputedly form part of the present valuation. While the Tribunal is not necessarily convinced that the difference between the results yielded by the two methods is attributable in its entirety to the risk of uncompensated expropriation, Claimant has not presented any evidence that the *\"bludgeon method\"* includes any risk that would not be taken into account by a willing buyer in its valuation of Norpro Venezuela. Therefore, the Tribunal follows Respondent's experts in this regard and finds that the country risk premium should be determined on the basis of Venezuela's USD-denominated bond spreads as reflected in the EMBI.\n\n741.\n\nHowever, there remains one question to be assessed in this regard, *i.e.,* whether the Tribunal should apply Prof. Damodaran's generic multiplier of 1.5 for its determination of the country equity risk premium on the assumption that investment in equity is riskier than investment in bonds, as stated by Respondent's experts,791 or whether it should refrain from applying any multiplier on the assumption that equity and debt risk converge for a long-term investment, as stated by Claimant's expert.792 The Tribunal notes that both sides relied in particular on Prof. Damodaran's statements in this regard. Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky pointed to the fact that Prof. Damodaran states in his spreadsheet:\n\n*\"You can estimate an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the default spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market (Std dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond). In this spreadsheet, I have used the global average of equity to bond market volatility of 1.5 to estimate the country equity risk premium.\"793*\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 202-205; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199 and Table 14.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6144.\n\n**App. BF-62,** p. 3.\n\n742.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that this statement is preceded by the sentence: *\"In the short term especially, the equity country risk premium is likely to be greater than the country's default spread\"794* Prof. Spiller also relies on the following statement from Prof. Damodaran:\n\n*\"[T]he differences between standard deviations in equity and bond prices narrow over longer periods and the resulting relative volatility will generally be smaller795. Thus, the equity risk premium will converge to the country bond default spread as we look at longer term expected returns.\"796*\n\n**App. BF-62,** p. 3. Prof. Spiller refers to he same sentence in Prof. Damodaran's spreadsheet fro 2012. Spiller II, \u00b6 144 referring to Exhibit CLEX-178, p. 1.\n\n[Internal citation:] *Jeremy Siegel reports on the standard deviation in equity markets in his book* 'Stocks for the very long run' *and notes that they tend to decrease with time horizon.*\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-108 / App. BF-55,** p. 12.\n\n743.\n\nIn response, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores presented the results of their own analysis on the relative volatilities of the bond and equity markets in the US and in Venezuela over a 20-year/5-year period797 preceding 15 May 2010, which yielded a ratio of 2.05 and 2.74, respectively.798 The Tribunal notes that, in their first expert report, they stated in a footnote that Prof. Damodaran had calculated a volatility ratio of 0.69 for Venezuela over two years through February 2012, but then a volatility ratio of 1.77 for two years through March 2013.799 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores criticized Prof. Damodaran for not having converted the Venezuelan Stock Market Index, which is denominated in bolivars, into US Dollars, which is the currency of the Venezuelan bond index. In addition, as they quoted in the same footnote, Prof. Damodaran notes that *\"the relative standard deviation of equity is a volatile number, both across countries (ranging from 2.48 for Czech Republic* *and 0.69 for Venezuela) and across time (Brazil's relative volatility numbers have ranged from close to one to well above* 2.\"800\n\nEven though Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores refer only to the 20-year period in their second report, it is apparent from **App. BF-105,** Table 7 that they relied on data from 6 May 2005 through 10 May 2010 for Venezuela, *i.e.,* a 5-year period. This corresponds to what they state in their first report. Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 205.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 199 and Table 14. They emphasize that for their benchmark calculation, they used Prof. Damodaran's generic multiplier of 1.5.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, note 352.\n\n**App. BF-63,** p. 60.\n\n744.\n\nHowever, it appears to the Tribunal that the two calculations cannot be compared directly, as Prof. Damodaran has calculated the relative volatility to the US market (with the US market being assigned a volatility of 1.00), whereas Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores have calculated the relative volatility to the bond market for both the US and Venezuela.\n\n745.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to what Respondent and its experts suggest, it does not appear from Prof. Damodaran's writings that he actually recommends the use of the equity multiplier. Rather, the following statement can be found in one his writings dating from 2010: *\"Some analysts believe that the equity risk premiums of markets should reflect the differences in equity risk, as measured by the volatilities of equities in these markets.*\"801 Similar statements can be found in other writings.802 From his spreadsheet, it also appears that he leaves it to the user to decide whether to apply a multiplier, given that he offers two choices: *\"Choice 1: Use the default spread as the measure of the additional country risk premium. To make this choice, go into the ERP worksheet and set cell E5 to 1.00\"',* and *\"Choice 2: Scale the default spread up to reflect the higher risk of equity in the market, relative to the default spread. You can see the relative ratios for individual countries in the worksheet* 'Equity vs. Govt Bond' *in this spreadsheet. Set cell E5 in the ERP worksheet to that number.*\"803 For June 2013 and January 2014, Prof. Damodaran presented a relative standard deviation (to the US market) of 0.69 for Venezuela; for May 2010, the Tribunal has not been provided with the relevant data.804\n\n**App. BF-61,** p. 178.\n\n**App. BF-63,** p. 50; **App. BF-64,** p. 52.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-75,** p. **1; App. BF-65,** p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-75,** p. 21; **App. BF-65,** p. 22; **App. BF-66,** p. 27.\n\n746.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient clarity on the appropriate multiplier to be applied for Venezuela, the Tribunal is not convinced that the generic 1.5 multiplier would adequately reflect the risk of an equity investment in Venezuela. Given the undisputed long-term nature of the investment to be valued in the present case, it further remains in dispute whether any multiplier should be applied at all or whether it can be assumed that debt and equity risk will converge. While Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that this theory is dispelled by their analysis on the relative volatilities of the equity and bond markets in the US and in Venezuela, the Tribunal notes that the ratio they calculated indeed appears to depend to a large extent on the maturity of the bonds selected in comparison to the stock market. While Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not present figures for different bond maturities for the Venezuelan market, the ratio for the US market differs between 1.55 for 20-year bonds and 2.81 for 5-year bonds as of May 2010.805\n\n**App. BF-105,** Table 9.\n\n747.\n\nAndrew Smithers and Stephen Wright on whom Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied in support of their argument that equity is riskier than debt, confirm that the volatility of bond returns is *\"distinctly lower\"* than that of stocks, but also state that long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds.806 Jeremy Siegel, however, who has also been cited by Respondent's experts, makes the following statement:\n\n*\"As was noted previously, stocks are riskier than fixed-income investments over short-term holding periods. But once the holding period increases to between 15 and 20 years, the standard deviation of average annual returns, which is the measure of the dispersions of returns used in portfolio theory, become lower than the standard deviation of average bond or bill returns. Over 30-year periods, equity risk falls to only two-thirds that of bonds or bills. As the holding period increases, the standard deviation of average stock returns falls nearly twice as fast as that of fixed-income assets.\"807*\n\n**App. BF-60,** p. 176.\n\n**App. BF-70,** p. 32.\n\n748.\n\nIn light of this evidence, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the risk of investment in equity and the risk of investment in bonds converge in the long term. As the subject of this valuation, *i.e.,* Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela, was undisputedly made as a long-term investment according to the standards applied by Prof. Damodaran, Messrs. Smithers and Wright, and Mr. Siegel, Respondent and its experts have not established that a multiplier should be applied to the default spread for the computation of the equity risk premium. Consequently, the Tribunal will apply the country risk premium calculated by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores on the basis of Prof. Damodaran's *\"bludgeon method\",* excluding the 1.5 multiplier. As of 15 May 2010, they determined a sovereign bond spread of 10.26% based on data from the EMBI, which in the absence of a multiplier to be applied in the present case is equal to the country equity risk premium.\n\n749.\n\nThe Parties and their experts have further debated certain factors specific to Norpro Venezuela as a result of which its country risk exposure might deviate from the average Venezuelan company.808 Apart from the factor of protection under a bilateral investment treaty, which has been discussed in detail above, the debate focused on two further issues: (i) the fact that Norpro Venezuela exported more than 80% of the produced proppants, most of it to North America, *i.e.,* a mature market, and (ii) the fact that it had concluded long-term supply contracts for its key inputs such as energy and bauxite.809\n\nCf. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6136-144; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6172-180.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 35, \u00b6\u00b641-43; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6200-202.\n\n750.\n\nAs to the second issue, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores correctly pointed out that the longterm contracts were set to expire in 2016 and 2018, respectively, and did not provide for a renewal term, let alone a renewal at the same or similar prices.810 Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that this factor would cause a willing buyer to lower his assessment of Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 202.\n\n751.\n\nWith regard to the first issue, Claimant relied on Prof. Damodaran's statement that \"[t]he *most obvious determinant of a company's risk exposure to country risk is how much of the revenues it derives from the country.*\"811 However, Respondent pointed out that Prof. Damodaran further stated in the same writing that \"[a] *company can be exposed to country risk, even if it derives no revenues from that country, if its production facilities are in that country\"812* In this context, Respondent and its experts argue that country risk is a much larger concept than exposure to domestic demand.813 Mr. Brailovsky further stated at the Hearing that *\"[t]here is a substantial amount of literature showing that natural resource projects, particularly oil or oil-related, bear more Country Risk than the average company.\"814*\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6139 quoting from **Exhibit CLEX-108,** p. 18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175 quoting from **Exhibit CLEX-108,** p. 18.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 175; Brailovsky/Flroes II, \u00b6 201.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1142 lines 9-12.\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant never argued that Norpro Venezuela is not subject to Venezuelan country risk at all but only that it is less exposed to Venezuelan country risk than the average Venezuelan company.815 In response to Mr. Brailovsky's comment at the Hearing, Claimant submits that Norpro Venezuela was not a natural resource company and claims that, in any event, resource-based companies are typically assigned a better rating than companies in other industries.816\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6136.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing submission, \u00b6\u00b6140-141.\n\n753.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers it plausible that Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure may indeed be different from that of the average Venezuelan company, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores correctly pointed out that Prof. Spiller never quantified the impact of the factors invoked by Claimant on the country risk to which Norpro Venezuela was in fact exposed.817 As explained by Prof. Damodaran, the fact that Norpro Venezuela exports most of its products could have been factored in as part of a *lambda* approach pursuant to which the country risk premium as derived for the average Venezuelan company could have been multiplied by a certain *lambda* coefficient.818 However, given that none of the Parties' experts have included such a coefficient in their calculations, the Tribunal will not give any further consideration to this approach. In the absence of any quantification of Norpro Venezuela's specific country risk exposure, the Tribunal will thus apply the country risk premium of 10.26% as yielded by the *\"bludgeon method\"* devised by Prof. Damodaran (excluding any equity risk multiplier).\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, \u00b6 160 and \u00b6 200.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-108,** pp. 17-23.\n\n**(4) Conclusion on Equity Risk Premium and Conversion Into Discount Rate**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n754.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal, by majority, finds that the equity risk premium to be applied to an investment in Norpro Venezuela as of 15 May 2010 consists of the following elements: (i) the cost of equity for a company operating in the US in the amount of 11.6%, i.e., a risk-free rate of 3.6% plus a market risk premium of 8%, consisting of the general market risk premium of 6.7%, to be multiplied by the industry-specific *beta* coefficient of 1.2; and a country risk premium for Venezuela in the amount of 10.26%. This results in a total equity risk premium of 21.86%.\n\n755.\n\nAs a final step, the Tribunal must determine the applicable debt-to-equity ratio in order to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and thus the nominal discount rate to be applied to Claimant's investment. The Parties' experts used similar but not identical debt-to-equity ratios in their calculations as of 15 May 2010. Prof. Spiller applied a ratio of 18.0% debt to 82.0% equity, representing a 5-year average of the ratio reported by Ibbotson/Morningstar for the composite company of SIC Code 1381;819 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied a ratio of 15.7% debt to 84.3% equity, representing a 1-year average as reported by Ibbotson/Morningstar for the median company of SIC Code 1381.820\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6162; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 29.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, Table 8; **App. BF-37.**\n\n756.\n\nWhile Prof. Spiller states that a single-year average is biased because it may be affected by particular events that occurred during that year,821 the Tribunal notes that this issue has not been subject to any further debate between the Parties or their experts. As Ibbot-son/Momingstar reports both the *\"latest\"* figures and the 5-year average, the Tribunal does not consider it established that it should prefer one over the other. The same applies to the choice of the composite company or the median company. Therefore, the Tribunal will not give preference to the choices of either expert, but will rather apply the average between the ratios in its assessment of the nominal discount rate, i.e., a ratio of 16.85% debt to 83.15% equity.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 163.\n\n757.\n\nFor the determination of the cost of debt (after tax), the Tribunal refers to Table 8 of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' second expert report, pursuant to which the cost of debt (after tax) is equal to the US risk-free rate (3.6%) plus the country debt risk premium (10.26%) plus an industry risk premium (set by both Parties' experts at 1.5% for 2010)822 multiplied by one minus the applicable tax rate (34%). According to the majority of the Tribunal, this results in the following calculation:\n\n(3.6% + 10.26% + 1.5%) \\* (1 - 34%) = 10.14%.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, Tables 8 and 9; **Exhibits CLEX-81,** p. 29 and **CLEX-192; App. BF-156.**\n\n758.\n\nOn the basis of the above determined average debt-to-equity ratio of 16.85/83.15, the majority of the Tribunal arrives at a nominal discount rate of 19.88%.823\n\n10.1376% \\* 0.1685 + 21.86% \\* 0.8315 = 19.8847756%.\n\n**bb) Future Cash Flows**\n-------------------------\n\n759.\n\nIn the following section, the Tribunal will turn to the discrepancies between the Parties and their experts in the determination of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows.\n\n**(i) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n760.\n\nWith regard to the calculation of the future cash flows, Claimant considers it *\"baseless\"* to split the profits that a willing buyer would generate from Norpro Venezuela's exports to account for internal cost allocation. In Claimant's view, the fair market valuation is *\"not dependent on idiosyncratic qualities of the buyer or seller\" ',* therefore, it must be assumed that the highest-bidding willing buyer would most likely be a strategic investor that already has a distribution and marketing network similar to that of Saint-Gobain and is thus in a position to accrue 100% of the profits.824 Claimant argues that the marketing costs is a fixed cost of the buyer that does not change through the acquisition, but the buyer can rather leverage its existing resources to take full advantage of the incremental value of the acquired asset just like Saint-Gobain internalized 100% of the profits. Finally, Claimant notes that both experts' estimates already include marketing and distribution costs in the amount of 7%.825\n\nReply, 170-172; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 174-175 referring to Prof. Spiller's oral testimony during the Hearing.

According to Claimant, this price increase was unlawful and therefore must not be taken into account based on the principle that *\"a party may not reduce its liability for one wrongful act (here, the expropriation) on the basis of another (the price increase)*,\"826 According to Claimant, the bauxite price should reflect the agreement under the Bauxite Contract and thus amount to USD 25.5 per MT.827\n\nReply, \u00b6 176; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n\nReply, \u00b6 177.\n\n762.\n\nAs to the transportation costs, Claimant refers to its witness Jack Larry who testified that, contrary to Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' assumption, proppants were not usually shipped from Corpus Christi to Alice (both in Texas) for storage, but the majority was rather shipped directly from the port in Corpus Christi to the customer, which is why the budgeted cost to Alice in the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan was *\"merely for illustrative purposes.*\"828 Claimant claims that (i) Prof. Spiller's estimate of the transportation costs is based on an actual shipment in March 2010 and confirmed by Saint-Gobain's contemporaneous transportation contracts; and (ii) the average price applied by Prof. Spiller for shipping costs within the US accurately accounts for the various locations and contractual arrangements with Claimant's ultimate customers.829\n\nReply, \u00b6 179 referring to Larry II, 13; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 167 referring to the 4 May 2010 Presentation, 2011-2015 Strategic Plan **(Exhibit R-10 / CLEX-80),** p. 42 and Mr. Larry's oral testimony during the Hearing.

As to the administrative delays invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that such delays have been found to be in breach of the FET standard and claims that it had a legitimate expectation that Respondent would follow its own VAT credit procedure, given that this issue was specifically discussed with the Venezuelan Government before Claimant invested in Venezuela.832 In addition, Claimant claims that the invoked two-year delay is *\"purely speculative\"* as all documents invoked by Respondent date from several years prior to 2010 and are further *\"without legal basis\"* as the Venezuelan law provides that the tax authority must issue its decision within 30 days.833\n\nReply, note 381 referring to Spiller II, \u00b693 and \u00b6\u00b6 115-116 and *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

Transcript (Day 3), p. 775 lines 10-19.\n\n**(ii) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n765.\n\nRespondent submits that it is undisputed betweem the Parties that prior to the expropriation Norpro Venezuela received only 27% of the profits, while the remaining 73% were allocated to Claimant's US affiliate SGCP. Respondent notes that this is based on Claimant's transfer pricing study, which distinguished between four equally weighted cate-goried: functions, risks, manufacturing intangibles and marketing intangibles. According to Respondent, the contribution of the plant and SGCP to the first three categories were split; the fourth category *\"marketing intangibles*,\" however, was assigned 100% to SGCP. Respondent argues that 25% of the plant's profits were directly tied to the marketing, logistics and distribution capabilities of SGCP, which were not expropriated together with the plant.834\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6198-199 and \u00b6 256 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35);** Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6238-242; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182.\n\n766.\n\nIn response to Claimant's argument that the study was only an internal accounting mechanism, Respondent notes that under Venezuelan law, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties must *\"determine their income, costs and deductions resulting from those transactions considering the prices and amounts that would have been used with or between independent parties in comparable transactions.* \" Therefore, Respondent maintains its presumption that the agreement between Norpro Venezuela and SGCP reflected an arm's-length transaction.835\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 183 quoting from the *Ley de Impuesto sobre la Renta* **(App. BF-113),** Article 111.\n\n767.\n\nConsequently, Respondent rejects Prof. Spiller's assumption that Norpro Venezuela would retain 100% of the profits as of the valuation date. It claims that a willing buyer would not pay for 100% of the profits because it would not be acquiring the capabilities of SGCP and would not be willing to transfer the profits it expects to earn through its own existing marketing, logistics and distribution network. If the buyer were not to have such network itself, Respondent notes that it would even have to pay for acquiring these capabilities or for the services of a third party. In short, Respondent claims, *\"no buyer would pay for something that it was not getting in the transaction.\"836*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 200-202. *See* also Rejoinder, \u00b6244. Respondent emphasizes that, while such a buyer might achieve 100% of the revenues from the ultimate sale of the proppants, it would not benefit from 100% of the profits because *\"a substantial portion of the profits\"* would be tied to the marketing, distribution and logistics functions that were not part of the transfer from Claimant in consideration for the purchase price. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 184-185.\n\n768.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the willing buyer would *\"value the Plant, not the assets in the full value chain, and would only take into account the profits that could be realized by the Plant itself \"'837*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 186.\n\n769.\n\nRespondent therefore refers to the assumption of its experts that a buyer of the plant would achieve *\"at the very most\"* 75% of the profits, as Claimant itself concluded in its transfer pricing study that the 25% portion of *\"marketing intangibles\"* was contributed 100% by SGCP.838\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 203 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 5; Rejoinder, 243; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 54.\n\n770.\n\nAs to the bauxite price to be paid by Norpro Venezuela to CVG Bauxilum, Respondent submits that there is no basis for Claimant's instruction to Prof. Spiller to reduce the agreed price of USD 33.8 per MT to the original contract price, given that Norpro Venezuela agreed to the increased price as long as there would be no further increase throughout 2009. Therefore, Respondent instructed its experts to base their calculation on the increased price, escalated by the US PPI-Commodities.839\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6210 and \u00b6 256; Rejoinder, \u00b6 251 quoting from the letter from Oscar Cid to CVG Bauxilum, 17 September 2008 **(Exhibit R-52).**\n\n771.\n\nWith regard to the transportation costs, Respondent submits that Prof. Spiller's estimate of the shipping costs to the US is apparently based on a single shipment in March 2010 and notes that the same document on which Prof. Spiller relies includes Claimant's own budgeted cost for transportation from Venezuela to Alice, Texas of EUR 110 (converted to USD 154) per MT. According to Respondent, this figure is also supported by Claimant's transfer pricing study.840 As to the contemporaneous transportation documents relied on by Prof. Spiller in his second report, Respondent submits that these documents do not reflect actual costs incurred in connection with transportation, which is why its experts maintained their original estimate.841\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 214 and \u00b6 256 referring to the 4 May 2010 Presentation, 2011-2015 Strategic Plan **(Exhibit R-10 / CLEX-80),** pp. 10 and 42 and Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 1; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 195-198; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6\u00b658-59.\n\nRejoinder, 255; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 194. Respondent notes that its experts did adjust their estimate based on the new information that some of the proppants were shipped directly from Corpus Christi to the customer and assumed that only half of the shipment was first shipped to Alice for storage. Rejoinder, 255-256.\n\n772.\n\nRespondent further rejects Prof. Spiller's estimate for the shipping costs within the US and claims that Claimant's budgeted cost and the Halliburton SPA reflect a *\"significantly higher\"* cost, which is why its experts based their estimate on the budgeted cost.842 Respondent notes that, even though Claimant did not provide any data in support of Prof. Spiller's assumption that 30% of the proppants would be sold *ex works* and the remaining 70% would be sold in equal volumes to each of the three distribution areas, Respondent's experts have applied that assumption together with the price provided for in the Halliburton SPA, which results in costs that are even higher than the costs they estimated.843\n\nCounter-Memorial, 215-216 referring to Saint-Gobain-NorPro, Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35),** p. 1.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6257-258.\n\n773.\n\nIn relation to the capital expenditures, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's assumption up to and including 2018 but argues that annual capital expenditures would significantly increase *\"as the Plant aged and equipment reached the end of its useful life\"844* While Prof. Spiller included only maintenance expenditures, Respondent claims that expenditures for *\"health and safety, technology or improvements to reduce breakdowns and process disruptions\"* are also required to assume operation in perpetuity and therefore takes the position that all four capexes as foreseen for Claimant's Fort Smith Plant should be included in the calculation.845\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218 and \u00b6 256.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6262.\n\n774.\n\nIn respect of the working capital, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's calculation except for the VAT credits. Respondent contends that as of 15 May 2010 Norpro Venezuela had not even applied for the tax recovery certificates and claims that the recovery procedure is usually a *\"lengthy and comple\"x* process. Respondent submits that its experts therefore assumed that the outstanding VAT credits as of 15 May 2010 would have been monetized in 2013 and further VAT credits accumulated thereafter would have been monetized on a two-year rolling basis and thus been part of working capital that a buyer would not separately value.846\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6269-271; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 201.\n\n775.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent refers to (i) newspaper articles reporting delays of several years in 2000 and 2003; (ii) the witness testimony of Eduardo Rond\u00f3n that the *\"procedure to recover VAT in Venezuela lasts at least two years from the initial filing of the request\"',* and (iii) Claimant's statement in its June 2009 DAC that *\"[r]ecovering the VAT from the tax treasury has become a very lengthy and complex process.\"847*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 200 referring to *Pedro Garc\u00eda, Exportaciones crecieron 4% en el trimestre,* 3 April 2000 **(App. BF-34),** *Eduardo Camel, Contracci\u00f3n de 35% en las exportaciones de la Naci\u00f3n,* 28 August 2003 **(App. BF-35),** Rond\u00f3n, 38 and the 8 June 2009 Update to the 23 October 2006 DAC **(Exhibit R-7),** p. 6.\n\n**(iii) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------------\n\n776.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the various points of disagreement regarding Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows in turn.\n\n**(1) Proppants Prices**\n------------------------\n\n777.\n\nAs to the proj ections for proppants prices to be applied, the Tribunal notes that the dispute between the Parties has focused primarily on the impact of recent developments on the oil market on price projections in a date-of-the-award valuation. It is undisputed between the Parties that this development could not have been foreseen as of 15 May 2010 and therefore does not have be taken into account in the present valuation. However, the Parties' experts also applied different assumptions with regard to the proppants prices in their 15 May 2010 valuations.\n\n778.\n\nProf. Spiller stated in his Updated Valuation Model, submitted together with his second expert report, that he based the prices for exports to the US: (i) for 2010, on historical sales in Venezuela for 2010; (ii) for 2011-2012, on historical sales in the US; (iii) for 2013, on the growth rate of Norpro Venezuela's average prices between 2012 and 2013; (iv) for 2014-2015, on the average growth rate of analyst reports and Claimant's forecasts; and (v) for 2016-2018, on the increase of the US PPI. Prof. Spiller's prices for exports to South America and local sales within Venezuela are based: (i) for 2010, on Claimant's April 2010 Business Plan; (ii) for 2011, on the growth rate of Versaprop and Interprop sales in the US between 2010 and 2011; and (iii) for 2012-2017, on the same assumptions as exports to the US.848\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 36.\n\n779.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores based the prices for sales to North America, South America and Venezuela (i) for 2010-2015, on the projections contained in Claimant's April 2010 Business Plan; and (ii) for the time period thereafter, on long-term inflation forecasts as of 20 1 0.849\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b650-51 and Table 4; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 40; **Exhibit CLEX-40,** pp. 13-14.\n\n780.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores that it is inaccurate for a valuation as of 15 May 2010 to use actual sales prices beyond April 2010 because those could not be known at the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further pointed out that Prof. Spiller's price projections are higher than Claimant's own projections for Norpro Venezuela as of April 20 1 0.850 The Tribunal is of the view that, while a willing buyer may have decided not to rely exclusively on the seller's projections but to take into account further data, e.g., based on analyst reports, it would certainly have given considerable weight to the projections in the April 2010 Business Plan. If Prof. Spiller considered that there was a reason to deviate from the Business Plan, he could have explained his choice, but he did not even address the discrepancy between the Business Plan and his own projections for the May 2010 valuation in his expert report.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b644-45 and Table 5.\n\n781.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt the reasonableness of Claimant's own price projections as of April 2010 and thus follows the approach of Respondent's experts in this regard.\n\n**(2) Profit Split for Marketing Part**\n---------------------------------------\n\n782.\n\nAs to the question of whether there should be a profit split for the export sales, there is common ground between the Parties that, prior to the expropriation, Norpro Venezuela in fact retained 27% of the profits from the sales of proppants; the remaining 73% were allocated to Claimant's US affiliate Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics (SGCP) that was responsible, *inter alia,* for the marketing and distribution of the proppants.851 There is a dispute as to whether a willing buyer would have assumed a profit split in its calculation of the purchase price to account for the fact that Norpro Venezuela itself did not have the marketing and distribution network required to sell the proppants to the customer.\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6 112 and note 55; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 52-58; Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35)**\n\n783.\n\nProf. Spiller assumed that a willing buyer would have included 100% of the profits in its calculation of the purchase price on the assumption that the highest bidder would have been a company with marketing and distribution capabilities similar to those of SGCP. According to Prof. Spiller, this assumption is compatible with fair market value because it is not based on *\"unique synergies\"* that could be realized only by a specific buyer, but rather on the reasonable consideration that there are several potential buyers with these capabilities in the market; therefore, Claimant would have sold to a buyer that could realize 100% of the profits and would be willing to factor this synergy into its offer for Norpro Venezuela. Prof. Spiller emphasized that he did not value any revenues or costs associated with a network outside the plant, but simply valued the additional profits that a buyer with access to such a network could obtain from adding Norpro Venezuela's capacity to its own capacity.852\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 **1** 64-68.\n\n784.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that Prof. Spiller incorrectly made specific assumptions regarding the characteristics of the willing buyer and ignored the fact that the marketing and distribution network was not expropriated. Even if the buyer indeed had such a network, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores argued, it would not have been willing to pay for, and give away the profits associated with, such network, precisely because it already had the network and did not acquire one in the transaction.853 According to Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, the asset to be valued is only the going concern Norpro Venezuela and not the marketing and distribution network of SGCP. Therefore, they referred to Claimant's transfer pricing study that both Parties relied on for the historical profits and noted that 25% of the profits were allocated to *\"Market Intangibles.* \" As Norpro Venezuela could not provide any of the services under this heading, they assumed that it could have retained *\"at most\"* 75% of the entire profits.854\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b659-63; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 49 and \u00b6 60.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 69-71; Brailovsky/Flores II, 50-55 and Figure 3 referring to the Transfer Pricing Document, 21 August 2009 **(Exhibit CLEX-35).**\n\n785.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Claimant, both Parties' experts further included a cost item of 7% labelled \" *Selling/R&D/Admin.* \" in their calculations.855 Claimant and Prof. Spiller refer to this cost item as marketing and distribution costs and argue that a further deduction would double count the marketing part.856 Respondent takes the position, however, that this cost covered only the local marketing costs in Venezuela and notes that it existed already under the transfer pricing document, which also made a further deduction of 25% for marketing in the US.857 In response to the question whether the 7% should not at least be deducted from the 25%, Dr. Flores explained the correlation between the two items at the Hearing as follows:\n\n\"*7 percent is an operating cost, so it goes in the cost line. 25 percent is not a cost. It comes from the profit line. You calculate the entire profit, which means all the revenue coming from final consumers paying for proppants, minus all the costs at any level\u2014like cost in Venezuela, cost of transportation, cost inside the U.S. And then that 7 percent is one of the costs. Then you do the deduction, and you get a total profit. That is 100 percent of the profit. [...] So as of that,* [Norpro Venezuela] *captured at most, and we think that's a generous assumption, at most, 75* *percent of the entire profit. So, you cannot compare the 25 and 7; they are different concepts.\"858*\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 37; **App. BF-101,** Tables 4A, 4B and 4C.\n\nProf. Spiller's Opening Presentation, slide 15; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 178.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 385.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1190 line 7 -p. 1191 line 5.\n\n786.\n\nThe Tribunal considers Dr. Flores' explanation convincing and will therefore analyze the question of whether any profit split should be made independently of the fact that Norpro Venezuela already incurred 7% in *\"Selling/R&D/Admin.\"* expenses. In the view of the majority of the Tribunal, Dr. Flores' explanation is further confirmed by the transfer pricing study that allocated 25% of the profits to *\"Marketing Intangibles\"* because the same document in fact includes the 7% cost item in its preliminary price calculation.859 The fact that pursuant to the transfer pricing study all of the services under the heading *\"Marketing Intangibles\"* are performed by SGCP demonstrates that these services had to be performed in addition to any services for which Norpro Venezuela incurred costs under the 7% cost item.860\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-35,** p. 1.\n\n*Cf.* **AsExhibit CLEX-35,** p. 5.\n\n787.\n\nAs to the question whether any deduction should be made, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the highest bidder would indeed have been a company with access to a marketing and distribution network that could have internalized 100% of the profits from the sale of proppants. However, this does not answer the question whether the buyer would have factored in 100% of these profits in its calculation of the purchase price for Norpro Venezuela. While the plant would produce the finished proppants, this alone did not enable the buyer to realize 100% of the profits, but this would be possible only by contributing its own marketing and distribution capabilities.\n\n788.\n\nIt is indeed plausible to assume that the buyer would be able to realize cost synergies by adding Norpro Venezuela's capacities to its own capacities and factor those synergies into its calculation of the purchase price for the plant. However, the majority of the Tribunal is not convinced by the assumption that the buyer would have been willing to pay the same amount as if Norpro Venezuela had been able to market and distribute the proppants on its own. The buyer would have at least deducted the additional costs it would incur by marketing and distributing the additional capacities it acquired.\n\n789.\n\nWhile the amount of these additional costs factored in by the buyer is of course not known, the Tribunal recalls that Prof. Spiller assumed that the buyer would have a network similar to that of SGCP. Therefore, it appears reasonable to refer to Claimant's transfer pricing study in this regard. While the Tribunal is aware that the buyer's additional costs may not be equal to the portion of profits that Claimant allocated to *\"Marketing Intangibles,* \" it also has to be noted that Norpro Venezuela undisputedly retained only 27% of the profits prior to the expropriation. Against this background, to the majority of the Tribunal it appears to be a rather conservative assumption that the buyer would have factored in additional costs for the marketing and distribution of the proppants in an amount that is at least equal to 25% of the profits.\n\n790.\n\nConsequently, the majority of the Tribunal follows the approach of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores to deduct 25% of the profits on export sales from Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows.\n\n**(3) Foreign Exchange Rate and Inflation**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n791.\n\nAs to the applicable foreign exchange rate at which Norpro Venezuela could have converted US Dollars into bolivars and *vice versa,* the Tribunal notes that in their 15 May 2010 valuations, both Parties' experts used the forecasts for the official C ADIVI exchange rate throughout the entire valuation period.861 As neither Party argues that the introduction of the more favorable SICAD II exchange rate in early 2014 was foreseeable in May 2010, the Tribunal thus does not have to express an opinion on the applicability of this exchange rate from 2014 onwards.\n\nSpiller II, note 216; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 97; Brailovsky/Flores II, note 167.\n\n792.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a difference with regard to the devaluation assumptions after 15 May 2010 caused by the fact that the Parties' experts relied on exchange rate forecasts from different sources. While Prof. Spiller relied on the forecast of Ecoanalitica, a private, Venezuela-based macroeconomic consulting firm,862 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores projected the evolution of the exchange rate based on forecasts of the International Monetary Fund.863 As pointed out by Prof. Spiller during the Hearing, the IMF does not directly project the development of the USD-bolivar exchange rate but rather inflation rates in the US and in Venezuela.864 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated in response that the IMF projects the gross domestic product for Venezuela in US Dollars and in bolivars and explained that they derived the exchange rate from the ratio of the two figures.865\n\nSpiller I, note 68; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 57.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 98; App.BF-33 and BF-101, Table 12; Dr. Flores' Opening Presentation, slide 24.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1217 lines 4-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 1218 line 18 -p. 1219 line 11.\n\n793.\n\nWhile the Parties' experts further debated whether the IMF makes any separate assumptions about devaluation or simply assumes that the exchange rate will develop in line with inflation,866 the Tribunal considers that it does not have to make a decision in this regard. There is no dispute between the Parties' experts that Econalitica directly projects the development of the USD-bolivars exchange rate. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further did not question the reliability of Ecoanalitica's forecasts; to the contrary, they cite Ecoanalitica's director, Mr. Asdrubal Oliveros, as authority for their assumption regarding a unified exchange rate that does not play a role in the 15 May 2010 valuation.867\n\n*Cf.* Transcript (Day 4), p. 1217 line 8 - p. 1218 line 15 and p. 1219 line 12 - p. 1222 line 7.\n\n*Cf.* Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 82; Transcript (Day 4), p. 1221 lines 15-22.\n\n794.\n\nAs Ecoanalitica is a Venezuela-based economic consulting firm, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that it is familiar with the particularities of the Venezuelan foreign exchange market and thus in a position to provide reliable forecasts for the exchange rate. Therefore, the Tribunal will follow Prof. Spiller's approach to rely on the contemporaneous projections of Ecoanalitica with regard to the evolution of the foreign exchange rate after 15 May 2010. In any event, the Tribunal notes that Respondent referred to a *\"slight difference\"* with regard to devaluation assumptions and did not even quantify such difference.868 Consequently, the Tribunal considers it safe to assume that the difference is in any event negligible.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 389.\n\n**(4) Bauxite Costs**\n---------------------\n\n795.\n\nAs to the applicable bauxite price that Norpro Venezuela would have had to pay to CVG Bauxilum under the Bauxite Contract after 15 May 2010, the Parties' experts were provided with differing instructions from the Parties. Consistent with Claimant's position that the bauxite price increase of September 2008 amounts to a violation of the FET standard, Prof. Spiller was instructed to eliminate the price increase from his calculation and to apply the original contract price instead, increased by the US PPI as provided for in Clause 10. 1 of the Bauxite Contract.869 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores on the other hand were instructed by Respondent to apply the increased price that Norpro Venezuela actually paid as of September 2008 and throughout 2009, increased as of 2010 by the US PPI870\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6126 and Figure 20; Spiller II, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I,\u00b6\u00b6 103, 105; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 99.\n\n796.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that apart from the dispute about the justification of the September 2008 price increase, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores also stated that Prof. Spiller had failed to take into account two former, undisputed, price increases for transportation in August 2007 and January 2008.871 Prof. Spiller did not address the two price increases, but noted that pursuant to his adjustment of the price for inflation, his price for 2008 was identical to the price referred to in the document relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, *i.e.,* USD 25.5 per MT.872 While it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal why the prices are indeed the same for 2008 even though Prof. Spiller made adjustments only for inflation but not for the increased transportation costs, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller's argument is not valid for 2007 (he applied a price of USD 23.8/MT despite the increase to USD 25.0/MT in August 2007).873 In the present context, however, the Tribunal needs to assess the applicable prices for the time period following 15 May 2010 so that an incorrect price for 2007 is irrelevant as long as the price as of 2008 is correct.\n\nBrailosvky/Flores I, \u00b6 102 referring to **Exhibit C-100,** slide 13; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 95. In August 2007, the original contract price of USD 23.5/MT was increased to USD 25.0/MT based on Clause 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract, and in January 2008, the price was increased to USD 25.5/MT, consisting of an adjustment for inflation based on Clause 10.1 (USD 0.23/MT) and an increase based on Clause 10.2 (USD 0.27/MT).\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 125.\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 40 *to* **Exhibit C-100,** slide 13.\n\n797.\n\nAs to the main dispute between the Parties, i.e., whether the calculation should include the price increase of September 2008, Prof. Spiller correctly identified the dispute about the legality of the price increase as a legal matter on which he did not express a professional opinion.874 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that it was in any event unreasonable to assume that a willing buyer would not have taken into account the actual price Norpro Venezuela was paying as of 2008.875 The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores that the starting point must be the perspective of the willing buyer in May 2010. Even if the price increase constituted a breach of contract, the buyer would have taken into account that Norpro Venezuela was paying the increased price and had not undertaken any legal action for breach of contract before the dispute resolution forum provided for in the Bauxite Contract. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the alleged illegality of the price increase would not be sufficient justification to eliminate the price increase from the present valuation.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 124.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 96.\n\n798.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Tribunal were convinced that the price increase was indeed illegal and Respondent was responsible for the increase under the FET standard or the FPS standard (either because CVG Bauxilum's conduct is attributable to the State or because MIBAM was obliged to intervene), this internationally wrongful conduct would indeed have to be eliminated from the valuation. However, the Tribunal refers to its finding above that Claimant has not established that the price increase of September 2008 amounted to a breach of contract on the part of CVG Bauxilum. Therefore: (i) it can be left open whether Respondent could be held liable for such contractual breach - even if it had been established - under the FET standard; and (ii) Respondent did not have an obligation to intervene in relation to the bauxite price increase under the FPS standard.876\n\n*See* paragraphs 542 and \u00b6\u00b6 559-560 above.\n\n799.\n\nIn the absence of any internationally wrongful conduct in connection with the bauxite price increase, Claimant is not entitled to any compensation in this regard. Consequently, there is no reason to eliminate the price increase from the present valuation. As to the additional issue raised by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores regarding the exchange rate applied by Prof. Spiller who assumed that Norpro Venezuela would have paid the USD price in bolivars,877 the Tribunal recalls that both Parties' experts used the CADIVI exchange rate in their May 2010 valuations.878 Therefore, no decision is required in this regard.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b697-99 and Figure 9.\n\nSpiller II, note 216; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 97; Brailovsky/Flores II, note 167.\n\n**(5) Transportation Costs**\n----------------------------\n\n800.\n\nThe next issue concerns the transportation costs that Norpro Venezuela would have incurred for shipping the finished proppants to the customers. Both Parties' experts distinguished between three categories of transportation costs: (i) for all proppants, local shipping costs within Venezuela to transport the proppants from the plant to the port of Puerto Ordaz; (ii) for North and South American exports, shipping costs from the port of Puerto Ordaz to the port of Corpus Christi, Texas (and possibly on to the warehouse in Alice, Texas); and (iii) for North American exports, shipping costs from Texas to the ultimate customer.\n\n**Local Shipping Costs in Venezuela**\n-------------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nAs for the local shipping costs within Venezuela for all proppants, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores adopted Prof. Spiller's projection that these costs amounted to VEF 50.5 per MT, increased in accordance with the (projected) Venezuelan PPI. While the Parties' experts disagree as to the applicable exchange rate in their date-of-the-award valuations, they both apply the official CADIVI exchange rate in their May 2010 valuations, which results in costs of USD 11.9 per MT as of 2010.879\n\nSpiller II, Figure 8; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 38; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6116-117; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 102.\n\n**Shipping Costs from Venezuela to the US**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n802.\n\nAs to the shipping costs from Venezuela to the US for all proppants to be exported, Prof. Spiller relied on an actual shipment in March 2010 from Puerto Ordaz to Corpus Christi, Texas at a cost of USD 99.0 per MT.880 He cross-checked that figure on the basis of several contractual documents provided to him by Claimant, which yielded a charge of USD 91.43 per MT.881 Based on the information from Claimant's witness Mr. Larry that some of the proppants were shipped directly from the port of Corpus Christi to the customer while others were first shipped on to Claimant's warehouse in Alice, Texas, Prof. Spiller also calculated the shipping costs from Corpus Christi to Alice at USD 17.6 per MT and concluded that the average between the total costs to Alice (USD 109.03 per MT) and the costs to Corpus Christi (USD 91.43 per MT) were in line with his estimate of USD 99.0 per MT.882\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 81 relying on CLEX-80, slide 10.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 82 and Table 7 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-152.**\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 81 and \u00b6\u00b683-85 referring to Larry I, \u00b6 35.\n\n803.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on Claimant's budgeted transportation costs for 2010, which amounted to EUR 110 per MT (converted to USD 154 per MT). They assumed that this cost included the local shipping costs of USD 11.9 per MT, thus resulting in a cost of USD 142.1 per MT for the second category of shipping costs.883 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further noted that Norpro Venezuela's transfer pricing study showed a cost for freight to the US in 2009 of USD 0,072 per pound, which translates into USD 158.7 per MT.884 Finally, they adopted Prof. Spiller's assumption that only half of the finished proppants were shipped to Alice and his estimate of the shipping costs between Corpus Christi and Alice (USD 17.6 per MT). Consequently, they estimated average transportation costs of USD 133.3 per MT.885\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, 118-119; Brailovsky/Flores II, 104 and 106 and Figure 11 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-80,** slide 42.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 120; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 106 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-35,** p. 1.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 117.\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties' experts relied on Claimant's 2011-2015 Strategic Plan as the primary source for their respective estimates. While Prof. Spiller applied the costs for one actual shipment in March 2010, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores referred to the budgeted costs for 20 1 0.886 In principle, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to rely on Claimant's own estimate for its 2010 budgeted costs. Claimant's witness Mr. Larry, who was involved in the creation of this slide,887 confirmed during the Hearing that this estimate included the shipping costs to Alice, Texas.888 With regard to the divergence between the numbers relied on by the Parties, Mr. Larry further explained:\n\n*\"So, if we look, we have an actual cost per shipment in March, dollars per metric tonne, and then we were constantly trying to optimize the shipment to the customer. So, if we're placing material in the Permian Basin, we wouldn't send it to Alice, Texas. We would take it from the warehouse, ship it, with as much efficiency as possible, directly to the Permian Basin. And you can see that actual number for March, which was a number of\u2014which was a month of strong sales in the Permian Basin, was actually $37 per pound.\"889*\n\n*Compare* **Exhibit CLEX-80,** slide 10 *to* slide 42.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 685 lines 15-20.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 701 lines 11-18.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 605 lines 6-16.\n\n805.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Larry's testimony not only supports the assumption adopted by both Parties' experts that half of the proppants were shipped to Alice and the other half was shipped directly from Corpus Christi to the customer.890 More importantly, Mr. Larry explained that the divergence between the costs for the actual shipment in March 2010 and the budgeted costs for 2010 resulted, at least in part, from the fact that the shipment in March did not go to Alice but directly from Corpus Christi to the customer in the Permian Basin.\n\n*See* also Larry I, \u00b635 and Larry II, 13.\n\n806.\n\nMr. Larry further testified that *\"the overall cost for freight, including the delivery of the customer, was in this \u20acl 10-per-metric-tonne range.*\"891 Prof. Spiller also stated that \"[his] *understanding is that the 110 euros includes all the expenses from Puerto Ordaz to the customer*.\"892 However, the Tribunal notes that the slide from the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan states *\"Supply to Alice, Texas.\"* Therefore, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by Mr. Larry and Prof. Spiller's statements and will therefore also look at the subsidiary sources that the Parties' experts presented in support of their respective estimates.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 696 lines 6-8.\n\nTranscript (Day 4), p. 972 lines 15-17.\n\n807.\n\nAs to the costs for *\"Freight to U.S.* \" set out in the transfer pricing study that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores translated into USD 158.7 per MT, the Tribunal notes that there is no separate cost item for local freight costs within Venezuela so that it can again be assumed that the costs of USD 11.9 per MT are included in that amount. However, there is a separate costs item for \" *U.S. Inland freight+handling\"* so that it can also be assumed that the shipping costs to the customer are not included in that amount.893 As the amount of USD 146.8 per MT (excluding local shipping costs) is even higher than Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' estimate, the study supports the accuracy of the 2010 budgeted costs.\n\n*See* **Exhibit CLEX-35,** p. 1.\n\n808.\n\nAs to Prof. Spiller's cross-check of the costs to Corpus Christi on various contractual documents provided to him by Claimant, which resulted in an amount that is even lower than the costs of the actual shipment in March 2010 (USD 91.43 per MT to Corpus Christi), the Tribunal notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores questioned this crosscheck in various aspects. In particular, they pointed out that the documents included an undated memorandum of understanding and an offer transmitted by e-mail in 2008; (ii) the service contract dating from 2008 was set to expire in August 2010 and would have been in the process of re-negotiation in May 2010; and (iii) Prof. Spiller made various assumptions pursuant to which the shipping costs in 2010 were lower than in 2008 when the documents were signed or transmitted.894\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6111-115.\n\n809.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers that these points of criticism do not render the documents and Prof. Spiller's cross-check entirely unreliable, they also do not provide conclusive evidence on the transportation costs. The resulting costs of USD 91.43 per MT are even lower than the costs of the actual shipment in March 2010, which according to Mr. Larry also did not include any costs to Alice.\n\n810.\n\nOn the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to base its conclusion on the average of all four figures presented by the Parties' experts, i.e., USD 99.0 per MT, USD 124.5 per MT,895 USD 129.2 per MT,896 and USD 91.43 per MT (all excluding the undisputed shipping costs of USD 17.6 per MT from Corpus Christi to Alice). This results in an average of USD 111.03 per MT to Corpus Christi and an average of USD 128.63 to Alice. As the Parties' experts agreed to take the average between the costs to the two possible locations in Texas, this results in an overall average of USD 119.83 per MT.\n\nUSD 154.0 - USD 11.9 (local shipping costs) - USD 17.6 (shipping costs to Alice) = USD 124.5 per MT.\n\nUSD 158.7 - USD 11.9 (local shipping costs) - USD 17.6 (shipping costs to Alice) = USD 129.2 per MT.\n\n**Shipping Costs from Texas to Customers**\n------------------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nFinally, the Parties' experts apply differing assumptions to estimate the shipping costs from Corpus Christi or Alice to the ultimate customer. Prof. Spiller again relied on the costs of an actual shipment in March 2010, which amounted to USD 37.0 per MT. He assumed that 30% of the proppants were sold *ex works* and the remaining 70% were evenly distributed between Claimant's geographic sales areas in the US and thus considered the costs of a shipment to a location in Texas a reasonable proxy.897\n\nSpiller II, T186; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 37; **Exhibit CLEX-80,** slide 10.\n\n812.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores again relied on Claimant's budgeted costs for 2010; however, as there was no budget for costs from Corpus Christi or Alice to the customer, they referred to the costs for transportation from Claimant's Fort Smith Plant, Arkansas, to Alice, which amounted to EUR 31.0 per MT (converted to USD 43.4 per MT). Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores assumed that the distance between Fort Smith and Alice represented a good estimate of average transportation costs to locations throughout the entire US.898 While noting that Claimant delivers not only within the US but also to Canada, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that, even on the assumption that Prof. Spiller's estimate of the sales distribution were correct, this would result in an average cost of USD 51 per MT if applied to the prices per pound set out in the Halliburton Master Agreement.899 By including the sales to Canada, they calculated average costs of USD 54 per MT.900\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, 124-126; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6120-122 and Table 6.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 123 and Table 7.\n\n813.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that neither approach is sufficiently substantiated. The approach of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores based on the transportation costs from Fort Smith to Alice appear rather speculative because those costs relate to a different plant and a different route. As to Prof. Spiller's approach, the Tribunal notes that he was not provided with any actual sales data but rather stated that he understood that approximately 30% of proppants were sold *ex works* and assumed that the rest would be evenly distributed between Claimant's three US geographic sales regions. However, apart from the fact that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores pointed out that Claimant also sells proppants to locations in Canada, there is no evidence in the record that Prof. Spiller made a realistic assumption. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it would have been for Claimant to disclose the actual ratio of Norpro Venezuela's sales in North America.\n\n814.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is not convinced by Prof. Spiller's assumption that the costs of an actual shipment to a location within Texas is a good proxy for the sales throughout the US. In particular, the fact that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied Prof. Spiller's sales assumption to the prices under the Halliburton Master Agreement and arrived at a weighted average of USD 51 per MT, creates doubt as to the reliability of Prof. Spiller's costs estimate of USD 37 per MT.\n\n815.\n\nIn light of the fact that Claimant failed to disclose conclusive evidence in this regard and further taking into account that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' estimate of USD 43.4 per MT is still considerably lower than the cost they calculated under the Halliburton Master Agreement, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt their estimate for shipping costs within North America.\n\n**Conclusion on Transportation Costs**\n--------------------------------------\n\n816.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the present valuation should include (i) USD 11.9 per MT of local shipping costs within Venezuela for all sales; (ii) USD 119.83 per MT of shipping costs from Venezuela to Corpus Christi or Alice, Texas for all export sales; and (iii) USD 43.4 per MT of shipping costs within North America for all North American export sales.\n\n**(6) Capital Expenditures**\n----------------------------\n\n817.\n\nAs to the capital expenditures, the Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties with regard to the time horizon 2010-2018. For this time period, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores adopted Prof. Spiller's approach to rely on the figures estimated in Claimant's April 2010 Business Plan for 2010-2015 (USD 1.4 million in 2010; USD 1.0 million in 2011; USD 1.5 million in 2012; USD 5.0 million in 2013; and USD 0.5 million *per* *annum* in 2014-2015) and to assume that the amount of USD 0.5 million *per annum* (inflated in accordance with the US PPI) would also be required in 2016-2018.901\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6137; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 50; Brailovsky/Flores I, 128-130; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 128.\n\n818.\n\nHowever, the Parties' experts have applied differing figures for the time period after 2018. Prof. Spiller assumed that the long-term capex would amount to USD 0.6 million in perpetuity and noted that this was in line with the estimate of the maintenance capex of Claimant's 30-year old Fort Smith Plant for 2010-2018.902\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b688-90 and Figures 9 and 10; **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 50.\n\n819.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores considered that it was unreasonable to assume that Norpro Venezuela would have the same capex over its entire life cycle and ultimately relied on the four capexes of the Fort Smith Plant: (i) Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE); (ii) Maintenance of Business (MOB); (iii) Technology (TECH); and (iv) World Class Manufacturing (WCM). They calculated that adjusted to the size of Norpro Venezuela, this resulted in a capex of USD 1.6 million in perpetuity.903\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, 130-136; **App. BF-104,** Table 8.\n\n820.\n\nProf. Spiller argued that apart from the MOB capex, the other three capexes were not related to maintenance, but rather to efficiency and technological improvements, which could be included in the valuation only if one were to account for increased production or efficiency gains as well. However, both Parties' experts assumed that Norpro Venezuela's efficiency factors would remain constant in the long term.904\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 89.\n\n821.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that the three *\"non-maintenance\"* capexes included items such as roof repairs and improvements to prevent slide, trips and falls (HSE), replacements of old technology (TECH) and improvements to reduce breakdowns and process disrutpions (WCM). They concluded that all of these components were necessary to keep the plant running in perpetuity and remain competitive.905\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, 134-135 referring to **Exhibit CLEX-91,** slides 142, 144 and 145.\n\n822.\n\nIn principle, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Spiller that the inclusion of expenditures that are not related to maintenance but improvements of technology or efficiency would make it necessary to account for the corresponding added value as well. However, as the first example cited by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores under the *\"Health, Safety and Environmental\"* capex shows, maintenance cannot necessarily be reduced to capex labelled *\"Maintenance of Business.\"* Maintenance in terms of keeping the plant running at the same techonological and efficiency level also includes expenditures for, *e.g.,* adapting to new regulatory requirements or safety improvements.\n\n823.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores that Prof Spiller's distinction between one *\"maintenance\"* capex and three *\"non-maintenance\"* capexes is not quite accurate. In particular, the Tribunal's understanding of maintenance includes several of the items that form part of the *\"Health, Safety and Environmental\"* capex. As for the *\"Technology\"* and *\"World Class Manufacturing\"* capexes, however, the Tribunal considers that they primarily relate to technology and efficiency improvements, which cannot be taken into account without at the same time accounting for the resulting efficiency gains (which Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not do). Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the long-term capex for Norpro Venezuela should reflect the expenditures foreseen for the Fort Smith Plant under the MOB and the HSE capexes, but not the TECH and WCM capexes.\n\n**(7) Working Capital - VAT Credits**\n-------------------------------------\n\n824.\n\nAs to the working capital required to operate the plant, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores agreed with Prof. Spiller's modelling in his second expert report, except for his approach to the VAT credits.906 Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further did not question Prof. Spiller's calculation pursuant to which as of April 2010 Norpro Venezuela had a balance of outstanding VAT credits in the amount of VEF 12.3 million (converted to USD 2.9 million).907 The approaches of the Parties' experts differ, however, as regards the time period it would have taken to monetize those VAT credits.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 145.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 53.\n\n825.\n\nAs per instruction from counsel, Prof. Spiller relied on Venezuelan administrative law pursuant to which claims for tax credits must be decided within 30 days and therefore assumed that the balance of VEF 12.3 million would have been collected in the course of 2010. He modeled a working capital requirement on the assumption that (i) it would have taken 60 days from the date of filing the request for reimbursement to monetize the VAT certificates; and (ii) Norpro Venezuela would have recovered 80% of the VAT receivables.908\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6\u00b692-93.\n\n826.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that Norpro Venezuela had not obtained its export license and had not started the VAT recovery process as of May 2010 and assumed that it would submit its first VAT recovery requests in late 2010 or 2011. According to Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, Norpro Venezuela would therefore have received its first recovery certificates only approximately two years later, *i.e.,* in 2013 due to the well-known long delays in the recovery procedure. They further assumed that until then, Norpro Venezuela would have acquired additional inputs and supplies, which would have resulted in new VAT credits and thus a continuous outstanding balance of VAT credits. Consequently, they did not include VAT-related cash flows in their model.909\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 170-175; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6 148-150.\n\n827.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there are two issues to be discussed in this regard: (i) whether Respondent may rely on delays in its own administrative procedure for the purposes of the present valuation; and (ii) whether Respondent has established that exporters were in fact facing delays of approximately two years in the recovery procedure.\n\n828.\n\nAs to the first issue, the Tribunal notes that from the strictly economic perspective of a willing buyer, administrative delays resulting in delayed cash flows would certainly have to be taken into account - provided that the delays actually exist. However, Claimant argues that if Venezuela had acted in good faith, it would have followed its own administrative law to decide on the VAT credits within 30 days. While it initially raised a separate FET claim in this regard,910 Claimant no longer pursued this argument in its subsequent pleadings or at the Hearing but referred to the VAT credits only in its discussion on quantum and noted that *\"lengthy administrative delays have, in themselves, been found to violate the FET standard.\"911* According to Claimant, it would be *\"inequitable for the State to use its own time lag in processing legal obligations as a way to avoid the obligation altogether\"912*\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6 162-164.\n\nReply, note 381.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6159.\n\n829.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is not inclined to allow Respondent to invoke its own administrative deficiencies to lower the amount of Claimant's compensation, Claimant's argument could be successful only if it were established that the delays either did not exist when Claimant made the decision to invest in Venezuela or if Claimant was assured that it would not be subject to such delays. The evidence shows that administrative delays in the VAT recovery procedure have been a rather well-known issue in Venezuela already back in the early 2000s when Claimant considered investing in Venezuela. A news article dating from 2000 reports that VAT refunds in the amount of VEF 100 billion were due since 1993.913 A further news article dating from 2003 reported that since 2001, VEF 170 billion were owed in VAT refunds.914 Finally, a news article dating from 2007 reported the issuance of recovery certificates in the amount of up to VEF 3.1 billion following delays of several months.915\n\n**App. BF-34**\n\n**App. BF-35**\n\n**App. BF-36**\n\n830.\n\nClaimant does not contest that exporters were facing considerable delays in obtaining VAT recovery when it made the decision to invest in Venezuela, but claims that it was assured that Venezuela would follow its own VAT credit procedure.916 Claimant relies in particular on Article 43 of the VAT Law, which provides that the tax administration shall render its decision on the recovery request within thirty business days *\"counted from the date in which the request is definitely received, so long as all of the requirements set forth to that end in the Rules, have been met.\"917* According to this language, the 30-day period starts only once the tax administration has received all of the supporting documentation required under the VAT Law, which is not necessarily equal to the date on which it has received the request because it is not unusual that the administration requests further documentation or information on certain issues, as Mr. Rondon explained in his written witness statement.918\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6159.\n\nEnglish translation submitted by Respondent as **Exhibit R-41.**\n\nRondon, \u00b6 38.\n\n831.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Claimant indeed received specific assurances that Venezuela would comply with this provision. In particular, Claimant could not point to any statement from a Government official that it would not be subject to the same delays that exporters were generally facing in Venezuela at the time. Mr. Pedersen testified in his written statement that based on meetings with CVG in 2005 they anticipated that they would receive *\"beneficial VAT and import tax treatment\"* without stating, however, that any specific assurances were made with regard to the VAT recovery procedure.919\n\nPedersen, \u00b624.\n\n832.\n\nThe contemporaneous documents that Claimant relies on in this regard explicitly refer to exemptions from VAT and import duties pursuant to a Presidential Decree granted in 2006, but not to the VAT recovery procedure for materials that were not exempted from VAT duty.920 As explained by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores in their first expert report, the VAT exemptions and the VAT recovery procedure concerned different materials, as under an exemption, Norpro Venezuela did not have to pay any VAT in the first place and could thus not be entitled to any refunds.921 As Norpro Venezuela was in fact granted an Exemption for Capital Goods Certificate by MILCO on 25 October 2007 that covered 29 specific types of equipment, it appears that the company actually received the *\"beneficial VAT treatment\"* that it had been promised. As there is no specific reference to the VAT recovery procedure for materials that were not covered by this certificate, the Tribunal finds that there is no legal basis under international law to exclude delays in the recovery procedure, provided that they are established, from the present valuation.\n\n*See* in particular **Exhibits C-079, C-082, p. 4** and **C-084.**\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 163.\n\n833.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has to assess whether Respondent has established that there were indeed delays of approximately two years in the VAT recovery procedure in 2010. As to the three news articles referred to above, Claimant correctly pointed out that they all date from three to ten years earlier.922 While they thus serve as evidence that delays were an issue when Claimant invested in Venezuela, they do not establish that the same delays still existed in 2010.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, note 348.\n\n834.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further pointed to a statement in Claimant's 8 June 2009 update to the DAC:\n\n*\"Partially linked to the export issues, recovering the VAT from the tax treasury has become a very lengthy and complex process. [...] The main causes for the delay are related to the legal requirements that have to be fulfilled before being granted an export license. Every single requirement has been identified and assigned a plan.\"923*\n\n**Exhibit R-7,** p. 6.\n\n835.\n\nWhile the DAC update confirms that the VAT recovery still took a considerable amount of time, the main reasons for the delays were seen in obtaining the export license, which had not been obtained as of June 2009. Apart from the fact that it was reported that every legal requirement was being tackled, Respondent's witness Mr. Rond\u00f3n stated in his written witness statement that by the time of the expropriation *\"Norpro Venezuela had notified the tax authorities of its intention to start the process to recover VAT credits by applyingfor a special tax recovery certificate based upon export sales.*\"924 During the Hearing, Mr. Rond\u00f3n clarified that Norpro Venezuela had actually submitted its application for a special tax recovery certificate and thus started the recovery process.925 As explained by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores in their first expert report, the company first had to obtain the export license before it could submit a tax recovery request.926 As Mr. Rond\u00f3n's testimony confirms that Norpro Venezuela had initiated the second step by May 2010, it must have completed the first step by that time, which had been described as the main cause for delays in the DAC update.\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 38\n\nTranscript (Day 3), p. 775 lines 10-19.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 168.\n\n836.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Rond\u00f3n stated in his written witness statement:\n\n*\"We were conscious that, even after a request for a special tax recovery certificate was initially submitted, the process would be lengthy and tedious and would involve verification of all related transactions. We also knew that it would be typical as part of the process for the tax authorities to seek additional documentation. I understand that this procedure* *to recover VAT in Venezuela lasts at least two years from the initial filing of the request.\"927*\n\nRond\u00f3n, \u00b6 38.\n\n837.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Respondent, Mr. Rond\u00f3n was not cross-examined on his statement on the VAT recovery procedure.928 The Tribunal also noted above that the 30-day period in Article 43 of the VAT Law starts only once the tax authority has received all documentation that it deems necessary for its decision on the recovery request. Apart from this provision, Claimant has not presented any indication that the statement made by Mr. Rond\u00f3n was inaccurate or that the situation had changed since the news articles dating from 2000, 2003 and 2007.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 412. The clarification referred to in paragraph 835 was made in response to a question from the Tribunal.\n\n838.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal follows the approach of Respondent's experts that the recovery procedure took considerable time during which new VAT credits were accumulating, thus creating a continuous balance of outstanding VAT credits. As Norpro Venezuela could not operate without continuously accumulating new VAT credits while waiting for the recovery of the initial balance, the Tribunal considers it plausible to assume that they form part of Norpro Venezuela's working capital as a going concern. As both Parties' experts assumed that production would have increased until 2014,929 - and with it the annual amount of newly accumulated VAT credits - the Tribunal further follows Respondent's experts in that Norpro Venezuela would have had a continuing outstanding balance of VAT credits equal to at least the amount outstanding in April 2010. As such amount would have continuously been locked in the operating business, it does not present any separate value that a willing buyer would pay for in addition to Norpro Venezuela's value as a going concern.\n\n*Cf.* Spiller I, \u00b6\u00b652 et seq.. and Figure 4; Barilovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 174.\n\n**(8) New Taxes Introduced after the Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n839.\n\nFinally, there has been a debate between the Parties and their experts as to the point in time from which Norpro Venezuela would have been subject to a contribution of 1% of the annual income to be made by companies with more than 50 employees under the Organic Law on Drugs. However, as explicitly noted by Respondent, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not include this contribution in their 15 May 2010 valuation because it was not applicable to Norpro Venezuela as of 2010 due to the use of its outsourcing model.930\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 256; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 243.\n\n840.\n\nThere is further common ground that a second contribution of 1% of the annual income under the Organic Law on Sports, Physical Activity and Physical Education is not to be included in the 15 May 2010 valuation because this law was enacted only in 2011 and thus not known to a willing buyer in 2010.931\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 256; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 243.\n\n841.\n\nAs there is agreement between the Parties that neither contribution could be foreseen as of 15 May 2010, the Tribunal finds that the two contributions cannot be included in the DCF calculation evaluating Norpro Venezuela as of that date.\n\n**c) Historical Losses Associated with the Increase of the Bauxite Price**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**aa) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n842.\n\nIn addition to the fair market value of the plant, Claimant claims that it is entitled to compensation for the losses it has incurred for the supply of bauxite under the Bauxite Contract due to the price increase in violation of Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty. In Claimant's view, Respondent is liable for the overpayment of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010.932\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6162-163; Spiller II, Table 12.\n\n843.\n\nClaimant argues that its *\"legal right to bauxite at the designated contractual price\"* of USD 25.5 per MT in 2008, inflated to USD 24.3 per MT in 2009, was part of the rights that were expropriated by Respondent. According to Claimant, Norpro Venezuela could otherwise have pursued its legal claims under the Bauxite Contract against CVG Bauxi-lum; thus, Claimant must be compensated for the taking of this intangible right.933\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199; Memorial, \u00b6 221.\n\n**bb) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n844.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's claim for damages is meritless because (i) Norpro Venezuela agreed to the bauxite price increase as long as there would be no further price increase throughout 2009; and (ii) the claim is inadmissible, as Norpro Venezuela should have pursued this claim for an alleged breach of the Bauxite Contract in an arbitration proceeding in Caracas, as provided for in the Contract.934\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 266.\n\n845.\n\nIn response to Claimant's argument that it expropriated Norpro Venezuela's legal right to vindicate its alleged claim against CVG Bauxilum, Respondent argues that Norpro Venezuela's contractual claims against CVG Bauxilum, even if it had any, were not expropriated.935\n\nRejoinder, note 857.\n\n**cc) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n846.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this claim again relates to Claimant's FET and FPS claims regarding the bauxite price increase in September 2008. Similar to the Tribunal's finding above that there is no basis to exclude the price increase from the valuation of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows as of 15 May 2010, it also finds that there is no basis for Claimant's separate claim to be compensated for the payment of the increased price prior to 15 May 2010.\n\n847.\n\nThis finding is independent of the question whether any contractual claims of Norpro Venezuela against CVG Bauxilum would have formed part of the expropriated rights for which Claimant is to be compensated. In any event, the Tribunal found that Claimant has not established that the price increase was not justified under the Bauxite Contract and is therefore not convinced that Norpro Venezuela had any claims for breach of contract against CVG Bauxilum that could have been expropriated.\n\n848.\n\nConsequently, Claimant is not entitled to compensation for the fact that it paid the increased price of USD 33.8 per MT between September 2008 and May 2010 that was quantified by Prof. Spiller at USD 1.3 million as of May 2010.936\n\nSpiller II, Table 12.\n\n**d) Conclusion on the Calculation of Damages**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n849.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal has found that the calculation of the compensation to be paid by Respondent has to be based on the net present value of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows as of 15 May 2010. The net present value is to be determined by applying a nominal discount rate of 19.88%.\n\n850.\n\nAs to the future cash flows of Norpro Venezuela, the Tribunal has found that (i) the assumptions on proppants prices should be based on the projections in Claimant's April 2010 Business Plan; (ii) a deduction of 25% should be made on the profits on export sales to account for the fact that Norpro Venezuela did not have its own marketing and distribution network; (iii) as to the foreign exchange rate to be applied, the devaluation assumptions after 15 May 2010 should be based on the exchange rate forecasts made by Ecoanalitica; (iv) the bauxite costs should be calculated on the basis of the increased price of USD 33.8 per MT that Norpro Venezuela in fact paid as of September 2008; (v) the transportation costs should include USD 11.9 per MT of local shipping costs within Venezuela for all sales, plus USD 119.83 per MT of shipping costs from Venezuela to Corpus Christi or Alice, Texas for all export sales, plus USD 43.4 per MT of shipping costs within North America for all North American export sales; (vi) the long-term capex for Norpro Venezuela should reflect the expenditures foreseen for the Fort Smith Plant under the MOB and the HSE capexes, but not the TECH and WCM capexes; and (vii) it should be assumed that the VAT credits form part of the working capital required for the continuous operation of Norpro Venezuela and thus do not present any separate value in addition to Norpro Venezuela's value as a going concern.\n\n851.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has found that Claimant is not entitled to any compensation for historic losses associated with the increase of the bauxite price in September 2008 because the price increase was justified under Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract.\n\n**3. Interest**\n---------------\n\n852.\n\nAs a final step, the Tribunal has to decide on Claimant's claim for pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 and its claim for post-award interest until the date of payment by Venezuela.\n\n**a) Summary of Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n853.\n\nClaimant claims that it is entitled to both pre-award interest and post-award interest. According to Claimant, it must be brought in the position it would have been in if the expropriation had not occurred; thus, the interest rate should be equal to the return it expected to earn from its investment in Venezuela, i.e., its opportunity cost.937\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 230, 232; Reply, \u00b6 202.\n\n854.\n\nClaimant relies on the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina,* which ordered interest at the claimant's cost of capital, finding that the interest rate should be *\"a reasonable proxy for the return the Claimants could otherwise have earned on the amounts invested and lost in the [...] concession.*\"938 Claimant further refers to the tribunal in *France Telecom v. Lebanon,* which awarded interest at a rate of 10% as the reasonable profitability of capital of which the claimant had been deprived by the State's unlawful actions.939 Claimant also relies on the tribunal in *Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine,* which awarded pre-award interest at the risk-free rate plus the market risk premium on the assumption that *\"this rate better reflects the opportunity costs associated with Claimant's losses, adjusted for the risks of investing in the Ukraine*,\"940 In addition, Claimant refers to the ICC tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA,* which granted interest at a rate corresponding to an investor's cost of equity in Venezuela.941\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, note 406 quoting from *Vivendi v. Argentina* **(CLA-024), \u00b6** 9.2.8.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, note 406 referring to *France Telecom v. Lebanon* **(CLA-034), \u00b6** 209.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 233; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, note 406 quoting from *Alpha Prjektholding v. Ukraine* **(CLA-002), \u00b6\u00b6** 514, 518.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 234; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, note 406 referring to *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA* **(CLA-** **064), \u00b6** 294-296; Reply, \u00b6 203 quoting from \u00b6 295(ii).\n\n855.\n\nClaimant argues that if they had re-invested the cash flows generated by Norpro Venezuela, they would have earned returns at its cost of equity. Therefore, Claimant claims that it should also be awarded both pre-award interest and post-award interest at a rate equivalent to Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity.942 Claimant takes the position that there is no reason to distinguish between the pre-award interest rate and the post-award interest rate except that the post-award interest rate should capture the present-day cost of equity figure (14.53% as of 31 August 2015).943\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 235; Reply, \u00b6 204.\n\nReply, \u00b6 207; Prof. Spiller's Valuation Update, Table 6; **Exhibit CLEX-198,** p. 2. Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity as of 15 May 2010 was calculated by Prof. Spiller at 13.56%. **Exhibit CLEX-81,** p. 32.\n\n856.\n\nIn addition, Claimant is of the view that any other interest rate would lead to an unjust enrichment of Respondent because it had free access to the expropriated funds. Claimant contends that the reasonable cost that PDVSA would have incurred if it had to borrow the amount in question is equal to the yields on its bullet bonds, which was close to 9% in 2013.944 According to Claimant, this would also be the minimum *\"appropriate\"* market interest rate under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, but maintains that under the standard of customary international law, it is entitled to Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity.945\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206. According to Claimant, this rate is *\"quite conservative\"* because Respondent's long-term borrowing rate is close to 13%. Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 182.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181, 183.\n\n857.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the interest rate cannot be based on the risk-free rate in the present case because Venezuela has trouble paying its debts and has to pay the Award in US dollars, i.e., a currency other than its own so that it cannot print money to satisfy the Award. Claimant argues that for more than five years it was forced to lend money to Venezuela despite the risk that it might not pay, which is why the market interest rate must reflect the costs of a mid- to long-term loan to Venezuela.946\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 184-186, Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 111, 114-115. In support of its position that the interest rate should reflect Respondent's risk, Claimant relies on a paper written by Fisher and Romaine, which discusses pre-judgment interest for damages awarded in US litigation. Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 110 quoting from **App. BF-96,** p. 147. However, Respondent clarified that Fisher and Romaine ultimately *\"retain the position that prejudgment interest should be awarded at the risk-free rate.\"* Respondent's letter dated 2 June 2015, 4 quoting from **App. BF-96,** pp. 147-148. This submission was admitted into the record by the Tribunal on 19 June 2015. The paper was also discussed with Respondent's expert during the Hearing. Transcript (Day 4), p. 1113.\n\n858.\n\nIn particular with regard to the post-award interest rate, Claimant argues that otherwise Respondent would have no interest in paying the Award before it has paid all of its other debts to its creditors. In Claimant's view, this would not serve the purpose of post-award interest to serve as an effective incentive to comply with the terms of the Award.947\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing submission, \u00b6\u00b6 188, 190.\n\n859.\n\nIn any event, Claimant asserts that the interest rate advanced by Respondent is not a market interest rate but rather equivalent to an inter-bank rate and refers to the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* which rejected Venezuela's suggestion on that basis. In addition, Claimant submits that none of the tribunals relied on by Respondent has applied a 3-month treasury bond but considers it *\"well settled\"* that the pre-award interest rate should reflect a mid- to long-term interest rate.948\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 109 quoting from *Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(CLA-155),** \u00b6 206.\n\n860.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the Tribunal should award interest on an annual compounding basis in order to fully reflect the time value of its losses and thus give effect to the standard of full reparation under customary international law.949 Claimant argues that *\"nearly all real-life transactions and financial operations\"* involve compound interest and notes that the tribunals in the five most recent ICSID decisions involving Venezuelan expropriations have awarded compound interest.950\n\nMemorial, 236-237; Reply, \u00b6 208; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 191-194.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 112.\n\n**b) Summary of Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's claim that it should be awarded interest in the amount of Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity and argues that this does not qualify as an *\"appropriate market interest rate\"* under Article 5(1) of the Trreaty. In addition, Respondent considers it *\"absurd\"* to update past cash flows at a higher rate than the discount rate that Prof. Spiller calculated for the purposes of discounting future cash flows, even though the risks and uncertainties of the future do not apply.951\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 250; Rejoinder, \u00b6 273.\n\n862.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimant's alternative argument of applying the rate applicable to PDVSA's debt is equally inappropriate because interest as a form of compensation should focus on Claimant's loss caused by the fact that it did not receive payment on a fixed date. As Claimant no longer bore any risk associated with its investment as of 15 May 2010, Respondent claims that the appropriate interest rate is the risk-free-rate.952\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 114-115 and \u00b6 121.\n\n863.\n\nAccording to Respondent, market interest rates in the commercial context are *\"almost always\"* based on a base rate, such as the LIBOR or the short term US Treasury bill rate, to be increased by a certain spread depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower, *i.e.,* in this case Claimant's ultimate parent company Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. In light of the integrity issue raised with regard to the LIBOR, Respondent takes the view that the interest rate should be based on the US Treasury bills; it selects the 3-month bills to compensate Claimant for any *\"short-term borrowing\"* it may have required pending the issuance of the present Award.953\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 251; Rejoinder, \u00b6 274; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 242.\n\n864.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina,* which awarded pre-award interest based on the average 6-month US Treasury bills (2.66%).954 Respondent further relies on the cases of *LG&E* and *BG Group* in which the tribunals applied short-term US Treasury bill rates.955 Respondent also refers to the tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador,* which applied the monthly rate on US Treasury bills stating that it \"ref/ec/[ed] *a prudent, risk-free and conservative re-investment practice*,\"956 Finally, Respondent relies on the tribunal in *Yukos v. Russia,* which awarded pre-award interest based on the average yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond.957 According to Respondent, various tribunals explicitly refused to apply the claimant's cost of capital as the basis for the pre-award interest rate.958\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117 referring to *Siemens v. Argentina* **(CLA-77), \u00b6** 396.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117 referring to *LG&E* **(CLA-48), \u00b6\u00b6** 102, 105 and *BG Group* **(CLA-113), \u00b6** 455.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117 quoting from *Occidental v. Ecuador* **(CLA-61), \u00b6** 842.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117 referring to *Yukos v. Russia* **(CLA-153), \u00b6\u00b6** 1685-1687.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 118-120 referring to PSEG (RL-86), \u00b6\u00b6 345, Guaracachi (RL-125), H 615 and Tza Yap Shum (RL-173), \u00b6\u00b6 288, 290.\n\n865.\n\nRespondent submits that the average yield on debt with a 3-month maturity carrying the same rating as that of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (BBB) was 1.09%, while the yield on short-term US Treasury bills was 0.08%. Respondent concludes that the applicable market interest rate to be applied to the net present value of the cash flows as of 15 May 2010 should thus be the 3-month US Treasury bill rate plus 1.01%.959\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 251 and\u2018 260: Rejoinder, \u00b6 274; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 242. In its request for relief, however, Respondent requests that 1.1% be added to the 3-month US Treasury bill rate. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 209; Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 64.\n\n866.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that interest should be calculated on a simple basis because compound interest is prohibited under Venezuelan law.960 In this regard, Respondent relies in particular on the tribunal in *Yukos v. Russia,* which held that simple interest was *\"just and reasonable.\"961* Respondent further contests Claimant's suggestion that awarding compound interest is the norm in international arbitration and refers to various decisions in which simple interest was applied.962\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 252.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 122 quoting from *Yukos v. Russia* **(CLA-153), H** 1689.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 244 referring to *RosInvestCo* **(RL-172), \u00b6\u00b6** 687-692, *Desert Line* **(RL-88) \u00b6** 295, *CME* **(CLA-20), \u00b6** 647 and *SPP* **(CLA-80), \u00b6** 236.\n\n**c) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n867.\n\nThe Tribunal will first determine the applicable pre-award interest rate **(aa))** and then assess whether there is any reason to apply a differing rate for post-award interest **(bb)).** Finally, the Tribunal will address the issue of simple versus compound interest **(cc))**.\n\n**aa) Pre-Award Interest Rate**\n-------------------------------\n\n868.\n\nAs the value of Norpro Venezuela and thus the amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant is to be assessed as of May 15, 2010, it is undisputed between the Parties that Claimant is further entitled to payment of pre-award interest as from this date.\n\n869.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller did not discuss pre-award interest (or the update of historical cash flows to be made in the alternative date-of-the-award valuation) but simply applied Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity based on an instruction from Claimant's counsel.963 In his 15 May 2010 valuation, he calculated pre-award interest on the basis of Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity (estimated at 13.04% as of 2014) and in the alternative based on PDVSA's cost of debt as the average yield of seven USD bullet bonds during 2013 (estimated at 9.08%), but again he did not discuss either alternative.964\n\nSpiller I, note 73; **Exhibit CLEX-01, \u00b6** 3(d).\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 138 (with note 217) and Table 13.\n\n870.\n\nMr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that *\"from a strict economic point of view\"* the pre-award interest rate should be the risk-free rate. However, they recognized that it is common in arbitration to apply *\"some sort* of 'normal' *commercial rate.\"* Therefore, they adopted two criteria: (i) a short-term maturity of three months as the date of the award is not known and the loan required as a result of the delay in payment must thus be renewed constantly; and (ii) Claimant's risk measured as the yield of debt with a BBB rating, i.e., the rating that Compagnie de Saint-Gobain carries. According to Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, the yield on BBB bonds with a 3-month maturity issued by industrial companies in the US was on average 1.09%, i.e., a spread of 1.01% over the US 3-month US Treasury bills.965\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6248-250; Brailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6\u00b6252-254 and Table 19. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores also note that, while the LIBOR rate has often been used as a benchmark in the past, it might be inappropriate to use it in the present case given that its integrity as suitable interest rate benchmark has recently been challenged. Brailovsky/Flores I, note 445.\n\n871.\n\nAs to the approach applied by Prof. Spiller, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores considered it incorrect to use 2013 and 2014 interest rates for a period starting on 15 March 2010 instead of a certain average over the time period in question. In addition, they note that only two of the PDVSA bonds used by Prof. Spiller had a short-term maturity - they yielded an average of 3.6% three months before maturity.966\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 259.\n\n872.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty provides that interest shall accrue at an *\"appropriate market interest rate\" (\"taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat de march\u00e9 appropri\u00e9\" / \"adecuada tasa de inter\u00e9s del mercado\").967* As to the standard under customary international law, Article 38 of the ILC Draft Articles provides that *\"[t]he interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve* [the] *result* [of ensuring full reparation].\"968 While the Tribunal is aware that an appropriate market interest rate is not necessarily the same as an interest rate that ensures full reparation of the damage Claimant incurred, it appears possible under the present circumstances to settle on a rate that satisfies both standards.\n\n**Exhibit C-1,** Article 5(1) subparagraph 2.\n\n**CLA-027,** Article 38(1).\n\n873.\n\nClaimant takes the position that under the standard of full reparation it would be entitled to interest at the rate of Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity as being equal to the return Claimant expected to earn from its investment.969 However, the Tribunal notes that, regardless of whether the expropriation would be labelled as *\"lawful\"* or *\"unlawful\"* this is not a case in which Respondent was not permitted to expropriate Norpro Venezuela *per se.* The Tribunal rather found that Respondent failed to comply with the requirements concerning the payment of compensation that should have accompanied the expropriation. Consequently, Claimant is not to be brought in the position it would have been in if it were still the owner of Norpro Venezuela, but rather in the position it would have been in if Respondent had paid compensation on or shortly after 15 May 2010.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232; Reply, \u00b6 202.\n\n874.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it would not be accurate to award Claimant interest at a rate that accounts for the risks of investing in a company located in Venezuela even though Claimant was no longer bearing these risks and, more importantly, would also not have been bearing these risks if it had been compensated on 15 May 2010. Therefore, the Tribunal will not award interest at Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity.\n\n875.\n\nAlternatively, Claimant claims that the appropriate market interest rate would be PDVSA' cost of debt, arguing that it was forced to grant a loan to Respondent in the amount of the compensation owed to it as of 15 May 2010.970\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 180-186.\n\n876.\n\nThere is no indication that the determination of an appropriate market interest rate should account for the State's cost of debt. Claimant has not cited any decision from an international tribunal in support of its submission but refers to a paper from Fisher and Romaine on pre-judgment interest in US litigation and a statement from Prof. Damodaran. However, as Respondent correctly pointed out in its letter of 2 June 2015, Fisher and Romaine considered that the risks associated with the particular defendant resulted from litigation rather than the violation itself and thus ultimately did not justify a deviation from the application of the risk-free rate.971 As to the statement made by Prof. Damodaran, the Tribunal notes that this statement did not concern the determination of an appropriate interest rate but was rather made as part of the requirements for an investment to be riskfree.972 Therefore, the Tribunal considers that none of the authorities cited by Claimant supports its position that the *\"appropriate market interest rate\"* should reflect Respondent's cost of debt.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 2 June 2015, \u00b6 4 quoting from **App. BF-96,** pp. 147-148. This portion of the letter was admitted into the record by Tribunal on 19 June 2015.\n\n**Exhibit C-158,** p. 6.\n\n877.\n\nIn principle, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and its experts (reyling on Fisher and Romaine) that the loss to be compensated by awarding interest on the principal amount is the time value of money, without factoring in any risks that Claimant did not bear.973 However, this does not render it completely irrelevant that, if Claimant had received the compensation on or shortly after 15 May 2010, it would have had the opportunity to reinvest this amount and earn a return considerably above the return of the risk-free rate. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances of this case, both the customary international law standard of full reparation and the standard in Article 5(1) of the Treaty require the application of what Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores described as *\"some sort* of 'normal' *commercial rate\"* that is commonly applied in arbitrations.974\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, **\u00b6** 251 quoting from **App. BF-96,** p. 146.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, **\u00b6** 248; Brailovsky/Flores II, 252.\n\n878.\n\nWhile Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores therefore added Claimant's cost of debt for shortterm loans to the risk-free rate, the Tribunal is not convinced that this appropriately captures Claimant's loss of investment opportunity in the present case. The Tribunal wishes to re-emphasize that it does not intend to award interest at a rate equal to the opportunity cost of Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela (nor in any hypotethical alternative investment), primarily because Claimant in fact did not bear the risk associated with such a rate of return. At the same time, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's own cost of debt does not adequately reflect the fact that, over a period of several years, Claimant was deprived of the opportunity to dispose of the money it should have received in connection with the expropriation of its investment in Venezuela.\n\n879.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the interest rate to be applied in the present case should therefore achieve a balance between, on the one hand, avoiding the granting of a rate of return that would not have been achievable without considerable risk, and on the other hand, acknowledging that Claimant would have been in a position to use its funds for more than just a risk-free investment if it had been paid on or shortly after 15 May 2010. In the Tribunal's view, this applies in particular in times where the risk-free interest rates are close to zero as they were for almost the entire time period between the date of the expropriation and the date of the Award.\n\n880.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal exercises the discretion it has under either Article 5(1) of the Treaty and under customary international law and awards an interest rate that qualifies as both an *\"appropriate market interest rate\"* and a rate that *\"ensure[s] full reparation\"* in terms of a reasonable opportunity to invest the principal amount in the market. Taking up the concerns raised by Respondent and its experts regarding the integrity of the LIBOR rate as a reliable benchmark for interest rates, the Tribunal will instead refer to the US Treasury bill rate, which both Parties' experts have relied on in various aspects of their valuations. As to the appropriate maturity, the Tribunal notes that, while Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied the 3-month rate, this choice is not supported by any of the cases relied on by Respondent in the context of its submissions on interest. It rather appears that the 6-month rate is a rate that is commonly applied by investment treaty tribunals.975\n\n*See, e.g., Siemens v. Argentina (CLAASTT),* 396; *LG&E Energy Corp, et at. v. Argentina* **(CLA-048),** 105; *BG Group Pic. v. Argentina* **(CLA-113), \u00b6** 455; *Occidental Petroleum Corporation et al. v. Ecuador* **(CLA-061), \u00b6\u00b6** 841-842. Tribunals that applied the LIBOR rate also commonly referred to the 6-month rate, *see, e.g.,* *Lemire v. Ukraine* **(RL-122), \u00b6** 353; *PSEG Global Inc. et al. v. Turkey* **(RL-86), \u00b6** 348.\n\n881.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this practice and therefore finds that the preaward interest rate should be based on the 6-month US Treasury bill rate. In order to reflect the above mentioned considerations relating to the balance between risk and reinvestment opportunity, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to add a spread of 2% to this risk-free rate.\n\n882.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to pre-award interest at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate.\n\n**bb) Post-Award Interest Rate**\n--------------------------------\n\n883.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant explicitly takes the position that there is no reason to distinguish between pre-award interest and post-award interest.976 However, the Tribunal is aware that Claimant makes this statement in the context of its argument that it should be awarded pre-award interest at a rate at least equal to Respondent's cost of debt. Specifically with regard to post-award interest, Claimant argues that if the interest rate were lower than Respondent's cost of debt, Venezuela would have no incentive to comply with the Award - contrary to the very purpose of awarding post-award interest.977\n\nReply, \u00b6 207.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 188 referring to Irmgard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law, 2009, **(RL-97),** 6,245-6.246.\n\n884.\n\nNeither Respondent nor its expert makes any explicit statement as to what they consider to be the applicable post-award interest rate in the present case. They also do not address Claimant's argument that post-award interest should serve as an incentive to comply with the Award.\n\n885.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Article 5(1) of the Treaty and Article 38(2) of the ILC Draft Articles provide that interest shall continue to accrue until the date on which the actual payment is made.978 Therefore, the Tribunal will award post-award interest on the amount to be paid pursuant to the Award.\n\n**Exhibit C-1,** Article 5(1) subparagraph 2; **CLA-027,** Article 38(2).\n\n886.\n\nAs to the applicable rate, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, in principle, there is no reason to apply differing rates for pre-award interest and post-award interest. The Tribunal further sees no reason to deviate from this general rule because it has found above that the applicable pre-award interest rate might be lower than Respondent's (alleged) cost of debt. In the Tribunal's view, post-award interest serves the same purpose as pre-award interest, i.e., to compensate Claimant for the time value of money and the fact that it cannot dispose of the amount until the date of actual payment; however, it is not meant to ensure compliance with the Award. Therefore, the Tribunal again considers that Respondent's cost of debt is not the appropriate benchmark to determine the applicable interest rate; rather, interest shall accrue at the same rate both prior to and following the Award.\n\n**cc) Simple / Compound Interest**\n----------------------------------\n\n887.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has to determine whether interest shall be calculated on a simple basis, as advanced by Respondent, or compounded annually, as claimed by Claimant.\n\n888.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that compound interest is prohibited pursuant to Article 530 of the Venezuelan Commercial Code and its reliance on the case of *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela,* in which the tribunal did not award compound interest based on the combined fact that this was not allowed by Venezuelan law and not required by international law.979\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 252 referring to **Exhibit R-55,** Article 530 *and* *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v.* *Venezuela* **(RL-124), \u00b6\u00b6** 396-397.\n\n889.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that this decision, which is the only one cited by Respondent in this regard, dates from 2003. As correctly pointed out by Claimant, several more recent decisions involving Venezuela included an award of compound interest, in particular *Tidewater, OI European* and *Venezuela Holdings* dating from 2015 and 2014 respectively.980\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission,\u00a0**\u00b6** 112 referring to *Tidewater v. Venezuela* **(CLA-155),** 208- 209, *OI European v. Venezuela* **(CLA-156), \u00b6\u00b6** 946, 952 and *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* **(CLA-154),** **\u00b6\u00b6** 394, 399.\n\n890.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fact that compound interest is not allowed under Venezuelan law does not prevent this Tribunal from awarding compound interest because the legal basis for Claimant's claim for interest is either Article 5(1) of the Treaty or customary international law. This finding is not in contradiction with the tribunal's finding in *Autopista v. Venezuela* because the tribunal in that case did not hold that Article 530 of the Venezuelan Commercial Code prevented it from awarding compound interest *per se* but rather noted this fact in addition to its finding that compound interest was not an established principle under, and therefore not required by, international law.\n\n891.\n\nAs more than a decade has passed since the *Autopista* award was rendered, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to re-assess the finding whether compound interest can be considered a well-established principle under international law. Upon review of the cases cited by the Parties in connection with interest, the Tribunal notes that a majority of them awarded compound interest.981 While Respondent did cite several cases in which interest was awarded on a simple basis, it appears that this was either due to the particular circumstances prevailing in the respective case or not supported by any reasoning for the tribunal's decision.\n\n*Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine* **(CLA-002), \u00b6** 14; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas v. Argentina* **(CLA-024),** 9.2.8; *France Telecom v. Lebanon* **(CLA-034),** **\u00b6** 209; *LG&E v. Argentina* **(CLA-048),** **\u00b6****\u00b6** 102-105; *Unglaube v. Costa* *Rica* **(CLA-051), \u00b6\u00b6** 319, 325; *Occidental v. Ecuador* **(CLA-061), \u00b6\u00b6** 842, 845; *Phillips v. Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela* **(CLA-64), \u00b6\u00b6** 294 et seq.; *Siemens v. Argentina* **(CLA-077),** **\u00b6****\u00b6** 396, 401; *Wena v. Egypt* **(CLA-089), \u00b6** 129; *BG* *Group v. Argentina* **(CLA-113), \u00b6\u00b6** 454-457; *PSEG v. Turkey* **(RL-86),** **\u00b6****\u00b6** 345, 348; *Lemire v. Ukraine* **(RL-122),**\u00a0**\u00b6\u00b6** 353, 356, 361; *Guaracachi v. Bolivia* **(RL-125), \u00b6\u00b6** 615-617; *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru* **(RL-173),** \u00b6\u00b6 289-292.\n\n892.\n\nIn particular, the tribunal in *Yukos v. Russia* on which Respondent relies explicitly recognized that *\"the awarding of compound interest under international law now represents a form* f' 'jurisprudence constante' *in investor-state expropriation cases\"* but deviated from this practice in light of the *\"significant amount of damages\"* owed by Russia.982 In *Rosin-vest v. Russia,* the tribunal recognized that *\"recent investment treaty arbitration have awarded compound interest\"* but also noted that *\"this practice is by no means unanimous\"* and held that *\"in light of the speculative nature of the investment\"* it would be unjust to award compound interest.983 The tribunal in *Desert Line v. Yemen* did not give any reasons for its decision to award simple interest rather than compound interest as requested by the claimants in that case.984\n\n*Yukos v. Russia* **(CLA-153), \u00b6\u00b6** 1689, 1691.\n\n*Roslnvest v. Russia* **(RL-172), \u00b6\u00b6** 689-690.\n\n*Desert Line v. Yemen* **(RL-88), \u00b6\u00b6** 295-298.\n\n893.\n\nIn *CME v. Czech Republic,* the tribunal again recognized that *\"in recent years international arbitral tribunals, particularly those acting under bilateral investment treaties, have increasingly have* [sic] *awarded compound interest essentially in recognition of the prevalent contemporary commercial reality that companies that borrow pay compound interest\"* The tribunal found, however, that the claimant had not established that it actually had paid compound interest on loans it had borrowed from banks and therefore did not find *\"particular circumstances\"* that would justify to award compound interest.985 The Tribunal notes that, while the *CME* tribunal apparently considered it necessary to find *\"particular circumstances\"* that justified compound interest, this decision again dates from 2003 and might therefore not be representative of recent developments in both market lending and international investment arbitration.\n\n*CME v. Czech Republic* **(CLA-020), \u00b6\u00b6** 645-647.\n\n894.\n\nFinally, the tribunal in *SPP v. Egypt* again decided that interest was not to be compounded without giving any specific reasons for its decision.986 As the decision dates from 1992, the Tribunal in any event considers that it does not provide useful guidance as to recent developments in international investment arbitration.\n\n*SPP v. Egypt* **(CLA-080), \u00b6** 236.\n\n895.\n\nIn sum, the majority of investment tribunals have in recent years decided to award compound interest and even most of those tribunals that decided to award simple interest for a particular reason, recognized that compound interest represents what the *CME* tribunal described as the *\"prevalent contemporary commercial reality.\"* The Tribunal would not go as far as saying that it would thus be for Respondent to establish particular circumstances that would justify not awarding compound interest. However, since the Tribunal has decided to award an appropriate market rate, it does not see any reason in the present case not to follow the majority of tribunals, which have decided to award compound interest on the principal amount.\n\n896.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that both pre-award interest and post-award interest shall be subject to compounding. As to the periodicity, the Tribunal follows Claimant's argument that interest should be compounded annually.\n\n**4. Taxation Liabilities**\n---------------------------\n\n897.\n\nFinally, Claimant requests in its two post-hearing submissions a declaration that (i) the award of damages and interest be made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes; and (ii) Venezuela may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest. In addition, Claimant requests that Respondent be ordered to indemnify Claimant in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures.987\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, 195; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 16.\n\n898.\n\nRespondent did not comment on this request in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief.\n\n899.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant has raised its claim regarding taxation liabilities only after the hearing, i.e., in its relief sought as set out in its Post-Hearing Submission and its Second Post-Hearing Submission. In addition, besides failing to provide any justification for its decision to raise this claim only at such a late point in time, Claimant has not made any submissions on the claim outside its relief sought.\n\n900.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal considers that it needs to distinguish between the first two claims relating to taxation of the awarded compensation within Venezuela on the one hand and the additional claim relating to potential double taxation liabilities that might arise outside of Venezuela on the other.\n\n901.\n\nAs to the first two claims, the Tribunal notes that the Parties' experts have both taken an income tax rate of 34% into account as part of their respective valuation of the compensation to which Claimant is entitled.988 The Tribunal further notes that, while the experts initially disagreed on a specific aspect of Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller's determination of the taxable income, i.e., the aspect of depreciation as modeled by Prof. Spiller in his first report,989 Prof. Spiller adopted the method of Respondents' experts Dr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores in his second report.990 This was acknowledged by Respondents' experts in their second report.991 It therefore appears to the Tribunal that the Parties' experts are in agreement as to the treatment of income taxes and depreciation in their calculations.\n\nSpiller I, \u00b6 138; Brailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6 136.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores I, \u00b6\u00b6 136-147.\n\nSpiller II, \u00b6 101.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores II, \u00b6 139.\n\n902.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers it justified to assume that the valuation method agreed on by the Parties adequately accounts for income taxes that would have had to be paid by Norpro Venezuela in the future in the but-for scenario.992 Any further taxation by Venezuela of the compensation to be paid to Claimant would therefore amount to a double-taxation of this amount. Consequently, the Tribunal holds that Claimant's request that (i) the award of damages and interest be made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes; and (ii) Venezuela may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest, is justified. In fact, it logically results from the valuation method selected by the Parties' experts and in particular their agreement on how to deal with income taxes in their calculations. In the Tribunal's view, no further elaboration on Claimant's part was necessary to grant this declaratory request and, moreover, it is unproblematic that Claimant included this request in its relief sought only as of its Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n*See* also *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* **(CLA-154),** \u00b6 389.\n\n903.\n\nConsequently, Claimant's request relating to the taxation of the awarded compensation with Venezuela is granted.\n\n904.\n\nAs to the additional claim for an indemnification in respect of any hypothetical future double taxation liabilities that might arise in any third country, the Tribunal considers that such claim would have required at least some elaboration by Claimant in order to be considered substantiated. Claimant has specified neither the legal basis for eventual taxation, nor the tax rate nor the grounds based on which Respondent should compensate it for incurring such liability. In addition, there is no indication that any such liability towards third-party States was included in the calculations of the Parties' experts and, thus, that a failure to grant Claimant's request in this regard would lead to a double-taxation of the awarded amount. Finally, the relief Claimant is seeking would have required at least a certain degree of probability that a third-party State will indeed impose taxes on the awarded compensation, which has not been alleged by Claimant.\n\n905.\n\nIn the absence of any submissions on this request outside Claimant's relief sought, the Tribunal considers that such request is speculative and unfounded;993 the Tribunal therefore sees no basis for ordering an indemnification against foreign taxation liabilities as requested by Claimant. Consequently, Claimant's claim that Respondent be ordered to indemnify Claimant in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures is denied.\n\n*See Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* **(CLA-154),** \u00b6 388.\n\n**V. Decision on Costs**\n------------------------\n\n906.\n\nIn accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal's decision on costs will form part of its Award.\n\n**G. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n907.\n\nThe present decision reflects the Tribunal's findings on liability and the principles of quantum as set out above. Subsequent to the notification of this decision to the Parties, the Tribunal will, by separate order, invite the Parties to attempt to seek agreement on the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela - based on the findings contained in the present decision. Failing agreement reached between the Parties within two months from the notification of this decision, the Tribunal will, following consultation with the Parties, fix a calendar for submissions of the Parties on the remaining quantum issues to be decided.\n\n908.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal renders the following\n\n**DECISION ON LIABILITY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM**\n\n**1. Respondent has breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty by failing to specify the amount of compensation and to pay prompt compensation for the expropriation of Claimant's investment in Venezuela.**\n\n**2. Respondent shall pay to Claimant the amount of compensation to be calculated on the basis of the Tribunal's findings summarized at paragraphs 849 through 851 above, plus pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 until the date of the Award at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.**\n\n**3. Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of compensation under 2 as of the date of the Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually. Post-award interest is to be paid only on the principal amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded.**\n\n**4. The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes, and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest.**\n\n**5. The decision on costs is reserved for the Award.**\n\n**6. All other claims and requests are dismissed.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-11-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| CLA- | Claimant's Legal Authorities |\n| Claimant's Cost Submission | Claimant's Cost Submission of 30 June 2015 |\n| Claimant's First Updated Cost Submission | Claimant's submission of its Updated Cost Submission of 23 November 2015 |\n| Claimant's Second Updated Cost Submission | Claimant's submission of its Updated Cost Submission of 28 July 2017 |\n| Claimant's Second Post Hearing Submission | Claimant's Simultaneous Second-Round Post-Hearing Submission of 22 May 2015 |\n| Counter Memorial | Respondent's Counter Memorial dated 21 March 2014 |\n| CVG Bauxilum | CVG Bauxilum, C.A. |\n| FET | Fair and Equitable Treatment |\n| France-Venezuela-BIT or \"the Treaty\" | Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection on Investments Between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Arbitration Rules | The ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| ICSID Convention | The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States |\n| ICSID Institution Rules | Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Procedures |\n| Rejoinder | Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits dated 18 September 2014 |\n| Request | Request for Arbitration against Respondent dated 25 May 2012 |\n| Respondent's Additional Cost Submission | Respondent's submission of its Additional Cost Submission of 28 July 2017 |\n| Secretariat | ICSID Secretariat |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Secretary-General | ICSID Secretary-General |\n| The \"Bauxite Claims\" | Claimant's claims that, by virtue of the increase of the bauxite price that had initially been agreed upon in the Bauxite Contract between Claimant and CVG Bauxilum, Respondent failed to accord to Claimant fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Treaty and to protect and secure Claimant's investment pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Treaty. |\n| The \"Bauxite Contract\" | The contract signed by CVG Bauxilum and Saint-Gobain Proppants Venezuela C.A. on 25 October 2005 |\n| The \"Decision\" | The Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum rendered by the Tribunal in this arbitration proceeding on 30 December 2016 |\n\n**A.

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a legal dispute between Saint-Gobain and Venezuela arising out of Venezuela's alleged refusal to compensate Saint-Gobain for the expropriation of Saint-Go-bain's investment in its 99.99%1 subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A. (\"**Norpro Venezuela**\" or \"**Norpro**\") following a televised speech of Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on 15 May 2010. Claimant alleges that Respondent breached the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (the \"**France-Venezuela-BIT**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"), which entered into force on 15 April 2004, by refusing to offer compensation for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela's proppants plant in Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, as well as by sanctioning or failing to intervene in the increase of the price for the supply of bauxite allegedly in breach of a contract entered into with a State-owned entity, thus failing to treat Claimant fairly and equitably and to accord its investment full protection and security, in violation of Articles 5(1) and 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.\n\nOne share is held by Mr. Luis P\u00e1ez, a Venezuelan national and the President of Norpro Venezuela, who subscribed a single share when Norpro Venezuela was incorporated. The planned transfer of Mr. P\u00e1ez's share to Saint-Gobain has not yet been completed. Request, \u00b6 4, note 4.\n\n6.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration against Respondent (the \"**Request**\") with the Secretary-General of ICSID in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\") and the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Institution Rules**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 29 May 2012, the Secretariat of ICSID (the \"**Secretariat**\") transmitted the Request to Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 June 2012, the Secretary-General registered Claimant's Request in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and 7 of the ICSID Institution Rules and notified the Parties of such registration. The case was assigned the ICSID Case Number ARB/12/13.\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 September 2012, Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn 3 October 2012, Respondent appointed Mr. Gabriel Bottini, a national of the Argentine Republic, as arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, Judge Brower accepted his appointment as arbitrator by Claimant, having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 October 2012, Mr. Bottini accepted his appointment as arbitrator by Respondent, having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n13.\n\nOn 12 November 2012, the Secretary-General informed Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs that the Parties agreed on his appointment as President of the Tribunal. By letter of 14 November 2012, Prof. Sachs accepted his appointment, having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Prof. Sachs, Judge Brower and Mr. Bottini had accepted their appointments as arbitrators and, accordingly, pursuant to Rules 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun as of such date; in addition, Ms. Natal\u00ed Sequeira was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal (the \"**Secretary**\").\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the exchange of written submissions and an oral hearing held in Washington, D.C., USA from 2 to 6 February 2015, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum on 30 December 2016 (the \"**Decision**\"), which forms an integral part of the Award. For the summary of the procedural history leading up to the issuance of the Decision, reference is made to Section C. of the Decision.\n\n16.\n\nIn the operative part of its Decision, the Tribunal held:\n\n1. Respondent has breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty by failing to specify the amount of compensation and to pay prompt compensation for the expropriation of Claimant's investment in Venezuela.\n\n2. Respondent shall pay to Claimant the amount of compensation to be calculated on the basis of the Tribunal's findings summarized at paragraphs 849 through 851 above, plus pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 until the date of the Award at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.\n\n3. Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of compensation under 2 as of the date of the Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually. Post-award interest is to be paid only on the principal amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded.\n\n4. The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes, and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest.\n\n5. The decision on costs is reserved for the Award.\n\n6. All other claims and requests are dismissed.\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it ordered:\n\nThe Parties are invited to liaise in an attempt to reach agreement on the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela - based on the Tribunal's findings summarized in paragraphs 849 to 851 of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum.\n\nThe Parties shall inform the Tribunal within two months from the notification of the Decision, *i.e*., by Wednesday, 1 March 2017, whether and to what extent they have been able to reach agreement on the matter set out under paragraph 3 above.\n\nIn case the Parties have not been able to reach agreement on the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant by 1 March 2017, the Tribunal will invite the Parties to agree on, or failing agreement to submit their respective proposals for, a calendar for submissions of the Parties on the remaining quantum issues to be decided.\n\n18.\n\nBy e-mail of 17 February 2017, the Parties jointly requested an extension of the 1 March 2017 deadline identified in paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 4 to 31 March 2017. By email of 18 February 2017, the Tribunal granted the Parties' extension request.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 30 March 2017, Respondent filed its submission on the final amount of compensation to be awarded to Claimant based on the findings made by the Tribunal in its Decision. In particular, it presented four figures calculated by the Parties' experts using their respective DCF models and proposed that the Parties agree on the second highest of these four amounts, *i.e*., the amount derived by Respondent's expert using its own economic model.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 31 March 2017, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it considered the results of the application of the DCF method based on the parameters set out by the Tribunal in its Decision inconsistent with the standard of compensation mandated by the Treaty and customary international law and requested that the Tribunal direct the Parties to confer and propose a calendar for submissions on the quantum issues to be decided.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing the exchange of further submissions between the Parties as regards the necessity to file new submissions on quantum and as regards Claimant's requests for reconsideration and correction of the Tribunal's Decision, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Claimant's Requests for Reconsideration and Correction on 28 June 2017 (the \"**Reconsideration Decision**\"). For a detailed summary of the submissions exchanged prior to the issuance of the Reconsideration Decision, reference is made to Section A. of the Reconsideration Decision.\n\n22.\n\nIn the cover letter dated 28 June 2017, transmitted to the Parties together with the Reconsideration Decision, the Tribunal made reference to paragraph 89 of the Reconsideration Decision, where it expressed the view that it was not yet in a position to determine the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of Claimant's investment without providing Claimant with the opportunity to comment on the contents of Respondent's letter of 30 March 2017. The Tribunal therefore invited Claimant to file its comments, in particular on Respondent's proposal to adopt the second highest of four figures calculated by the Parties' experts on the basis of the Tribunal's findings in its Decision as the final amount of compensation, by 12 July 2017.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 12 July 2017, Claimant commented on Respondent's letter of 30 March 2017 and, in particular and without prejudice to its previous submissions made in the context of its requests for reconsideration and correction, agreed with Respondent's proposal to adopt the second highest of four amounts. Claimant further requested leave to amend its submission on costs in light of additional fees and costs incurred subsequent to the last cost update in November 2015.\n\n24.\n\nIn its letter of 14 July 2017, the Tribunal invited both Parties to submit any updates to the Cost Submissions that they wished to be considered in the Tribunal's decision on costs to be included in the Award by 28 July 2017.\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 July 2017, Claimant filed an updated cost submission (\"**Claimant's Updated Cost Submission**\"). On the same date, Respondent filed an additional cost submission (\"**Respondent's Additional Cost Submission**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 7 August 2017, the Centre informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Mr. Francisco Grob, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Ms. Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**D. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n28.\n\nA detailed summary of the background facts that are not disputed between the Parties, or which have otherwise been established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the satisfaction of the Tribunal has been set out in Section D. of the Decision.\n\n**E. PARTIES'' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nFor detailed summaries of the Parties' positions on liability and quantum as argued in their written submissions and during the Hearing, reference is made to Sections E. and F. of the Decision.\n\n30.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's Decision, which dealt with the question of Respondent's liability under the Treaty and the principles of quantum applicable to the determination of the amount of compensation, the remaining issues to be addressed in this Award are: (i) the exact amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of its investment based on the findings made by the Tribunal in its Decision; and (ii) the allocation of the costs of the arbitration and the legal fees and costs incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration.\n\n**I. AGREED AMOUNT OF QUANTUM AND JOINT PROPOSAL**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn its letter of 30 March 2017, Respondent presented the results which had been calculated by the Parties' experts, who had each run their own and the other Party's expert's economic model based on the Tribunal's findings in its Decision, and exchanged between the Parties on 7 March 2017. These results were as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Respondent's Expert's Calculations****Using Using****Claimants Respondent's****DCF Model****DCF Model** (US$ Million) |\n| **1.** | **Value as of May 15, 2010** | **$** | **25.6 $ 29.6** |\n| **2** | **Interest through March 31, 2017** | **$** | **4.1 $ 4.8** |\n| **3** | **Total** | **$ 29.8 34 4****Claimant's Expert's Calculations Using Using****Claimant's Respondent's****DCF Model DCF Model****(US$ Million)** |\n| **4.** | **Value as of May 15. 2010** | **$** | **23.0 $ 30.6** |\n| **5** | **Interest through March 6, 201 7** | **$** | **3.6 $ 4.7** |\n| **6** | **Total** | **$** | **26.6 $ 35.3** |\n\n32.\n\nOn that basis, Respondent proposed that the Parties agree on the final amount of compensation derived by its expert using his own economic model, *i.e*., an amount of USD 34.4 million (including interest through to 31 March 2017).\n\n33.\n\nUpon invitation from the Tribunal to comment on Respondent's letter of 30 March 2017 and in particular the above mentioned proposal after the Tribunal's Reconsideration Decision had been rendered on 28 June 2017, Claimant stated in its letter of 12 July 2017 that: (i) Respondent's letter accurately reflected the four amounts calculated by the Parties' experts on the basis of the parameters set out in the Tribunal's Decision; and (ii) without prejudice to its previous submissions made in the context of its requests for reconsideration and correction of the Tribunal's Decision, it agreed with Respondent's proposal to adopt the second highest of these four amounts, *i.e.*, USD 34.4 million including interest through to 31 March 2017.\n\n**II. SUMMARIES OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nBoth Parties request that the Tribunal order reimbursement by the other Party of the costs they have incurred, respectively. In the following, the positions of the Parties on costs, as argued in their written submissions will be summarized.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant's Position on Costs**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimant submits that in light of the Tribunal's finding in its Decision that Respondent breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, Respondent should be ordered to bear the entirety of Claimant's costs plus compound interest calculated annually from the date of the Award until the date of payment by Venezuela.2\n\nClaimant's Updated Cost Submission, p. 1.\n\n36.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal's authority to assess and apportion the costs between the Parties is derived from Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which is generally understood broadly so as to include: (i) fees, allowances and any other expenses incurred by attorneys and experts; and (ii) all travel expenses and costs incurred by witnesses, advisors and representatives of the Parties.3\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n37.\n\nClaimant further submits that a tribunal should exercise its authority to award costs and to apply the rule of \"*costs follow the event*\" particularly in cases where a respondent State has breached its treaty obligations. According to Claimant, tribunals \"*have consistently awarded the claimant all or a portion of its reasonable costs*\" in such circumstances. Claimant makes reference to *ADC v. Hungary* and *Gold Reserve*, where the tribunals linked their costs award to the principle of full reparation established in *Chorz\u00f3w*.4 Claimant further quotes from an authority who considers that \"*there is a case for treating the arbitration costs incurred by a claimant who is found to have suffered damages at the hands of a State (or vice versa) as being among the* 'natural, normal and predictable consequences of the damage inflicted.'\"5\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, *quoting from* *ADC v. Hungary* (**CLA-001**), \u00b6\u00b6 531, 533 *and* *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* (**CLA-152**), \u00b6 860.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 8, *quoting from* Bienvenu, Pierre and Valasek, Martin J., \"*Compensation for Unlawful Expropriation, and Other Recent Manifestations of the Principle of Full Reparation in International Investment Law*\", in Albert Jan van den Berg (ed.), 50 Years of the New York Convention: ICCA International Arbitration Conference, 14 ICCA Congress Series 231 (2009) (**CLA-011**).\n\n38.\n\nClaimant argues that it is not necessary for a claimant to prevail on each of its claims in order to be eligible for reimbursement of its reasonable costs and refers to the tribunal in *Hochtief v. Argentina*, which considered it sufficient that \"*the core of the claim ha*[d] *been upheld*\" and that the claimant was \"*entitled to reparation for the losses caused by Respondent's violation of Claimant's rights under the BIT*.\"6 According to Claimant, the logic of full reparation mandates that \"*as long as there has been some breach of a claimant's treaty rights requiring resort to arbitration, a costs award is necessary to put the claimant back in the position it would have been in had the breach never occurred*.\"7\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 9, *quoting from* *Hochtief v. Argentina* (**CLA-160**), \u00b6 330.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\n39.\n\nClaimant claims that the tribunals in *OI European v. Venezuela* and *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela* applied this approach by requiring Venezuela to pay for the costs of the proceeding and a substantial part of the claimant's reasonable legal costs, respectively.8 In addition, Claimant makes reference to the decision in *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, where the tribunal held that the expropriation was lawful but nevertheless awarded costs to the claimants, holding that \"[t]*he result is that* [claimants] *have been put to a great deal of time, trouble and expenses in order to obtain compensation that Venezuela had vouchsafed to provide under the terms of the Barbados BIT and ought to have so provided in 2009*.\"9\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 10, *referring to OI* *European Group v. Venezuela* (**CLA-156**), \u00b6\u00b6 969-976 *and* *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela* (**CLA-161**), \u00b6\u00b6 994-995, 997, 1000-1001.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 11, *referring to* *Tidewater v. Venezuela* (**CLA-155**), \u00b6 213.\n\n40.\n\nClaimant notes that Respondent does not challenge the Tribunal's authority to grant a costs award but rather seeks one itself, relying on Claimant's non-participation in the procedures provided under Venezuelan law for the determination of the compensation due to Claimant. In response to that argument, Claimant emphasizes that it would not have had to participate in such proceedings if Respondent had complied with its obligations under the Treaty and Venezuelan law by providing Claimant with adequate compensation at the time of expropriation. As a result of Respondent's failure to do so, Claimant argues that it had to initiate legal action, which resulted in delays that cost it significant time and financial resources.10\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. *See also* Claimant's First Updated Cost Submission, p. 1.\n\n41.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the fact that its challenge and application for provisional measures were not successful cannot serve as grounds to deviate from the principle of full reparation, arguing that \"*good-faith procedural conduct resulting in a minor delay*\" does not justify awarding costs to the opposing party. Claimant refers to the case of *Postov\u00e1 Banka v. Hellenic Republic* where the tribunal did not make a costs order despite ruling in favor of the respondent on jurisdiction, holding that the \"*issue was not clear-cut and involved a complex factual and legal background. Each side presented valid arguments in support of its respective case and acted fairly and professionally*.\"11\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 16, *quoting from Postov\u00e1 Banka v. Hellenic Republic* (**CLA-163**), \u00b6 377.\n\n42.\n\nOn the other hand, Claimant claims that an adjustment to the costs award may be warranted \"*in light of extreme conduct or abuse of process by parties, including deliberate obstruction of proceedings*,\" which it considers to be the case here due to Respondent's refusal to pay its share of the advances on costs as required by ICSID Regulation 14(3)(d). Claimant argues that Respondent thereby \"*threatened the continuity of the proceedings*\" and forced it to pay Respondent's share to avoid discontinuance of the proceedings. Claimant refers to the decision in *Venoklim v. Venezuela*, where the tribunal took note of Venezuela's similar conduct and ordered it to reimburse the claimant for its unpaid share of the advance on costs.12\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 18, *referring to* *Venoklim v. Venezuela* (**CLA-165**), \u00b6\u00b6 163-165.\n\n43.\n\nBased on the above and pursuant to Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Claimant seeks reimbursement of: (i) the advances of fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and ICSID's administrative fees; (ii) the travel costs and expenses of Claimant's witnesses and party representatives; and (iii) the costs of its legal representation, independent experts and consultants.13 According to Claimant's Updated Cost Submission filed on 28 July 2017, Claimant has incurred the following costs:14\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **Updated Total****Amount as of 28****July 2017 (USD)** |\n| Tribunal and ICSID Costs | 1,425,00015 |\n| Travel Costs and Expenses of Witnesses and Representatives | 85,227.27 |\n| Attorney's Fees and Disbursements | 5,214,398.70 |\n| Valuation Expert Fees and Disbursements | 1,652,172.11 |\n| **Total Costs Claimed** | **8,376,798.08** |\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimant's Second Updated Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\nThis amount includes the final advance on costs requested by ICSID by letter of 17 August 2017, which was paid by Claimant and received by ICSID on 6 September 2017.\n\n**2. Claimant's Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal:16\n\n(a) ORDER that Venezuela reimburse Saint-Gobain for the following fees and costs, plus compound interest calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of the Award until the date of payment by Venezuela:\n\n(i) USD 1,425,000.00, which corresponds to the advances on the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees of ICSID made by Saint-Gobain;\n\n(ii) USD 85,227.27, which corresponds to the reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by Saint-Gobain's witnesses and representatives;\n\n(iii) USD 5,214,398.70, which corresponds to the fees and disbursements of Saint-Gobain's counsel Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, LEC Partnes LLC, and Sosa & Mart\u00ednez Estudio Jur\u00eddico (including USD 53,374.49, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of Saint-Gobain's legal expert, Dr. Brewer-Car\u00edas, and USD 15,512.26, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of Saint-Gobain's technology consultants, FTI Consulting and Immersion Legal Graphics, LCC); and\n\n(iv) USD 1,652,172.11, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of Saint-Gobain's valuation expert, Compass Lexecon.\n\n(b) AWARD any other relief it may deem appropriate.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 30 with figures updated from Claimant's Second Updated Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n**3. Summary of Respondent's Position on Costs**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants the Tribunal authority to assess by whom the expenses of the Parties, as well as the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and charges for the use of ICSID facilities, shall be borne.17\n\nCounter Memorial, \u00b6 271; Rejoinder, \u00b6 280.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent submits that ICSID tribunals often exercise their discretion by awarding costs to the party that prevailed in the arbitration proceedings and claims that it should be considered the prevailing party in this case. Respondent makes reference to Claimant's request to reconsider the Tribunal's Decision, which was unanimously rejected, and to the figures derived by the Parties' experts based on the Tribunal's findings. Respondent notes that all of these figures, which range from USD 23 million to USD 30 million (excluding pre-award interest) are \"*far lower than the grossly exaggerated amounts that Claimant demanded throughout the case*,\" *i.e*., USD 99.5 million as of 15 May 2010 or USD 120.5 million as of 31 May 2014.18\n\nRespondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n47.\n\nRespondent further invokes Claimant's refusal to participate in the procedures for determining compensation under Venezuelan law and its request for provisional measures against those procedures, which, in Respondent's view, \"*frustrated their implementation*.\" According to Respondent, there would have been no need to incur the expenses of this arbitration if Claimant had \"*taken a reasonable position*\" in this regard.19\n\nRespondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n48.\n\nRespondent argues that \"[i]*n light of Claimant's strategic decision not to participate in the procedures provided under Venezuelan law for the determination of just compensation and instead to engage in tacticts to delay such a determination, and given Claimant's grossly excessive compensation demand in this case*,\" Claimant should be ordered to bear all of the costs incurred by the Parties as well as the costs of the arbitration.20\n\nCounter Memorial, \u00b6 272; Rejoinder, \u00b6 281.\n\n49.\n\nPursuant to Respondent's Additional Cost Submission filed on 28 July 2017, Respondent has incurred the following costs:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount (USD)** |\n| Fees of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP until 23 November 2015 | 4,144,946.25 |\n| Fees of Venezuelan Legal Counsel | 162,637.00 |\n| Economic Expert - Vladimir Brailovsky | 340,565.63 |\n| Economic Expert - Econ One (Daniel Flores) until 23 November 2015 | 1,415,833.74 |\n| Transportation and Travel Expenses | 199,955.50 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount (USD)** |\n| Document Production/Duplicating & Word Processing | 126,876.84 |\n| Courier Service | 9,390.96 |\n| Fees and disbursements of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP after 23 November 2015 | 127,468.75 |\n| Fees and disbursements of Respondent's economic expert Econ One (Daniel Flores) after 23 November 2015 | 61,370.11 |\n| **Total Costs Claimed** | **6,589,044.78** |\n\n**4. Respondent's Relief Sought**\n---------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal award costs against Claimant and, in this case, implement that decision by deducting from the final amount of compensation determined by the Tribunal all of Respondent's costs indicated in the updated Cost Submission of 23 November 2015 and in the Additional Cost Submission.21\n\nRespondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n**F. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. THE PARTIES' AGREEMENT ON QUANTUM**\n----------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties have reached agreement on the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela based on the findings contained in the Tribunal's Decision. This consent is expressed in Respondent's letter of 30 March 2017 and Claimant's letter of 12 July 2017.\n\n52.\n\nBased on the agreement reached between the Parties, the Tribunal therefore determines that the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of its investment, calculated on the basis of the Tribunal's findings summarized at paragraphs 849 through 851 of its Decision, amounts to USD 34.4 million. This amount includes pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 through to 31 March 2017 in the amount of USD 4.8 million.\n\n53.\n\nRespondent shall further pay to Claimant pre-award interest, calculated at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually, from 1 April 2017 until the date of this Award.\n\n54.\n\nFinally, Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest as determined by the Tribunal in its Decision. Such interest shall start to accrue from the 30th day following the date of this Award.\n\n**II. DECISION ON COSTS**\n-------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal's authority to render a decision on the allocation of costs is based on Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n\"*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award*.\"\n\n56.\n\nThere is further common ground that the Tribunal's discretion to \"*assess the expenses incurred by the parties*\" extends to all costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration proceedings, *i.e*., including the fees charged for their legal representation and valuation experts.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus exercise its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and decide on the allocation of: (i) the costs of the arbitration, which includes the administrative fees charged by ICSID as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal; and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration.\n\n**1. The Costs of the Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will address the question of who shall bear the costs of the arbitration. As to the advances on costs paid in this regard, the Tribunal notes that, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, ICSID requested the Parties to pay each of the respective advances on costs in equal shares. Respondent, however, has not paid its 50% share pursuant to any of the advance payment requests issued by ICSID over the course of this proceeding. Upon request, Claimant has therefore paid its own as well as Respondent's share of the advances on costs in the total amount of USD 1,425,000.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Respondent's refusal to pay its share of the advances on costs constitutes a breach of the ICSID procedural framework, which the Tribunal will take into account in its decision on the allocation of the arbitration costs.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls its finding in the Decision that Respondent has breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty by failing to specify the amount of compensation and to pay prompt compensation for the expropriation of Claimant's investment.22 At the same time, the Tribunal notes that it did not make a finding on whether Respondent has breached its own domestic laws concerning the expropriation process and whether any such breach amounted to a lack of due process as alleged by Claimant in this proceeding.23\n\nDecision, \u00b6 480 and order no. 1.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 504.\n\n61.\n\nIn any event and irrespective of whether Respondent's conduct was in compliance or in breach of its own expropriation laws, the Tribunal notes that, to its knowledge, Respondent has to date, *i.e*., more than seven years after the expropriation date, not paid any amount of compensation to Claimant and has not deposited any amount of preliminary compensation with a competent court in Venezuela - despite the fact that it has always recognized the occurrence of an expropriation that requires payment of just compensation. In this context, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's argument that Claimant's request for provisional measures frustrated the implementation of Venezuelan procedures for determining compen-sation,24 given that the Tribunal decided in its Procedural Order No. 3 to deny Claimant's request in full and thus refrained from ordering Respondent to discontinue any domestic proceedings related to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela.\n\n*Cf*. Respondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n62.\n\nAgainst this background and taking into account Respondent's failure to comply with the requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it was forced by Respondent's conduct to initiate this arbitration proceeding in order to obtain adequate compensation for the expropriation of its investment in Venezuela.25 Consequently, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration, which amount to (in USD):26\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nProf. Dr. Klaus Sachs 508,122.79\n\nThe Honorable Charles N. Brower 256,489.47\n\nMr. Gabriel Bottini 229,089.47\n\nICSID's administrative fees 160,000\n\nDirect expenses27 149,488.26\n\n**Total** **1,303,189.99**\n\n*Cf*. Claimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account.\n\nThis amount includes charges relating to the dispatch of the Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n63.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay Claimant USD 1,303,189.99 for the expended portion of the advances to ICSID.28\n\nThe remaining balance of the advances will be reimbursed to Claimant.\n\n**2. The Costs Incurred by the Parties in Connection with this Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will assess the question of who shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that neither Party has raised any objection to the reasonableness of the costs incurred by the other Party and that, in fact, the total costs that each of them incurred are within a similar range of approximately USD 6.5-7 million.\n\n65.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, in particular given that Claimant had to initiate the present arbitration proceeding to obtain compensation, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall bear a certain portion of the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this proceeding. In its assessment of the specific portion that should be borne by Respondent, the Tribunal has particularly taken into account the following considerations.\n\n66.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recalls that while it has found a breach of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty and left open whether there was a breach of due process in the expropriation process, it denied Claimant's Bauxite Claims, *i.e*., its claims that Respondent breached Article 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty by virtue of the increase of the bauxite price that was initially agreed upon in the Bauxite Contract entered into between Claimant and CVG Bauxilum.29\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 542 and 560.\n\n67.\n\nSecond, as for quantum, the Tribunal recalls that while Claimant requested in its final submission to be awarded compensation in the amount of USD 99.5 million plus pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010,30 Respondent requested that compensation should be awarded in the amount of USD 9.5 million excluding pre-award interest.31 Respondent argues that in light of the amount agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Tribunal's findings in its Decision, *i.e*., USD 29.6 million excluding pre-award interest, it should be considered the prevailing party in this arbitration.32 The Tribunal cannot agree with this characterization. Apart from the Tribunal's finding on liability that Respondent has breached its obligations under the Treaty, the Tribunal notes that as a result of its findings on the principles of quantum, Claimant is entitled to approximately 30% of what it has requested or to more than 300% of the compensation that Respondent has considered just in the context of this arbitration.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 116.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Reply Brief, \u00b6 64.\n\nRespondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\n68.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent,33 Claimant has further initiated three incidental proceedings, *i.e*., (i) a request to disqualify arbitrator Bottini; (ii) a request for provisional measures directed at discontinuing all domestic proceedings in Venezuela related to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela; and (iii) a request for reconsideration and correction of the Tribunal's Decision. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary at this stage to express an opinion as to whether each of these three requests was \"*substantial and properly required the Tribunal's consideration*,\" as was the case in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* on which Claimant relies in this regard.34 In the Tribunal's view, it suffices to note for the present purposes that all three requests were unsuccessful.\n\nRespondent's Additional Cost Submission, p. 2.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 17, *quoting from* *Tidewater v. Venezuela* (**CLA-155**), \u00b6 212.\n\n69.\n\nTaking into account all of the above considerations, the Tribunal does not consider it justified to order that Respondent shall bear the entirety of the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this arbitration. The Tribunal is of the view that it is appropriate for Respondent to bear two thirds of the costs incurred by Claimant. Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse Claimant with an amount of USD 4,634,532.05.\n\n**3. Interest on Costs Award**\n------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs a final matter, Claimant requests that Respondent be ordered to reimburse its costs, plus compound interest calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of the Award until the date of payment by Venezuela.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to award interest on the amount of costs that Respondent is ordered to reimburse at the same post-award interest rate as on the principal amount of compensation, *i.e*., at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually. Such interest shall start to accrue from the 30th day following the date of this Award.\n\n**G. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal35 renders the following\n\n**AWARD**\n\n**1. Respondent shall pay to Claimant within 30 days of the date of this Award: (i) USD 29.6 million as principal amount of compensation for the expropriation of Claimant's investment in Venezuela; and (ii) USD 4.8 million as pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 through to 31 March 2017.**\n\n**2. Respondent shall further pay to Claimant within 30 days of the date of this Award pre-award interest on the principal amount of compensation under 1,** ***i.e*****., USD 29.6 million, as of 1 April 2017 until the date of this Award at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.**\n\n**3. Subject to the limitation that post-award interest is to be paid only on the principal amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded, Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the principal amount of compensation under 1,** ***i.e*****., USD 29.6 million, as from the 30th day following the date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.**\n\n**4. The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes, and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest.**\n\n**5. Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration,** ***i.e*****., the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal as well as the charges for the use of the facilities of ICSID, in full. Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse Claimant with an amount of USD 1,303,189.99 within 30 days of the date of this Award.**\n\n**6. Respondent shall further bear two thirds of the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this arbitration proceeding and thus reimburse Claimant with an amount of USD 4,634,532.05 within 30 days of the date of this Award.**\n\n**7. Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of costs to be reimbursed under 5 and 6 as from the 30th day following the date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.**\n\n**8. All other claims and requests are dismissed.**\n\nArbitrator Bottini believes that, whenever an ICSID tribunal exercises its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and enters an adjusted costs order (i.e., ordering one party to pay the other party's costs or the tribunal's costs, in full or in part), two relevant factors to be considered are the extent to which the claimants' damages claim has been granted and who has prevailed in any incidental proceeding decided in the arbitration. Arbitrator Bottini finds that the Tribunal's decision on costs reflects neither of these two factors."}]}
