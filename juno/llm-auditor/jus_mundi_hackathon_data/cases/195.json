Following the filing by Claimants of the Memorial on the merits, Respondent on 15 March 2016 filed a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdictions and Counter-Memorial on the Merits containing a request for bifurcation. Having considered the Parties' submissions on that request, the Tribunal decided by Procedural Order N\u00b0 3 of 25 April 2016 to \"deal with Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal as a preliminary question, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\" and to \"bifurcate the proceedings into separate jurisdiction and merits phases, such that the jurisdiction phase will deal with all objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal\". The present Decision on Jurisdiction puts an end to the jurisdictional phase of the case.\n\n2.\n\nDuring this jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal considered the three preliminary objections on the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal filed by Respondent, namely:\n\nFirst Objection: There is no claim for a *prima facie* violation of the BIT;\n\nSecond objection: There is no consent to arbitrate because Claimants failed to accept Argentina's offer to arbitrate in the BIT; and\n\nThird Objection: There is not jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\n3.\n\nThe present majority Decision on Jurisdiction rejects apparently Respondent's three preliminary objections, deciding: A) that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute concerning Claimants' claims for breach of Articles 2(1) and 4(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT; and B) that it has no jurisdiction over the present dispute concerning claims for beach of Article 3(1) of that BIT. I reject this decision adopted by the majority of the Tribunal, and enter into the present Dissenting Opinion concerning Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection (PART ONE) and into a Declaration of dissent explaining my vote on Respondent's First and Second Preliminary Objections. (PART TWO)\n\n4.\n\nMy choice for casting under the form of an opinion my views on Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection is due to the fact that *consent* is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of Centre and, generally, of arbitration in public international law and that the majority analysis and conclusions thereon are, in my opinion, particularly unfortunate in the light of the law applicable to the case, as well as contrary to considerations of legal security with respect to the formation under the BIT system of the needed binding arbitration agreement between the Parties to the dispute referred to in paragraph 6 of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**PART ONE** - **Dissenting Opinion on Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction:** ***There is not mutual consent of the Parties to the dispute to submit it to international arbitration***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nArgentina's second objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, Claimants having failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 8 of the 1992 Argentina/Austria BIT (in force since 1 January 1995) invoked by them, as the basis for jurisdiction in the instant case, in their Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014 registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 18 December 2014. As indicated in paragraph 134 of the present Decision, Claimants contend that they \"validly accepted Respondent's offer to arbitrate under Article 8 of the BIT\". And, to this effect, they argue that *strict compliance* with the various *procedural* requirements of Article 8 \"*is not a condition for the validity of the Parties' consent to arbitration*\" *.* Instead, for Claimants \"compliance with Article 8 of the BIT raises *merely questions of admissibility\".* (Emphasis added)\n\n6.\n\nThese contentions of Claimants basically accepted by the present majority Decision, are in full contradiction with the *jurisprudence* of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with respect to the principle qualified by the Court as the \"fundamental principle of consent\". For example, in the *Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application 2002),* the Court stated that:\n\n\"(The Court) jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them... When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon. The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application.\" (*Case Concerning Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application 2002), (DR of Congo v. Rwanda)*, *ICJ Reports 2006*, p. 39, para. 88) (AL RA 39).\n\nAs the above statement of the ICJ appears quoted in paragraph 141 of the Decision on Jurisdiction of the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* Tribunal of 2 July 2013 (CL-134), a decision referred to in various contexts by Claimants, the present arbitrator presumes that they are aware of that Court's statement but reject it, notwithstanding that the Court's jurisprudence thereon is declaratory of the fundamental principle of State's consent to jurisdiction of public international law. The same applies *mutatis mutandis* to my coarbitrators because otherwise their conclusions in paragraphs 263 to 328 of the present Decision would be incomprehensible.\n\n7.\n\nFor my part, I consider that the above contentions of principle of Claimants are untenable propositions because *inter alia* they are in full contradiction with: (i) the established jurisprudence of the ICJ on the matter; (ii) the systemic principle of public international law of State's consent to the jurisdictions of international courts and tribunals; (iii) the rules governing international arbitration in general as well as in the ICSID Convention; (iv) the text and context of Article 8 of the Argentina/Austria BIT; (v) the rules of international law on interpretation and application of treaties codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) applicable in the relations between Argentina and Austria; (vi) the lengthy line of case-law in international investment arbitration which during the last decades has acknowledged and explained that requirements as those set forth in Article 8 of the BIT are indeed *jurisdictional requirements* ; (vii) the admission by Claimants in the letter of 30 April 2014 addressed to the President of the Argentine Republic notifying that a dispute arose under Article 8 (1) of the BIT as a result of the revocation of the licence of ENJASA by ENREJA and that \"the requirements to submit the dispute to arbitration under Articles 8(2) and Article 8(3) b) are fulfilled\"; and (vii) Claimants' statements to the effect that \"irrespective of the legal qualification of the procedure set forth in Article 8 BIT, Claimants have complied with it and were entitled to refer the dispute to arbitration\" confirming thereby that what they characterize as *\"procedural requirements\"* have nonetheless to be complied with by investors in order to meet the \"offer\" of international arbitration made by Argentina and Austria in Article 8 (4) of the BIT (see, for example, Claimants' PHB, para. 195). It should be noted however with respect to the letter of 30 April 2014 that in that letter CAI states that it \"accepts the offer in Article 8(5) BIT to submit the dispute to arbitration\" concerning the selection of ICSID arbitration, but kept silent concerning the core consent to arbitration offer made in Article 8(4) by the Contracting States of the BIT.\n\n8.\n\nFor the above and other considerations to be developed further below, I uphold, as already indicated, the *ratione voluntatis* preliminary objection filed by Respondent which I consider rightly founded upon the elements of fact and law concurring in the instant case and in conformity with the admissions of and proofs administered by the Parties. The present opinion is aimed at developing in detail the motives for my rejection of the conclusion of my colleagues on Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection. I will begin by recalling in the first place the main principles and rules of international law (conventional and customary) applicable to this phase of the case, an essential element diminished, when not absent, in the reasoning of the present majority Decision.\n\n**A. The Law Applicable to the Case**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The respective general position of the Parties**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe general positions of the Parties on the law applicable to the case differ from each other. One of the first issues concerns their disagreement as to the meaning of *\"compliance\"* in connection with the application of the conditions and requirements set out in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Should the term mean compliance *tout court* (position of Respondent) or would an alleged *non-strict* compliance suffice (position of Claimants)? And further, does it make sense, legally, to refer to a \"*non-strict compliance\"* in the face of the clear mandatory provisions of Article 8(1) to (4) of the BIT or is the expression simply a sagacious manner to disguise eventual non-compliances as compliances? Furthermore, Claimants contended expressly that \"[c]ompliance with Article 8 of the BIT *is not a question of consent\",* without excluding altogether that it could be binding on other grounds (see Claimants' Opening Statement, Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 168:24-25, English version). (Emphasis added)\n\n10.\n\nThus, Claimants' non-strict compliance argument goes hand in hand with an attempt to side-pass the *cornerstone issue* of the existence *in casu* of the required \"arbitral agreement\" which cannot be reached but by the mutual consent of the Parties to the dispute to submit it to ICSID arbitration. A similar path has already been followed before in ICSID arbitrations by claimants in difficulties to prove the existence of the mutual consent of the Parties to the dispute required for jurisdiction to be established. I understand fully that claimants in such a situation try to avoid facing the issue of the mutual consent and of its proof, but it is more difficult for me to understand that arbitrators might be seduced by pleas which are in full contradiction with the law applicable to the present ICSID arbitration. Everybody knows that unilateral offers by host States to arbitrate investment disputes contained in BITs are unable without further ado to establish jurisdiction to adjudicate a given investor-host State investment dispute. The offers have to be accepted by the protected private investor in the terms formulated in the offer concerned in order for that mutual consent to give birth to a binding arbitration agreement between the host State and the protected private investor. Under the ICSID Convention there is no arbitral jurisdiction by the unilateral consent of one of the parties to the dispute, and private protected investors lack standing to modify in any respect the terms of the offer enounced in a BIT, which is a treaty between two States in written form and governed by international law.\n\n11.\n\nFor Respondent, the non-strict compliance argument of Claimants is simply a contention which tries to make good their failure to accept the conditions and requirements under which the Argentine Republic had consented to international arbitration as manifested in the very text of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, in particular (i) the failure to accept the offer to arbitrate as a whole, by disrupting the *sequential system of settlement* provided for in Article 8; (ii) the failure to enter into *amicable consultations* for a term of six months; (iii) the failure to submit the dispute to the *local courts* for a term of 18 months; alternatively, (iv) the failure to withdraw the *pending domestic courts proceedings* ; and (v) the *invocation of the MFN clause* of the BIT in order to import an alleged alternative means of dispute resolution in terms other than those expressly agreed upon between Argentina and Austria in Article 8 of their BIT (see, for example, Respondent's PHB, para. 35)\n\n12.\n\nFor the determination of whether or not Claimants have complied with the law applicable to the determination of the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal it is indispensable to be acquainted with various components of the applicable law, beginning with the wording of the relevant provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT and of the ICSID Convention. Where there is not an English translation agreed between the Parties of a given provision of the BIT I will quote the text of the authentic Spanish version.\n\n**(b) The relevant provisions of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Argentina/Austria BIT are enounced in Article 8 and Article 1, which in the authentic Spanish text read as quoted below:\n\n\" Art\u00edculo 8\n\nSoluci\u00f3n de controversias relativas a las inversiones\n\n(1) Toda controversia relativa a las inversiones entre un inversor de una de las Partes Contratantes y la otra Parte Contratante sobre las materias regidas por el presente Convenio ser\u00e1, en la medida de lo posible, solucionada por consultas amistosas entre las partes en la controversia.\n\n(2) Si estas consultas no aportaran una soluci\u00f3n en un plazo de seis meses, la controversia podr\u00e1 ser sometida a la jurisdicci\u00f3n administrativa o judicial competente de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se realiz\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n.\n\n(3) La controversia podr\u00e1 ser sometida a un tribunal arbitral en los casos siguientes:\n\na) cuando no haya una decisi\u00f3n sobre el fondo, luego de la expiraci\u00f3n de un plazo de dieciocho meses contados a partir de la notificaci\u00f3n de la iniciaci\u00f3n del procedimiento ante la jurisdicci\u00f3n arriba citada;\n\nb) cuando tal decisi\u00f3n haya sido emitida pero la controversia subsista. En tal caso el recurso al tribunal de arbitraje privar\u00e1 de efectos a las decisiones correspondientes adoptadas con anterioridad en el \u00e1mbito nacional;\n\nc) cuando las dos partes en la controversia lo hayan as\u00ed convenido.\n\n(4) Con este fin, cada Parte Contratante otorga, en las condiciones del presente Convenio, su consentimiento anticipado e irrevocable para que toda controversia sea sometida a este arbitraje. A partir del comienzo de un procedimiento de arbitraje, cada parte en la controversia tomar\u00e1 todas las medidas requeridas para su desistimiento de la instancia judicial en curso.\n\n\u2026\n\n(6) El \u00f3rgano arbitral decidir\u00e1 en base al derecho de la Parte Contratante que sea parte en la controversia - incluidas las normas de derecho internacional privado -, en base a las disposiciones del presente Convenio y a los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos espec\u00edficos concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n seg\u00fan los principios de derecho internacional en la materia.\n\n...\"\n\n14.\n\nFor this arbitrator all the requirements defined in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) of the BIT are, in conformity with the established jurisprudence of the ICJ, jurisdictional preconditions to which the consent to arbitration given in Article 8(4) is subject. Consequently, those preconditions which are interdependent and interlinked with each other constitute limits to the scope of the said consent. But this is not the case for the requirement in the second sentence of Article 8(4) because it is not setting a precondition to the institution of the arbitral proceeding. In my opinion, this particular requirement is a requirement concerning indeed the admissibility of Claimants' Request for Arbitration. Secondly, the definition of investment disputes of Article 8(1) of the BIT as worded in the Argentina-Austria BITs excludes *\"contract claims\"*. And thirdly, the definition of the applicable law in Article 8(6) of the BIT encompasses the law of the host State of the investment, the Argentina/Austria BIT, specific agreements on the investment concerned if any, and the principles of international law on the matter.\n\n15.\n\nConcerning Article 1 of the BIT, the relevant provisions are in the definition of the term \"investment\", as follows:\n\n\"Art\u00edculo 1\n\nDefiniciones\n\nA los fines del presente Convenio:\n\n(1) El t\u00e9rmino \"inversi\u00f3n\" designa todo activo invertido o reinvertido en cualquier sector de la actividad econ\u00f3mica, siempre que la inversi\u00f3n haya sido realizada conforme con las leyes y reglamentaciones de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio ha sido efectuada y, en particular, aunque no exclusivamente:\n\n\u2026\n\nb) los derechos de participaci\u00f3n y otras formas de participaci\u00f3n en las empresas;\n\n\u2026\n\ne) las concesiones de derecho p\u00fablico para la prospecci\u00f3n y la explotaci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales.\n\nEl contenido y el alcance de los derechos correspondientes a las diversas categor\u00edas de los activos, ser\u00e1n determinados por las leyes y reglamentaciones de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio la inversi\u00f3n est\u00e1 situada.\"\n\n16.\n\nClaimants have initially referred with respect to its \"investment\" in the Argentine Province of Salta to Article 1(1)(b) and (e) of the BIT, notwithstanding that the latter provision relates to \"natural resources\" exclusively as pointed out by Respondent. But Respondent admitted that Claimants' shareholding in ENJASA qualified as an \"investment\" under Article 1(b) of the BIT. The last quoted provision of Article 1(1) of the BIT whereby \"*los derechos correspondientes a las diversas categor\u00edas de los activos\"* are determined by the law of the host State are particular relevant in connection with some specific questions at issue between the Parties as, for example, the distinction which has to be born in mind between the \"company's rights\" and \"shareholder' rights\".\n\n17.\n\nFinally, Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT enounces the MFN treatment clause invoked by Claimants as an alternative base of jurisdiction, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Art\u00edculo 3\n\nTratamiento de las inversiones\n\n(1) Cada Parte contratante otorgar\u00e1 a los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante y a sus inversiones, un tratamiento no menos favorable que el otorgado a sus propios inversores y a sus inversiones o a los inversores de terceros Estados y a sus inversiones.\"\n\n**(c) The relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe main relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention in the instant phase of the case are formulated in the Preamble (paragraph 6) and Articles 25(1), 26 (first sentence), 41 and 42. These provisions are worded as quoted below:\n\n\"Preamble\n\n... Recognizing that mutual consent by the parties to submit such disputes [investment disputes] to conciliation or to arbitration through such facilities [Centre facilities] constitutes a binding agreement which requires in particular that due consideration be given to any recommendation of conciliators, and that any arbitral award be complied with;.\n\nArticle 25 (1)\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n\u2026\n\nArticle 26\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy...\n\nArticle 41\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\nArticle 42\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n(2) The Tribunal may not bring in a finding of *non liquet* on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law.\n\n(3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2). shall not prejudice the power of the Tribunal to decide a dispute *ex aequo et bono* if the parties so agree.\"\n\n19.\n\nThe above quoted provisions confirm in the first place that the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute is the base of the binding agreement to arbitrate investments disputes in the ICSID arbitration system. No ICSID arbitration may go on the mere basis of the unilateral consent of a one of the parties only. Both parties to the dispute must consent mutually. Secondly, those provisions confirm likewise (i) that only when *the parties* in the plural have given their consent, namely when a mutual consent to arbitrate the disputes is there, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally and (ii) that the consent of the parties to arbitrate the dispute under the ICSID Convention excludes the recourse to any other remedy, unless otherwise stated. There is not such a statement in the instant case. On the contrary there is an explicit reaffirmation of the said general rule in the second sentence of Article 8(4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Thirdly there is not any agreement of the parties empowering the Tribunal to decide the dispute *ex aequo et bono* either. The Tribunal must therefore decide the dispute in accordance with the rules of law defined in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(6) of the Argentina/Austria BIT which refer respectively, *inter alia,* to the \"rules of international law as may be applicable\" and to the \"principles of international law\" on the matter.\n\n**(d) The rules of public international law governing the interpretation and application of treaties**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe rules of customary international law on the interpretation and application of treaties have been codified by the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and Argentina and Austria are parties to that Convention. As to \"interpretation\" of the BIT both Parties agree that the rules set out in Articles 31, 32 and 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) apply, in particular the \"General rule of interpretation\" of Article 31 of the Convention which, as stated by the International Law Commission (ILC) in its commentary, is a single integrated rule. So far so good, but these rules of the VCLT are not the only ones that needed to be born in mind in the circumstances of the present case. There are others particularly on the application of treaties which are likewise relevant in the case.\n\n21.\n\nThe essence of the system of interpretation of treaties set out in Articles 31 to 33 of the VCLT has recently been recalled - in connection also with a given *ratione voluntatis* objection to jurisdiction - by the Award of 30 April 2015 in the case *Ping an Life Insurance Company of China, Limited et al v. Kingdom of Belgium,* ICSID Case N\u00b0 ARB/12/29 (AL RA 250) in the following terms:\n\n\"164.... The general principle is that a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context (including the preamble and annexes) and in the light of its object and purpose (Vienna Convention, Article 31(1), (2)) and also the circumstances of its conclusion (Article 32).\n\n165. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention reflects the primacy of the text as the basis for the interpretation of a treaty, while also giving a role to extrinsic evidence of the circumstances of its conclusion and to the objects and purposes of a treaty as a means of interpretation. It is based on the view that the text is presumed to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties, and that in consequence the starting point of interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text by reference to the intention of the drafters: International Law Commission, Yb ILC, 1966, vol II, pp 218, 220.\n\n166. The ordinary meaning approach has been adopted in many investor-State arbitrations to confirm that the presumed intentions of the parties should not be used to override the explicit language of a BIT *(**Fraport v. Philippines* at [340]) or to override the agreed-upon framework *(Daimler Financial Services v. Argentina* at [164]), or be used as an independent basis of interpretation *(**Wintershall v. Argentina* at [88]).\"\n\n22.\n\nThe principles and considerations quoted above apply *mutatis mutandis* to the interpretation of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Thus, Article 8 *shall* be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the *ordinary meaning* to be given to the terms of the Article in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT (Article 31(1) of the VCLT), except of course for terms like \"investment\" to which a *special meaning* for the purpose of the BIT has been given by Argentina and Austria in Article 1 of the BIT, as provided for in Article 31(4) of the VCLT. As to the *context* the only elements of the definition in Article 31(2) of the VCLT present in the instant case are the text of the BIT itself, its preamble included. The Parties to the case did not provide the Tribunal either with annexes to the BIT or with any agreement and/or instrument of the kind listed by the VCLT in its definition of context. Concerning the interpretative elements that the interpreter shall take into account together with the context (Article 31(3) of the VCLT) the only one present in the instant case is the *relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between Argentina and Austria,* because the Parties to the case are not invoking any subsequent agreement or practice on the interpretation and/or the application of the BIT.\n\n23.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants did not invoke directly a \"floating or presume intention\" of the Contracting Parties as an independent basis for the interpretation of Article 8 Argentine-Austria BIT overriding the primacy of the text and the ordinary meaning of its terms as provided for in of Article 31 of the VCLT. They tried however to achieve a somewhat similar result by other means like, for instance, their *\"non-strict compliance argument\"*, a notion alien to the VCLT. In any case, for this arbitrator the text of Article 8 of the BIT is the primary element for ascertaining the common intention of Argentina and Austria when they chose to conclude a BIT for the protection and promotion of investments of their respective nationals and the settlement of eventual investment disputes related thereto with the host State of the investment. There is nothing in the wording of Article 8 which could be considered to be in a good faith interpretation inconsistent with the object and purpose of the BIT as defined in its Preamble. There is not therefore room for less than compliance with the sequential system of settlement and the individual conditions and requirements fixed by Argentina and Austria in the disputesettlement-system adopted by the two States for Article 8(1) to (4) of the BIT.\n\n24.\n\nAs it has been concluded by the best doctrine, an interpreter is supposed to read the BIT and not to read into the BIT, to paraphrase the heading of an article published in 2006 by Weiniger on the topic of jurisdiction challenges in BIT arbitration, and the purpose of interpretation as a legal operation is to discover rather than to create meaning as stated by Koskenniemi in an article published in 1989 on the structure of international legal argument. I cannot therefore accept arguments construed for the case on the basis essentially of an alleged \"non-strict compliance\" with Article 8 of the BIT or the like. This kind of reasoning gives rise to serious questions concerning *pacta sunt servanda* and other systemic principles of the international legal order which cannot be put aside lightly, as underlined by a number of decisions and awards of ICSID arbitration tribunals, such as the following passage of the Award of 22 August 2012 in the *Daimler v. Argentina* case:\n\n\"... as international treaties, BITs constitute an exercise of sovereignty by which States strike a delicate balance among their various internal policy considerations. For this reason, the Tribunal must take care not to allow any presuppositions concerning the types of international law mechanisms (including dispute resolution clauses) that may best protect and promote investment to carry it beyond the bounds of the framework agreed upon by the contracting state parties. It is for States to decide how best to protect and promote investment. The texts of the treaties they conclude are the definitive guide as to how they have chosen to do so\" (para. 164) (AL RA 96).\n\n25.\n\nSo far as the supplementary means of interpretation of Article 32 of the VCLT are concerned, the *circumstances of conclusion* of the BIT are also relevant in the instant case in the sense that they proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Claimants are *\"thirds\"* with regard to the BIT, as confirmed by the first paragraph of the Preamble of the BIT, as well as by the fact that Claimants lack standing in public international law to conclude treaties. Being \"thirds\" with respect to the Argentina-Austria BIT, Claimants have no standing to circumvent, to modify or to alter the terms and scope of Argentina's consent to international arbitration, as defined and delimited in the \"standing offer to arbitrate\" in Article 8(4) of Argentina-Austria BIT. And the same apply to arbitrators.\n\n26.\n\nUnder the Argentina/Austria BIT, Claimants hold secondary-treaty-rights only and in the exercise of those held secondary rights they have to act in accordance with the BIT, by complying with the conditions and requirements for their exercise as provided for in the BIT or established in conformity with the BIT (see Article 36(2) of the VCLT (CL-001)). This has been recalled by the *Wintershall* tribunal as follows:\n\n\"It is a general principle of the law of treaties that a third beneficiary of a right under it must comply with the conditions for the exercise of the right provided for in the treaty or established in conformity with the treaty. On the analogy of Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (the \"Vienna Convention\") the \u2018secondary right-holder' under a bilateral treaty (the investor) who is conferred certain rights, being in no different position from \"the third State\" (mentioned in Article 36) - must comply with the conditions stipulated for the exercise of the rights provided for in the treaty concerned, which in the instant case is the \u2018basic' treaty\" (Award of 8 December 2008, para. 114) (AL RA 38).\n\n**(e) The question of the characterization of the requirements in Article 8(1) to (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT as preconditions to international arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAs indicated at the beginning of the present Opinion, the Parties disagree as to the legal characterization of the requirements of international arbitration of the system of settlement of investment disputes of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. On the one hand, Respondent considers that those requirements are preconditions jurisdictional in nature, which explains that its alleged failure of compliance by Claimants prompted the filing of the present Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction. On the other hand, Claimants consider that those requirements are of a procedural character and its eventual non-compliance does not pertain to the realm of \"jurisdiction\" but to the \"admissibility\" of a claim, while affirming nonetheless that they have complied with the said requirements and, consequently, they were entitled to refer the instant dispute to arbitration under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n28.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the above disagreement (*jurisdictional requirements v. procedural or admissibility requirements)* none of the Parties appear to question that to reach arbitration in Article 8(3) of the BIT the investor has to comply with the preconditions in Article 8(1), (2) and (3), namely to engage in amicable consultations with the host State for six months and to submit the dispute to the competent administrative of judicial jurisdiction of the host State for at least eighteen months. It is indeed crystal clear in the light of the ordinary meaning of the terms used in those paragraphs of Article 8 that if the investor wishes (\"may\") to reach the third step (international arbitration) it must comply with the first (amicable consultations) and second (local administrative or judicial jurisdiction) steps. Furthermore, it is not questionable in the light of the wording, sequence and interrelation of these steps of the dispute resolution system of Article 8 of the BIT that they are indeed premised on the binding character of each of said steps in order for the investor be in the position to resort to ICSID or UNCITRAL international arbitration. It follows therefore that the requirements of Article 8(1), (2) and (3) and its sequence are *preconditions* to international arbitration and that, whatever its legal characterization, binding in character for protected investors.\n\n29.\n\nIt should also be recalled that this characterization issue poses an interpretative question of public international law and that the rules on interpretation of treaties codified by the VCLT listed also \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" as one of the interpretative elements to be taken into account by the interpreter together with the context (Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT) (CL-001). It is certainly true that States parties to a given BIT are free to formulate the requirements commented as preconditions delimiting the scope of consent given in advance of \"an offer to arbitrate\" (jurisdiction) or as a condition relating to the application or request for arbitration (admissibility) or as a procedural requirement. However, the latter are much less frequent because in most cases the arbitration forum designated by the BITs has its own arbitration rules like ICSID and *ad hoc* tribunals have at their disposal the UNCITRAL Rules. Furthermore, in investment arbitration the procedural rules to be applied by the arbitral tribunals are supposed to be agreed upon not by the States parties to the applicable BIT, as is the case of jurisdictional or admissibility preconditions, but by the investor and the host State (see, for example, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention). And, in any case even the requirements in BITs characterised as \"procedural\" are binding for the investors as recalled, for example, by *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal (Decision on Jurisdiction of 15 December 2010, para. 142) (AL RA 204).\n\n30.\n\nWhat is more frequent is that in dispute resolution systems of BITs the Contracting States formulate the requirements under consideration as in the present case, namely in term of preconditions to international arbitration, the reason for that being the paramount importance for the States to circumscribe with some degree of precision the scope of the \"standing arbitration offers\" in BITs willingly given by them in advance without knowing either the individual protected private investors who will accept the offers nor the particular factual circumstances of a future investment dispute with them. The BIT system entails certainly exceptional assurances for foreign protected investors but it was not intended to derogate the systemic principle of the State's consent to international jurisdiction of public international law and should not be understood and applied by ICSID arbitral tribunals otherwise.\n\n31.\n\nFor example, as stated by the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* Tribunal with reference to the local jurisdiction precondition in BITs:\n\n\"137. The Tribunal disagrees with the position expressed by some tribunals, and echoed by the Claimants, which would disregard the domestic litigation requirement [as] \u2018nonsensical', since, allegedly, the domestic court would not be in a position to render a decision within the time-limit prescribed by the applicable treaty. The Tribunal also considers that a finding that domestic litigation would be \u2018futile' must be approached with care and circumspection. Except where this conclusion is justified in the factual circumstances of the particular case, the domestic litigation requirement may not be ignored or dispensed with as futile in view of its paramount importance for the host State. Its purpose is to offer the State an opportunity to redress alleged violations of the investor's rights under the relevant treaty before the latter may pursue claims in international arbitration.\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013) (CL-134).\n\n32.\n\nI share the above statement of the *Philip Morris* tribunal as well as its general conclusion that whether the domestic litigation requirement (like the amicable consultations requirement) relate to jurisdiction or, rather, to admissibility or procedure depends on the interpretation of the dispute resolution article of the BIT, based on the interpretation rules of the VCLT *(Ibid,* para. 138). It is indeed on such a basis that this arbitrator considers that the requirements in Article 8(1) to (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT relate to jurisdiction and not to admissibility or procedure.\n\n**(f) The jurisprudence of the ICJ on the rule of State's consent to international jurisdictions and on preconditions in treaty dispute resolution clauses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe established jurisprudence *(jurisprudence constante)* of the ICJ on the characterization of preconditions in a compromissory clause of a given treaty as relating to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application - as declared for example by the Court in the *Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New application 2002)* (see above paragraph 6 of this Opinion) - is for me determinative of that question in public international law. And that is so not only due to the authority of the ICJ but also because, as stated in Article 38(1) of its Statute, the function of the Court is \"to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it\". This explains the frequent invocation by parties to arbitration proceeding of investment disputes the relevant jurisprudence of the ICJ, as well as the references to it in decisions and awards of ICSID arbitration tribunals. The present case is not an exception in that respect. Respondent has invoked in several contexts law statements of the ICJ and sometimes also Claimants (for example, the *ELSI* case), but the majority supporting the present Decision has been, in my opinion, particularly wrong and shy on the relevant jurisprudence of the Court for issues raised in the present phase of the case, notwithstanding that the Arbitral Tribunal has to decide in accordance, *inter alia,* with principles and rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n34.\n\nI am of a different opinion. I believe that several core issues at the present phase of the case have already received in the said jurisprudence of the ICJ the correct international law answers, particularly in connection with the forms of manifestation of *State's consent* admitted and on the question of the *characterization of preconditions* in treaty dispute resolution clauses, as those formulated in Article 8(1), (2) to (3) of the Argentina/Austria BIT. For example, it is obvious that the overall conclusions in paragraphs 336 and 337 of the present majority Decision are untenable propositions in the face of the established jurisprudence of the ICJ on the systemic role of a State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals which provides that such a consent must be voluntary, certain, clear and unequivocal whatever the form of its manifestation or the title or base of jurisdiction invoked and/or the nature and values of the substantive legal obligations at issue. It is obvious that Claimants have not proven that Respondent gave in the said BIT, and neither did Austria, a voluntary, certain, clear and unequivocal consent for free access to international arbitration of protected investors nationals of the other country, nor have voluntarily, certainly, clearly and unequivocally consented to international arbitration without the investors' prior compliance with the conditions set forth in the BIT or dispensed that Claimants alleged consent may be of a different meaning or scope than Respondent's consent in the offer to arbitrate defined in the BIT *au lieu* of the \"meeting of consents\" commanded by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the character of a material norm and the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction are two different things (see *Case Concerning East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)*, *ICJ Reports 1995*, p. 102, para. 29) (CL-107 / AL RA 200) and, consequently, they should not be confused with each other through references, for example, to the object and purpose of the BIT concerned or other parties' frequent contentions in ICSID arbitrations aimed at avoiding compliance with the preconditions and requirements of BITs.\n\n35.\n\nThe following collection of some samples of relevant ICJ statements, there are many others, records its established jurisprudence in the matter under consideration:\n\n\"... The Court could not act in that way in the present case. It has simply to ascertain whether by rendering the disputed Award the Tribunal acted in manifest breach of the competence conferred on it by the Arbitration Agreement, either by deciding in excess of, or by failing to exercise, its jurisdiction.\n\nSuch manifest breach might result from, for example, the failure of the Tribunal properly to apply the relevant rules of interpretation to the provisions of the Arbitration Agreement which govern its competence. An arbitration agreement (*compromis d'arbitrage)* is an agreement between States which must be interpreted in accordance with the general rules of international law governing the interpretation of treaties.\" (*Case* *concerning Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989, ICJ Reports 1991,* p. 69, paras.47-48);\n\n\"The Court recalls its jurisprudence, as well as that of its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, regarding the forms which the parties' expression of their consent to its jurisdiction may take. According to that jurisprudence, \u2018neither the Statute nor the Rules require that this consent should be expressed in any particular form' and \u2018there is nothing to prevent the acceptance of jurisdiction. from being effected by two separate and successive acts, instead of jointly and beforehand by a special agreement'. The attitude of the respondent State must, however, be capable of being regarded as \u2018an unequivocal indication' of the desire of that State to accept the Court's jurisdiction in a \u2018voluntary and indisputable manner'.\" (*Case Concerning Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application 2002), (DR of Congo v. Rwanda), ICJ Reports 2006,* p. 18, para. 21) (AL RA 39).\n\n\"... the Court has jurisdiction in respect of States only to the extent that they have consented thereto.When a compromissory clause in a treaty provides for the Court's jurisdiction, that jurisdiction exists only in respect to the parties to the treaty who are bound by the clause and within the limits set out therein\" *(Ibid.,* p. 32, para. 65)\n\n\"... Article 29 of this Convention [on Discrimination against Women] gives the Court jurisdiction in respect of any dispute between States parties concerning its interpretation or application, on condition that: it has not been possible to settle the dispute by negotiation; that, following the failure of negotiations, the dispute has, at the request of one such State, been submitted to arbitration; and that, if the parties have been unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, a period of six months has elapsed from the date of the request for arbitration.\n\n\"In the view of the Court, it is apparent from the language of Article 29 of the Convention that these conditions are cumulative. The Court must therefore consider whether the preconditions on its seisin set out in the said Article 29 have been satisfied in this case\"  \n*(Ibid.,* p. 39, para. 87)\n\n\"When that consent [of the parties] is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon. The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application. It follows that in the present case the conditions for seisin of the Court set out in Article 29 of the Convention on Discrimination against Women must be examined in the context of the issue of the Court's jurisdiction. This conclusion applies *mutatis mutandis* to all of the other compromissory clauses invoked by the DRC\" *(Ibid.,* pp. 39-40, para. 88)\n\n\"The Court further notes that, even if the DRC had demonstrated the existence of a question or dispute falling within the scope of Article 75 of the WHO Constitution, it has in any event not proved that the other preconditions for seisin of the Court established by that provision have been satisfied, namely that it attempted to settle the question or dispute by negotiation with Rwanda or that the World Health Assembly had been unable to settle it\" (*Ibid.,* p. 43, para. 100)\n\n\"... the Court is called upon to determine whether a State must resort to certain procedures before seising the Court. In this context it notes that the terms \u2018condition', \u2018precondition', \u2018prior condition', \u2018condition precedent' are sometimes used as synonyms and sometimes as different from each other. There is in essence no difference between those expressions save for the fact that, when unqualified, the term \u2018condition' may encompass, in addition to prior conditions, other conditions to be fulfilled concurrently with or subsequent to an event. To the extent that the procedural requirements of [a dispute settlement clause] may be conditions, they must be conditions precedent to the seisin of the court even when the term is not qualified by a temporal element\" (*Case concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation), ICJ Reports 2011 (I),* p. 124, para. 130).\n\n\"The consent allowing for the Court to assume jurisdiction must be certain. That is so, no more and no less, for jurisdiction based on *forum prorogatum.* As the Court has recently explained whatever the basis of consent, the attitude of the respondent State must \"be capable of being regarded as \u2018an unequivocal indication' of the desire of that State to accept the Court's jurisdiction in a \u2018voluntary and indisputable' manner\". For the Court to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of *forum prorogatum,* the element of consent must be either explicit or clearly to be deduced from the relevant conduct of a State\" (*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), ICJ Reports 2008,* p. 204, para. 62) (AL RA 35).\n\n\"... the Court considers that the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things. Whatever the nature of the obligations invoked, the Court could not rule on the lawfulness of the conduct of a State when its judgment would imply an evaluation of the lawfulness of the conduct of another State which is not a party to the case. Where this is so, the Court cannot act, even if the right in question is a right *erga omnes*\" *(**Case Concerning East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), ICJ Reports 1995,* p. 102, para. 29) (CL-107 / AL RA 200).\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Court in this case is based solely on Article IX of the [Genocide] Convention. [the Court] has no power to rule on alleged breaches of other obligations under international law, not amounting to genocide, particularly those protecting human rights in armed conflict. That is so even if the alleged breaches are of obligations under peremptory norms, or of obligations which protect essential humanitarian values, and which may be owed *erga omnes*\" (*Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), ICJ Reports 2007,* p. 104, para. 147).\n\n36.\n\nThe above statements of the ICJ, confirmed by several others, qualify the State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts or tribunals rule, as a *fundamental principle* of the international legal order (see, for example, *ICJ Reports 1995,* p. 101, para. 26) (CL-107 / AL RA 200). It follows that the present ICSID Arbitral Tribunal can only exercise jurisdiction over the Argentine Republic with its consent. That consent must be proved to be voluntary, certain and unequivocal and be manifested, as it has been so done in the *\"standing offer to arbitrate\"* made to the investors of the other Contracting State in Article 8(4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. However, the consent embodied in that offer of Argentina, as well as of Austria, exists only within the parameters enounced in the text of Article 8 of the BIT which delimits with considerable precision the scope of the consent given by each of these States in their offer. There is no consent of Argentina or of Austria beyond that scope or otherwise.\n\n37.\n\nThese considerations relate however to a fundamental principle of the applicable international law which is dwarfed in Claimants' plea, as well as diminished and misunderstood in the reasoning of the present majority Decision.\n\n**(g) The scope of the \"consent\" given in advance by the Contracting States' \"standing arbitration offer\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAs clearly established in the BIT, the respective consents to ICSID arbitration given in advance by Argentina and Austria in the \"standing arbitration offer\" of Article 8 of the BIT is not all-embracing. Its scope is limited by the definitions in Article 1 of the BIT and the conditions in paragraphs (1) to (3) of Article 8 that must be complied with step by step by protected investors so as to be in the position of reaching the final step of international arbitration. In effect, in the first place, the provision in Article 8(1) confines the scope of application of the whole Article 8 to \"treaty claims investor-host State disputes\". Secondly, the consent manifested in the \"standing arbitration offer\" of Article 8(4) (first sentence) is subject to successive compliance with each of the conditions set out in the preceding Article 8(1) to (3) of the BIT which are, because of its sequential order and drafting, *preconditions* to international arbitration.\n\n39.\n\nThus, it follows that Respondent's advanced consent in the \"standing arbitration-offer\" of Article 8(4) of the BIT is neither a \"mutual consent\" of the parties to the dispute allowing protected investors direct access to international arbitration from the entry into force of the BIT nor a unilateral \"arbitration consent offer\" which could be considered as a perfected consent without the protected investor concerned accepted that offer following compliance with all the preconditions of Article 8(1) to (3) in its sequential order. The time-limits being part and parcel of the preconditions concerned must also be observed by the protected investor in order for \"Argentina arbitration consent offer\" made in the BIT to become a \"mutual consent\" of Respondent and Claimants giving birth as such to a binding \"arbitration agreement\" *(convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje)* between the parties to the investment dispute, as referred to in the Preamble (paragraph 6) and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n40.\n\nFor this arbitrator the ordinary meaning of the words *\"sobre las materias regidas por el presente Convenio\"* in Article 8(1) is certainly broad when contrasted with the scope of the dispute resolution clause of Article 9 of the BIT as underlined by Claimants in line with some ICSID arbitral tribunals. This is quite normal because the subject-matter of these Articles differs from each other. But with respect to investment disputes resolutions clauses in BITs, Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT is not particularly broad because, contrary to other BITs (for example, the corresponding provision in the Switzerland/Uruguay BIT applied in the *Philip Morris case*), the words quoted from the Argentina-Austria BIT exclude \"contract claims disputes. It follows that it is not sufficient under the Argentina-Austria BIT that the dispute at issue be merely an investment dispute without further ado. It must be a \"treaty claims investment dispute\".\n\n41.\n\nFurthermore, the sentence \"Con este fin, cada Parte Contratante otorga en las condiciones del presente Convenio, su consentimiento anticipado e irrevocable\" (emphasis added) in Article 8(4) of the BIT settles the issue of the mandatory jurisdictional nature and sequential character of the preconditions in Article 8(1) to and (3) of the BIT, which are binding for the protected investors as confirmed further by the accompanying temporal element of six month in the case of \"amicable consultations precondition\" and of the eighteen months in the case of \"local jurisdictions precondition\".\n\n42.\n\nThese conclusions are based on the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the text of Article 8(1) to (4) of the BIT in its respective context as provided for in Article 31 of the VCLT and the sequence of the successive steps of the settlement dispute resolution system of Article 8 of the BIT, as confirmed also by case-law.\n\n**(h) The formation of a binding \"arbitration agreement\" between the host State and the protected investor national of the other Contracting State**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn international law \"arbitration\" is a means of settlement of disputes in which the consent of the parties thereto plays a paramount role. The same applies to international arbitral procedures applicable nowadays to investment disputes between the host State of the investment and a protected private investor national of the other Contracting State of the BIT. As explained in the Report of the Executive Directors on the 1965 ICSID Convention the consent of the parties to the dispute to submit themselves to ICSID arbitration is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre. It follows that, under the current BIT system, the execution of a binding \"agreement to arbitrate\" a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment cannot be achieved but by the matching of the consent of the host State as manifested in the offer of the applicable BIT and the consent given by the protected investor when accepting that offer in writing and/or by filing a request for arbitration with the Centre. As explained above, the BITs are bilateral treaties which provide \"rights\" for potential third protected investors, but the latter are not obliged at all by these BITs to accept the \"standing arbitration offers\" made by the Contracting States of the BIT in question, but they cannot modify or alter the meaning or scope of the standing offer of the BIT.\n\n44.\n\nThe present case is a BIT case and, therefore, the main jurisdictional issue posed by the formation of the needed \"arbitration agreement\" *of the parties to the dispute* to submit it to international arbitration consists in ascertaining whether Argentina's consent to arbitrate as given in advance to protected Austrian investors in the offer made in Article 8 of the Argentina/Austria BIT and CAI and CASAG' consent as given when accepting that Respondent's arbitration offer match each other, because only if the consents of both parties to the dispute match, a \"mutual consent\" comes into existence and, consequently, the agreement or undertaking to arbitrate of the Parties to the present dispute can be considered as having been executed. The need of such arbitration agreement or undertaking between the parties to the dispute remains today, as in the past, unquestionable under the BIT system, as well as under contemporary public international law as explained, for example, by *Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria* Decision on Jurisdiction in the following passage:\n\n\"Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away the basic prerequisite for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate. It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous. In the framework of a BIT the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to arbitration that a state gives in advance in respect of investment disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an investor if the latter so desires.\" (para. 98 of the Decision) (AL RA 36).\n\n45.\n\nAt the doctrinal level, Dolzer and Schreuer have explained referring to consent through a BIT that: \"The basic mechanism is the same as in the case of national legislation... the arbitration agreement is perfected through the acceptance of that offer by an eligible investor\" (*Principles of International Investment Law,* Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 242) (AL RA 37). In the same vein, Zachary Douglas, *International Law of Investments Claims,* Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 74 and seq. and 360 (AL RA 23).\n\n46.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute some historical facts such as: (i) that in Salta (Argentina) a contract claims dispute at the domestic level between the Province of SALTA and ENJASA on the subject-matter of the revocation of a license of ENJASA by ENREJA (the *ente regulador* in the Province) was going on since 2013; and (ii) that Respondent had been informed by CAI's letter of 30 April 2014, joined later by CASAG (letter of 7 August 2014), that Claimants considered that a second legal dispute had arisen, this time between CAI and CASAG and the Argentine Republic, under the Argentina-Austria BIT, \"as a result of the revocation of the license of ENJASA\". The filing of Claimants' Request for Arbitration on 4 December 2014 formalized procedurally this second ICSID treaty claims dispute. Only the second legal investment dispute is before the present Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n47.\n\nWhat is in dispute between the Parties is whether - notwithstanding the declaration by Claimants of their acceptance of Respondent's offer to arbitrate in CAI's letter of 30 April 2013 and the filing by CAI and CASAG of the Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014 - Claimants' conduct reveals a consent to arbitrate the present dispute which actually matches Respondent's consent to arbitrate as defined in the offer of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT or, on the contrary, reveals a Claimants' consent which differs or falls out of the scope of Respondent's consent as given in the offer of the said BIT. In the first of these two hypotheses the Second Preliminary Objection of Respondent has to be rejected, but in the second one the Second Preliminary Objection must be upheld because the lack of mutual consent of the Parties to the dispute to submit it to ICSID arbitration entails the absence of a binding agreement between the Parties to arbitrate the dispute.\n\n48.\n\nThe easy way to be followed for the execution of an \"arbitration agreement\" between the parties to the dispute under the prevailing practice of the BIT system has facilitated enormously the exercise by protected investors of the right provided for them in the corresponding BIT to institute international arbitration proceedings against host States, but in contrast the system reserves exclusively to the host States the definition of the \"standing arbitration offers\" of BITs. There are not examples of BITs leaving to individual protected investors (or to all together) nationals of any one of the two Contracting States of the BIT the possibility of modifying or altering in any respect the kind and scope of the host State's \"standing arbitration offer\" as defined in the corresponding BIT, but I regret to say that this is what actually does the present majority Decision and explains this Dissenting Opinion of mine.\n\n49.\n\nFor me, the \"standing arbitration offer\" of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT with all its preconditions, terms and requirements cannot be, under the applicable international law, questioned, altered or modified by Claimants as apparently admitted by my co-arbitrators. CAI and CASAG are \"third persons\" with respect to the BIT and as such they hold only secondary rights under the BIT, in addition to being private legal persons lacking standing in international law to conclude, amend or to modify the BIT or the offer to investors made therein. As stated in the following passage of the Award on Jurisdiction of the *ICS Inspection and Control Service v. Argentina* Tribunal:\n\n\"At the time of commencing dispute resolution under the treaty, the investor can only accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms. The investor regardless of the particular circumstances affecting the investor or its belief in the utility or fairness of the conditions attached to the offer of the host State, must nonetheless contemporaneously consent to the application of the terms and conditions of the offer made by the host State, or else no agreement to arbitrate may be formed. As opposed to a dispute resolution provision in a concession contract between an investor and a host State where subsequent events or circumstances arising may be taken into account to determine the effect to be given to earlier negotiated terms, the investment treaty presents a \"take it or leave it\" situation at the time the dispute and the investor's circumstances are already known. This point is equally poignant in the context of jurisdiction grounded on an MFN clause..(Award of 10 February 2012, para. 272) (AL RA 40).\n\n50.\n\nAfter decades of application of the ICSID Convention and the BIT system it could appear redundant to recall the obvious. But the conclusions in paragraphs 336 and 337 of the present majority Decision show that it is not yet the case for my co-arbitrators. To declare the wild conclusion that the Arbitral Tribunal \"*comes to the conclusion that Respondent has validly consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the present arbitration under Article* 8 *of the BIT at the time the BIT entered into force...This consent thus has existed since the entry into force of the BIT. Claimants, in turn, have consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the present arbitration when they initiated the present claim against Respondent*\" proves that the question of formation of the \"arbitration agreement\" *(acuerdo de arbtraje)* between the Parties to \"the present treaty claims investment dispute\", namely between CAI and CASAG (Claimants) and the Argentine Republic (Respondent), as required by the ICSID Convention, is not yet clear in all minds. This, however, is not all because the said conclusion is supplemented by a second one as mistaken as the first, namely: *\"...the pre-arbitral requirements equally laid down in Article 8 of the BIT... do not constitute conditions precedent to Respondent\u2019s consent, which would need to be fulfilled at the time of initiating ICSID arbitration. They merely concern criteria for the validity of the seisin of the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that it suffices that these criteria are fulfilled at the time a decision on jurisdiction is taken\".*\n\n51.\n\nWith those two conclusions my co-arbitrators dynamite the BIT system as it has been functioning until the present. Moreover, this appears to have been indeed the intent, namely to create a new case-law and doctrine or, for the matter, to give birth to a system altogether different from the present BIT system. In any case, this majority Decision unbalances the conditions governing the BIT system since its beginnings. It is, therefore, in my opinion, a Decision that goes against the legal security which should preside over the relations between host States and protected investors under the ICSID Conventions and the BIT system. All this is done by the majority Decision without invoking any instrument, rules and principle of public international law applicable to this phase of the case, not even the rules on the interpretation and application of treaties of the VCLT. This explain why I begin this Dissenting Opinion recalling the instruments, rules and principles, some systemic in nature, of public international law applicable to the present phase of the case.\n\n52.\n\nIn the second part of this Opinion I will consider in detail the various issues of law and fact that, in my opinion, have to be taken into account to make arbitral determinations relating to the Second Preliminary Objection of Respondent. However, without prejudice of those determinations, I will advance here a few general considerations of law and fact thereon to be born in mind. In the first place, that as it is obvious, Article 8 (4) is but one of the provisions of the Article on settlement of investment dispute system of the BIT, and that dispute settlement provisions contain several other provisions setting out preconditions and/or requirements which according to the interpretation rules of the VCLT must be taken into account as \"context\" in the interpretation Article 8(4). Secondly, Claimants are \"thirds\" *vis-a-vis* the BIT concluded between Argentina and Austria where the two States included the \"standing consent offer\" of Article 8 as a right (not an obligation) for protected private investors accepting that offer not further or otherwise. Thirdly, the present \"international arbitration\" as such is not an arbitration under domestic legislation, it was instituted by Claimants as an arbitration under an international instrument, the ICSID Convention, and under this Convention as generally in public international law there is no arbitration without an \"arbitration agreement\" executed between the parties to the dispute, as enounced the Preamble and Article 25 of ICSID Convention.\n\n53.\n\nAs to the facts, I will recall here first that there was not an \"arbitration agreement\" between Claimants and Respondent when the BIT entered into force in the relation between Argentina and Austria on 1 January 1995; and, secondly, that Claimants were not investors in the Province of Salta (Argentina) concerning the subject-matter of the present dispute before the year 2000 when they acquired 5% of L&E's shares. How therefore the majority concludes that the Respondent *\"has validly consented to the present arbitration under Article 8 of the BIT\"* with Claimants on 1 January 1995, date of entry into force of the BIT in the relations between Argentina and Austria? Where is the needed second consent of the Preamble and Article 25(1) of ICSID, namely Claimants' consent on that date? The explanation for this *totum revolutum,* there are many others, is not easy to find, unless the majority is trying here to suggest, *inter alia,* that the ICSID Convention has already been revised in the sense that ICSID arbitration could go on with the sole consent of the host State party to dispute. It would be a nonsensical proposition in public international law. Last but not least, the majority Decision all along, not only in its conclusions, reverses the logical order to be followed when considering the Second Preliminary Objection of Respondent according to which the is no jurisdiction because Claimants did not comply with the \"standing arbitration offer\" of the BIT. Respondent has never questioned its own consent *as determined* in writing in Article 8 of the BIT. What is at issue is whether or not that consent has been matched by Claimants' alleged consent, not the Respondent's consent.\n\n54.\n\nThe determination of jurisdiction and competence by an ICSID arbitral tribunal as the present one is, like in the case of any international court of tribunal, an *objective question* which must be decided by the tribunal concerned as judge of its own competence (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention) in accordance with the elements of law and fact concurring in the particular case. In the present phase of the case the elements of law are provided in the first place by Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT with its conditions and requirements and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, interpreted and applied in accordance with the corresponding rules of the VCLT and other principles and rules of public international referred in this Opinion. As to the elements of fact by the proofs and admissions that reveal that Claimants have not complied either with any of those conditions and requirements or with the sequential system of means of settlement enounced in Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n55.\n\nIn such a situation, trying as the majority does in paragraph 337 of the present Decision to excuse one of the Parties, Claimants, for its noncompliance with the applicable law by references to *\"* overly formalistic\" approaches (echoing Claimants' non-strict application fallacy) and to invoke \"a fair administration of international justice\" to condone not compliance with the applicable law by Claimants in detriment of Respondent's rights is an abuse of language unacceptable for this arbitrator. The issue is not, and it has never been, \"when\" Claimants may have instituted their case with the Centre but that whenever such moment maybe they have prior to comply with the preconditions of Article 8 and its sequential order.\n\n56.\n\nIn any case, the present ICSID arbitration is an arbitration *under the applicable law* as defined in Article 8(6) of the BIT and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and not in any respect an *ex aequo et bono arbitration* pursuant to a given agreement between the Parties to the dispute as provided in Article 42(3) of the ICSID Convention. None of the Parties has informed the Arbitral Tribunal of the existence of such an agreement or has claimed that the Tribunal proceeds as if such agreement would exist between the Parties. Once more the present majority Decision is confusing apples with oranges by a topical *totum revolutum* approach. What this Tribunal must do in the present proceedings is to be guided and enforce the law applicable to the present phase of the case in accordance with the principle of a \"proper administration of (arbitral) justice\" so as to avoid miscarriages or unwarranted *denials of justice.*\n\n**B. The Evaluation of Parties' Arguments and Established Facts in the Light of the Applicable Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nGenerally, it may be said that Respondent considers that the Argentine Republic's consent embodied in the \"standing arbitration offer\" addressed to protected investor of the other Contracting State of Article 8(4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT is subject to the conditions, terms and requirements expressly stated in the relevant paragraphs (1) to (4) of Article 8 and that the only way for that consent to be perfected, namely to become a \"mutual consent\" to arbitrate the present dispute, is that Claimants accept the offer as formulated in the BIT by complying with all its conditions, terms and requirements as the case may be.\n\n58.\n\nThe general position of Claimants is based upon the twofold affirmation already referred above *,* namely (i) that the requirements of Article 8 do not constitute preconditions to Respondent's consent to international arbitration but procedural conditions relating to admissibility of Claimants' claims and (ii) that although in principle Claimants have to comply with those procedural requirements in order for the Arbitral Tribunal to be able to decide the merits of the case, they do not need to be fully applied or followed by them for the existence of jurisdiction (the so-called \"non-strict compliance argument\" of Claimants).\n\n59.\n\nIn paragraphs 271 to 282 of the present Decision on Jurisdiction, entitled \"Source and existence of Respondent's consent and nature of the prearbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT\", the majority adopted the general position of Claimants. I reject that choice of my colleagues as contrary to the law applicable to the present case as already explained in detail all along paragraphs 9 to 56 of the present Opinion. I will therefore add here only a few observations on specific points made by the majority in the said paragraphs of the majority Decision.\n\n60.\n\nNobody questions that the irrevocable consent given in advance by Argentina and Austria in the BIT, as an offer to protected investors of the other Contracting State, came into existence from the entry into force of the BIT between the two Contracting States *in the relations between themselves*. And it is indeed as from that date that there is an offer by Respondent to arbitrate \"investment disputes\" with Austrian protected investors as defined in article 8 of the BIT and, consequently, it is as from then that the offer became capable of being accepted by an Austrian protected investor. But Respondent's consent given in advance in Article 8(4) (first sentence) of the BIT cannot be interpreted and applied in isolation from other provisions of the Article (including Article 8(6)) and the BIT as a whole as \"context\", if the interpreter is of course applying the rules on interpretation and application of treaties codified in the VCLT -including \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between [Argentina and Austria]\" (Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT) (CL-001) - and not proceeding in the abstract or in a legal vacuum.\n\n61.\n\nIn paragraph 271 of the Decision, the majority refers indeed to the rules on treaty interpretation of the VCLT, but the ensuing reasoning fails to explain how in the light of the clear text of Article 8(1) to (3) a good faith interpretation and application made as commanded by the VCLT may lead to the conclusion in paragraph 281 that \"the BIT did not establish the prearbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT as conditions precedent to the existence of the host State's consent to investor-State arbitration, but rather as mandatory procedural steps investors have to take before a claim can be decided by an international arbitral tribunal on the merits\". As to the determination from when Respondent's advance consent as embodied in the \"standing arbitration offer\" of the Argentina-Austria BIT is in existence, it goes with the BIT system that it must be prior to the consent of the protected investor, but without the latter's consent there a \"mutual consent\" between the parties to the dispute indispensable for the \"arbitration agreement\" cannot be considered executed.\n\n62.\n\nRespondent's consent offer to protected Austrian investors as manifested in the Argentina-Austria BIT, the fact that the offer is in force since 1 January 1995 and the further fact that that \"offer\" was in existence before CAI and CASAG accepted the \"offer\" do not alter in any respect neither the legal nature of the preconditions to international arbitration formulated in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) the BIT nor the normal operation, under the BIT and ICSID mechanisms, of the dispute settlement system established by the Argentine-Austria BIT, which is binding for Claimants since CAI's letter of 30 April 2014 accepting thereby the ICSID arbitration offer in Article 8(5) of the BIT (joined on 7 August 2014 by the same acceptance of CASAG) and confirmed for both companies by the Request for Arbitration dated 4 December 2014.\n\n63.\n\nThis arbitrator has noted that the majority Decision appears to be rather in silence (or deny) the condition of *\"offer\"* to protected investor of the other Contracting State of the \"standing consent\" of Article 8 of the BIT. This is quite wrong. The best proof for this conclusion of mine is the very Claimants' Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014 whose section 2 entitled *\"Consent to Arbitrate\"* reads as follows.\n\n\"(12) Article 8 of the BIT contains an *offer* by Argentina to submit to arbitration within the scope of the treaty. CAI and CASAG initiated amicable consultation in accordance with Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT with letter dated 30 April 2014. With the same letter, CAI accepted Argentina's *offer* to submit the dispute to arbitration. CASAG accepted Argentina's *offer* to submit the dispute to arbitration with letter dated 7 August 2014. CAI and CASAG submit this Request for Arbitration to ICSID in accordance with *Article 8(5)* of the BIT *as the applicable dispute resolution mechanism and thereby repeat and ratify their consent to arbitration.*\n\n\"(13) *The acceptance of Argentina's jurisdictional offer forms the parties' consent in writing to submit to ICSID.*\n\n\"(14) Pursuant to Rule 2(3) of the Institution Rules, the date of consent to ICSID arbitration is 30 April 2014 for CAI and 7 August 2014 for CASAG.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n64.\n\nIn the present phase of the case, Respondent's consent as such poses no problem for the core determinations to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal. In fact, the problem only exists with respect to Claimants' consent because they are \"thirds\" to the BIT and as such CAI and CASAG do not have standing to modify Respondent's arbitration offer of the BIT with all its preconditions, terms and requirements and, as it will be explained below *,* they failed to do so. The question of the correspondence between the Spanish word *\"condiciones\"* and the German word *\"Bestimmungen\"* raised in paragraph 281 of the majority Decision is, in my opinion, irrelevant for the core determinations to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n65.\n\nWhat is essential is to know whether or not Claimants' alleged consent matches the scope of Respondent' consent of the offer or whether because the non-fulfilment of the preconditions to arbitration in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) and the by-passing of the sequential system of settlement of the Article, Claimants' consent falls outside of the scope of the offered Respondent's consent with the result that the indispensable \"arbitration agreement\" (acuerdo de arbitraje) between the Parties to the dispute has not be formed or executed between them. But, before examining in detail these failures a few general comments on the \"applicable law\" and the \"burden of proof\" seem in order.\n\n66.\n\nContrary to current practice followed generally in investment international arbitration decision and awards, the present majority Decision is silent on the law applicable to this phase of the case and on the allocation of the burden of proof to the Parties. Regarding the law governing the determination of jurisdiction the predominant opinion is that such determination is rather to be decided in accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the applicable rules of the relevant treaty, the Argentina/ Austria in the BIT instant case, and the applicable rules and principles of international law, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention would govern the merits of the case only (see, for example, Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013 in the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* case, p. 11, para. 30). I have followed this predominant opinion but without excluding altogether Article 42(1) because in the present case the Argentina-Austria BIT makes at the end of the definition of the term \"investment\" a very important *renvoi* to the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is placed.\n\n67.\n\nAs to the allocation of the burden of proof, I have been guided by recent relevant jurisdictional decisions or awards which have distinguished rightly between different sets of facts with regard to the burden of proof at a jurisdictional phase (Decisions on Jurisdiction in the case *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance and Republic of Paraguay* (2010), and *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* (2013); and Award on *Blue Bank International v. Venezuela* (2017)). As stated, for example, by the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* Tribunal:\n\n\"Regarding burden of proof, it is commonly accepted that at the jurisdictional stage the facts as alleged by the claimant have to be accepted when, if proven they would constitute a breach of the relevant treaty. However, if jurisdiction rests on the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the existence of an \u2018investment' and of the parties' consent, the Tribunal must apply the standard rule of onus of proof *actori incumbit probatio,* except that any party asserting a fact shall have to prove it.\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013, para. 29) (CL-134).\n\n**(a) The sequential system of settlement of investment disputes of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe first issue raised by Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection concerns the failure of Claimants to comply with the sequential system of settlement of investment disputes set forth in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. For Respondent the path followed by Claimants disrupted that \"sequential multi-stage dispute settlement system\" of the BIT made up of successive and interdependent steps, namely amicable consultations, local or domestic jurisdictions, international arbitration and withdrawal of local proceedings *before* ICSID arbitration would be ultimately available for protected investors. More precisely the sequential system would command for the Respondent the following steps: (i) amicable consultations at least six months, except in case of an earlier solution; (ii) submission of the dispute to domestic jurisdiction at least 18 months except in case of a decision on the merits before or agreement between the parties; (iii) possibility of submitting the dispute to an international arbitral tribunal; (iv) withdrawal of any pending local judicial proceedings in case of submitting the dispute to ICSID arbitration.\n\n69.\n\nIn support of its main argument Respondent invokes mainly the text of Article 8 and other provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the ICSID Convention, the rules on interpretation of treaties codified by the VCLT and the jurisprudence of the ICJ (for example, the case *Georgia v.Russian Federation* (2011)), as well as decisions or awards on jurisdiction of investment arbitral tribunals relating to the interpretation of similar dispute resolution clauses of other BITs (for example, in *Wintershall* (2008), *Murphy* (2010) *, Impregilo v.Argentina* (2011), *Inspection and Control Service v. Argentina* (2012) and *Daimler* (2012) *.*\n\n70.\n\nIn this kind of dispute resolution systems, the Contracting States' intention reflected in the very wording of the relevant provisions of the applicable BIT makes clear that each step of the sequential settlement process is contingent upon the fulfilment by the investor of the prior step of the system, the various paragraphs of the dispute resolution clause being thereby interdependent and interlinked. Thus, if a given protected investor desires to benefit itself from the access to international arbitration offered by that kind of system in BITs it must first comply with the prior steps as announced by the system - and following the order of steps established by it, amicable consultation and local jurisdictions in the Argentina-Austria BIT. Otherwise, the investor's access to international arbitration cannot be materialized in law. Why not? Because the wording of that kind of dispute resolution systems shows that the Contracting States of the BIT did not intend that protected investors would have a free choice between the prior means of settlement listed in the system on the one hand and direct access to international arbitration on the other hand, and the starting point of the interpretation of any treaty is the elucidation of the meaning of *the text* of the provision or provisions subject to the interpretation presumed in public international law to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties to the treaty (VCLT *dixet*).\n\n71.\n\nIn the present case, it is obvious that the text adopted by Argentina and Austria for Article 8 of the BIT makes its various relevant paragraphs interdependent and interlinked, becoming mutually near \"context\" to each other in one interpretation conducted in accordance with the interpretation and application rules codified by the VCLT. In public international law there are no admissible propositions to the effect that when a treaty provides for rights for \"thirds\" (as happened with BITs in respect of protected investors) these very \"thirds\" when accepting those rights may free themselves from complying with conditions or requirements provided for by the treaty concerned for the exercise of the rights in question. In accordance with rules codified in article 36(2) of the VCLT the protected investors exercising BIT rights are duty bound (*shall)* to comply with the conditions for the exercise of those rights as formulated in the BIT in question. In the present case, they must comply with the conditions (order of the successive steps included) of the sequential systems of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. To do otherwise would render the system meaningless, an unacceptable result for a good faith interpretation done in accordance with the VCLT. Furthermore, the words used by the contracting States in the text of the treaty provision subject to interpretation should have to be given appropriate effect by the interpreter, as commended by the *effect utile* principle in public international law.\n\n72.\n\nNo facts making it actually *impossible* or *futile* (notions which should not be confused with *reasons of convenience)* for Claimants to comply with all aspects of the sequential system of the BIT have been invoked or satisfactorily proven to me and Claimants have not established that Argentina and Austria intended to give any special meaning to the words used in the relevant paragraphs of Article 8 either, except with respect to the term \"investment\" and \"investors\" defined by the Contracting States in Article 1(1) and (2) of the BIT. It follows that for all other terms of Article 8 the ordinary meaning rule of Article 31 of the VCLT applies. Thus, the listed individual preconditions as well as the sequential order of the system itself as formulated in the text of Article 8 of the BIT are part and parcel of the \"offer to arbitrate\" made by Argentina and Austria in the BIT. This means in turn that when a given protected investor affirms having accepted or complied with the conditions and requirements of Article 8 that statement cannot be taken but as referring to Article 8 *in toto*, including the very sequential system as such and not only its individual interrelated steps.\n\n73.\n\nClaimants have been rather silent on the issue of the duty to comply with the sequential system itself of Article 8 of the BIT, beyond contending that they did not breach the \"procedural steps\" of Article 8 of the BIT. They have considered preferable to approach the subject-matter of the system as such in an oblique manner when addressing the individual preconditions at issue without elaborating much on the system of settlement of the BIT as a whole. But their basic submission has been all along that they have complied with the \"procedural conditions\" of Article 8, although they admit not necessarily in the order listed in Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n74.\n\nFor example, the \"Notification for the commencement of amicable consultations\" addressed by CAI to the President of the Republic of Argentina of 30 April 2014 states that \"the requirements to submit the dispute to arbitration under Articles 8(2) and 8(3) b) are fulfilled\" because as contended it had seised Salta provincial administrative and judicial jurisdictions before requesting the host State for the commencement of amicable consultations. In their Hearing Opening Statement, they restated the argument of having \"complied with the requirements of Article 8\" but they invoked cautiously, as an alternative to Article 8, that in any case the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the BIT would grant Claimants jurisdiction if the Tribunal were to follow Respondent's *strict reading* of Article 8 (see, for example, para. 136 of the Tribunal Decision) *(emphasis added)*\n\n75.\n\nTo be more precise, Claimants are invoking - as a demonstration of compliance with Article 8 - the alleged following facts: (i) that on 28 August 2013 a *dispute arose* from the treatment accorded to CAI's investment in ENJASA as a result of the revocation by Resolution 240/13 of 13 August 2013 by the *ente regulador* ENREJA of the exclusive licence of ENJASA for the management, commercialization and exploitation of all the games of chance in the province of Salta and (ii) that following the rejection by ENJASA Resolution 315 /13 of 19 November 2013 of the request for revocation of that measure, ENJASA on 5 February 2014 filed in a local court of Salta judicial action aiming this time at the annulment of that ENREJA's decisions on the revocation of the measure. In other words, Claimants admitted in the present ICSID international proceedings that the local jurisdictions (administrative as well as judicial remedies) have been seised by ENJASA in Salta prior, not subsequent, to Claimants' notification of 30 April 2014 to the Argentine Republic asking for the commencement of amicable consultations, admitting therefore to having inverted the order of sequence of remedies of the BIT.\n\n76.\n\nThese admissions are indeed evidence that for Claimants the order of the steps of the sequential system of the BIT could be altered by them (the menu *a la carte* of the *Daimler* tribunal) without breaching Article 8 of the BI, *otherwise the provision would be applied strictly by the Arbitral Tribunal.* This together with Claimants' general position on the characterization of the individual preconditions to arbitration of Article 8, allows this arbitrator to conclude *ad majori* that Claimants consider themselves entitled to alter without negative jurisdictional consequences for them the sequence or steps of the system of settlement agreed upon by Argentina and Austria when concluding the BIT and, by so doing, ignoring one of the conditions which are part and parcel of the \"standing arbitration offer\" made by the two States in the BIT. This misbehaviour is dispensed of by the majority Decision without major explanation in detriment to the common intention of the Contracting States of the BIT and the principle of legal security which should prevail in the relations between host States and protected private investors under the BITs.\n\n77.\n\nThe above proposition and decision cannot be upheld by this arbitrator in the light of the applicable law and the considerations made *supra* on the matter. The fact that the sequential system of settlement of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria is sided-step by the present majority Decision is indeed the first of the reasons for my dissent concerning the present Decision on the Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection. Arbitrators are not Contracting Parties to BITs. They are duty-bound to make its decisions on the basis of the law applicable to the case, without disregarding the provisions of bilateral treaties adopted by States to protect and promote investments as they commonly wish.\n\n78.\n\nAs it has been declared by the ICJ when the dispute resolution system of a treaty provides for, as the bilateral Argentina/Austria BIT does, an express choice of two or more modes of dispute settlement (in the instant BIT amicable negotiation followed by resort to local administrative o judicial jurisdiction before international arbitration) the text suggests *an affirmative duty* to resort to these means, in this order, prior to the institution of international arbitration (see *ICJ Reports 2011 (I),* p. 126, para. 134 and ff.) and this affirmative duty must, in my opinion, be enforced by the arbitrators.\n\n79.\n\nThe conclusions above are advanced without prejudice to the question to be considered below of whether or not there exists between the Parties a single or two distinct disputes, namely a \"contract dispute\" and a \"treaty dispute\" allegedly born from the same original event, the revocation of the exclusive licence of ENJASA, a privatized enterprise national of Argentina where the Claimant alleged to have a protected investment under the Argentina-Austria BIT amounting mainly at the time of the occurrence of the event to the holding of 60% shares of Leisure & Entertainment S.A. (L&E)'s (another Argentina stock corporation) shareholding of ENJASA.\n\n**(b) The prior condition of \"amicable consultations\" for a term of six months**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants failed to meet the requirement of prior \"amicable consultations\" for a six months period of Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and this failure to comply with this first individual precondition of the dispute resolution system of the BIT demonstrates that CAI and CASAG did not accept the \"offer to arbitrate\" advanced by Argentina in Article 8, with the result that Respondent's consent to arbitrate the present investment dispute with Claimants was never perfected through Claimants' acceptance of that offer. In consequence, the \"arbitration agreement\" between the Parties to the present dispute needed for establishing the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Arbitral Tribunal has never been executed between these Parties.\n\n81.\n\nFor Respondent, the precondition of \"amicable consultations\" is not a mere dispensable procedural requirement and its temporal element of six months period is not a dispensable cooling-off period either. They are binding *jurisdictional requirements* whereby the Parties to the dispute must attempt to settle it amicably during a maximum period of six months. The text would suggest that it sets forth an obligation *(shall*, in the text *)* which operates between the Parties within the dispute resolution system of the BIT during a defined time-limit as a *prior condition* to the submission of the dispute to the second step of the system, namely *before* (not *after)* the submission of the dispute to the local jurisdictions and thereafter, eventually, to international arbitration.\n\n82.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' contentions that the obligation to negotiate is a \"soft obligation\" which must only be attempted when one of the Parties unilaterally considers that it is possible *(en la medida de lo possible*, in the Spanish text *)* to solve thereby the dispute. For Respondent, the Claimants' contention was aimed at retroactively justifying their failure to meet the \"amicable consultations\" precondition of Article 8 of the BIT, invoking against such a contention: (i) the very text of the provisions in Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina/Austria BIT; (ii) the Wolf Theiss firm's letter of 30 April 2014 on behalf of CAI entitled \"Notification for the commencement of amicable consultations\" addressed to the President of the Argentine Republic; (iii) the affirmation in the said Notification that the dispute was already submitted to the competent domestic authorities of Salta since 2013 as described in paragraphs 119 and 120 of Claimants' Rejoinder of Jurisdiction; and (iv) Claimants' admission in said Notification that CAI had already fulfilled the requirement of Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT, while asking for the *commencement* of \"amicable consultations\" and noting that a decision on the merits of the dispute was already rendered by the *ente regulador* ENREJA on 19 November 2013. All this would prove beyond any reasonable doubt Claimants' breach of the precondition of \"amicable consultations\" defined by the BIT as the first means of settlement to be tried by the parties to the dispute.\n\n83.\n\nStarting from their basic position the so-called \"no strict compliance\" and the characterization of the \"amicable consultations\" as a mere *procedural* requirement and not as a precondition for the validity of the consent of the Parties to the dispute, Claimants argued that Article 8(1) does not provide for an unconditional consultation obligation, but only an obligation to the extent that the amicable consultations are possible (*en la medida de lo possible)*. However, Claimants contend that they have met the BIT procedural requirement of entering into amicable consultations aimed at settling the dispute with Respondent.\n\n84.\n\nTo reconcile both propositions, Claimants develop a series of profuse arguments on (i) when did the dispute arise and (ii) how have Claimants complied with the requirement to settle the dispute, while possible, through amicable consultations (see Claimants' PHB, pp. 69-85). Under (i), Claimants considered the definition of dispute, the emergence of the dispute and whether or not Claimants have to initiate amicable consultations with an \"official\" trigger letter. And under (ii), Claimants considered the definition of amicable consultations and the conduct of the amicable consultations, concluding that they had fulfilled the requirement of Article 8(1) even if CAI letter of 30 April 2014 is considered to be determinative of the beginning date of the amicable consultations.\n\n85.\n\nThese arguments Claimants' take in their Post-Hearing Brief about sixteen pages, however neither in the text nor in the corresponding sixty footnotes of those pages appears, if I am not mistaken, any reference to the rules codified by the VCLT on the interpretation and application of treaties.\n\n86.\n\nDoubtless some passages of Claimants' arguments on the present precondition are or could be relevant for the jurisdictional determinations to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal, but most of these arguments appear to me to be rather alien or falling outside the realm of the VCLT *rules of the law of treaties* concerning the interpretation and application of \"conventional obligations\" as the obligation to engage in \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT, namely as an invitation to the Arbitral Tribunal to follow a kind of free interpretation and application approach to BIT obligations as promoted by certain circles but that this arbitrator does not share because it ignores relevant principles and rules of the applicable conventional and customary international law.\n\n87.\n\nBesides, several of Claimants' arguments do not appear to have taken account, as they should, of the full text of the BIT obligation of trying first to settle the dispute through *\"* amicable consultations\". Thus, it has to be underlined that the text does begin in Article 8(1) but ends with the first words of Article 8(2) where it is stated that *\"Si estas consultas no aportaran una soluci\u00f3n en un plazo de seis meses,...\"* the dispute may be submitted to second step, namely the competent local administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State. Given the admitted or proven facts, it seems that Claimants have not complied with this temporal aspect of the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of the Argentina-Austria BIT either.\n\n88.\n\nTo ascertain the meaning and scope of the obligation of engaging in \"amicable consultations\" with the other party to the dispute, as the first precondition to international arbitration, an interpreter has to proceed to look at the *text* of the obligation *in toto,* the mutual *context* provided *inter se* by the first four paragraphs of Article 8 and the definition of the word \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT, as well as together with the context the relevant *rules of international law* applicable in the relations between Argentina and Austria as Contracting States of the BIT (Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT). If that is done through a good faith interpretation process the meaning and scope of the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of the BIT appears perfectly clear.\n\n89.\n\nIn Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the word \"dispute\" must be of course understood as defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT and be a \"legal investment dispute\" (as provided for in article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention). The dispute must be between a protected investor of the other Contracting State and the host State of the investment and concern \"*las materias regidas por el presente Convenio\",* but not further. This last very important reference in Article 8(1) excludes *\"contract claims disputes\"* from the scope of application of Article 8. The subject-matter of the legal investment dispute falling within the scope of Article 8 must be therefore a *\"treaty claims dispute\"* and the Parties are obliged to engage between themselves in the \"amicable consultations\" thereon, not otherwise, and try thereby *en la medida de lo posible* to settle the *\"treaty claims dispute\"* concerned through those consultations within a term of six months, except of course in case of an earlier settlement of the dispute between the parties. Only, as provided expressly at the beginning of Article 8(2), *\"Si estas consultas no aportaran una soluci\u00f3n en un plazo de seis meses\"* may the dispute be submitted to the second step of the dispute settlement system of the BIT.\n\n90.\n\nThus, except in the hypothesis of \"an earlier solution\", the obligation of engaging in \"amicable consultations\" lasts until the six months period is over. Thereafter, the parties are entitled to move the dispute to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State. As rightly stated by the *Teinver v. Argentina* Tribunal, it is fair to interpret the \"amicable consultations obligation\" as \"a general \u2018best efforts' obligation for the parties\" and, further, that the natural reading of the obligation together with its temporal element is \"that the Parties are obligated to make their best efforts to amicably settle their dispute, and that they are required to do so for six months before proceeding to the next step.\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 December 2012, p. 19, para. 108).\n\n91.\n\nThis is how Argentina and Austria have defined in the BIT the precondition of \"amicable consultation\" obligation and it is as such, no otherwise, which is binding for Claimants to accept Respondent's offer to arbitrate the investment dispute in question. For this arbitrator, it is a clear obligation of conduct binding the Parties to the dispute all along of the prescribed six months unless an earlier settlement is reached. \"Amicable consultations or negotiations\" were in the past, and are at present, the most frequent precondition to international arbitration or judicial settlement in the international practice because it is a manifestation of a systemic rule of public international law, namely the rule of State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals as reflected in the jurisprudence of the ICJ, and its arbitral or judicial application should be approached with most care. For my part, I do not admit the characterization of \"soft obligation\" as do the majority Decision with reference to the \"amicable consultations\" obligation in Article 8 of the present BIT or in any other international conventional instrument.\n\n92.\n\nThe established jurisprudence of the ICJ rejects in resolute terms the majority Decision arguments developed in its motives concerning the characterization, nature and function of preconditions in disputes resolution clauses of treaties, as evidenced by some passages of its jurisprudence already quoted in the above paragraphs 6 and 35 of this Opinion. For example, in the following one: \"... any conditions to which [the] consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon. The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application\" (*Case Concerning Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application), (DR of Congo v. Rwanda), ICJ Reports 2006,* p. 39, para. 88) (AL RA 39).\n\n93.\n\nAmong more recent examples, the Judgment on Preliminary Objections in the case concerning the *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms Racial Discrimination* (*Georgia v. Russian Federation)* is of particular interest for the jurisdictional phase of the present ICSID arbitration case because (i) the applicant failed its case for not complying with a treaty precondition of prior resort to negotiations and (ii) the summing up made by the Court in that Judgment of its own and of the Permanent Court's jurisprudence on the subject-matter. I quote below some passages of this Judgment which provide additional light on specific issues of law which are also present in this ICSID arbitration case in connection with the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8 of the BIT:\n\n(i) On prior negotiations qualified by a temporal element:\n\n\"To the extent that the procedural requirements [of a dispute settlement clause] may be conditions, they must be conditions precedent to the seisin of the Court even when the term is not qualified by a temporal element\" (see whole quotation of the passage in paragraph 35 of the present Opinion).\n\n(ii) On the absence of a genuine attempt to negotiate:\n\n\"Manifestly, in the absence of evidence of a genuine attempt to negotiate, the precondition of negotiation is not met. However, where negotiations are attempted or have commenced, the jurisprudence of this Court and of the Permanent Court of International Justice clearly reveals that the precondition of negotiation is met only when there has been a failure of negotiations, or when negotiations have become futile or deadlocked\" (*Case concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation), ICJ Reports 2011*, p. 133, para. 159).\n\n(iii) On the distinction between negotiations or mere protest or disputations:\n\n\"Furthermore, ascertainment of whether negotiations, as distinct from mere protests or disputations, have taken place, and whether they have failed or become futile or deadlocked, are essentially questions of fact \u2018for consideration in each case'\" (*Ibid*., p. 133, para. 160).\n\n(iv) On the relationship between the precondition of negotiations and the subject-matter of the treaty containing the resolution clause:\n\n\"However, to meet the precondition of negotiation in the compromissory clause of a treaty, these negotiations must relate to the subject-matter of the treaty containing the compromissory clause. In other words, the subject-matter of the negotiations must relate to the subject-matter of the dispute which, in turn, must concern the substantive obligations contained in the treaty in question\" (*Ibid*., p. 133, para. 161).\n\n94.\n\nAs already explained above, the Austrian protected investors under the Argentina-Austria BIT as Claimants are a \"third person\" with respect to that BIT and, consequently, they lack standing for altering or modifying, in any respect, the \"offer to arbitrate\" given in advance by Argentina to Austrian nationals as per the BIT. Claimants are not in a procedural position allowing them to question, redraft or dispense themselves compliance with that \"offer\" through free interpretations or unilateral statements alleging impossibility, futility or the like when as in the instant case the \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT had not even commenced. This seems to be the position of Respondent and also in April 2014 the understanding of Claimants themselves as reflected in CAI's letter of 30 April 2014 to the President of the Argentine Republic, except with respect to the specific question whether or not \"amicable consultations\" could be the *second* step in the dispute resolution system of the BIT.\n\n95.\n\nWhat the Parties definitely disagree on all along is with respect to the date as from which the six months period of Article 8(2) has to be counted: As from the date of the invitation to the other party to engaging in the amicable consultation *simplicitur?* As from the date of actual commencement of the amicable consultations? or as from any other date or dates? The answer is a question of fact and the burden of proof of that fact corresponds to Claimants *(onus probandi incumbit actori).* Claimants suggest to the Arbitral Tribunal two alternative dates for that purpose, namely as from 27 August 2013 or as from 30 April 2014, but none of these dates have been proven to my satisfaction as correct. The reasons will be unfolded below.\n\n96.\n\nThis arbitrator is unable to admit the first date proposed by Claimants, namely as from 27 August 2013, the date of the first meeting of Mr. Tucek with representatives of the Government of the Province of Salta (Claimants' PHB, para. 214). Neither their second alternative date, namely as from the letter dated 30 April 2014 to the President of the Argentine Republic entitled \"Notification for the commencement of amicable consultations\" (*Ibid*., para. 252). Both contentions appear to ignore elements of fact and law of the case which cannot be put aside by this arbitrator in the light of the applicable law and admitted facts.\n\n97.\n\nAs to the first contention, it must be recalled that the subject-matter of the meeting of Mr. Tucek (acting in behalf of ENJASA) on 27 August 2013 with representatives of the Province of Salta concerned *exclusively* the issue of the reinstatement of ENJASA's licence which had been revoked on 13 August 2013 by ENREJA Resolution N\u00b0 240/13. At that time, the subject-matter of these contacts, meetings or exchanges between representatives of Claimants (acting either on their own or on behalf of ENJASA) and representatives of the Province of Salta concerned the issue of the revocation of the license, as confirmed by ENJASA's submission on 28 August 2013 before ENREJA of a petition for reconsideration of Resolution N\u00b0 240/13. At some point of those exchanges, on the one hand, the Salta authorities made certain settlement proposals to Claimants which were rejected by them and, on the other hand, Claimants increased their control of ENJASA by purchasing the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E (for the Claimants' version on those events, see the written witness statements of Mr. Tucek and Mr. Schreiner and their oral statements at the Hearing).\n\n98.\n\nHowever, neither of those initial events nor the fact that thereafter ENJASA filed under the administrative domestic laws of Salta a request or petition for reconsideration of Resolution N\u00b0 240/13 or the further fact of the rejection of that petition by ENREJA Resolution N\u00b0 315/13 of 19 November 2013 relate to the subject-matter of the present ICSID arbitration which is an international arbitration which subject-matter is compensation for alleged damages resulting from alleged breaches of the Argentina-Austria BIT (not the reconsideration of the revocation of ENREJA's Resolutions concerning the license, which is an administrative \"contract claims dispute\" pursued by ENJASA under the domestic law of the Province of Salta and which since 5 February 2014 is the object of a request by ENJASA for annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions concerned before the First Instance Court of Salta).\n\n99.\n\nThe mere description of the events above suffices to answer in the negative the first Claimants' suggested date as from which the six months period of Article 8(2) of the BIT should be counted. Claimants' notification of 30 April 2014 provides additional determinative written proof of Claimants' admission that by April 2014 they had not yet fulfilled the obligation of engaging in \"amicable consultations\" with the Argentine Republic as Respondent in the present case, as prescribed by this precondition of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n100.\n\nRegarding the second alternative date (30 April 2014) suggested by Claimants explaining that \"at the latest on 1 November 2014 (i.e. six months after the letter dated 30 April 2014), Claimants had complied with the six-month period pursuant to Article 8(1) [of the] BIT\". However, 30 April 2014 is not acceptable for this arbitrator either because CAI took months to provide Respondent with the usual written evidence concerning capacity, legal representation and powers of attorney. Furthermore, CASAG did not join CAI as Claimants in the present case and provide for the corresponding representation and powers of attorney until Claimants' letter of 7 August 2014, at no time before that date, as admitted by Claimants.\n\n101.\n\nThe above facts have not been challenged by Claimants. The documental evidence submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal shows that by letter of 16 May 2014 the head, Dr. Abbona, of the competent federal administration (*Procuradur\u00eda del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n)* requested the Claimants' side to provide documentation showing the capacity of Wolf Theiss to act on behalf of CAI. A copy of a power of attorney of CAI to Wolf Theiss was provided to Respondent as an attachment to a further letter of 10 June 2014 where it is also recalled the readiness of CAI to participate in amicable consultations as per the notification of 30 April 2014.\n\n102.\n\nFollowing a further letter of Dr. Abbona of 2 July 2014, the executive director (Mr. Tucek) and the financial director (Mr. Zuruker-Burda) of CAI confirmed the readiness of CAI to participate in amicable consultations as per letters of 30 April 2014 and 10 June 2014. In another letter of 14 July 2014 which refers also to Dr. Abbona's letter of 2 July 2014, Wolf Theiss informed further (i) that the letter of 10 June 2014 was validly issued because it had been signed by the executive directors in accordance with the statutes of the company; (ii) that an attached certified copy of CAI's entry in the Austrian commercial register confirms that the signatories of the power of attorney are the executive directors of CAI; (iii) that attaching copies of the applicable provisions of Austrian law provide for the executive directors' representations in all matters concerning limited liability companies and third parties' reliance on the validity of all entries in the commercial register; (iv) that CAI would confirm in a separate letter that Wolf Theiss had been duly appointed as legal representative of CAI in relation to the dispute; and finally (v) recalling the notification of 30 April 2014 and the readiness of CAI to participate in amicable consultations with the Government of Argentina, as well as asking when Dr. Abonna would be available for a meeting to conduct amicable consultations.\n\n103.\n\nFurthermore, in a letter dated 7 August 2014 from Wolf Theiss, Respondent was informed of the following: (i) that the notification for the commencement of amicable consultations made by CAI also *included claims* of its parent company CASAG; (ii) that CASAG was ready to participate in amicable consultations with Argentina in accordance with Article 8(1) of the BIT; and (iii) that Wolf Theiss had assured likewise the legal representation of CASAG, attaching therewith the corresponding power of attorney from CASAG.\n\n104.\n\nThus, Claimants' preparation and submission of documentation showing the capacity, representation and powers of attorney for CAI and for the joined CASAG company *extended from 30 April 2014 until 7 August 2014*, namely more than six months. All along this period ENJASA' judicial action instituted as indicated on 5 February 2014 in the local courts of Salta requesting the annulment of ENREJA's resolutions 240 and 331 was, and continued to be, going on in 2014.\n\n105.\n\nIt follows that it was only on 7 August 2014 that the preliminary procedural issues of proving capacity, representation and powers of both Claimants were settled. Consequently, the possibility of commencing the substantive \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT was certainly there as from that day, but not before that date. Thus, as stated by Respondent: \"Claimants' counsel provided evidence of their power to represent both Claimants on 7 August 2014, as a result of which \u2018only on 7th August 2014 the parties are in a position to start sitting down around the table to negotiate'\" (Respondent's PHB, para 55). On the basis of the relevant written documentation in the record of the case this arbitrator concludes that 7 August 2014 is the date as from which the six months temporal element of the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT must, in the circumstances of the present case, begin to be counted.\n\n106.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, from 7 August 2014 on Claimants did not show major interest in engaging in \"amicable consultations \"and on 4 December 2014 they filed the Request for Arbitration with ICSID. The last of Claimants' relevant communications between these two dates, the letters of CAI and CASAG of 9 September and 21 October 2014 to the Argentine Republic (Exhibits C-8 and C-14) limit themselves to reiterating the previous position by recalling once more that Claimants were \"looking forward\" to Respondent's comments to the first letter of 30 April 2014 and asking Respondent to inform them of its availability for a meeting \"to conduct amicable consultations\". But they did not advance any concrete proposal to Respondent concerning where and when to call the suggested meeting or any other alternative meeting or how to organize the consultation or propose a draft agenda.\n\n107.\n\nAfter 7 August 2014 Claimants did not move a jota from beyond reiterating in most general terms their readiness as per the letter of 30 April 2014. They never confronted Respondent with any kind of concrete proposal concerning the consultations or gave a warning or a hint to Respondent's side. There are practical means to move along consultations or negotiations in international practice if there exists the will to do so. For example, the making of a soft intimation or *mise en demeure* through a proper communication or announcement or still more simply by sending a letter with fixed time-limits to get a positive answer from the other side as did, for example, Claimants in the *Abaclat* case (see, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 4 August 2011, p. 43) (CL-131). Nothing of the kind occurred in the present case.\n\n108.\n\nClaimants' conduct did not show any eagerness to meet the other side or to organize somewhere the amicable consultations of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT. They did not come to Argentina or propose a third country as host for the amicable consultations. In fact, it was Mr. Waijntraub - appointed representative of Salta by a provincial decree - the one who tried and finally got in touch not without difficulties with the legal representative of the Claimants on 22 October 2014 and arranged with them through e-mail exchanges and the assistance of the Austrian Embassy in Buenos Aires a meeting that finally took place on 13 March 2015 in Vienna, namely more than three months after Claimants' filing on 4 December 2014 of the Request for Arbitration with the Centre. (see paragraph 75 of the present Decision)\n\n109.\n\nThe factual evidence provided by Mr. Waijntraub in a written witness statement and oral testimony at the Hearing of his e-mail exchanges with the legal representatives of the Claimants and of what happened during the one-day Vienna meeting confirms my own perception that whatever might have been the Claimants' initial intention on 30 April 2014 about holding with Respondent the \"amicable consultations\" prescribed by the BIT (although *as a second step)* it was over by October 2014. In the formation of that perception I took also account of the time needed by Claimants for the preparation of the detailed Request for Arbitration they filed on 4 December 2014. In any case, a detailed analysis of the testimony of Mr. Waijntraub is given in paragraphs 58 to 66 of Respondent's PHB.\n\n110.\n\nIn the light of the considerations and conclusion above on the applicable law and factual evidence, I dissent from all the conclusions of the majority in paragraphs 284 to 292 of the present Decision, namely:\n\n(i) To define the \"amicable consultation obligation\" under consideration by reference to Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT only, namely without major attention to the temporal element of the obligation;\n\n(ii) To characterize the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT as a \"soft obligation\";\n\n(iii) To interpret of the words \"as far as possible\" in Article 8(1) as encompassing mere unilateral party's allegation of unwillingness of the other party or compliance with time-limits under a given domestic law and without taking account in the matter of the six months temporal element of the amicable consultations obligation as provided by Article 8(2);\n\n(iv) To affirm that in no case the requirement of \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8 (1) and (2) of the BIT may be read as limiting the scope of Respondent's consent offer to arbitrate in paragraph Article 8(4) notwithstanding the jurisprudence on the matter of the ICJ and paragraphs 12 to 14 of Claimants' Request for Arbitration;\n\n(v) To affirm that Claimants have fulfilled their obligation to comply with the requirement of \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT since 27 August 2013 when Mr. Tucek, the CEO of CASAG, met with representatives of the Province of Salta and of NREJA in order discuss how to reinstate ENJASA's exclusive license, namely at a time when there is no hint at all for any of the interested participants of any eventual \"treaty claims dispute\" between Claimants and Respondent;\n\n(vi) To affirm without evidence in support Claimants' hypothetical argument that the reinstatement of ENJASA's license by the Province of Salta a \"contract claim dispute\" would have settled the present \"treaty claim dispute\" between Claimants and Argentina Republic before this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal when in fact since 4 December 2014 Claimants by their own initiative are participating simultaneously in the Salta proceedings and the ICSID proceedings;\n\n(vii) To affirm without further ado that the acts, all the acts, of the Province of Salta are attributable under public international law to the Argentine Republic mixing up thereby the situation under international responsibility for international wrongful acts of international law with the attribution of contractual rights and obligations under the domestic laws of a given country;\n\n(viii) To affirm that the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) contains a broad understanding to the effect that the \"dispute\" subject to amicable consultations could be any dispute with regard to investment, including negotiations concerning the reinstatement of ENJASA's license, disregarding the text of the provision, the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the exclusive \"treaty claims dispute\" competence of the Arbitral Tribunal and without providing in support of such affirmation any preparatory work or any other kind of evidence;\n\n(ix) To affirm that the meetings which took place on 27 August 2013 between representatives of Claimants and the Province of Salta fulfil the need for Claimants to attempt the settlement of the present \"treaty claims dispute\" with the Argentine Republic through consultations, in full contradiction with CAI's \"Notification for the commencement of amicable consultations\" to the President of the Argentine Republic dated 30 April 2014 and the six subsequent letters (the last one of 21 October 2014) inviting Respondent for such a commencement;\n\n(x) To affirm that the consultations Claimants attempted to initiate through these letters, which remained without response in substance because of their own lack of preparation, equally fulfil the requirement under Article 8(1) of the BIT, again without reference to the temporal element of the \"amicable consultation obligation\" in Article 8(2).\n\n111.\n\nAll the conclusions of the majority Decision affirming Claimants' compliance with the precondition of \"amicable consultations\" are presented therein: (i) without answering directly any one of the arguments and evidence presented by the Respondent; (ii) without any indication of the VCLT applied by the majority Decision to the interpretation and application of the conventional provisions in Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT to reach the conclusions concerned; and (iii) without any hint as to how the majority proceeded for weighing, in the light of the applicable international law, the factual evidence submitted by each Party with their respective contentions, arguments, admissions or contradictions.\n\n112.\n\nOne obvious example of those general shortcomings in the motives of the majority Decision would be sufficient as an illustration of the above. CAI's letter of 30 April 2014 which subject-matter is, as indicated, the formal notification to the President of the Argentine Republic *for the commencement of amicable consultations under the Argentina-Austria BIT* and the series of subsequent letters which went on until 21 October 2014 referring to *the commencement of the said consultations* (all of which are in the records of the case) belied fully, in my opinion, the present majority Decision's conclusion on the core question of whether or not the meeting between Mr. Tucek and representatives of the Province of Salta and of ENREJA on 27 August 2013 had already fulfilled the amicable consultations precondition provided for in Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT *without providing any evidence that the participants in the meeting were conscious of such an anticipated effect* or any other kind of evidence in support of that extravagant conclusion. In any case, this basic contradiction would deserve a complete demonstration in the motives of the Decision, which is missed.\n\n113.\n\nI will recall further, because it is important to bear it in mind in the present phase of the case that the affirmation in paragraph 286 of the majority Decision to the effect that - for the purpose of compliance with the \"amicable consultations\" precondition of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT -the meeting of Mr. Tucek with the representatives of the Province of Salta \"shows that the \u2018dispute', at the time, was not limited to claims for breach of domestic law between ENJASA and ENREJA, or the Province of Salta, but already concerned the rights of Claimants as foreign investor under the Argentina-Austria BIT\" is a fallacy not only out of line with established facts and considerations of coherence and logic, but also by the reading of the text and context of the said provisions of the BIT and the jurisprudence of the ICJ (see above paragraph 93 of this Opinion). The subject-matter of the \"amicable consultations\" of the precondition must relate to the subjectmatter of the dispute which, in turn, must concern the substantive obligations of the treaty in question. Nothing of that kind took place at the said Mr. Tucek's meeting on 27 August 2013 according to the written and oral evidence submitted by the Parties to the Arbitral Tribunal. It is also the appropriate moment to recall that according to the said jurisprudence the absence of a *genuine* attempt to negotiate, the precondition of negotiation is not met.\n\n114.\n\nIn sum, I reject the majority Decision's conclusion on the precondition of \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and conclude that the Claimants failed to comply with its duty of trying first to solve the instant ICSID dispute between CAI and CASAG and the Argentine Republic for the following summarized core reasons:\n\n(i) Because Claimants as admitted did not try first to solve that \"treaty claims dispute\" before the Arbitral Tribunal through \"amicable consultations\", as provided for in the sequential dispute settlement system of Article 8 of the BIT;\n\n(ii) Because Claimants' affirmation to have complied with the \"amicable consultations \"of Article 8(1) and (2) has not been proven or the affirmation relate to facts concerning a dispute other than a \"treaty claims dispute\" before this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n(iii) Because Claimants did not comply with the six months term established by Article 8 of the BIT for the \"amicable consultations\" considering that the earliest available date, in the circumstances of the case, to begin to count the said temporal term is 7 August 2014 and that Claimants filed with the Centre their Request for Arbitration on 4 December 2014, namely before completion of that term;\n\n(iv) Because Claimants invoke the exchanges held at the meeting between Mr. Tucek and representatives of the Province of Salta on 27 August 2013 when such invocation is not admissible under international law as declared by ICJ jurisprudence according to which to meet the precondition of negotiations prescribed in a dispute settlement clause of a given treaty the later must relate to the subject-matter of the treaty containing the dispute resolution clause so that the subjectmatter of the negotiations must relate to the subject-matter of the dispute which, in turn, must concern the substantive obligations contained in the treaty in question;\n\n(v) Because Claimants' invocation of Mr. Tucet's meeting of 27 August 2013 as complying with the \"amicable consultations\" requirement of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT is absolutely incompatible with CAI' Notification to the President of the Argentine Republic of 30 April 2014 (joined in August 2014 by CASAG) of Claimants' readiness to commence \"amicable consultations\" pursuant to the Argentina-Austria BIT and the six subsequent Claimants' letters (the last one of 21 October 2014) insisting on the commencement of the said consultations; and\n\n(vi) Because CAI and CASAG never actually engaged in \"amicable consultations\" with the Argentine Republic and, therefore, according to international law as declared by ICJ jurisprudence Claimants are not entitled now to allege impossibility of compliance or a failure of consultations which never took place or that consultations would have become futile or deadlocked.\n\n**(c) The prior condition of \"submission of the dispute to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\" of the host State for a term of eighteen months**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nRespondent contends that following the \"amicable consultations\" precondition, the next step of the system of investments disputes settlement of the Argentina-Austria BIT is the submission of the investment dispute to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State for 18 months, as provided for in Article 8(2) and (3) (a) of the BIT. As in the case of any other jurisdictional precondition the submission of the dispute to the host State competent domestic jurisdiction is mandatory for the protected investor and Claimants' reliance in the word \"may be\" *(podr\u00e1 ser)* in Article 8(2) of the BIT is taken out of context and does not mean that recourse to domestic courts is discretionary. To the contrary, a contextual reading of Article 8(2) of the BIT indicates that it does not contain options but a mandatory precondition requiring recourse to local courts of the host States, as second step, prior to the submission to international arbitration.\n\n116.\n\nFor the Respondent, the only circumstance in which submission to local courts would not be necessary is that the Parties have agreed to disregard this step, which is not the case with the instant dispute. Failing that agreement recourse to local courts constitutes a jurisdictional precondition as already explained in this Opinion. International tribunals would have found that the absence of imperative language does not equal to the absence of a mandatory requirement, or mean that the treaty language can be ignored. Furthermore, Respondent affirms that the dispute filed with domestic courts cannot be different from the one submitted to international arbitration and that the term \"dispute\" in Article 8 is not broad enough to permit unrestricted access to ICSID jurisdiction, while rejecting Claimants' arguments that there were not competent courts and administrative authorities in Argentina to address their grievance and that submission to Argentine courts would have been futile within the limited span of 18 months established in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n117.\n\nClaimants contend that they fulfilled their obligation under Article 8(2) of the BIT to submit the dispute to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Province of Salta (Argentina). They assert that ENJASA's recourse for reconsideration of ENREJA Resolution N\u00b0 240/13 was a recourse to the competent administrative jurisdiction, underlining in that context that unlike most other BITs of Argentina and Austria the BIT applicable to the present case specifically refers not only to \"competent judicial jurisdiction\" but also to the \"competent administrative jurisdiction\". Claimants assert likewise that they were not required to wait for six months before submitting the dispute to domestic authorities, as provided for under Article 8(2) of the BIT, because the recourse for reconsideration under domestic law had to be introduce within 15 days and, in such circumstances, the consultation waiting period cannot be a mandatory waiting period of six months.\n\n118.\n\nA further assertion of Claimants was that the domestic administrative issues are the same as those raised in the present ICSID arbitration and, consequently, it would follow that the dispute in domestic administrative proceedings would be the same dispute as the one pending before the present ICSID Arbitral Tribunal. In their view it would be contrary to the text, context and object and purpose of Article 8 of the BIT that the scope of the term \"dispute\" in the Article be construed as narrowly as proposed by the Respondent. According to the Claimants Article 8 would not require that the dispute submitted to the domestic administrative or judicial authorities be *identical* as the one before this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal. All that Article 8 of the BIT would require is, for Claimants, that \"the pleaded facts are substantially similar and concern the same protected investment\" (Claimants' PHB, para. 258).\n\n119.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue further that they have also complied with Article 8(3) of the BIT which provides that the investor may proceed to international arbitration either if no decision on the merits has been reached by domestic courts within 18 months as stipulated Article 8(3)(a), or once a decision on the merits was rendered but the dispute persists as stipulated in Article 3(b).\n\n120.\n\nThis latter alternative, in Claimants' view, happened with ENREJA Resolution N\u00b0. 315/13 which would be a decision on the merits on ENJASA's recourse for reconsideration of Resolution N\u00b0 240/13 even if it could still be appealed before a higher administrative authority (recourse of *\"alzada\").* The notion of a \"decision on merits\" and a \"final decision\" should not be equated, the latter being a decision without appeal. Claimants contend also that \"the dispute\" arose with the passing of ENREJA's Resolution N\u00b0 240/13, not with the adoption of its Resolution N\u00b0 315/13.\n\n121.\n\nIn the face of Claimants' *totum revolutom* approach on the interpretation and application of the precondition of Article 8(2) and (3)(a) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, this arbitrator considers it a necessity - since the outset of the consideration of this prior-recourse to competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State for 18 months - to recall first the well-established distinction in international investment law between *\"contract claims\"* and *\"treaty claims\"* and secondly that if - as admitted by the majority Decision - the present ICSID case is a *\"treaty claims dispute\"*, *it must be so all along and in all respects* and not only with regard to the Respondent's First Preliminary Objection in order to overcome the forum selection clause of the Bidding Terms of the license.\n\n122.\n\nIt is necessary to deal with the said distinction for objective as well subjective reasons. Concerning the objective ones, Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT states explicitly that it applies with regard to investment disputes between an investor of one of the Contracting States and the other Contracting State concerning any subject- matter governed by this Agreement *(Toda controversia relativa a las inversiones entre un inversor de una de las Partes Contratantes y la otra Parte Contratante sobre las materias regidas por el presente Convenio),* not further or otherwise.\n\n123.\n\nAs to the subjective reasons, paragraph (1) of Claimants' Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Argentina of 4 December 2014 cannot be clearer. The Request is made in accordance with Article 36(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention, Article 2 of ICSID Institution Rules and Article 8 of Argentina-Austria BIT of 7 August 1992. No doubt therefore that the Claimants' Request for Arbitration itself excludes altogether domestic contract disputes or claims - as the ones between ENJASA and ENREJA or between ENJASA and the Province of Salta - from the subject-matter of the present ICSID arbitration case as defined by Claimants themselves.\n\n124.\n\nHaving clarified that the subject-matter of the instant ICSID arbitration dispute between CAI and CASAG and the Republic of Argentina is *\"treaty claims dispute\" -* and no \"umbrella clause\" having been alleged or otherwise invoked in this jurisdictional phase by Claimants - this arbitrator in his consideration of the second jurisdictional precondition of Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT will apply the interpretation and application rules of the VCLT and other relevant principles and rules of international law applicable in the relations between Austria and Argentina without losing sight of the differentiation between a *\"treaty claims dispute\"* and a *\"contract claims dispute\"* object of particular doctrinal attention (see, for example, James Crawford, *Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration,* Arbitration International, (Kluwer Law International 2008, Volume 24, issue 3 pp. 351-374).\n\n125.\n\nInvestment arbitration case-law has also taken the above distinction duly into account, as in the following passages of the *Abaclat and others v. Argentina* Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility:\n\n\"It is in principle admitted that with respect to a BIT claim an arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction where the claim at stake is a pure contract claim. This is because a BIT is not meant to correct or replace contractual remedies, and in particular it is not meant to serve as a substitute to judicial or arbitral proceedings arising from contract claims. Within the context of claims arising from a contractual relationship, the tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to BIT claims is in principle only given where, in addition to the alleged breach of contract, the Host State further breaches obligations it undertook under a relevant treaty. Pure contract claims must be brought before the competent organ, which derives its jurisdiction from the contract, and such organ - be it a court or an arbitral tribunal - can and must hear the claim in its entirety and decide thereon based on the contract only\" (Decision of 4 August 2011, para. 316) (CL-131).\n\n126.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties, as shown above in paragraphs 116 to 118 of this Opinion, are in disagreement on the question of whether or not under of the Argentina-Austria BIT the \"dispute\" submitted to the international arbitral body must be rather the same or covered substantially the same dispute as the one submitted beforehand to the local courts pursuant to Article 8(2) and (3) of the present BIT (obligation constituted by both *ratione fori* and *ratione temporis* elements). Respondent relies mainly on the conclusion of the *Wintershall* Tribunal to the effect that in the corresponding Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT the 18 months rule was premised on the submission of the entire dispute for resolution to the local courts and also in statements of other investment arbitration tribunals (for example, by the Tribunal in *Omer Dede and Serdar Elhuseyni v. Romania*).\n\n127.\n\nThe *Urbaser v. Argentina* tribunal observed rightly that in *Wintershall the* Arbitral Tribunal's emphasis was placed on the notion of a \"same *dispute*\" or on \"*dispute* coextensive\" with the dispute under the BIT:\n\n\"The key concept in Article X of the BIT [Argentina/Germany BIT] is the \u2018dispute', not the relief requested. There is no indication whatsoever that the investor should not be entitled to present its dispute \u2018in full' before a domestic court. The *Wintershall* Tribunal therefore correctly noted that the 18 month[s] rule is premised on the submission of \u2018the entire dispute for resolution in local courts'.\n\n\u2026\n\n\"The claim before the local courts must be \u2018coextensive' with a dispute relating to investments made under the BIT. The nature of the \"dispute\" brought before domestic courts may be broad. The objective of the judicial filing is indeed to provide the domestic court with an opportunity to fashion a suitable remedy that may obviate international arbitration. For such a result to be reached, it is not necessary for the domestic court to adjudicate the claim within the framework of the BIT. What is required, however, is that the cause of action to be adjudicated at the domestic level be of such a nature as to allow for the resolution of the dispute to the same extent as if the claim had been brought before an international arbitration under the BIT. As the *Wintershall* tribunal stated, it must be possible to bring the \u2018entire dispute' before the competent local court\" (*Urbaser v. Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 19 December 2012, paras. 180-181) (AL RA 41).\n\n128.\n\nClaimants are of a different view. They contend that Respondent's position on the scope of the term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT was too narrow and argue in favour of what they define as a \"broad\" meaning or understanding of the term in question in the context of Article 8, invoking in that regard the decisions of *Teinver v. Argentina* Tribunal (2012) and *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* Tribunal (2013). Furthermore, Claimants submitted that contention as if the proposition would be one of general application. However, they reached the said conclusion without applying either the VCLT rules on interpretation of treaties or any other rules or principles of law in support of the contention. In my opinion, this Claimants' contention is erroneous and, consequently, not acceptable for this arbitrator, in addition to being a misrepresentation of *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* to affirm that its conclusions are susceptible of application to the legal and factual circumstances of the present case.\n\n129.\n\nThe conclusions of *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* differ from those of *Wintershall* by the simple reason that the dispute resolution clauses of the Argentina-Spain BIT and of the Switzerland-Uruguay BIT have quite different wordings than the wording of the corresponding clause in Argentina-Germany BIT, but the three tribunals applied the same principle, namely that the dispute resolution clause of the BIT applicable to the case concerned must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of the VCLT *.* The three tribunals respected therefore the intention of the Contracting States as reflected in the respective texts of each of those three BITs. A conclusion that is far from being true as regards the present majority Decision which in approaching the question of the meaning \"dispute\" *(* \"*controversia*\" *)* - term which appears in the first fives and in the last paragraphs of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT - disregards the \"context\" represented by the wording of Article 8 as a whole in the interpretation of said term.\n\n130.\n\nThe verification of the above conclusions may be done very easily by a comparison between the text of the relevant paragraphs of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT (quoted in paragraph 13 of the present Opinion) and the texts of the corresponding paragraphs of the dispute settlement clauses of the BITs applicable in the *Teinver* (Argentina-Spain BIT) and *Philip Morris* (Switzerland-Uruguay BIT) cases:\n\nArgentina-Spain BIT (Requirements in Article 10(1) and (2))\n\n\"1. Disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If a dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months as from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in whose territory the investment was made.\" (*Teinver v. Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 December 2012, para. 74) (CL-137).\n\nSwitzerland-Uruguay BIT (Requirements in Article 10(1) and (2)\n\n\"1. Disputes with respect to investments within the meaning of this Agreement between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties concerned.\n\n2. If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph (1) cannot be settled within a period of six months after it was raised, the dispute shall, upon request of either party to the dispute, be submitted to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made. If within a period of 18 months after the proceedings have been instituted no judgment has been passed, the investor concerned may appeal to an arbitral tribunal which decides on the dispute in all its aspects.\" (*Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013, para. 25) (CL-134).\n\n131.\n\nIt is quite clear that the scope of the term \"disputes\" (in the plural) *with respect to investments within the meaning of the BIT* in the settlement resolution clauses of the BITs applied in *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* is broader than term \"dispute\" (in the singular) *on any subject matter governed by the BIT* of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. In *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* the term \"disputes\" may encompass, for example, more than one dispute and left open the door to different degrees of similarity or resemblance between them. The problem for arbitral tribunals in the case of these BITs is to determine the test for determining the relationship which must exists between the two or more of the disputes concerned.\n\n132.\n\nThus, the *Teinver* Tribunal referred to a domestic litigation suit and an international arbitration suit as *having* in casu *the same subject-matter* and that *the goal* of both suits was to make the Claimants' \"whole for the economic loss suffered as a result of the nationalization\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 December 2012, para. 132) (CL-137) and further that the BIT \"permits either party to initiate local court proceedings for purposes of Article X.\" (*Ibid*., para. 134) In the *Philip Morris* case, Article 10(1) of the BIT referred to \"disputes with respect to investments\" and other provisions of the same article referred also to \"disputes\" in the plural. The Tribunal expressly stated that account must be taken of the plural of dispute (Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013, para. 100) (CL-134).\n\n133.\n\nThe *Philip Morris* Tribunal had to decide whether Claimants had failed to satisfy the 18 months domestic litigation requirement of Article 10(2) of the Switzerland - Uruguay BIT on the following grounds: (i) Claimants failed to litigate their treaty dispute in Uruguayan courts and (ii) Even if they had submitted the dispute to Uruguayan courts, Claimants were required to have litigated for 18 months before initiating arbitration. The tribunal rejected both preliminary objections on the following grounds:\n\n*First ground*\n\n\"... by submitting their domestic law claim through the Requests for Annulment filed with the TCA to the Uruguayan Courts the Claimants satisfied the domestic litigation requirement under Article 10(2) of the BIT. The term \u2018disputes', as used in Article 10(2), is to be interpreted broadly as concerning the subject matter and facts at issue and not as limited to particular legal claims, including specifically BIT claims. The dispute before domestic courts under Article 10(2) does not need to have the same legal basis or cause of action as the dispute brought in the subsequent arbitration, provided that both disputes involve substantially similar facts and relate to investments as this term is defined by the BIT.\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 July 2013, para. 113) (CL-134);\n\n*Second ground*\n\n\"The domestic litigation requirement had not been satisfied at the time this arbitration was instituted. The present case differs from the other cases where jurisdiction has been denied due to the absence either of a dispute expressed in legal terms or of any actions by the investor to address its claims to the domestic court before resorting to arbitration. Nonetheless, even if the requirement were regarded as jurisdictional, the Tribunal concludes that it could be, and was, satisfied by actions occurring after the date the arbitration was instituted. The Tribunal notes that the ICJ's decisions show that the rule that events subsequent to the institution of legal proceedings are to be disregarded for jurisdictional purposes has not prevented that Court from accepting jurisdiction where requirements for jurisdiction that were not met at the time of instituting the proceedings were met subsequently (at least where they occurred before the date on which a decision on jurisdiction is to be taken).\" *(Ibid.,* para 144).\n\n134.\n\nThe considerations and quotations above show beyond any doubt that the legal and factual circumstances of *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* are quite different from those of the present case *.* But, in those two cases, like in *Wintershall,* the determinative factor to define the meaning and scope of the term \"dispute\" or \"disputes\", as the case may, be in the disputesettlement-clause has been the intention of the Contracting States of the BIT as reflected in the wording given by them to the corresponding dispute-settlement-clause of the applicable BIT interpreted and applied in accordance with relevant rules of the VCLT and, eventually, with other relevant rules of public international law as well.\n\n135.\n\nThe dispute-settlement-clauses in *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* were broad enough to include more than one kind of dispute on investments extending, for example, the meaning and scope of the term \"disputes\" beyond treatybased disputes, or including contract disputes not involving treaty breaches, or disputes regarding domestic law claims in addition to treaty claims, etc. In all those situations, two or more different disputes *may fall within the scope of the clause* and the problem becomes the question of the relationship between the disputes concerned, solved in the case law most frequently by reference to notions such as the \"subject-matter\" or \"object and purpose\" of both disputes or its respective \"cause of action\", or a much less frequent case, by reference to the notion of \"substantially similar facts\" or to a combination of these criteria.\n\n136.\n\nBut, the above situation is alien to the present case because the meaning and scope of the term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT refers exclusively to a \"single dispute\" and to a \"treaty (BIT) claims dispute\" all along the successive paragraphs of Article 8 and, furthermore, in the present case the conditions and requirements of Article 8 were not been satisfied by Claimants not only on 4 December 2014 when they instituted the case but also on the date of issuance of the present Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n137.\n\nIt follows from the above that in the present ICSID arbitration the formula adopted by Argentina and Austria in the text of Article 8 of their BIT is determinative for ascertaining the meaning and scope of the term \"dispute\" in that provision. Then, that formula follows *mutatis mutandis* the corresponding clause of the Argentina-Germany BIT *(Wintrshall)* and some other like BITs concluded by Argentina (for example, with the United Kingdom) and by no means the broader formulas of the term \"disputes\" used the Argentina-Spain BIT *(Teinver)* or in the Switzerland-Uruguay BIT *(Philip Morris)*.\n\n138.\n\nIt is fort that reason that the *Wintershall* Tribunal's conclusions on the meaning and scope of the term \"dispute\" in the dispute-settlement- clause of the Argentina-Germany BIT are essentially similar to the conclusions of this arbitrator regarding the meaning and scope of that term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, namely that the term refers all along the paragraphs of the Article to *one and the same treaty claims dispute* and not further or otherwise. The text of Article 8 of the applicable BIT does not allow, if interpreted in accordance with the rules on interpretation of treaties of the VCLT, to reach a different conclusion with respect of the intentions of Argentina and Austria when in 1992 they formulated and adopted the text of Article 8 of their BIT.\n\n139.\n\nThe same applies regarding the mandatory nature of the precondition to international arbitration of Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, explained in the *Wintershall* award with reference to Article 10(2) of the Argentina-Germany BIT, as follows:\n\n\"Article 10(2) [Article 8(2) in the present case] contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to-local-courts-clause, which mandates (not merely permits) litigation by the investor (for a definitive period) in the domestic forum - which both Contracting Parties have considered to be an appropriate judicial body. It does not mention what relief should be sought in the domestic courts, nor does it require that it should be the same or similar relief to that sought in international arbitration. Whatever may have been the object in contemplation of the Contracting States when the Argentina-Germany BIT [Argentina-Austria in the present case] was agreed to and adopted, (and there is no evidence of this in the present case apart from the text of the treaty - i.e. the BIT) it does definitely indicate a compulsion to comply -(not, as erroneously stated in paragraph 95 of Claimant's CounterMemorial on Preliminary Objection of Jurisdiction a mere \u2018option' to comply).\" (*Wintershall v. Argentina*, Award of 8 December 2008, para. 118) (AL RA 38).\n\n140.\n\nIn the light of the above conclusions, in the present case the question raised by Claimants' contention of the broadness of term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT has to be answered with the framework of a single \"treaty claims dispute\" as prescribed in the very text of Article 8. There is not room in the Article either for more than one \"treaty claims dispute\" or for any kind of \"contract claims disputes\".\n\n141.\n\nPlaced within that appropriate frame, this second aspect of the Claimants' \"broad scope argument\" appears to be a proposition without limitations. Everything fitting Claimants' propositions will fall within the scope of the present \"treaty claims dispute\". It is indeed a contention which, as presented, appears out of control by the applicable law to the point of making a caricature of the very *notion of \"dispute\"* defined in public international law by reference to the three classic elements of *parties, petitum* and *causa petendi,* the two last ones (*petitum* and *causa petendi)* defining the *subject-matter* of the dispute.\n\n142.\n\nI feel the need to recall the criteria which define in law the term \"dispute\" - *which is the term subject to interpretation* in Article 8 of the BIT and not any other gratuitously extrapolating therein like, for instance, \"claims\" \"relief\" or \"facts\" (see *Urbaser* in paragraph 127 of this Opinion) - because of the following contradictory and amazing conclusion of the majority:\n\n\"In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that ENJASA's Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 complied with the need to have recourse to domestic remedies under Article 8(3) of the BIT. This recourse has also been submitted after amicable consultations had been initiated with the meeting of Mr. Tucek with representatives of the Province of Salta of 27 August 2013 and pursued in subsequent meetings. Since this recourse has now been pending for more than 18 months without a decision on the merits, the Tribunal finds that it can exercise its jurisdiction in the present case and proceed to the merits.\" (present Decision, para. 328).\n\n143.\n\nI do not find any kind of support in the elements of law and fact of the case before this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal for such a rigmarole conclusion of the majority in which on the basis of alleged \"substantially similar facts\" between selected proceedings of the \"contract claims dispute\" case going on in Salta since 2013, and being since 5 February 2014 before the First Instance Court of Salta because an ENJASA's request for annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions 240 and 315 and Decrees of the Province thereto *(ENJASA v. Province of Salta* dispute *),* and the present international \"treaty claims dispute\" before this Arbitral Tribunal on compensation for damages for alleged breaches by the Argentine Republic of certain standards of the Argentina - Austria BIT pursuant to CAI and CASAG' Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014 filed with ICSID on 4 December 2014 *.* By so doing the majority admits the fact that the \"treaty claims dispute\" before the Arbitral Tribunal has never been submitted to an administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic. Then, the provision in Article 8(2) and (3)(a) of the Argentina-Austria BIT is premised on the prior submission of the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal to the competent domestic jurisdiction of the host State of the investment. What counts under the Argentina-Austria BIT is not the \"similarity of facts\", as could be under other BITs, but the identity of the dispute, the present \"treaty claims dispute\" in the instant case.\n\n144.\n\nThe quoted paragraph of the Decision is contradictory with itself because in order to reject Respondent's First Preliminary Objection the present case is a \"treaty claims dispute\" while now to reject Respondent' Second Preliminary Objection it extrapolates to the proceeding of present treaty claims dispute the domestic judicial proceeding going on in the First Instance Court of Salta, and this Arbitral Tribunal is without competence for any dispute on \"contract claims\". And it is an amazing conclusion that does not find justification in the law and facts of the case, it is in breach of the VCLT rules on interpretation of treaties and it is a backward decision with respect to the clarification of the distinction which must be made between compliance with international law and compliance with domestic law as explained in the *Vivendi Annulment* decision and, before, as advised by the ICJ in the following passage of the *Elettronica Sicula* case:\n\n\"Compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.\" *(Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A., ICJ Reports 1989,* p. 51, para. 73) (AL RA 193).\n\n145.\n\nMoreover, for the determinations to be made by this Arbitral Tribunal at the present phase of the case the facts relevant are those concerning Claimants' conduct with respect to their compliance or not with Article 8(1) to (4) of the BIT and not the behaviour, whatever it may be, of ENJASA in local judicial proceedings relating to the contract claims of its dispute with the Salta Province concerning certain Resolution adopted by ENREJA as *ente regulador* of the market concerned. The dispute with the Province of Salta is not subject in any respect to the conditions and requirements of the BIT and/or the systemic rule of public international law of State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals.\n\n146.\n\nENJASA is litigating under the domestic legislation of the Salta Province, while in the present phase of this ICSID arbitral proceedings the existence of jurisdiction and competence requires the concurrence of (i) a treaty as the Argentina-Austria BIT and (ii) an \"arbitral agreement\" executed by the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute, namely CAI and CASAG as Claimants and the Argentine Republic as Respondent. Then, in none of these legal instruments there is a place for ENJASA and its domestic proceedings in the Salta Province in this phase of the case. The criteria of \"substantially similar facts\" is also irrelevant in the present \"treaty claims dispute\" in which the core issue is the interpretation of the term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT with reference to a single treaty claim dispute as per Claimants' Request for Arbitration. Even in the hypothesis of being in need of determining the relationship between two disputes, as in *Philip Morris*, the criteria of \"substantially similar facts\" was not alone. It was preceded by a reference to the \"subject-matter\" of both disputes and followed by the words applicable also to both disputes that the facts concerned be \"related to investments as the term is defined in the BIT\" applicable (see paragraphs 133 of the present Opinion).\n\n147.\n\nThe subject-matter of the present ICSID arbitration proceeding is not similar in any respect to the subject-matter of Salta domestic proceeding, and extrapolation of events from the latter to the former in matters of jurisdiction and competence appears a wavering move without grounds either in international law or in the logic of international judicial proceedings and questioning the *integrity* of both judicial proceedings. The subject-matter of the present ICSID international arbitration is compensation for alleged breaches by the Argentine Republic of three material treaty standards (expropriation, fair and equitable treatment and discrimination) of its BIT with Austria, while the subject-matter of the dispute going on in the domestic court of Salta Province is the annulment of certain Resolutions adopted by *ENREJA* by alleging breaches of the domestic provincial applicable law adopted in the exercise of its regulatory functions and related decrees of the Government of the Province. In any case, these subject-matters of each of these judicial proceedings are quite different from each other to the point as appearing as being mutually incompatibly, underlying thereby the premature filing of the Request for Arbitration on 4 December 2014.\n\n148.\n\nLast but not least, the conclusion of the majority based upon what I consider to be an oxymoron denies in fact the Arbitral Tribunal's limited competence as established by the text of Article 8(1) to (5) of the BIT (see paragraphs 121-125 of the present Opinion). It is clear according to these texts of those provisions that the present Arbitral Tribunal has no competence over pure contract claims and ENJASA's domestic proceedings going on in the Salta Province relate to pure contract claims. A good reason indeed to avoid interfering as done by the majority Decision *to avoid concluding with the proven fact* of Claimants' non-compliance with the precondition of submission of the instant \"treaty claims dispute\" to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State for a term of eighteen months, as provided for in Article 8(2) and (3) (a) of the Argentina/Austria BIT, and *replacing* it without any support in the applicable law and the facts of the case by the proceedings on ENJASA's request for annulment of the said ENREJA's Resolutions going on since 5 February 2014 in the First Instance Court of Salta. An *ultra vires* approach indeed.\n\n149.\n\nFor the this arbitrator, Claimants have obviously not complied with the prior condition of international arbitration of submitting the *present treaty claims dispute* (the only one before this Arbitral Tribunal) to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic, in its condition of host State, for a term of eighteen months simply by reasons of convenience and, in any case whatever the reason or reasons, it is a proven matter of fact that *such an event never took place* as commanded by Article 8 (2) and (3) (a) of the BIT. In the case of this precondition of Article 8 (as in the case of the others considered before) Claimants failed to conduct themselves as provided for in Article 8 of the Argentina -Austria BIT in order to be entitled *thereafter* to have access to ICSID international arbitration.\n\n150.\n\nHowever, Claimants have been authorized by the majority Decision \"to proceed to the merits\" and that happened in spite that Claimants as third parties to the BIT are holding under it secondary rights only. Thus, the fundamental *pacta sunt servanda* rule prompted me to ask myself the question: how is it possible? I guess that by a series of subjective or free interpretations which put aside altogether not only the texts of the prescriptions provided for in the dispute- settlement-system of Article 8 of the BIT and the relevant rules of the ICSID Convention, but also the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) itself, notwithstanding that, in addition to enouncing codified international law on the subject, it is a Convention to which both Argentina and Austria are Parties. The outcome of this lacuna is a kind of hodgepodge which does not fit in with Article 8 of the BIT, the VCLT and other rules of the public international law applicable in this phase of the case.\n\n151.\n\nFurthermore, the majority Decision following the way of pleading of Claimants qualified Respondent's contentions on the duty of protected investors to comply with Article 8 of the BIT as adopted by Argentina and Austria with names such as \"strict reading\", \"overly formalistic\", \"slavishly compliance\", \"unfairly\", \"stall or cause delay\", \"increase the costs\", etc. to such an extent that sometimes the motives of the Decision look like the plea of a party. Another way that the Decision excuses Claimants' non-compliances used and abused in the motives is by selfdefining the object and purpose of the BIT provision concerned by presuming that States adopt BITs for the sole benefit of the protected investors and that investors' interest or convenience should be the prevailing guidance, if not the only one, for the interpreter, without regard for *pacta sunt servanda* and the law of treaties and/or other rules of international law such as the rule of State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals.\n\n152.\n\nIn the light of the considerations and conclusion above on the applicable law and evidence submitted by the Parties, I dissent from all the core conclusions of the majority in paragraphs 296 to 328 of the present Decision. Here, the *totum revolutum* approach of Claimants, assumed by the majority Decision, with its mix-up of everything - including the proceedings of the *\"contract claims dispute\"* between ENJASA and the Province of Salta and the proceedings on the instant *\"treaty claims dispute\"* between CAI and CASAG as Claimants and the Argentine Republic as Respondent - reaches indeed in the case of the present precondition its climax, in detriment of the integrity of the Argentina -Austria BIT, the rules of public international law applicable and the preservation of legal security in the relation between protected investors and host States.\n\n153.\n\nThe annulment proceeding of ENREJA's Resolutions instituted by ENJASA before the First Instance Court of Salta would retroactively mean for the majority Decision compliance by CAI and CASAG with the their obligation under Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT (prior submission of the present treaty dispute to the domestic competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction for a term of 18 months), in the same way that the exchanges at the meeting held on 27 August 2013 of Mr. Tucek with representatives of the Government of the Province and of ENREJA would retroactively mean compliance of CAI and CASAG with their obligation under Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT (prior amicable consultations on the present treaty dispute for a term of six months).\n\n154.\n\nThe motives of my rejection of the individual conclusions of the majority Decision in the said paragraphs 296-328 are given below selectively and in summary form:\n\n*1. The notion of dispute in* *Article 8 of the Argentina/Austria BIT*\n\n(i) That for determining Claimants' compliance with the precondition of having recourse to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host State provided for in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT it would be necessary for the Tribunal in the instant case to address first the nature of one or the other of domestic recourses instituted under the law of the Salta Province by ENJASA against the revocation of its license by ENREJA. *Irrelevant.*\n\n(ii) To affirm as a general proposition that the recourse to the domestic jurisdictions of Article 8(3) of the BIT cannot be understood narrowly in the sense that the domestic dispute or disputes and the dispute submitted to ICSID arbitration be identical (in parties and cause of action), because it would hardly be in line with the object and purpose of BITs. *Wrong under the present Argentina -Austria BIT.*\n\n(iii) To affirm as a general proposition that investment treaty tribunals have generally adopted a broader notion of dispute for the purpose of determining whether domestic-remedies-first in investment treaties have been complied with. *Wrong, depending on the text of the dispute-settlement-clause of the applicable BIT.*\n\n(iv) To suggest that the quoted passages of the *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* decisions on jurisdiction would endorse a broad notion of dispute in the matter as a kind of rule or guidance of general application by investments tribunal. And that the fact that Article 8 (2) provides that the dispute in question may be \"submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\" would support a broad notion of the term dispute. *Wrong because the text of the disputesettlement-clauses of the Argentina-Spain BIT and Switzerland-Uruguay BIT differ from the text of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT and, because the alternative \"administrative\" or \"judicial\" jurisdiction is irrelevant to the interpretation of the term \u2018dispute' in Article 8 of the BIT.*\n\n(v) To affirm, on the basis of the *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* conclusions, that the domestic recourses by ENJASA under Salta law against the revocation of the license or the annulment of ENREJA's decisions are able to fulfill the domestic-remedy-recourse of Article 8 of the Argentina/Austria BIT. And that the so-called narrow reading of the notion of dispute would be incompatible with a good faith reading of Article 8(2) and 8(3) of the BIT under the interpretation rules of the VCLT. *Wrong inter alia because Article 8 of the present BIT limits the competence of this Arbitral Tribunal to \"treaty claims disputes\" exclusively and because a good faith reading of Article 8(2) and (3) commands to respect the text of the applicable treaty provision concerned*\n\n*2. Compliance with Article 8(2) of the BIT*\n\n(vi) The affirmation that for the determinations to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal in the present phase of the case the question arises as to which one, if any, of ENJASA's recourses pursuant to the laws of the Salta Province complied with Article 8(2) of the BIT. *Irrelevant.*\n\n(vii) That the different conclusions reached by the majority to the effect that the \"recourse for reconsideration ENJASA submitted against Resolution N\u00b0. 240/13 to ENREJA\" which would not meet the requirement that the dispute must have been submitted to an \u2018administrative jurisdiction' in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT (which I accept), while \u2018the recourse for annulment initiated by ENJASA on 5 February 2014 of ENREJA Resolutions N\u00b0 240/13 and 315/13 with the First Instance Court of Salta qualifies as a recourse to domestic courts as required by Article 8(2) of the BIT are relevant in the case for the determination by the Arbitral Tribunal of it jurisdiction. *Both hypotheses irrelevant*\n\n(viii) The qualification of the temporal element of six months period of the \"amicable consultations obligation\" in Article 8(2) as a \"waiting period\" which cannot be complied with \"slavishly\" before going to the second prior condition of \"competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\" of the host State. *Wrong, as it is contrary to the text of the provision.*\n\n(ix) The affirmation that the recourse to the \"amicable consultations obligation\" being qualified by the words \"as far as possible\" means that the parties can only be expected to exhaust the negotiations period of six months to the extent this is feasible *Wrong as it is contrary to the text of the provision.*\n\n(x) That any other construction would create contradictions between Article 8(1) and Article 8(2) of the BIT and, at the same time, suggest replacing in the process of interpretation the notion of \"dispute\" by the notion of the \"investment\" and making wider the object of the required negotiations *. Wrong, the alleged contradiction is self-induced, the object of the interpretation is the term \"dispute\" and the object of the required negotiations is the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal.*\n\n(xi) That in the light of the time-limits and other requirements of ENJASA's local proceedings challenging the revocation of the license, no breach of the negotiation period in article 8(2) of the BIT has occurred. *Wrong because time-limits and requirements of the Salta local proceeding are irrelevant for the interpretation and application of Article 8 of the BIT.*\n\n*3. Compliance with the 18 months requirement in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT*\n\n(xii) That whether the non-compliance with the 18 months requirement at the time of initiating the ICSID arbitration may make Claimants' claims inadmissible under Article 8(3) of the BIT. *Irrelevant because the 18 months requirement is part and parcel of a jurisdictional precondition and not a cause of inadmissibility.*\n\n(xiii) That Claimants have complied with the temporal element of the prior obligation of submitting the dispute to the competent administrative o judicial jurisdiction of the host State because by now (May 2018) 18 months have passed since 5 February 2014 when ENJASA submitted its claim for annulment to the courts of Salta. *Wrong because ENJASA's domestic courts proceeding is irrelevant for the interpretation and application of the 18 months term of Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.*\n\n(xiv) That requiring that 18 months must have passed before international arbitration is initiated is overly formalistic and not in line with the object and purpose of the domestic-remedies-first requirement as contained in Article 8(3) of the BIT and, furthermore, the allegation that because the dispute may be submitted to international arbitration \"whenever\" they have agree to do so (Article 8 (3) (c)) it must also, *mutatis mutandis,* be irrelevant for purposes of timing of seisin under Article 8 (3) *Wrong because it is contrary to the text of Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT and because under that provision of the BIT the parties are not acting pursuant to a particular agreement directly concluded by the parties to the dispute concerned*.\n\n(xv) That the purpose of a domestic-remedies-first requirement is not to stall or to cause delay, nor to increase the costs for the investors by requiring them to pursue domestic remedies first. *Quite irrelevant for the interpretation and application of Article 8 of the BIT.*\n\n(xvi) That to insist on strict compliance would be an exaggerated formalism that is incompatible with the fair administration of international justice and the principle of good faith in aiming to settle international disputes. *Quite irrelevant for the interpretation and application of Article 8 of the BIT.*\n\n(xvii) That strict insistence on the 18 months term would no longer at present prevent Claimants from reinitiating an identical arbitration without facing jurisdictional obstructions because of the 18 months requirement from Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT. *Irrelevant. Claimants did not comply with that term before or after instituting the present case because they never complied with the precondition to which the term refers.*\n\n(xviii) That the quoted conclusions of *Teinver v. Argentina* and *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* are applicable in the circumstances of the present case and with the same effect. *Wrong, because those conclusions do not correspond to the prescriptions of the BIT applicable in the present case.*\n\n(xix) That ENJASA's recourse to annul Resolutions N\u00b0 240/13 and N\u00b0 315/13 submitted to the domestic courts of Salta concerned \"substantially similar facts\" as the dispute instituted by Claimants before the Arbitral Tribunal and fulfils the temporal element of domestic-remedies-first requirement in Article 8 (3) of the BIT and, therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction in the case to proceed to the merits. *Quite wrong because Article 8 of Argentina-Austria BIT refers in all its paragraphs to a \"single treaty dispute\", not to two or more disputes eventually of different kinds, as does the majority Decision.*\n\n155.\n\nIn sum, I reject the majority Decision's conclusions on this precondition to international arbitration - set forth in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT - and conclude that the Claimants failed to comply with that jurisdictional obligation for the following seven resumed core reasons:\n\n(i) Because Claimants did not try to solve the present \"treaty dispute\" after trying \"amicable consultation\" as provided for in the sequential dispute settlement system of Article 8 of the BIT;\n\n(ii) Because Claimants has never submitted the present \"treaty dispute\" to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic as prescribed by Article 8(2) and (3) (a) of the BIT;\n\n(iii) Because Claimants' contention that they have complied with the present precondition because of the filing by ENJASA on 5 February 2014 before the First Instance Court of Salta of a request for annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions N\u00b0 240/13 and N\u00b0315/13 and related Decrees is rejected by this arbitrator on the ground that these domestic judicial proceedings relate to \"contract claims\" alien to the subject-matter of the \"treaty dispute\" before this Arbitral Tribunal (Article 8(1) of the BIT) and, furthermore, the scope of the Tribunal's competence defined by the BIT does not encompass \"contract disputes\" and, still further, the competence over these contract dispute belongs, according to the forum-selection-clause applicable, to the local courts of Salta;\n\n(iv) Because Claimants' invocation of the conclusions in *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* in the present case is out of place in the light of the wording of the dispute-settlement-clauses of the BITs applicable to these cases that refer to \"disputes\" in the plural, while Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, like the Argentina - Germany BIT of *Wintershall*, is premised on a single \"treaty dispute\" to be submitted for resolution in local courts, as well as on the submission that the claims before the local courts should be coextensive with the \"treaty dispute\" for breaches of the Argentina - Austria BIT. Consequently, the issue of the relationship between two disputes posed to the *Teinver* and *Philip Morris* Tribunals by the wording of their respective BITs is alien to the present ICSID case;\n\n(v) Because Claimants having never submitted the present \"treaty dispute\" to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Republic of Argentina did not comply either with the eighteen months temporal term of the present precondition established in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT. It is because of that that some references in the Decision to certain jurisprudence of the ICJ is not opposable in the present case;\n\n(vi) Because Claimants have not proven that the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic to entertain the present \"treaty dispute\" between CAI and CASAG versus Argentine Republic is the First Instance Court of Salta;\n\n(vii) Because Claimants never complied with the treaty obligations set forth in Article 8(2) and (3)(a) of the BIT they are not entitled now to allege that compliance would have been futile because of the impossibility for Argentine courts to solve the present \"treaty dispute\" in 18 months, ignoring the context provided for by Article 8(3)(b), according to which even if the domestic courts rendered the decision within the 18 months, but the dispute persists, it may be submitted by the investor to international arbitration, and the arbitral tribunal's decision could render ineffective the previously adopted decision at the domestic level, notwithstanding the encompassing delays and costs incurred.\n\n**(d) The withdrawal of \"pending local judicial proceedings\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe requirement in Article 8(4) (second sentence) of the Argentina-Austria BIT is not for this arbitrator a prior jurisdictional condition to arbitration as claimed by Respondent. The reason for this conclusion is the very wording and location of the sentence within the dispute-settlement-system of the BIT. The relevant text of the provision - which echoes the \"exclusive remedy rule\" of Article 26 (first sentence) of the ICSID Convention -reads, as per the English translation agreed between the Parties, as follows: *\"As from the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, each party to the dispute shall take all the required measures to withdraw the pending judicial proceedings\".*\n\n157.\n\nIn the light of the words *\"shall take all the required measures\",* it is crystal clear that this provision enounces a requirement as binding as the preconditions set forth in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) of the BIT, but it is not a jurisdictional precondition because the obligation is not *precedent to the seisin* of the Arbitral Tribunal (see *ICJ Reports 2011(I)*, p. 124, para. 130) (the full quotation of the passage concerned is given in paragraph 35 of the present Opinion). The Parties' obligation to comply with the requirement begins only, as so stated in the text, \"as from the commencement of an arbitration proceeding\" and not before that moment. It is for this reason that the requirement does not qualified as a jurisdictional precondition. Furthermore, the Parties' discontinuance obligation established by Article 8 (4) (second sentence) concerns only *\"pending judicial proceedings\"*. Thus, the obligation applies doubtless to the pending judicial proceeding instituted on 5 February 2014 by ENJASA on the annulment of ENREJA' Resolutions on the revocation of the license which is going on since then before the First Instance Court of Salta, notwithstanding Claimants' Request for Arbitration filed on 4 December 2014 with ICSID.\n\n158.\n\nI agree therefore with the majority Decision (paragraph 331) that this requirement although binding does not relate to consent to jurisdiction but rather to the conduct of the arbitral proceeding following the institution of the case. The requirement is rather a *procedural admissibility condition* relating in the present case to Claimants' application, namely their Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014). As of this moment (March 2018), Claimants did not take any initiative aiming at complying with this admissibility condition and the judicial proceeding instituted by ENJASA on 5 February 2014 in the said Court of Salta continues to go on in breach of this admissibility requirement of the BIT and Article 26 (first sentence) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n159.\n\nFor the rest, I disagree with the manner in which the majority has handled this question. Once more, the reasoning of the Decision takes only into account alleged difficulties for the Claimants for an earlier compliance with the obligation enounced in Article 8(4) (second sentence) of the BIT, as well as in Article 26 (first sentence) of the ICSID Convention, forgotting the proven fact that the existing situation has been caused by Claimants' premature filing of their Request for Arbitration. The difficulties created for Respondent up to now (including incurred means and costs) by that premature Claimants' conduct do not appear to have been weighed by the majority on this occasion. The emphasis in the majority Decision's reasoning is clearly on the obligation of cooperation of both Parties to put an end to a situation contrary to the applicable law of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, but this should not mean in my opinion that the burden to put an end to the ongoing situation be the same for both Parties.\n\n160.\n\nFor this arbitrator, the initiative in the matter corresponds to the claimant party in this and any other similar cases, but Claimants have done nothing in this respect since the filing of their Request for Arbitration on 4 December 2014. The so-called \"risk\" for Claimants referred to in paragraph 332 of the majority Decision is not an admissible argument because ICSID arbitration is not supposed to be used as a kind of appeal chamber for domestic contract disputes and, on the other hand, the institution of ICSID arbitral proceedings is not subject to any kind of timelimits for a claimant party. They concern rather the judicial policy, strategy or conveniences of a given Party, namely elements that according to the VCLT are not interpretative elements to be taken into account in deciding how Article 8(4) (second sentence) of the BIT operates.\n\n161.\n\nMore generally, this arbitrator does not see justification for a Claimants' delay of more than two years in taking any initiative for the withdrawal of Salta's judicial proceeding. The argument concerning the disposal or nondisposal of domestic remedies and the further one relating to the outcome of the present phase are not questions to be pondered in the interpretation of the requirements enounced by the applicable objective law, namely by the dispute-settlement-cause in Article 8 of the BIT and by Article 26 (first sentence) of the ICID Convention.\n\n162.\n\nThe reference in paragraph 332 of the majority Decision to the notion of \"denial of justice\" seems to me an excess of language because nobody has prevented or prevents Claimants from their access to both the First Instance Court of Salta and to the present ICSID arbitration as they have done. If they prevailed or lost in anyone, both or none of these proceedings, is of course a different matter alien to the notion of \"denial of justice\", except in case of serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure or a decision on the merits manifestly unjust which none of the Parties has alleged with respect to any one of the two proceedings in question.\n\n163.\n\nI reject, therefore, the astonishing conclusion in the said paragraph 332 of the majority Decision that \"the obligation in Article 8(4) of the BIT to withdraw any pending domestic proceeding only arises once the present decision comes into effect\". My conclusion is just the opposite. For me, the Arbitral Tribunal should have simply suspended the present proceeding until being informed by the Parties of their compliance with the obligations in Article 8(4) (second sentence). It would have been a decision more akin to the text and spirit of the obligations concerned and have the additional advantage of avoiding gossip on \"denial of justice\".\n\n164.\n\nAs a consequence of my conclusion above, I am unable either to accept at this stage of the case the implementation measures ordered in paragraphs 333 and 335 of the majority Decision. I will only recall that the two months' time-limit given in paragraph 335 for the withdrawal of the dispute pending in the Salta courts concerns the same ENJASA's \"contractual dispute\" that the majority in paragraph 328 of the Decision takes as having been the remedy for Claimants' non-compliance with the precondition of Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n**(e) Claimants' invocation of the MFN clause in Article 3 of the BIT as an alternative base of jurisdiction in the case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nHaving determined the existence in the instant case of jurisdiction of the Centre and competence of the Arbitral Tribunal on the basis of the disputesettlement provision of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the present majority Decision did not need to enter into the question whether the MFN clause of Article 3 of the BIT may have entitled Claimants to rely on the allegedly more favourable dispute-resolution clause of Article 9(2) of the Argentina-Denmark BIT. Thus, the majority Decision did not decide the inadmissibility objection raised thereon by the Respondent.\n\n166.\n\nFor my part, I esteem that given my findings concerning the inexistence of jurisdiction and competence under Article 8 of the BIT, I have to answer in this Opinion to Claimants' jurisdictional claim concerning the applicability of the MFN clause in Article 3 of the Argentina-Austria BIT to dispute-settlement. I will do it below through some relevant systemic principles of public international law and rules on interpretation of treaties which make Claimants' argument on the MFN clause in Article 3 of the BIT unpersuasive for me because that clause is a mere \"*generally drafted MFN clause*\", and I agree with the *Plama v. Bulgaria* Tribunal that an MFN provision so drafted \"in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, *unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them*\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005, para. 223) (emphasis added).\n\n167.\n\nThat incorporation is, as a matter of fact, alien to the text of Article 3 (Treatment of Investments) of the Argentina-Austria BIT which paragraph 1 is thus reading:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall grant to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments treatment no less favorable than that which it grants to its own investors and their investments or to investors of any third State and their investments.\"\n\nThe expression \"generally drafted MFN clause\" is used in this Opinion for reasons of convenience, namely to distinguishing an MFN clause drafted generally speaking along the lines of the above quoted Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT from broad \"all matters\" or \"any matter\" language MFN clauses in some other BITs and MFN clauses which provide expressly, clearly and unambiguously, that the Contracting States intended that the scope of the clause encompasses dispute-settlement (as, for example, in some UK Model BIT and practice).\n\n168.\n\nFurthermore, there are not traces in the whole Argentina-Austria BIT showing that the Contracting States intended to incorporate dispute settlement provisions of another treaty when they negotiated and drafted the BIT, Articles 3 and 8 included, and the Parties have not provided the Arbitral Tribunal with evidence or information to the contrary. Then, as declared by the ICJ on several occasions, a State's consent to jurisdiction must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal *whatever the form of its manifestation or the title or base of jurisdiction invoked* (see, for example, *Certain Question of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, ICJ Reports 2008,* p. 204, para. 2) (AL RA 35). Under no circumstances may a State's consent to an international jurisdiction be presumed because international law does not construe a State's silence, or uncertain consent, as consent to the jurisdiction of a given international court or tribunal. The question is intimately linked with basic systemic principles and rules of *public* international law, as declared likewise by both the PCIJ and the ICJ in the following terms:\n\n\"It is well established in international law that no State can, without its consent, be compelled to submit its disputes... either to mediation or to arbitration, or to any other kind of peaceful settlement\" (*Status of Eastern Carelia,* 1923, PCIJ, Series B, N\u00b0 5, p. 27);\n\n\"The Court is not departing from the principle, which is well established in international law and accepted by its own jurisprudence as well as that of the Permanent Court of International Justice, to the effect that a State may not be compelled to submit its disputes to arbitration without its consent\" (*Ambatielos Case (Greece v. United Kingdom), ICJ Reports 1953,* p. 19) (AL RA 235).\n\n169.\n\nThe extension of the scope of application of *\"generally drafted MFN clauses\"* to dispute-settlement on the basis of an alleged presumed consent or contracting out proposition, or of other allegations disregarding the distinction between \"substantive provisions\" and \"dispute-settlement provisions\", would amount to bypassing the paramount international law rule of States' consent to jurisdiction, as declared by international jurisprudence and the best doctrine. Matters being so, those invoking the extension of the scope of application of generally drafted MFN clauses in BITs to dispute-settlement should provide a reasonable legal explanation of how this phenomenon may take place in practice without disregarding the said principle because in public international law \"substantial treatment\" and \"jurisdictional treatment\" have to be distinguished from each other, the latter requiring a supplementary condition to be granted to the investor: the consent of the host State.\n\n170.\n\nClaimants did not provide that explanation. But the question remains because in international law \"substantive rights\" and \"means of dispute settlement for protecting those rights\" are different things and confusion with each other is inadmissible in the light of a distinction which is inherent to a basic systemic principle of the international legal order in force. This dichotomy prevents indeed an *ejusdem generis* relationship between these two sets of rights absent the required *substantial identity* between both. Even if access to international arbitration can broadly be considered part of \"treatment\", the investor is not entitled to have access to the two aspects of that treatment under the same conditions (see, for example, Brigitte Stern, Concurring and Dissenting Opinion in *Impregilo v. Argentina,* p. 13, para. 45).\n\n171.\n\nBetween \"substantive rights\" and \"substantive treatment\", on the one hand, and \"jurisdictional rights\" and \"jurisdictional treatment\", on the other hand, there are legal differences not only of degree but also of nature. This difference in nature manifests itself in the fact that \"jurisdictional rights\" and \"jurisdictional treatment\" require prior compliance - by virtue of the international law systemic rule of a State's consent to jurisdiction - with the *ratione voluntatis* conditions and requirements attached by the Contracting States to the standing international arbitration offer of the dispute-settlement-clause of the BIT, or likely in its MFN clause or in any clause of the BIT invoked as a dispute-resolution clause by a party to a given case. The existence of such an obligation of international law consequential to the interposition in the matter of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction explains that it is unjustified in public international law to insist in the proposition of the existence of an *ejusdem generis* relationship between \"substantive protection\" and the \"means of enforcing such protection\" *.*\n\n172.\n\nOne thing is to accord the investor most-favoured-nation treatment in material rights, and another thing to use the MFN clause to avoid a condition or limitation contained in the dispute-settlement-cause of the BIT. To proceed otherwise would amount to deny not only the *effect utile* of that clause but also of the international law systemic rule of State's consent to jurisdiction. It follows that \"jurisdictional rights\" as, for example, access to ICSID arbitration to settle a given investment dispute, require the private investors' prior compliance -as commanded by the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction - with the conditions or requirements qualifying the right of access set out by the Contracting States normally in the dispute-settlement-clause of the BIT.\n\n173.\n\nThe situation would of course be different if the MFN clause at issue (or for that matter some other provision of the BIT, including the dispute settlement-clause) would provide expressly in a clear and unequivocal manner that the MFN treatment of the clause in the basic treaty is intended to import a more favourable arbitration dispute-resolution from another treaty, as stated in the *Plama* decision. In this hypothesis, the interpreter cannot but give effect to that common intention of the Contracting States manifested in the BIT (or eventually in conformity with the BIT) because for the VCLT the text must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intention of the Parties to the BIT and further because, in such a hypothesis, the commands of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction would have been in general terms satisfied.\n\n174.\n\nBut this hypothesis is alien to the present case, as well as the case-law concerning cases where the MFN clause refers to \"all matters\" or \"any matter\", as for example in *Maffezini* (2000) and *Teinver* (2012) decided both under the 1991 Argentina-Spain BIT. *Teinver* differs also from the present case because Claimants rely on the MFN clause of Article 3 of the Argentina-Austria BIT as a second basis of jurisdiction alternative to Article 8 of the BIT, while *Teinver* did not request that the tribunal apply the MFN clause to replace the dispute-settlement provision of the BIT, but only to apply the clause \"in order to broaden the scope of the legal issues that may be adjudicated through arbitration\" (*Teinver,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 December 2012, para. 182) (CL-137).\n\n175.\n\nIn the present case, Article 3(1) of the BIT does not manifest in any manner whatsoever that dispute-settlement falls under its scope of application and there are not traces of it in other provisions of the BIT or in protocols or annexes to the BIT. Concerning the non-listing of dispute-settlement among the exceptions of Article 3(2) the legal answer is quite simple, because it is not necessary to do so. Establishing jurisdiction in public international law requires *always,* as it has been explained on several occasions, a manifest positive act of acceptance, a *contracting-in* conduct. *Contracting-out* contentions do not have a role to play in the field as mistakenly used and abused in some earlier case-law.\n\n176.\n\nAs pointed out by the ICJ in the *East Timor* case, the scope of application of a substantive obligation is an entirely separate question to the conferral of jurisdiction to an international tribunal, the latter depending solely upon consent *(**ICJ Reports 1995,* p. 102, para. 29). I will add that the principle of contemporaneousness which is controlled in the interpretation process by the interpretative elements of good faith and the object and purpose of the instrument subject to interpretation does not help Claimants' invocation of Article 3 of that BIT either. At the time of conclusion of the Argentina-Austria BIT the generally accepted prevailing view was, as declared by the ICJ in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (United Kingdom v. Iran)* that \"the most-favoured-nation clause... has no relation whatsoever to jurisdictional matters between the two Governments\" *(**ICJ Reports 1952,* p. 110) and the rejection of the \"incorporation by reference\" concerning most favoured nation treatment in *Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (ICJ Reports 1952,* p. 191/192)\n\n177.\n\nIn fact, this view remained unchallenged until the year 2000 when *Maffezini* erred in the interpretation of a well-known passage in *Ambatielos II.* Then, the Argentina-Austria BIT had been concluded 8 years before *Maffezini* in 1992. It is true that after *Maffezini* several arbitral decisions on investment disputes without major legal analysis (for example, *Siemens, Suez, Gas Natural, etc.)* followed for a while the proposition of the so-called \"inextricable link between dispute-settlement and substantive protection\" and went even further, disregarding altogether the \"public policy considerations\" reservation and other caveats of *Maffezini,* as well as the acknowledgement of *Maffezini* that the precondition of submitting the investment dispute to local courts for a term of 18 months prior to international arbitration is indeed a jurisdictional requirement, limiting as such the scope of the consent to arbitration of the State hosting the investment.\n\n178.\n\nHowever, the above argument is not prevailing any more to the point that nowadays it appears rather as an old-fashioned argument in investment arbitration proceedings. Since about fourteen years ago, arbitral tribunals in investment disputes have progressively found and explained the core reason why a \"generally drafted MFN clause\" cannot be extended in its application, without further ado, to dispute-settlement because the distinction in public international law between \"dispute-settlement protection\" and \"substantive protection\" is an inherent tenet of the international legal order in force.\n\n179.\n\nThis perception is at the root of the findings that with respect to invocations of MFN clauses as a base of jurisdiction have been reached by arbitral tribunals on investment disputes in a series of arbitral awards and decisions, such as: *Salini v. Jordan* (2004), *Plama* (2005), *Telenor* (2006), *Berchader* (2006), *Wintershall* (2008), *Tza Yap Shum* (2009), *ICS Inspection and Control Services* (2012) and *Daimler Financial Services* (2012).There are also opinions of individual arbitrators inspired by the systemic distinction referred to above, like: Brigitte Stern in *Impregilo v. Argentina* (2011), J. Christopher Thomas in *Hochtief v. Argentina* (2011) and myself in *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina* (2013). The basic view prevailing before *Manffezini* has been restored also at the doctrinal level by a number of qualified publicists of international law. One of them, Zachary Douglas, has rightly pointed out that:\n\n\"The fundamental point is that the more favourable treatment granted in a third treaty must be claimed *through* the MFN clause in the basic treaty. That is how the MFN clause works. It does not operate to amend or supplement the text of the basic treaty....One can appreciate the wisdom of the International Law Commission's decision to avoid the language of \u2018incorporation of [by] reference' in its Draft Articles on MFN clauses and of the International Court's rejection of that approach. It is a domestic contract law analogy that is probably the root cause of the mistaken approach taken by investment treaty tribunals to the MFN clause. Reliance upon an MFN clause is not the same as reliance upon an express term in a commercial contract making reference to the standard terms of a trade organization, for instance\" (*The MFN clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails,* Journal of International Law Dispute Settlement, Vol. 2, N\u00b0 1 (2011), p. 106).\n\n180.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, I reject Claimants' invocation of the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Austria as an alternative base of jurisdiction in the present case. Moreover, differential treatment in relation to dispute-resolution may not necessarily equal less or more favourable treatment as the case may be and, therefore, if \"more favourable treatment\" is invoked it needs to be so proven. Then, Claimants failed to prove to my satisfaction that the invoked Argentina-Denmark BIT (the comparator treaty) with its *fork-in-the-road* dispute settlement provision offers, as alleged, \"more favourable treatment\" in dispute settlement matters to Danish investors in Argentina as compared with the treatment offered to Austrian investors in Argentina under Article 8 the Argentina-Austria BIT (the basic treaty).\n\n**C. General conclusion**\n-------------------------\n\n181.\n\nIn the light of the considerations and conclusions above on the applicable law and its interpretation and application to the case, as well as the proven or admitted relevant facts, it is quite clear that Claimants have not complied with any of the relevant conditions and requirements set forth in Article 8 (Settlement of Disputes regarding Investments) of the Argentina- Austria BIT either before or after the filing on 4 December 2014 of their Request for Arbitration with ICSID.\n\n182.\n\nThe Contracting States of the applicable BIT, namely Argentina and Austria, gave, in advance in Article 8(4) (first sentence) within the framework of that dispute-settlement system, their respective irrevocable consents to submit investment disputes with investors nationals of the other Contracting State to arbitration, under the form topical under the BIT mechanism, of an \"arbitration offer\" as expressly admitted by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration of 4 December 2014, \"offer\" subject as it is also usual to certain preconditions and requirements enounced in Article 8(1) to (4) of the BIT.\n\n183.\n\nThus, the \"advanced and irrevocable consent\" referred above has not been given by Argentina and Austria under the form of an \"unconditional consent\" to direct access of the investors protected by the BIT to international arbitration against the host State. Such an access is indeed subject to fulfilment by the protected investor concerned of the said preconditions and requirements spelled out in the first four paragraphs of Article 8 which wording is formulated in a sequential and interrelated manner so that the text of each paragraph is the immediate context for the preceding or following one for any given interpretative operation aimed at determining the scope of the \"offer\" made by Argentina and Austria in Article 8(4) of the BIT.\n\n184.\n\nThe very text of Article 8(4) cannot be more explicit and clear in that respect: \"Con este fin, cada Parte Contratante otorga, *en las condiciones del presente Convenio (nach den Bestimmungen dieses Abkommens)* su consentimiento anticipado e irrevocable para que toda controvesia *sea sometida a este arbitraje (diesem Schiedsverfahren unterbreitet wird).* The offered consent of the BIT has therefore not been given for any kind of arbitration, but to the conditional international arbitration of the BIT itself as set forth therein exclusively, and with respect to \"investments\" as defined in Article 1(1) of the Argentina -Austria BIT but not further or otherwise.\n\n185.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants did not accept the \"arbitration offer\" made by the Contracting States in the BIT, neither in their communication of 30 April 2014 nor when filing their Request for Arbitration on 4 December 2014. The admitted facts of the case prove in an irrefutable manner that Claimants disregarded each and every one of the preconditions and requirements of Article 8 which go together with the \"arbitration offer\" made by Argentina and Austria in the BIT. Thus, Claimants failed to comply with: (i) the sequential and subsequent system of settlement of investment disputes as enounced in the Article 8; (ii) entering into amicable consultations with Respondent for a term 6 months for trying to settle the present dispute; (iii) failed to submit the present dispute to local courts for a term of 18 months; and (iv) did not withdraw ENJASA's pending proceeding in the First Instance Court of Salta they instituted on 5 February 2014 following the institution of the present ICSID arbitration on 4 December 2014.\n\n186.\n\nThe first three Claimants' failures to comply concern requirements jurisdictional in nature because they are preconditions to the Respondent's consent advanced in the arbitration offer as *per* the Argentina-Austria BIT and \"arbitral jurisdiction\" in public international law is based upon the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute and confined to the extent accepted by both of them. As has been declared by the ICJ: \"When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, *any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon\"* (*Case Concerning Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application), (DR of Congo v. Rwanda)*, *ICJ Reports 2006,* p. 39, para. 88) (AL RA 39) *(emphasis added).* Compliance with these three preconditions is therefore a question of consent and Claimants failed to comply with the three.\n\n187.\n\nThe fourth condition or requirement is of a different nature. It is not a \"precondition\" because the obligation concerned exists only as \"from the commencement of an arbitration proceeding\", not before. It relates rather to the admissibility of the request for arbitration but - as illustrated by the text of second sentence of Article 8(4) - is as binding for the protected investors as the first three because it is likewise condition or requirement of the \"offer\" made by Argentina and Austria in the BIT, in the language of the BIT one of the \"*condiciones del presente Convenio*\" *(Bestimmungen dieses Abkommens).*\n\n188.\n\nThus, independently of their characterization as jurisdictional, procedural, or otherwise the four conditions or requirements are mandatory for protected investors as underlined by *Murphy v. Ecuador, Philip Morris v. Uruguay* and several other ICSID arbitral tribunals in like circumstances. But, contrary to their submission, Claimants have not complied with any one of these conditions or requirements. The question is not as was contended by them whether they have validly given their consent or whether or not such a consent may be given in advance by a protected investor, but if one may conclude that Claimants' alleged consent is in agreement with *(match)* the scope of Respondent's consent as offered in advance in Article 8 of the BIT so as to allow to determine the existence of the \"mutual consent\" source of the needed \"arbitration agreement\" between the Parties to the present investment dispute to submit it to ICSID arbitration.\n\n189.\n\nIn other words, the core question is whether a binding \"agreement to arbitrate\" the present investment dispute exists in the relations between the two Parties thereto. The finding of this arbitrator is that no \"agreement to arbitrate\" the dispute has been executed because CAI and CASAG, as Claimants, have not accepted the arbitration offer consented to by the Argentine Republic, as Respondent, in the terms provided for in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. And with respect to the admissibility requirement of Article 8(4) (second sentence) my finding is that its non-compliance when more than two years have lapsed since the commencement of the present ICSID arbitral proceeding is a cause for suspension of the present proceeding until the Arbitral Tribunal is informed by the Parties of the termination or withdrawal of the domestic judicial proceeding going on in Salta.\n\n190.\n\nWith respect to the alternative basis of jurisdiction invoked by Claimants, namely the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the finding of this arbitrator is that such provision as drafted does not provide a base of jurisdiction alternative to Article 8(1) to (4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT or entitling Claimants to rely in the present case on dispute settlement provisions contained in the Argentina-Denmark BIT, because consent to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal, as are ICSID tribunals, has to be in all occasions voluntary in nature, cannot be presumed, and should be manifested in a clear and unambiguous manner, as recalled by *Plama, Wintershall, ICS Inspection and Control Service, Daimler* and other treaty based arbitral tribunals in investment disputes.\n\n191.\n\nIt follows from the above that this arbitrator upholds the Second Preliminary Objection of the Respondent and, consequently, there is no jurisdiction of the Centre and competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to consider and adjudicate the merits of the present \"treaty dispute\". The majority Decision is mistaken for manifest reckless misinterpretations and erroneous application of the relevant provisions of the BIT and for ignoring several rules of public international law applicable in the case of the present Preliminary Objection such, among others:\n\n1. The non-application of Articles 31 and 32 on interpretation of treaties of the VCLT;\n\n2. The non-application Article 36(2) on application of treaties providing for rights for third parties of the VCLT;\n\n3. The non-application of the systemic rule of international law on State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, as manifested and defined by the ICJ in its established jurisprudence; and\n\n4. The non-application of the general principle of international law that international arbitration required an agreement to arbitrate between the parties to the dispute, as provided for in the Preamble and Articles 25(1) and 26 (first sentence) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n192.\n\nThe non-application of the VCLT is particularly regrettable because it is, in my opinion, one of main reasons of the otherwise inexplicable broad interpretations and application by the majority Decision of the provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT, broadness which appear aimed at avoiding any limitation on the right of investors to sue host States whatever the wording and prescriptions of the applicable BIT, and notwithstanding the fact that such a right did not exist but as *per* the BIT itself. The conviction of this arbitrator is that to avoid unbalanced interpretation and application, the BITs, like any other kind of treaties, have to be interpreted and applied in good faith in accordance with the rules of international law codified by the VCLT. It is not admissible that uncertainties or ambiguities be decided systematically in favour of State sovereignty or in favour of the protected investor without regard for the applicable law and the rules governing the interpretation and application of treaties. Concerning the protected investors, as rightly stated by the *El Paso* Arbitral Tribunal, what is not acceptable is the contention that: \"as a BIT's purpose is to protect [investors], the interpretation of treaties for the promotion and the protection of investments, viewed in their context and according to their object and purpose, leads to an interpretation in favour of the investors\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 27 April 2006, paras. 68 and 69) (CL-106).\n\n193.\n\nLast but not least, the majority Decision erred likewise:\n\n1. By following all along an unfit *totum revolutum* approach - which, *inter alia,* tends to confuse \"claims\" and \"disputes\" in detriment of the meaning of the term \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT as defined in Article 1(1) the BIT itself;\n\n2. By extrapolating into the present ICSID arbitral proceedings on a \"treaty dispute\" ENJASA's actions concerning a \"contract dispute\" instituting first administrative proceedings before ENREJA and then in a judicial proceeding before the First Instance Court of Salta as a remedy for Claimants' failure to comply with the preconditions of \"amicable consultations\" and \"referral to local jurisdictions\" of Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n3. By blurring, for so doing, the established legal distinction that a breach of a treaty like the BIT and a breach of contract are quite different legal questions as has been declared by the ICJ in the *Siccula* case and with respect to ICSID arbitration as, for example, in the following statement by the *Ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi Universal v. Argentina Annulment* decision:\n\n\"For example, in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucum\u00e1n, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.\" (Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, para. 96) (AL RA 22).\n\n194.\n\nTo conclude with this general conclusion on Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection I confirm all and every one of the considerations and conclusions I made in this Dissenting Opinion. It follows that I consider that the conclusions reached by the majority concerning Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection are not based upon what I consider to be the \"applicable law\" and I do not know what \"applicable law\", if any, has been applied in the matter by my co-arbitrators.\n\n195.\n\nThe considerations in paragraphs 272 to 276 of the majority Decision continue to keep undefined the \"legal rules\" applied by the majority for reaching its conclusions. I say \"legal rules\" because it is so commanded by Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT is a bilateral treaty provision whose interpretation and application is governed by the law of treaties codified by the Vienna Convention which is an instrument of public international law, and because ICSID arbitral tribunals are considered to be \"international tribunals\" by the fact of being \"treatybased\" institutions entitled to applied public international law for the solution of investment disputes.\n\n196.\n\nIn paragraph 171 and footnote 135 the majority Decision claims that it applies the rules on treaty interpretation laid down in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) but this rhetoric statement is not confirmed neither by the interpretative operation undertaking by the majority concerning Article 8 of the BIT as recorded in the Decision, nor by the conclusions of the latter. Then, as recalled in paragraph 24 of the present Dissenting Opinion, I have to conclude that the interpretation of the majority \"is not reading the BIT but reading into the BIT\" and, consequently, it is not an interpretation of Article 8 of the BIT done in accordance with the relevant rules of the Vienna Convention. The paragraph 171 and footnote 185 made also a reference to \"interpretative canons\" which may be understood by some as diminishing the normative nature of the rules set forth in Articles 31 to 33 of the CVLT which the ICJ considers declaratory of general customary international law.\n\n197.\n\nIn this respect, it should be born in mind that, as explained by the ILC in its Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, the Commission decided \"to trying to isolate and codify the comparatively few general principles which appear to constitute general rules for the interpretation of treaties\" and that there were cogent reasons why the codification of these general rules should be attempted and, in the first place, that \"the interpretation of treaties in good faith *and according to law* is essential if the *pacta sunt servanda* rule is to have any real meaning\" (United Nations Publication, Sales Number:E.70. V.5, p. 38, para. 5) *(italics supplied).*\n\n198.\n\nMoreover, I cannot accept the invocation in footnote 185 of the so-called difficulties of a \"hermeneutic enterprise, such as the interpretation of international treaties\" as an excuse for the construction of Article 8 of the BIT arrived at by the majority. Article 8 of the BIT is drafted in very clear terms and does not pose any major interpretative issue for a good faith interpreter acting in conformity with the said Vienna interpretation rules. On the other hand, the reference to the capacity of \"appreciation of nuances\" is certainly misplaced, the reason being that the interpretation reached by the majority of Article 8 of the BIT does not pose to any reasonable arbitrator an issue of \"nuance\". It is an unwarrantable interpretation in the light of the wording of Article 8 and the factual circumstances of the case and, therefore, in quite contradiction with the affirmation in paragraph 171 that the majority Decision applies the rules on treaty interpretation laid down in the VCLT. Having participated in all meetings concerning the elaboration of the VCLT (ILC, Sixth Committee of the GA and United Nation Conference on the Law of Treaties, drafting committees included) I am fully equipped to distinguish in the field \"a nuance\" from \"a non-compliance\".\n\n199.\n\nThe majority has also difficulties in handling the fact that the Claimants are \"third\" with respect to the BIT concluded between Argentina and Austria and this carries with it some legal consequences for the interpretation, as well as the application of that BIT. At the interpretation level the Claimants' conduct is irrelevant for an interpretation of Article 8 of the BIT done in conformity with the Vienna interpretation rules. However, in the interpretative operation undertaking by the majority it is obvious that Claimants' conduct, behaviour or mere convenience is the leading factor in the interpretation of the provisions of Article 8 arrived at by the majority Decision.\n\n200.\n\nAt the application level, Claimants as a third to the BIT are subject to the provision of Article 36(2) concerning the application of treaties providing for rights for third parties as indicated *supra.* The answer given by the majority to their non-application of the said provision is given in footnote 238 of the Decision in the form of the following denial: \"As investors are not States, the rules for beneficiary third States under Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention are not applicable to the relations between host States and investors covered under the BIT\". But, this slavish textualist argument cannot prevail because the provision is but a mere manifestation of a general principle of law known as *\"estipulaciones en favor de terceros (stipulation pour autrui)* according to which \"any third\" when exercising a right provided for it in a given instrument must comply with the conditions for the exercise of such a right provided for in the instrument in question and, *in casu*, Argentina and Austria made an stipulation in favour of the Claimants as protected investors in Article 8 of the BIT and have recognized the said general principle of law by the act of becoming parties to the VCLT.\n\n201.\n\nThe radical antagonism existing since the outset between the applicable law and the majority's views continues. Thus, the final product, namely the majority Decision, remains as alien to public international law as before concerning, for example, the principle of State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals. The majority does not accept that the requirements in paragraphs (1) (2) and (3) of Article 8 of the BIT are preconditions to international arbitration of a jurisdictional nature, limiting thereby the scope of the consented jurisdiction by the host State.\n\n202.\n\nFurthermore, with regard to the general principle of international law that international arbitration requires an agreement between the parties to the dispute (principle making by the 1965 ICSID Convention the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre), the majority continue to questioning my position in that respect and tries to confuse a clear fundamental matter of principle by introducing, in paragraphs 272 and 273 of the Decision, irrelevant distinctions concerning the different forms of casting consent by the parties to a dispute. I said irrelevant because nobody is making analogies between \"contract-based arbitration\" and \"inter-state arbitration\" because, in the first place, protected foreign investors lack standing to conclude treaties. The \"binding agreement\" referred to in paragraph 6 of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention cannot be by definition a treaty and nobody is saying the contrary. The real issue in the present context is not the possible forms of casting parties' consent, but the substantive issue of the need that the consent given by the parties to the dispute be a *\"mutual consent\"* otherwise a \"binding agreement to arbitrate\" (*acuerdo de arbitraje)* cannot be considered as executed. This is what happened in the present case and, consequently, the conclusion cannot be a finding of in favour of the existence of jurisdiction.\n\n203.\n\nNotwithstanding the general accepted mechanism as how to reach the above *\"mutual consent\"* of the parties to the dispute under the BIT system, the majority Decision continue to side-step the consequences on consent of that system, namely that the protected investor must accept the offer of the applicable BIT as formulated by the Contracting States thereto. As stated by Schreuer: \"The (ICSID) Convention requires consent in writing *by both parties to the dispute*. Just as in the case of legislative provisions for the settlement of dispute by ICSID, a provision on consent in a BIT can be no more than an offer that needs to be accepted in order to amount to a consent agreement. The treaty provision cannot replace the need for consent by the foreign investors. The observations made in the context of national legislation concerning the timing, form and scope by the investors (paras. 416- 420 *supra)* apply equally to BITs. An additional requirement is that the BIT must be between the host State and the State of investor's nationality\" (*\"The ICSID Convention. A commentary\",* Second Edition, p. 211/212, para. 447) *(italics supplied)*.\n\n204.\n\nAs it is mentioned in the paragraphs referred to in the middle of the quotation above where consent is based on the host State's legislation, \"it can only come into existence through an agreement between the parties. The provision in the host State's legislation can amount to no more than an offer that may be accepted by the investor\" *(Ibid,* p. 202, para. 416) as in the case of BITs. Further, also as in the case of BITs, the investor's acceptance of the consent given in the host State's legislation \"can be given only to the extent of the offer made in the legislation. But it is entirely possible for the investor's acceptance to be narrower than the offer and to extend only to certain matter or only to a particular investment operation\" *(Ibid,* p. 203, para. 420). In the present case, Claimants' alleged consent went far beyond of the extent or scope of the offer made by the Argentina in its BIT with Austria and, consequently the offer has not been perfected by lack of the needed mutual or reciprocal consent of the parties to settle the present dispute through ICSID arbitration as provided for in the BIT.\n\n205.\n\nAs I stated above in this Dissenting Opinion, the offer/ acceptance mechanism for reaching under the BIT system the \"mutual consent\" between the parties to the dispute necessary for the execution of the \"binding agreement\" to arbitrate at ICSID the dispute has been correctly explained in the Claimants' Request for Arbitration (paragraphs 12 and 13). But the majority Decision does not take account neither of such fact nor of the additional fact of the subsequent change position in Claimants' pleadings in order to avoid or overcome the problem posed to them by the non-compliance with the \"preconditions\" in paragraphs (1) (2) and (3) of Article 8 of the BIT. This is but an example of the cavalier manner in which the Decision handles certain relevant admitted facts when it may put into question majority findings.\n\n206.\n\nAnother example of the same is the treatment given in the majority Decision to Claimants' notification of 30 April 2014 and subsequent related letters (the last dated 21 October 2014). The fact that in all these letter Claimants were asking \"*for the commencement of amicable consultations pursuant to Article 8 (1)\"* of the BIT was not a sufficient documental proof for the majority of the fact that before the period 30 April 2014- 21 October 2014 no \"amicable consultations\" pursuant to the Article 8 (1) of BIT took place. All this clear relevant documental proof provided by the Claimants themselves and recorded by the Tribunal did not prevent the majority to conclude that the \"amicable consultations\" required by Article 8 (1) of the BIT took place on 27 August 2013! This contrast indeed with the alleviations or dispensations by the majority of Claimants' burden of proof like, for example, in paragraph 289 of the Decision: \"The Tribunal also has no indication of fact to conclude that Claimants engaged in these negotiations, which they initiated, without the genuine intention of trying to settle the dispute arising out of the revocation of ENJASA's license amicably. In the Tribunal's view, it cannot be required that Claimants furnish positive evidence of the existence of such genuine intentions in the absence of clear indications suggesting their absence\".\n\n207.\n\nThe majority Decision continues to interpret the term *\"controversia\"* (dispute) in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT as if the wording of that provision would be similar to dispute-resolution-provisions of other BITs, in particular of the Argentina-Spain BIT and Switzerland- Uruguay BIT. Furthermore, the unfit *totum revolutum* approach is maintained all along the Decision by the majority mixing up the present ICSID arbitration proceedings with the proceedings of the \"contract dispute\" going on in Salta Province, notwithstanding the fact that according to Article 8 (1) of the BIT the Arbitral Tribunal is without competence in contractual investment disputes. Then, the annulment of ENJASA's resolutions revocation ENJASA's licence is a contractual \"subject-matter\" governed by the laws and regulations of Salta Province as provided for in the applicable forum selection clauses of the contractual instruments concerned, and not a \"subject-matter\" governed by the Argentina-Austria BIT and, consequently, it is a \"subject-matter\" which falls outside the competence of the present ICSID Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n208.\n\nFinally, the majority Decision continues to ignore the point of international law that the State of Argentina, namely the Republic Argentina, is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by the Province of Salta, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts. It is only when a claim is based on a treaty that international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the State of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. This distinction of the *Vivendi Annulment* Decision underlined the unfitness of mixing up apples and oranges in these matters as does the majority with its *totum revolutum* approach.\n\n209.\n\nIn sum, the Decision concerning Respondent's Second Preliminary Objection continues to be alien to the applicable public international law rules (conventional and customary). It appears as if for the majority the process of interpretation and application of the applicable law would be conditioned by considerations of another nature such as, for example, elements of the *lex mercatoria,* or policy guidances for the governance of investments or undefined principles of soft law or the non-strict compliance argument of Claimants, in contradiction with the provisions of Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention that command both that the solution of jurisdictional disputed issues in investment arbitral cases be done by the application of the relevant provisions of the BIT concerned and of the rules of international law as may be applicable in the case, and bearing in mind that in the international legal order the systemic rule of State's consent to jurisdiction must be respected in the interest of international legal security of all concerned and, ultimately, of the preservation of the ICSID arbitration as a means of settlement of investment disputes between States and national of other States.\n\n210.\n\nIt follows that consequential to the attitude of lawgivers adopted by the majority, the present Decision does not make sense in public international law. For public international law it appears, in my opinion, as a lawless decision, although my co-arbitrators do not challenge directly the law applicable to the present phase of the case, as defined in Part A of this Opinion. They proceed rather indirectly voiding the applicable rules of public international law of its core meaning and functions by construing an artificial background and proceeding, thereafter, to an alleged process of interpretation and application against the said self-made background. (See paragraphs 271 to 276 of the majority Decision)\n\n211.\n\nThe first step in the construction of the said artificial background was to make of the so-called \"investment treaty arbitration\" a separate category of arbitration with its own specifications (jurisdictional basis included) different from other forms of international arbitration like, for example, the so-called \"contract arbitration\". This first step is aiming at excluding the need of an \"arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute\" in investment treaty arbitration cases, a condition sine qua non in all forms of international arbitration under public international law. The second consideration of the majority in its construction of the said background concerns the jurisdictional preconditions or requirements of the compromissory clauses and it is aiming at denying the strict compliance obligation with these conditions and requirements contrary the established jurisprudence of the ICJ in the matter which is, in turn, a corollary of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction. For the majority, \"absent a clear and unmistakable formulation to the contrary, investors should not be held to the formalities of public international law dispute settlement with the same strictness as States\". A proposition that *inter alia* aims at transforming the \"contracting in\" position of States in jurisdictional matters under public international law in a \"contracting out\" obligation.\n\n212.\n\nFinally, the third consideration of the majority in the process of construction of said artificial self-made background consists in extending the second consideration above to the very interpretation of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT because they said the object and purpose of the BIT is \"to promote and protect foreign investments\". On this basis - and in full contradiction with El Paso and other investment case-law, the majority states in the Decision:\n\n\"It cannot be seen in a pure inter-State context but is in fact addressed to investors, entitled to protection, and consequently has to be interpreted in that light. This does not mean that pre-arbitration requirements are optional. On the contrary, they remain, in principle, mandatory requirements. But - again, unless the pre-arbitration requirements are formulated clearly and unmistakably to require the same formalistic approach in assessing compliance with them - an investment treaty tribunal should accord greater flexibility to the disputing parties than the ICJ accords to conditions of seisin under compromissory clauses. It is against this background that the Tribunal proceeds to analyzing Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT\" (majority Decision, para. 276).\n\n213.\n\nThe above quotation confirms in the first place what has been said *supra* in this Opinion, namely that the majority failed to apply to the interpretation of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT the codified interpretation rules of the VCLT. Moreover, the majority consider that the international law rules applicable in a given ICSID arbitration case may be put aside by arbitrators on the basis of subjective doctrinal, ideological or convenience considerations alien to the objective law applicable to the case at issue. And furthermore, that the said subjective considerations may be applied for the solution of the case in question without any kind of prior demonstration that the considerations concerned are part and parcel of the applicable law. Without such a demonstration the decision cannot claim to be based upon public international law. Then, it should be recalled, Article 8(6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provide that the Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with rules of law as indicated in these provisions.\n\n**PART TWO** - **Declaration of Dissent concerning Respondent's First and Third Preliminary Objections**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nHaving dissented also from the findings of the present majority Decision concerning the Respondent's First and Third Preliminary Objections, I explain my vote thereon through this Declaration.\n\n**(a) First Preliminary Objection: There is no claim for a prima facie violation of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe finding of the majority on Respondent's First Preliminary Objection in paragraph 262 of the Decision provides: (i) that Claimants have met the threshold of presenting *prima facie* claims for breach of Article 4 of the BIT relating to expropriation, and for breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT relating to fair and equitable treatment; (ii) that their claims as presented qualified as treaty claims, not contract claims; (iii) that they have also presented *prima facie* claims that these treaty provisions were breached in relation to Claimants as shareholders-investors in L&E and ENJASA; (iv) that, in particular, the Tribunal found that Article 4(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT cannot be interpreted as limiting claims by shareholders-investors to breaches of Article 4 of the BIT for expropriation; (v) that the forum selection clauses in the Bidding Terms and Conditions as well as the Transfer Agreement, have a limit scope, which do not cover claims for breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT arising out of the revocation of the license and subsequent events; (vi) that Claimants have not been able to present a *prima facie* claim for beach of Article 3(1) of the BIT relating to national treatment; and (vii) that the Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent's objection relating to a lack of a *prima facie* claim insofar it relates to claims for breach of Articles 2(1) and 4 of the BIT, but upholds it with respect to breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n216.\n\nI dissent from most of the above findings for several reasons. In the first place because concerning findings (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) and (vii), Claimants have not met at all the threshold of presenting *prima facie* claims for breach of Article 4 of the BIT relating to expropriation. This majority finding is absolutely baseless. None, I say none, of the facts alleged in that respect by Claimants, if duly proved or established as true, would amount to an expropriation or to a measure having an equivalent effect. Here, the majority is betraying its own test defined in paragraph 207 of the Decision as follows: \"The task of the Tribunal under this test is therefore to determine whether the facts pleaded by Claimants, if established to be true, could possibly result in a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT\". It is by applying that very text that I reject the finding of the majority relating to Article 4 of the BIT concerning expropriation. In contrast, I share finding (vi) of the Decision to the effect that Claimants failed to present a *prima facie* for breach of Article 3(1) but for both treatments, namely \"national treatment\" and \"MFN treatment\".\n\n217.\n\nThus, regarding majority's findings (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) and (vii) I consider that only the claims as presented by Claimants concerning the fair and equitable treatment (Article 2(1) of the BIT) could meet the *prima facie* threshold provided that there is jurisdiction and only, of course, if they are genuine \"treaty claims\", because this Arbitral Tribunal is without jurisdiction over \"contract claims\" (Article 8(1) of the BIT). This last remark is prompted because of the majority's *totum revolutum* reasoning which avoids making in core issues clear factual and legal distinctions between \"contract claims\" and \"treaty claims\". My guidance on the matter has been the leading case on contract/treaty distinction, namely the *Vivendi Annulment* decision where it is stated, *inter alia*, that:\n\n\"As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty \u2026 (a) State may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa... In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly declaratory of general international law) whether there has been a beach of the BIT and whether has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its proper or applicable law - in the case of the BIT by international law; and in the case of the (contract), by the proper law of the contract, in other words, the (municipal law) (decision of the *ad hoc* Committee of 3 July 2002, paras. 95-96).\n\n218.\n\nI cannot accept either finding (iv) because it is not an issue concerning the \"*prima facie* breaches of the BIT\" and clearly prejudges the decision to be taken by the Tribunal on the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection. Furthermore, I reject finding (v) of the majority according to which the forum selection clauses concerned would have such a limited scope that they do not cover the revocation of the licence of ENJASA, an essential contractual matter in domestic administrative license regimes. This finding is aimed at excluding the \"revocation\" concerned from the administrative contract, the License, as well as from its natural legal framework under Salta law, essentially: the Bidding Terms and Conditions, the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Law N\u00b0 7020. In so doing, the majority tries to make of the \"revocation\" a part and parcel of an \"artificially construed treaty claim\" under the Argentina-Austria BIT (Decision, para. 218), so as to allow itself to characterize *at least one of the claims* brought before the Arbitral Tribunal by Claimants as a \"treaty claim\" and conclude, on that fragile basis, that there is *prima facie* jurisdiction. It goes without saying that such a characterization finds no support in the distinction between \"contract claims\" and \"treaty claims\" as defined in the *Vivendi Annulment* decision. I disagree with the interpretation of the referred \"well established jurisprudence\". The termination of a contract by the *ente regulador* in the normal exercise of its regulatory powers does no give raise to a treaty claim because in the first place it is not an international wrongful act (see below). It must be added that under public international law even the breach of a contract without further ado is not an international wrongful act.\n\n219.\n\nIn any case, the majority has not given effect to the valid choice of forum selection clauses applicable to the license by virtue of the relevant administrative contractual interrelated and closely coordinated legal instruments and Salta's provincial legislation, notwithstanding the following facts: (i) that the license was as from its granting subject to the supervision by ENREJA, *ente regulador* provincial of the market concerned, and accepted as such first by ENJASA and then by Claimants themselves when becoming through L&E indirect shareholders of ENJASA; (ii) that the revocation was decided by ENREJA's Resolution N\u00b0 240/13 in the exercise of its regulatory functions and powers as a sanction for alleged breaches by ENJASA of certain obligation set out in ENJASA's licence and related contractual instruments and legislation; and (iii) that ENJASA itself has resorted to the said forum selection clauses by: (a) submitting before ENREJA an administrative recourse for reconsideration of Resolution N\u00b0 240/13; (b) requesting Salta's courts for interim relief to stay the application of Resolution N\u00b0 240/13 and Decree N\u00b0 2348/13, a request which was granted; and (c) submitting before the First Instance Court of Salta a request still going on for annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions N\u00b0 240/13 (revocation) and N\u00b0 315/13 (confirmation of the revocation), as well as Decrees N\u00b0 2348 and 3330.\n\n220.\n\nBut this is not all. The majority is also ignoring the incidence that the material conventional or customary international law rules applicable to the situation at stake may have for the characterization of a given claim as a \"contract claim\" or as a \"treaty claim\". This would mean, in the instant case, the need to take into account not only the BIT standards but also other provision of the BIT and the principles and rules of international law concerning the exercise by States of its regulatory powers, the latter being formulated by the Arbitral Tribunal in *Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic* in the following terms:\n\n\"It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare\" (Partial Award of 17 March 2006, para. 255) (CL-018).\n\n221.\n\nThe revoked ENJASA's license granted in 1999 by the provincial authorities of Salta - which had created the company a few months before-was an exclusive license for a duration of 30 years. The resulting market was therefore a monopolistic market. Following the confirmation of the revocation of that license by the *ente regulador,* ENREJA, that market became a rather competitive market because the provincial authorities opened the market to about ten new operators holding each of them licenses for much shorter durations. This is also an element to ponder for ascertaining *prima facie* whether the exercise by the *ente regulador* of the mentioned regulatory powers was (as normal as it was) valid also under international law or whether it falls under one of the few generally admitted exceptions to the principle quoted above. The conclusions of the *Saluka* Tribunal are based upon: the *Harvard Draft Convention of the Responsibilities of States for* Injuries *to Aliens;* the *1967 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property;* and the *1987 United States Third Restatement of the Law of Foreign Relations*.\n\n222.\n\nRegarding the provisions of the BIT (other than the standards invoked by Claimants), the following should be recalled: (i) that the definition of the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) provides that the investment has to be \"made in accordance with the laws and *regulations* of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\"; (ii) that regarding all the different categories of assets listed in Article 1, including therefore the category in (b) (shareholding and other forms of participation in companies) the last paragraph of that Article provides that: \"The contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and *regulations* of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\"; and (iii) that Article 8(6) provides that \"The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute with reference to the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute, including private international law rules, the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.\"\n\n223.\n\nThe majority fails to explain how in the light of these provisions of the BIT it may be concluded that the \"revocation\" of the ENJASA's license by the competent provincial *ente regulador* ENREJA qualifies as part of a \"treaty claim\" of Claimants against the Argentine Republic, because the applicable law to the said \"revocation\" it is not international law but the domestic law of the Province of Salta and also because the latter law does not attribute to the Argentine Republic the contractual acts or measures adopted by the Province. On both accounts international law was absent when ENREJA adopted its Resolutions on the revocation of ENJASA's license in accordance with the applicable law which was provincial domestic law as established by the Argentina-Austria BIT itself.\n\n224.\n\nThat absence cannot be made good by a mere *posteriori* characterization, without sufficient *prima facie* demonstration, that a claim concerning the legality of the \"revocation\" of ENJASA's license could be analysed as \"part of a treaty claim\". Neither Claimants nor the arbitrators are transformers able as such to convert a \"contract claim\" into a \"treaty claim\" or, for that matter, into a \"mixed claim\". No doubt that ENREJA in the exercise of public authority as *ente regulador* (accepted by Claimants without reservation when they became indirect shareholders of ENJASA) revoked the licence as a sanction for alleged breaches by ENJASA of its obligations under that license and its related contractual and legislative provisions, but this does not change an iota the non-treaty nature of such a revocation Resolution.\n\n225.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that Resolution n\u00b0 240/13 was issued in compliance with the applicable domestic law in a procedure where the right of defence was respected and all of ENJASA's defence arguments were heard and, therefore, that the resolution revoking the license was adopted following considering by the competent *ente regulador* of the factual and legal background of the case in the light of the applicable law. As an illustration of its position, Respondent provided some selected passages of investment arbitration case-law as the following one:\n\n\"What is relevant is rather that the Province, with some justification, considered that AGBA had grossly failed in fulfilling its contractual obligations and terminated the Concession Contract on this basis. This is sufficient, in the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, to exclude that the termination could be regarded as an act of - direct or indirect -expropriation or other appropriation of AGBA's property or Impregilo's investment. It has also in no way been proven that the termination of the Concession Contract was the last step in a successive series of measures taken by the Province with a view to depriving AGBA of the concession, or, in other words, that AGBA was exposed to \u2018creeping expropriation'.\" (*Impregilo v. Argentina,* Award of 21 June 2011, para. 283) (AL RA 46).\n\n226.\n\nThe majority's device of making the \"revocation of ENJASA's licence\" part of Claimants' treaty claim is - for this Arbitrator - the best evidence of Claimants' failure to prove what they must prove at the present jurisdictional phase of the case, namely whether the actual behavior (conduct or measures) adopted by the Provincial Authorities and/or ENJASA *on the occasion* of the revocation of the license (no the revocation measure as such) could *prima facie*, if subsequently established as true, amount to a breach of the invoked standards of the Argentina-Austria BIT or, for that matter, of the rules of international law governing the exercise by sovereign States of their regulatory powers *.* In view of that failure, this arbitrator concludes that, as contended by Respondent, the existence in the case of a \"treaty claim or claims\" as contended by Claimants has not been proven *prima facie*.\n\n227.\n\nConsequently, I uphold the First Preliminary Objection of Respondent on the basis of Claimants' failure to prove *prima facie,* as they should have done, that the relevant facts and conducts they alleged, if proven as true, could constitute an internationally wrongful act or acts by the Argentine Republic by breach of the standards of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n**(b) Third Preliminary Objection: There is no jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe present Decision recorded the Parties' respective pleas and arguments concerning the Third Preliminary Objection, for the Respondent in paragraphs 106 to 116 of the Decision and for Claimants in its paragraphs 156 to 168. However, under Section VI of the Decision entitled \"The Tribunal's Analysis\" the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection is not the object of any sub-section and consequently does not appear in the \"table of contents\" of that Section and has vanished from the Decision as an autonomous preliminary objection, although the Third Preliminary Objection has not been withdrawn by Respondent.\n\n229.\n\nWhy it is so? The only reason for this disappearance is the majority's decision to avoid giving a judicial answer, at the present phase of the case, to Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection notwithstanding both the fact of it being an autonomous objection and the fact that the Parties' contentions and arguments concerning this Preliminary Objection were quite complete allowing the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate it at present, without waiting until the end of the merits phase. The majority's arguments in support of an economy of proceedings and costs made in other contexts do not seem to have played any role on this occasion.\n\n230.\n\nIt is in order to recall likewise that Tribunal's Procedural Order N\u00b0 3 decided to bifurcate the proceedings into separate jurisdiction and merits phases so that \"the jurisdiction phase will deal with all objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal\". It is true that the said Procedural Order dated 25 April 2016 reserved the possibility for the Tribunal of joining any objections to the merits phase once it had received the Claimants' counter-arguments on jurisdiction. But since then, Claimants' counter-arguments came fully in their Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction as well as at the Hearing, without any of the Parties questioning the autonomous nature of this Preliminary Objection or requesting or suggesting to join it to the merits phase, doubtless because Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection is an autonomous objection which possesses indeed an exclusive *ratione materiae* preliminary character.\n\n231.\n\nThus, the present Decision neither upheld nor rejected Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection nor even decided formally to join it to the merits, thereby raising a first procedural issue on the question of whether or not this treatment of a Party's Preliminary Objection constitutes a serious departure of a fundamental rule of the procedure applicable to the present ICSID arbitration. I cannot therefore accept the majority's attempt to justify such a treatment of the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection as recorded in paragraph 172 of the Decision. The issue here has nothing to do neither with the maxim *iura novit curia* nor with the alleged Tribunal's power for treating Respondent's Objections in a different order. The matter does not need esoteric explanations at all. It is much more simple and clear than that. It is regulated by Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and by Rule 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules which provides *inter alia* that the Tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question (either upholding or rejecting it) or join it to the merits of the dispute\". There is not a third alternative under ICSID Arbitrations. The Tribunal which is an \"ICSID arbitral tribunal\" is not empowered, in my view, to reformulate a party's objection as it pleases and neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules limit the kind of preliminary objections that a given party may decide to make.\n\n232.\n\nHow does the majority Decision proceeded to create such a procedural situation regarding Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection? First, as indicated, by denying its autonomous preliminary character and then by dividing in the Tribunal's analysis the consideration of the Third Objection into two separate sections, namely the section on the \"Existence of a Protected Investment\" (paragraphs 173 to 196 of the Decision) and the section on the \"*Prima facie* breaches of the BIT\" (paragraphs 223 to 253). Under the first of these two sections, the Decision considers what it calls \"One aspect of Respondent's objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* concerns the question whether Claimants have made an investment in Argentina that is protected under both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Austria BIT\" (paragraph 173) and, under the second section, the so-called \"other aspect of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae\"* which is described, in footnote 187 of the majority Decision, as follows:\n\n\"The other aspect of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because of limits the BIT imposes for the protection of shareholder-investors, in the Tribunal's view, does not, properly understood, concern a question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* but concerns the scope of the substantive protections the BIT grants to shareholder-investors. This is a question pertaining to the merits of the claim. At the present stage of the proceedings, any limitation on the substantive scope of protection is only relevant to the extent it results in the lack of a *prima facie* claim. See *infra* Section VI.2.\"\n\n233.\n\nThe purpose of the above division of the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection between the so-called *two aspects* - considered separately from each other - becomes obvious when reading the first aspect supposed to be considered in paragraphs 173 to 196 of the Decision and finds that a reference to that first aspect of the Third Objection of the Respondent appears in single paragraph, namely in paragraph 185 in which,, following the Tribunal' conclusion in the preceding one that ENJASA's operating license does not qualify as a protected \"investment\" itself in the sense of Article 1 of the Argentina- Austria BIT, the Decision stated the following:\n\n\"This does not mean, however, that interferences with ENJASA's assets are irrelevant for Claimants' rights as shareholder-investors protected under the BIT. Yet, the question to which extent Claimants enjoy protection as (indirect) shareholders against interferences with ENJASA's assets, such as the revocation of its operating license and subsequent events, is, in principle, an issue for the merits of the case. At the present jurisdictional stage, and despite Respondent's formulation as part of its objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the issue (i.e., the scope of protection of Claimants as shareholder-investors) is only relevant in order to assess whether Claimants have successfully\\_presented a *prima facie* claim. This issue is discussed in connection with Respondent's objection that Claimants have failed to present a *prima facie* claim.\" (majority Decision, para. 185)\n\n234.\n\nIn the light of the above quotation it is crystal clear that the purpose concerned was to deprive the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection of its autonomy and to begin to make it part and parcel of Respondent's First Preliminary Objection. This is fully confirmed by paragraphs 223 to 253 of the Decision in which Article 4(3) of the BIT is reviewed, together with Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, in the perspective of a *prima facie* plausible breach of Article 4 of the BIT, namely as an issue falling under the Respondent's First Preliminary Objection. Paragraphs 224 and 225 of the Decision are quite clear in that respect:\n\n\"224. In making this determination, the Tribunal therefore addresses not only aspects that are part of Respondent's first objection that Claimants have failed to show the existence of a *prima facie* claim proper, but also those aspects of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* which concern Respondent's claim that, in light of Respondent's construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT, Claimants, as indirect shareholders in ENJASA, are unable to bring claims relating to assets held by ENJASA, in particular claims arising out of the revocation of ENJASA's operating license unless the revocation of the license resulted in an expropriation of \"assets\"/\"financial assets\" of ENJASA.\n\n\"225. The Tribunal will first turn to the question whether Claimants have been able to show a *prima facie* breach of Article 4 of the BIT. In this context, the Tribunal will also address Respondent's argument on the impact of Article 4(3) of the BIT on claims by shareholderinvestors, both in respect of expropriation and other causes of action under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\"\n\n235.\n\nIn paragraphs 232 to 241 of the Decision, the majority made certain tentative constructions of Article 4(3) of the BIT as, for example, of the term *activos financieros (Vermogenwerte)* which I reject on the basis of Article 33 of the VCLT and international jurisprudence concerning the interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages. Those tentative constructions of Article 4(3) of the BIT are presented by the majority under the cover of an exercise aiming at determining whether Claimants have presented a *prima facie* plausible construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT but, in my opinion, they go beyond that declared purpose. To avoid eventual misunderstandings, I declare to disagree and to reserve my position with respect to what is said concerning Article 4(3) in paragraphs 236 to 241 of the majority Decision, taking note as from now of the statement in paragraph 235 of the Decision to the effect that:\n\n\"It is not necessary that the Tribunal comes to an ultimate conclusion on the interpretation of Article 4(3) of the BIT at the present stage of the proceedings. Instead, it is sufficient that Claimants have presented a *prima facie* plausible construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT. Paraphrasing Ambatielos, \u2018[i]f the interpretation [...] relied upon appears to be one of the possible interpretations that may be placed upon it, though not necessarily the correct one, then the [...] claim must' proceed to the merits\"\n\n236.\n\nBut, what is more important to underline here is the fact that the majority instead of dealing with Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection took advantage of the occasion for determining that Claimants have made a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license constituted an expropriation of ENJASA that could entitle Claimants to compensation by breach, *inter alia* of Article 4(3) of the BIT. To complete the picture of how the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection was handled by the majority, the following statement in paragraph 239 of the Decision is quite representative:\n\n\"All in all, with respect to Article 4 of the BIT, in the Tribunal's view, Claimants have made a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events constituted an indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and ENJASA contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Furthermore, Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events constituted an expropriation of certain of ENJASA's assets or of ENJASA as a whole which could entitle Claimants to compensation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the BIT\".\n\n237.\n\nI am obliged to dissent from the above deceptive passage, as well as of the statements in paragraphs 240 and 241 of the majority Decision, for several reasons. As I have already mentioned in paragraph 216 of this Declaration, none of the relevant facts alleged by Claimants, if duly proven or established as true, would amount to an expropriation or to a measure having an equivalent effect. But what is really amazing is to verify how the majority has transformed beyond recognition the contents and purpose of Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection. I do not consider that to do so is a task for arbitrators. To put the matter in its correct perspective, I quoted below the meaning of that *ratione materiae* preliminary objection as described by Respondent in its Post Hearing Brief:\n\n\"In conclusion, in light of Article 4(3) of the BIT, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction (a) over the claim put forward by Claimants since it is not related to a financial asset owned by ENJASA and, in any case, (b) in relation to the alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment and national treatment standards, since the Tribunal may only  exercise jurisdiction in case of expropriation of assets of the company in which the investor owns shares.\" (Respondent's PHB, para. 132)\n\n238.\n\nIt is quite a gratuitous assertion of the majority that at the present jurisdictional stage, the issue (i.e., the scope of protection of Claimants as shareholder-investors) *is only relevant in order to assess whether Claimants have successfully presented* a prima facie *claim.* The *prima facie* claim criterion is relevant in the present phase of the case for the adjudication of the First Preliminary Objection. But, it is quite alien for the adjudication of the Third Preliminary Objection presented by the Respondent as an autonomous objection, as well as to the Second one. The First and Third Preliminary Objections are autonomous from each other and as such must be adjudicated separately. And this has not being done by the majority Decision which avoided Tribunal's adjudication of Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection at the present jurisdictional phase and even, in the alternative, to joint it to the merits phase of the dispute as provided for in Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 (4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n239.\n\nWhy, against the obvious, did the majority decide otherwise? Because it considered that the adjudication of Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection at the present jurisdictional phase as one autonomous objection risked putting an end to the case while by making that Objection part and parcel of the First Objection that danger disappears *in the light of the test applicable for determining the existence of a* prima facie *claim*. Thus, that *test* has been used by the majority as a kind of black whole with respect to an early adjudication of the Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection. But, the Contracting States have in effect expressly limited as *per* Article 4(3) of the BIT the possibility for a shareholder-investor to make claims under the BIT for assets of the company or companies concerned, ENJASA in the instant case.\n\n240.\n\nLikewise, by doing as indicated above the majority alleviated in the present jurisdictional phase the standard burden of proof *actori incumbit probatio* of Claimants applicable - as declared by the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* Tribunal (see paragraph 67 of the present Opinion) - to preliminary objections of the kind of Respondent's Second and Third Preliminary Objections, a standard confirmed by other investment arbitration decisions and awards on jurisdiction like the ones below:\n\n\"...Thus, so long as the objection goes only to the authority of the Tribunal to hear claims for the breach of the legal right identified by the Claimant, the Tribunal's review of the sufficiency of the legal allegations, like its review of the factual allegations, is limited.\n\n\"A fundamentally different approach is required, however, for issues that are directly determinative of the Tribunal's jurisdiction - such as, for example, issues of consent, nationality, covered investment, territoriality, or the temporal scope of treaty protection. If the Tribunal is to make jurisdictional determinations on such issues in a threshold jurisdictional stage (rather than joining them to the merits), the Tribunal must reach definitive findings of fact and conclusions of law. Without such determinations, the Tribunal cannot satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction to hear the merits of the dispute\". (*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance and Republic of Paraguay*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 12 February 2010, paras. 52 and 53),\n\n\"It follows that matters that are decisive for purposes of establishing jurisdiction, such as whether a particular claimant qualifies as an investor or whether an investment falls under the protection of the relevant treaty, must be proven and decided at the jurisdictional stage. In the present instance, the burden of proof that all the jurisdictional requirements of the case are met, insofar as they are contested by the Respondent, lies with the Claimant\" (*Blue Bank International v. Venezuela*, Award of 26 April 2017, para.73).\n\n241.\n\nIt follows, as pointed out by Respondent, that Article 4(3) of the BIT \"establishes two requirements: (a) that the affected asset of the company constitutes a \u2018financial asset' [ *activo financiero* ], and (b) that the challenged measure qualifies as an expropriation\". And further, regarding the second requirement, that \"even if one considered that actions may be brought by shareholders in respect of company assets under Article 4(3) of the BIT, this provision would limit those actions to claims for expropriation, and exclude claims concerning the standards of fair and equitable treatment and national treatment from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\" (quoted from paragraph 114 and 116 of the Decision). This subject-matter of Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection not being adjudicated at the present jurisdictional phase must, unless withdrawn by Respondent, be adjudicated in the following merits phase, the burden of proof that Respondent is wrong corresponding to Claimants.\n\n242.\n\nFinally, it appears to be generally accepted that Claimants' alleged protected investment falls *prima facie* under Article 1(1)(b) of the Argentine-Austria BIT, namely under the category defined as any shareholding and any form of participation in companies. Then, it should be recalled that such a category, like for that matter any other of the different ones listed, is subject to the provison set forth in the last paragraph of Article 1 of said BIT which reads as follows:\n\n\"*El contenido y el alcance de los derechos correspondientes a las diversas categor\u00edas de los activos, ser\u00e1n determinados por las leyes y reglamentaciones de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio la inversi\u00f3n est\u00e1 situada*\".\n\n243.\n\nIn light of the considerations above, I dissent from the *prima facie* conclusion on the Third Preliminary Objection as recorded in paragraph 239 to 241 of the present Decision concerning Article 4(3) of the BIT and from the over-all handling by the majority of Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection which has failed to be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal or join it to the merits at the present jurisdictional phase in full contradiction with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 (4) of ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n244.\n\nIt follows that I reject the overall conclusion of the majority to the effect that by the finding that Claimants have presented plausible *prima facie* claims that the rights of foreign investors under Article 4(3) could have been breached, as well as all the premature conclusions by the majority on the interpretation of that provision of the Argentina-Austria BIT, like in paragraphs 240 and 241 and others of the Decision, which in some cases may have incurred in procedural prejudgments. In my opinion, the majority Decision did not respond to Respondent's Third Preliminary Objection either in *toto* or in part because it has nothing in common with the demonstration of the existence or non-existence of a given *prima facie* claim.\n\n245.\n\nFinally, I reject as from now the *prima facie* prejudgments incurred by the majority in paragraphs 240 and 262 of the Decision where it is stated that the Tribunal found respectively: (a) that Article 4(3) of the BIT was intended to grant shareholders investors an \"additional cause of action; and (b) that Article 4(3) of the BIT cannot be interpreted as limiting claims by shareholder-investors to breaches of Article 4 of the BIT for expropriation."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of the revocation, in 2013, of an exclusive 30-year license granted, in 1999, to the Argentine company Entretenimientos y Juegos de Azar S.A. (\"**ENJASA**\") for the operation of gaming facilities and lottery activities in the Argentine Province of Salta. ENJASA was established by the Government of the Province of Salta in 1999 as part of a process of privatizing the Province's gaming and lottery sector and developing tourism in the region. Following a public tender and various changes in the ownership structure, ENJASA became majority owned and controlled by Claimants, Casinos Austria International GmbH (\"**CAI**\"), a limited liability company established under the laws of Austria, and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft (\"**CASAG**\"), a sharecompany established under the laws of Austria (jointly \"**Casinos**\" or \"**Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nClaimants contend that the revocation of ENJASA's license, followed by the transfer of its gaming and lottery operations and personnel to a number of new gaming operators effectively destroyed their investment in Argentina. They invoke the violation of their rights as foreign investors under the Argentina-Austria BIT, namely not to be expropriated without compensation, to receive fair and equitable treatment, and to enjoy national treatment,1 and seek damages from the Argentine Republic (\"**Argentina**\" or \"**Respondent**\") for such breach.\n\n*See* Memorial on the Merits, Section III, subsections 3-5. The Tribunal notes that Claimants' allegations of discriminatory treatment were brought as a claim for breach of national treatment (*see* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 437-441). Moreover, a breach of the most-favoured-nation clause (*see* Request for Arbitration, para. 65) was not repeated in the Memorial on the Merits, but was invoked with regard to the Tribunal's Arbitral jurisdiction. Claimants had also invoked a violation of the standard of full protection and security under the Argentina-Austria BIT (*see* Request for Arbitration, para. 56), but they have not further pursued that claim.\n\n3.\n\nThe jurisdictional basis of the present proceedings rests on Article 25(1) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention), which is in force between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Austria. Pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,\n\n[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n4.\n\nClaimants claim that the conditions of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are fulfilled. They also contend that, by initiating the present proceedings, they have accepted, Respondent's consent to this arbitration contained in Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Article 8 provides, in its two authentic languages, Spanish and German, as follows:2\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *ARTIKEL 8 Beilegung von Investitionsstreitigkeiten (1) Jede Meinungsverschiedenheit aus Investitionen zwischen einem Investor der einen Vertragspartei und der anderen Vertragspartei betreffend die von diesem Abkommen geregelten Angelegenheiten wird, soweit wie m\u00f6glich, durch freundschaftliche Konsultationen zwischen den Streitparteien beigelegt.

Yet, at least with respect to Article 8 of the BIT, in the Tribunal's view, the differences between the Parties's respective translations are minor and make no difference in interpreting and applying that provision in the case at hand. The Tribunal therefore sees no need to settle on one version of the English translation. Instead it will use the English translation as far as agreed between the Parties and note any differences, whenever necessary, by attributing the translation to the respective Party in brackets. The translation of Article 8 of the BIT into English with the Parties' respective differences is as follows:\n\nARTICLE 8\n\nSettlement of Investment Disputes\n\n(1) Any dispute with regard to investments between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Contracting Party concerning any subject matter governed by this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(2) If the dispute cannot be settled through consultations within a term of six months, the dispute may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n(3) The dispute may be submitted to an arbitral tribunal in any of the following cases:\n\na) where, after a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the date of notification of the initiation of the proceeding before the afore-mentioned jurisdiction [Respondent]/authorities [Claimants], no decision was rendered on the merits;\n\nb) where such decision has been rendered, but the parties are still in dispute [Respondent]/the dispute persists [Claimants]. In such case, recourse to the arbitral tribunal shall render ineffective any decision previously adopted at the national level;\n\nc) where the parties to the dispute have so agreed.\n\n(4) To such effect, under the terms of this Agreement, each Contracting Party irrevocably consents in advance to the submission of any dispute to arbitration. From the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, each party to the dispute shall take all the required measures to withdraw any [Respondent]/the [Claimants] pending judicial proceedings.\n\n(5) Whenever the dispute is referred to international arbitration, it may be submitted, at the investor's choice, either to:\n\n- the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established under the \"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,\" opened for signature in Washington, on March 18, 1965, when both Contracting Parties have acceded to said Convention. Until such time as this requirement is met, each Contracting Party agrees to submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the ICSID Additional Facility Rules;\n\n- to an \"ad hoc\" arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute, including its rules on conflict of laws [Respondent]/private international law rules [Claimants], the provisions of this Agreement, and the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.\n\n(7) The award shall be final and binding and shall be enforced in accordance with the national legislation; each Contracting Party undertakes to recognize and enforce the award in accordance with its respective legal provisions.\n\n(8) A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not, at any stage of a conciliation or arbitration proceeding or enforcement of an award, raise objections grounded on the fact that the investor who is the other party to the dispute has received indemnity by virtue of a guarantee in respect of all or some of its losses.\n\nRevised version of the translations of Exhibits C-001 and A RA-01.\n\n6.\n\nRespondent objects to the jurisdiction of the present tribunal. In her view, the jurisdictional requirements under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and under the Argentina-Austria BIT are not met. In Respondent's view, Claimants have not demonstrated a *prima facie* violation of the Argentina-Austria BIT, have not complied with the conditions of Respondent's consent under Article 8 of the BIT, and have not shown that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 December 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Casinos Austria International GmbH and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft against the Argentine Republic (the \"**Request**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Institution Rules**\").\n\n9.\n\nBy correspondence of 3 December 2014, 29 December 2014, 13 January 2015, and 15 January 2015, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be comprised of three arbitrators; one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 13 January 2015, Claimants appointed Prof. Dr. Stephan Schill, a national of Germany, as an arbitrator in this case. Prof. Schill accepted his appointment on 26 January 2015.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 13 February 2015, Respondent appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, a national of Spain, as arbitrator in this case. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez accepted his appointment on 23 February 2015.\n\n12.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, Claimants informed the Secretary-General that the Parties had reached an agreement to appoint Prof. Dr. Hans van Houtte as President of the Tribunal. Respondent confirmed the agreement on the same date. Prof. van Houtte accepted his appointment on 3 April 2015.\n\n13.\n\nOn 6 April 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Giuliana Cane, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Following Ms. Cane's departure from the Centre, on 15 January 2016, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the Secretary-General appointed Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 13(1) and 20(1), the Tribunal held a first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties on 5 June 2015 by teleconference. The following persons were present at the session:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal* :\n\nProf. Dr. Hans van Houtte President\n\nProf. Dr. Stephan W. Schill Arbitrator\n\nDr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :\n\nMs. Giuliana Cane Secretary of the Tribunal, ICSID\n\n*Participating on behalf of the Claimants* :\n\nMs. Claudia Dotter Casinos Austria AG\n\nMr. Andreas Schreiner Casinos Austria International GmbH\n\nMr. Florian Haugeneder Counsel\n\nMr. Emmanuel Kaufman Counsel\n\n*Participating on behalf of the Respondent* :\n\nMr. Horacio P. Diez Subprocurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Carlos Mihanovich Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Sebasti\u00e1n Green Mart\u00ednez Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 23 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreements of the Parties and the Tribunal's decisions on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the schedule of the proceedings included as Annex A to that order.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n17.\n\nBy communication of 29 January 2016, Respondent requested the Tribunal to order Claimants to produce certain documents. On 4 February 2016, Claimants submitted observations to Respondent's request for production of documents, and Respondent filed a response to Claimants' observations on 5 February 2016. Having considered the Parties' communications, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on 11 February 2016 on document production.\n\n18.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, Respondent submitted her Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits. It included a request to treat the objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal as a preliminary matter. On 8 April 2016, Claimants presented observations in opposition to Respondent's request to bifurcate the proceeding.\n\n19.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' observations, on 25 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ruling that Respondent's objections would be heard as a preliminary question. The Tribunal noted that \"the objections to jurisdiction as submitted by Respondent are largely separate from the merits of the dispute and, if successful, would dispose of the case in its entirety.\" Furthermore, the Tribunal noted that it had reached its decision on bifurcation having considered \"Respondent's full arguments on jurisdiction but not having seen Claimants' response to these arguments,\" and thus reserved the possibility of \"joining any objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal to the merits phase once it has received Claimants' counterarguments on jurisdiction.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nOn 11 October 2016, Respondent filed her Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nOn 23 December 2016, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n23.\n\nOn 23 February 2017, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by teleconference. The following persons were present at the conference:\n\n*On behalf of the Tribunal* :\n\nProf. Dr. Hans van Houtte President of the Tribunal\n\n*ICSD Secretariat* :\n\nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*Representing the Claimants* :\n\nMr. Florian Haugeneder Counsel\n\nMr. Emmanuel Kaufman Counsel\n\nMs. Selma Tiric Counsel\n\n*Representing the Respondent* :\n\nDra. Silvina Sandra Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMs. Mariana Mabel Lozza Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Tom\u00e1s Braceras Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the pre-hearing organizational conference, on 13 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 regarding the organization of the hearing.\n\n25.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held in Paris, France, from 23 to 25 March 2017 (the \"**Hearing**\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Tribunal* :\n\nProf. Dr. Hans van Houtte President\n\nProf. Dr. Stephan W. Schill Arbitrator\n\nDr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :\n\nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For Claimants* :\n\nMr. Florian Haugeneder Counsel\n\nMr. Emmanuel Kaufman Counsel\n\nMs. Selma Tiric Counsel\n\nMr. Tobias Schaffner Counsel\n\nMs. Jovana Lakic Counsel\n\nMs. Claudia Dotter Casinos Austria AG\n\nMr. Dietmar Hoscher Casinos Austria AG\n\nMr. Alexander Tucek Casinos Austria International GmbH\n\nMr. Andreas Schreiner Witness\n\nProf. Fernando Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s Expert Witness\n\nProf. Alberto B. Bianchi Expert Witness\n\n*For Respondent* :\n\nDr. Carlos Francisco Balb\u00edn Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nDra. Silvina Sandra Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Ms. Mariana Mabel Lozza Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Tom\u00e1s Braceras Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMs. Mar\u00eda Soledad Romero Caporale Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMs. Alejandra Mackluf Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMs. Valeria Etchechoury Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMs. Bel\u00e9n Iba\u00f1ez Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nMr. Javier Hern\u00e1n Wajntraub Witness\n\nProf. Ismael Mata Expert Witness\n\n26.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the following persons were examined:\n\n*Witness and expert testimony submitted by Claimants* :\n\nMr. Andreas Schreiner Witness\n\nMr. Alexander Tucek Witness\n\nProf. Fernando Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s Expert Witness\n\nProf. Alberto B. Bianchi Expert Witness\n\n*Witness and expert testimony submitted by Respondent* :\n\nMr. Javier Hern\u00e1n Wajntraub Witness\n\nProf. Ismael Mata Expert Witness\n\n27.\n\nOn 7 April 2017, Claimants submitted a request for leave to submit new documents. Respondent opposed Claimants' request on 21 April 2017 and, in case it should be granted, requested and reserved in turn its right to request leave to submit responsive documents. Having considered the Parties' communications, on 5 May 2017, the Tribunal issued a decision granting Claimants' request to submit new documents, granting Respondent's request to submit one additional document and inviting Respondent to identify any other responsive documents, which Respondent did on 23 May 2017. Claimants confirmed on 26 May 2017 that they did not object to the submission of the new responsive documents identified by Respondent, which the Tribunal subsequently admitted on 16 June 2017.\n\n28.\n\nOn 23 and 24 May 2017, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the Hearing Transcript.\n\n29.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, the Parties submitted simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs. On the same date, Claimants indicated that the Parties had agreed to submit revised translations of certain exhibits on 10 July 2017. On that date, Claimants submitted courtesy revised translations. On 12 July 2017, Respondent stated that, while the Parties had agreed on the date the translations of certain exhibits would have to be submitted, they had been unable to agree on the content of those translations. In their respective Post-Hearing Briefs, the Parties thus relied on their own translations or corrections to the other Party's translations. Claimants confirmed, on 14 July 2017, that they had no further comments on the translations of certain exhibits prepared by Respondent and observed that Claimants stood by their own translations with regard to some other exhibits for which both Parties had made their own translations.\n\n**III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n30.\n\nRespondent objects to the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal based on three counts. They comprise, as further detailed below: first, the lack of a *prima facie* violation of the Argentina-Austria BIT; second, the lack of compliance by Claimants with the conditions to Respondent's consent under Article 8 of the BIT; and third, the lack of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. Respondent therefore requests the Tribunal regarding this phase of the proceeding:4\n\ni. to declare that this dispute falls outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal and that it is inadmissible;\n\nii. to reject each and every one of the claims put forward by Claimants; and\n\niii. to order Claimants to pay for all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration proceeding.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 215; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 134.\n\n**2. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n31.\n\nClaimants, in turn, counter these objections, by arguing, as detailed further below, that, first, they have set out a *prima facie* claim for breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT; second, that Respondent has validly consented to the present proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT; and third, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and should proceed to analyze the claims on the merits. Regarding this phase of the proceeding, Claimants therefore make the following request:5\n\ni. The ICSID has jurisdiction and the Arbitral Tribunal competence over the dispute.\n\nii. Claimants' claims are admissible and the Argentine Republic's objections are rejected.\n\niii. The Argentine Republic is ordered to pay to Claimants all costs, expenses and fees (including internal costs) relating to the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration and appropriate interest thereon.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 230; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 443.\n\n**IV. FACTS OF THE CASE**\n-------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe facts of the case, to the extent they are relevant for questions of admissibility jurisdiction, are largely uncontested. They are summarized in this section for the limited purpose of the present Decision. This summary does not constitute an exhaustive account of the facts, nor should it be taken as prejudging any issues of fact or law considered by the Tribunal on the merits.\n\n**1. The Privatization of the Gaming Sector in the Province of Salta**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nSince the 1970s, gaming facilities and lottery activities in the Province of Salta, located in the Northwestern part of Argentina, were operated directly by, or under the control of, Banco de Pr\u00e9stamos y Asistencia Social (\"**BPAS**\"), an autonomous entity fully owned by the Province of Salta.6\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 10-14; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 134-135.\n\n34.\n\nIn December 1995, the Province of Salta passed the \"Principles for the Restructuring of BPAS\" as part of its Law No. 6836. This Law foresaw the restructuring of BPAS, including the possible privatization of BPAS' gaming and lottery operations.7\n\n*See* Exhibit C-045.\n\n35.\n\nOn 7 September 1998, the Executive of the Province of Salta passed Decree No. 2126/98.8 This Decree created ENJASA, a company with limited liability under Argentine law. ENJASA's single purpose was the management, commercialization and exploitation of games of chance in the Province of Salta, which was formerly within the competence of BPAS. ENJASA was to have a duration of 30 years. 90% of its shares of capital stock (so-called Class A-shares) were to be offered to the public at large through a public offering; the remaining 10% were marked for a joint ownership participation program for employees of BPAS.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 19-24; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 137-139.\n\n36.\n\nOn 30 December 1998, Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta entered into force. It provides for the regulatory framework for the gaming and lottery sector in the Province.9 The Law creates the regulatory agency overseeing the gaming and lottery sector in the Province of Salta, called Ente Regulador del Juego de Azar (\"**ENREJA**\") (see Article 31). The agency is tasked, inter alia, with regulating the conduct of operators of games of chance, including by issuing operating rules and overseeing compliance with the laws and regulations in force (see Articles 3, 32 and 33). The obligations encompass, amongst others, the prohibition to hire operators without the authorization of ENREJA, the obligation to ensure that operation and maintenance of gaming facilities comply with the law, and the requirement to appoint an individual responsible for anti-money laundering measures (see Article 5). ENREJA also disposes of disciplinary and sanctioning powers, which include the issuance of warnings, the imposition of fines, disqualification, and the suspension and revocation of operating licenses (Article 13). Licenses for the operation of games of chance, however, were not issued by ENREJA itself, but remained under the responsibility of the Executive of the Province of Salta (Article 4).\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 25-27; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 140-147.\n\n37.\n\nOn 1 September 1999, the Executive of the Province of Salta passed Decree No. 3616/99.10 This Decree conferred an exclusive license to ENJASA for the operation of games of chance for a term of 30 years. The terms of the license provided that any breach of the conditions of the license, of Law No. 7020, and of any regulation issued by ENREJA were to be sanctioned with the penalties and sentencing provided for in Law No. 7020 (see Article 5.1 of the License). Furthermore, the license specified its causes of extinction and forfeiture (see Article 6 of the License). These included the lapse of the license term, noncompliance with the payment of the license fee, non-compliance with the obligations imposed under Article 5 of Law No. 7020, the exploitation of any game of chance without prior authorization by ENREJA, the cession or transfer, in full or in parts, of the operations covered by the license without prior authorization of the Executive, and the bankruptcy of the licensee.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 28-30; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 148-157.\n\n38.\n\nEqually on 1 September 1999, by Resolution No. 411/99, the Ministry of Production and Employment of the Province of Salta approved the Terms and Conditions for the Call for a National and International Public Tender to offer all Class A-shares of ENJASA for sale.11 Participants in the tender needed to have at least ten years experience in the operation of casinos and games of chance. Moreover, they had to submit a tourism development investment plan that included the number of employees to be hired and the amount of investments to be made, and they had to stipulate a yearly license fee to be paid to the Province for the term of the license.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 31-34; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 158-162.\n\n39.\n\nArticle 8.3 of the Terms and Conditions contained the following clause:12\n\n8.3. JURISDICCION\n\n8.3.1. Todos los interesados se someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n de los Tribunales ordinarios competentes de la Ciudad de Salta con renuncia a cualquier otra Jurisdicci\u00f3n.\n\n8.3.2. La adquisici\u00f3n del presente importa la aceptaci\u00f3n de esta Jurisdicci\u00f3n en toda la documentaci\u00f3n relacionada con esta Licitaci\u00f3n y el Contrato de Transferencia.\n\nExhibit C-030; Exhibit A RA 02. The Parties could not agree on a translation into English of this clause. Their respective translations are as follows:  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Claimants' Translation* 8.3.

S.A.**\") with a 90% participation. The UTE's bid included an offer on the license fee to be paid for the 30-year period (consisting initially of payments of USD 2,200,000 for the first three years and USD 3,500,000 for the following 27 years) and a plan to invest USD 20,770,000 in tourism development in the Province of Salta.13 This included the commitment to build a five-star hotel as well as hoteling and gastronomy schools in the City of Salta and to establish a fund for the promotion of tourism and culture in the Province. Following a request by the Ministry of Production and Employment, the bid was then revised, resulting in an offer with higher annual payments for the license of USD 2,500,000 per year for the first three years, and USD 4,100,000 per year for the following 27 years.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 35-39.

The Participation of Claimants in ENJASA**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nOn 15 February 2000, by Decree No. 419/00 the Executive of the Provice of Salta15 approved the Transfer Agreement which transferred the tendered shares in ENJASA to the UTE. The Transfer Agreement also extended the sanctions of Law No. 7020 to the buyer's breaches of the Transfer Agreement, the bid, or any other documentation that formed part of the tender (see Article 7.1.2 of the Transfer Agreement). Furthermore, Article 13 of the Transfer Agreement provided:16\n\nARTICULO DECIMO TERCERO: LEY APLICABLE Y JURISDICCION\n\n13.1. Este contrato ser\u00e1 interpretado de conformidad con la Ley Argentina y regulado por ella. A todos los efectos derivados del mismo las partes aceptan la jurisdicci\u00f3n exclusiva de los Tribunales Ordinarios de la Provincia de Salta, con renuncia a todo otro fuero o jurisdicci\u00f3n.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 40; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 169-175.\n\nExhibit A RA 11. The Parties agreed on the following translation of this clause: \"ARTICLE XIII: GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION 13.1. This Agreement shall be construed and governed by the laws of Argentina. To any effect derived therefrom, the parties submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ordinary Courts of the province of Salta, waiving any other forum or jurisdiction.\"\n\n43.\n\nThe UTE later requested that the shares be transferred to Leisure & Entertainment S.A. (\"**L&E**\"), a stock corporation under Argentine law, formed by the members of the UTE in accordance with their respective participation in the UTE (i.e., CAIH with 5%, Boldt S.A. with 5%, and Iberlux Int. S.A. with 90%). ENREJA authorized this transfer, and consequently ownership of the Class A-shares of ENJASA was registered in the name of L&E in the company register.17\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 50; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 176.\n\n44.\n\nThe remaining 10% of the shares in ENJASA continued to be held by the Province of Salta in order to implement the planned joint ownership participation program for former BPAS employees. However, on 19 October 2009, most of the beneficiaries of the joint ownership participation program authorized the Government of Salta to sell these shares. On 4 November 2009, L&E and the Province of Salta entered into an agreement for the purchase of these shares. Under this agreement and its successive amendments, L&E purchased almost all of the remaining shares in ENJASA, with the exception of a minor participation of 0.06% which remained with the Province of Salta under the joint ownership participation program because some of the former employees of BPAS had not agreed to the sale of their shares to L&E.18\n\nExhibit C-080. Memorial on the Merits, paras. 57-62; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, para. 177.\n\n45.\n\nAt the end of 2009, a minor participation in ENJASA was transferred by L&E to Complejo Monumento G\u00fcemes Sociedad An\u00f3nima (\"**CMG**\"), a share-company with its seat in Argentina owned by L&E (94.79%) and ENJASA (5.21 %). CMG currently holds a 0.51 shareholding in ENJASA.19\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 60, fn 85.\n\n46.\n\nAs a result of the above transactions, L&E currently holds 99.94% of the shares in ENJASA. The remaining 0.06% of the shares in ENJASA are still subject to the joint ownership participation program.\n\n47.\n\nThe ownership structure of L&E also changed over the course of the years.20 While Claimants, or rather their predecessors within the Casinos Group, held 5% of the shares in L&E from February 2000 to 2007, their participation increased to 60% in February 2007 as a result of purchasing 55% of L&E shares from Iberlux Int. S.A.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 50-56.\n\n48.\n\nOn 15 November 2013, CAI purchased the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E from Iberlux Int. S.A.; CAI then transferred 2% of the shares in L&E to CAIH, whose sole shareholder is CASAG. Thus, at present, CAI directly holds 98% of L&E. CASAG in turn indirectly holds 2% of L&E through its participation in CAIH and the remaining 98% through its participation in CAI. Consequently, CASAG indirectly controls 100% of L&E. Through L&E, CAI and CASAG in turn indirectly hold 99.94% of ENJASA's shares.\n\n49.\n\nThe current ownership structure in ENJASA therefore looks as follows:21\n\n*See* Exhibit C-017.\n\n50.\n\nThrough this structure, significant investments were made in the gaming, lottery and tourism sector in the Province of Salta. Claimants summarize these as follows:\n\nThe gaming and lottery business in the Province of Salta grew significantly as a result of the privatisation and the influx of capital provided by Claimants. This can be shown by a comparison between the situation before the privatisation and at the time of the revocation. In February 2000, before the privatisation, there were two casinos authorized to operate in Salta and 27 slot machine halls with 316 machines. None of these were operated by ENJASA. Moreover, in 1999 ENJASA had 239 employees, as evidenced by Article 1.1.1 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions. By the time of the revocation of the licence in August 2013, ENJASA operated four casinos, 15 slot machine halls and 14 lottery games, and in total 1,376 slot machines and 46 gaming tables. ENJASA was also one of the most significant employers in the Province, which crucially lacks domestic and foreign investment. When the licence was revoked, ENJASA had 750 employees, 600 of whom were transferred by governmental decree to other operators.22\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13. See for further detail on ENJASA's gaming and lottery operations, Memorial on the Merits, paras. 80-120.\n\n51.\n\nFurthermore, in August 2005, ENJASA opened the Sheraton Hotel Salta, the first five-star hotel in the region. Claimants claim that ENJASA invested more than USD 20,000,000 in the construction of the hotel. Although the hotel allegedly never generated any profits, it was part of the investment program that was promised to be undertaken as part of the privatization process. In addition, ENJASA sponsored two schools, one for hotel trade and one for gastronomy, and created the \"ENJASA Foundation\" for the promotion and research of cultural, tourist, hotel and gourmet activities in the Province of Salta, equally in fulfilment of the promises made in the course of the privatization of ENJASA.23 Respondent agrees that all obligations to invest in tourism undertaken under the Transfer Agreement had been fulfilled.24\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 121-133.\n\n*See* Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 182.\n\n52.\n\nENJASA also complied with its obligations to pay the license fee that was agreed with the Province of Salta.25 This fee, which was originally agreed as a fixed fee in USD for the entire license term, was renegotiated in 2008 at the request of the Province of Salta through an agency created specifically for the review and renegotiation of public contracts and licenses, called Unidad de Revisi\u00f3n y Renegociaci\u00f3n de Contratos y Licencias otorgadas por la Administraci\u00f3n (\"**UNIREN**\"). The resulting agreement between ENJASA and UNIREN of 7 May 2008 was ratified by the Government of Salta through Decree No. 3428/08.26 As a consequence, the fee was changed from a fixed to a dynamic fee, which was calculated as a percentage of the annual income of ENJASA.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 134-137.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 157-186; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 178-184.\n\n**3. The Revocation of ENJASA's Exclusive License**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 11 December 2012, ENREJA opened three separate investigations into alleged breaches of ENJASA of its obligations under the regulatory framework governing the operations of games of chance.27 One investigation related to compliance of ENJASA with its obligations concerning anti-money laundering in the administration of a lottery game (Resolution No. 380/12 of ENREJA), one to compliance with anti-money laundering rules in the operation of one of ENJASA's casinos (Resoution No. 381/12 of ENREJA), and one to compliance with ENJASA's obligation not to hire operators without ENREJA's authorization (Resolution No. 384/12 of ENREJA).\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 228-236; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 382-448.\n\n54.\n\nENJASA responded to the investigations initiated through Resolutions Nos. 380/12 and 381/12 on 2 January 2013.28 Its response to the investigation under Resolution No. 384/12 followed on 28 June 2013.29\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 242-287.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 288-317.\n\n55.\n\nOn 13 August 2013, in Resolution No. 240/13, ENREJA made a joint determination on all three investigations.30 In all instances, ENREJA concluded, ENJASA had violated its obligations under the regulatory framework in place. ENJASA had violated anti-money laundering provisions and had breached the obligation not to hire operators without ENREJA's authorization. In light of previous instances of non-compliance with the regulatory framework, ENREJA concluded that the appropriate sanction was the revocation of ENJASA's license.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-031; *See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 31.\n\n56.\n\nEqually on 13 August 2013, by Decree No. 2348/13, the Governor of Salta ordered ENREJA to prepare a transition plan to transfer ENJASA's operations, including its employees, to new operators.31\n\n*See* Exhibit C-222; *See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 318-319; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 478-480.\n\n**4. Developments after the Revocation of ENJASA's License**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nOn 27 August 2013, a meeting took place between Mr. Tucek, the CEO of CAI, and representatives of the Government of the Province of Salta. During this meeting, Claimants assert:\n\n[...] Mr Tucek was informed that the government of Salta believed that the level of involvement of CAI and CASAG in ENJASA was not sufficient and that the participation of Iberlux Int. S.A. in L&E was not considered a positive aspect.\n\nThe government of Salta was of the opinion that CAI's and CASAG's partner in L&E was a strawman of Mr Romero, the former Governor of Salta, and political rival of Mr Juan Manuel Urtubey.\n\nBased on this information, Mr Tucek recommended to CAI's management board to increase CAI's participation in L&E and, therefore, its indirect ownership share in ENJASA.32\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 334-336.\n\n58.\n\nFollowing this meeting, the purchase by Claimants of the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E from Iberlux Int. S.A. was concluded on 15 November 2013.33\n\n*See supra* para. 48.\n\n59.\n\nOn 28 August 2013, ENJASA filed a Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13.34 In this Recourse, ENJASA argued that Resolution No. 240/13 was unlawful and should be revoked. ENJASA, inter alia, claimed that several of the investigated instances, which were found to be in breach of the regulatory framework, had prescribed under the statute of limitations; that ENJASA had not hired \"operators\" in the meaning of Law No. 7020, but merely contracted out certain services to third parties, or had engaged persons that were allowed to operate games of chance under preexisting authorizations issued by BPAS; and that ENJASA had not breached any anti-money laundering rules. ENJASA further claimed that Resolution No. 240/13 was passed in breach of its right to be heard, that the Resolution's motivation was insufficient, was based on the retroactive application of certain regulatory rules, and constituted a disproportionate reaction to minor breaches or simple human errors. ENJASA's recourse also mentioned the reservation of any rights arising under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\nExhibit C-213. *See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 329-330; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, paras. 466-470.\n\n60.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, ENJASA requested interim relief before the First Instance Court of Salta, asking for the suspension of the implementation of Resolution No. 240/13 pending its Recourse for Reconsideration.35 This request was granted on 4 October 2013.36\n\nExhibit C-214; Exhibit A RA 77. *See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 331; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 481.\n\nExhibit C-215, Exhibit A RA 78. *See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 332; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 481.\n\n61.\n\nOn 19 November 2013, ENREJA passed Resolution No. 315/13, dismissing ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration.37 In it, ENREJA addressed the arguments brought by ENJASA in its Recourse for Reconsideration and rejected them as unfounded.\n\nExhibit C-032. *See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 342-346; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, para. 471.\n\n62.\n\nOn 20 November 2013, a meeting between Mr. Tucek and Mr. Schreiner of Casinos and representatives of ENREJA and the Province of Salta took place. During this meeting the modalities of transition of ENJASA's operations to new operators were discussed. Claimants claim that Mr. De Angelis, the Province's Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, offered Claimants to continue operating one of the casinos, \"Casino Salta\", an offer Claimants claim to have declined because it was not economically feasible.38 Subsequently, the Province of Salta allegedly extended an offer to continue operating one additional casino, an offer Claimants claim to have denied as well.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 356-357.\n\n63.\n\nOn 20 November 2013, by Decree No. 3330/13, the Government of the Province of Salta approved the Temporary Plan for the exploitation of games of chance prepared by ENREJA.39 The Plan established conditions for the issuance of new operator licenses. It contained a list of 11 individuals and entities that were to receive such licenses, several of which ENJASA had contracted before to operate its gaming activities and which ENREJA considered were hired by ENJASA without ENREJA's authorization.\n\nExhibit C-033. *See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 347-350; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, paras. 490-492.\n\n64.\n\nOn 26 November 2013, ENJASA requested the extension of the interim relief granted by the First Instance Court of Salta, pending an Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 ENJASA had brought in the same court.40 The request for interim relief was rejected on 23 December 2013.41\n\n*See* Exhibit A RA 153.\n\nExhibit C-288.\n\n65.\n\nOn 28 and 29 November 2013, by Resolutions Nos. 332-339/13, ENREJA implemented the Transition Plan in relation to several of the new operators and approved the transfer of employees of ENJASA to those new operators.42\n\nExhibits C-034 through C-041. *See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 351-353; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 495.\n\n66.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, ENJASA filed a Recourse for Revocation of Decree No. 3330/13. This recourse was rejected as inadmissible by Decree No. 1002/16 on 12 July 2016.43\n\n*See* Exhibit C-289.\n\n67.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, ENJASA filed Recourses for Revocation of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 332-339/13. These recourses appear to be still undecided.44\n\n*See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 326.\n\n68.\n\nOn 30 December 2013, ENREJA passed Resolution No. 364/13, with which it implemented the Transition Plan for Casino Salta, and approved the transfer of ENJASA's employees to a new operator.45\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 358; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 497.\n\n69.\n\nOn 5 February 2014, ENJASA filed an Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 and of Decrees Nos. 2348/13 and 330/13 with the First Instance Court of Salta.46 In this recourse, ENJASA not only claimed that the revocation of its operating license was contrary to domestic law; it also invoked breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT.47 In particular, ENJASA argued that the Argentina-Austria BIT was applicable because ENJASA's shares were indirectly owned by CAI, thus qualifying as an investment in the sense of Article 1(1) of the BIT, which was owned by a covered investor in the sense of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT. Furthermore, ENJASA argued that the conduct of ENREJA and of the Province of Salta was attributable under public international law to the Republic of Argentina and resulted in an uncompensated expropriation contrary to Article 4 of the BIT and in a breach of fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article 2(1) of the BIT. This action is still pending.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-221. *See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 361; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, para. 472.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-221, pp. 130-131.\n\n70.\n\nOn 30 April 2014, CAI sent a letter to Respondent, putting the latter officially on notice of the dispute under the Argentina-Austria BIT, inviting her to conduct amicable consultations, and accepting her offer to submit the dispute to arbitration under Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT.48\n\n*See* Exhibit C-008.\n\n71.\n\nOn 29 May 2014, the Province of Salta issued Decree No. 1502/14, granting ten-year licenses to the new operators as determined in Decree No. 3330/13.49\n\n*See* Exhibit C-176. *See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 362; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and CounterMemorial on the Merits, para. 504.\n\n72.\n\nOn 24 June 2014, ENJASA filed a Recourse for Revocation of Decree No. 1502/14. This recourse was dismissed on 12 July 2016.50\n\n*See* Exhibit C-289.\n\n73.\n\nOn 7 August 2014, CASAG requested Respondent to be joined into the amicable consultations initiated by CAI and accepted Respondent's offer to arbitrate under Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT.51\n\n*See* Exhibit C-012.\n\n74.\n\nUntil 21 October 2014, Claimants sent, in addition to its letters of 30 April and 7 August 2014, five further letters to Respondent and the Governor of the Province of Salta relating to the present dispute.\n\n75.\n\nIn parallel to the letters sent to Respondent, Mr. Wajntraub, a lawyer representing the Province of Salta, got in touch with Claimants on 22 October 2014 to discuss the dispute relating to the revocation of ENJASA's license. Following several email exchanges, a meeting between Mr Wajntraub and Claimants' counsel took place in Vienna on 13 March 2015, without however reaching any conclusion regarding the dispute.\n\n**V. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n76.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction on the grounds that:\n\nthere is no *prima facie* claim for violation of the Argentina-Austria BIT, that Claimants have not accepted the offer made by the Argentine Republic to submit disputes to arbitration, and that Claimants are not the owners of the asset which they invoke as investment and which was affected by the revocation\u2014that is to say, ENJASA's licence.52\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 1.\n\n***A. There is no claim for a prima facie violation of the BIT***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no *prima facie* jurisdiction because none of the claims are objectively capable of constituting breaches of the BIT. Instead, in Respondent's view, the essence of the dispute concerns the revocation of ENJASA's license, which makes it into a contractual, rather than a treaty claim, for which recourse must be had in contractual forum rather than the one provided for under the Argentina-Austria BIT.53\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 1.\n\n*(i) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over claims that prima facie are not objectively based on the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants' claims are entirely based on the revocation of the Licence to operate games of chance on the Province of Salta granted to ENJASA.54 For Respondent, these claims, as argued, do not constitute claims under the BIT but are, in essence, contractual claims that are only characterized by Claimants as BIT claims.55 Argentina disputes Claimants' assertion that the Tribunal's analysis at this stage should be limited to considering whether the facts as presented are capable of constituting a breach of the BIT standards. To the contrary, in order to establish a *prima facie* connection with the Treaty, Respondent considers Claimants' legal characterization of their claims should not be accepted as such and without analysis, but the claims need to be objectively connected to concrete violations of the substantive standards of treatment laid down in the BIT.56\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 2-23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 24-26.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 38; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 17-20.\n\n*(ii) None of the claims are based prima facie on the BIT*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the direct and indirect expropriation claims, as well as the claims concerning fair and equitable treatment and national treatment, are all based on a breach of the Licence and its consequences, and therefore constitute contract claims (or claims relating to the application of the regulatory framework governing the Licence). This is confirmed by the terms of the Licence itself which governs, together with domestic law, the consequences of a breach such that:\n\nany claim involving actions by ENREJA, taken in accordance with the legal framework of the Licence, constitutes a claim under the provisions of the Bidding Terms (insofar as it regulates the exercise of the Licence) and the Licence itself (which sets forth obligations of the Licensee and potential sanctions to be applied by ENREJA).57\n\nSuch claims, in Respondent's view, are not treaty claims. The distinction between contract claims and treaty claims has long been recognized by arbitral tribunals with the conclusion that contract claims by themselves do not sustain a claim for breach of an international treaty.58\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 29-34.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 40-44; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 21-28.\n\n*(iii) ICSID arbitration is not the proper forum for this dispute*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nFurthermore, since there is no *prima facie* violation of the BIT, Respondent also contends, the proper forum for the present dispute are the courts of the Province of Salta, as provided for in the forum selection clause of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Transfer Agreement. Because the Bidding Terms and Conditions contain rules regarding the exercise of the Licence, and the claim concerns the exercise of the Licence, the proper forum is the jurisdiction which covers the exercise of the Licence.59\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 45-50; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 35-37; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 27-34.\n\n81.\n\nRespondent also clarifies that she does not argue that a forum selection clause in a contract necessarily precludes an arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction for claims under a BIT. Instead, what Respondent argues is that, since there are no claims for breach of the BIT, it is the contractual forum, namely the courts of the Province of Salta, that is competent to hear the present dispute.60\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 38-40.\n\n82.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the fact that provincial courts have jurisdiction over the present dispute is further confirmed by Claimants' submission of a judicial claim to these very courts in order to comply with Article 8 of the BIT. For Respondent, Claimants cannot \"on the one hand, [submit] a judicial claim to the province's courts under the BIT and, on the other hand, [argue] that the provincial forum is not appropriate to hear their claim under the BIT.\" In the same sense, Respondent argues, Claimants cannot expect to rely on the legal framework applicable to the Licence to ascertain the existence of an investment, while at the same time disregarding the forum selection clause included in the same provisions.61\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 49; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 41-44 (quote at para. 42).\n\n83.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants' argument that the dispute is beyond the scope *ratione personae* of the forum selection clause in the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Transfer Agreement. According to Respondent, the clause is applicable to Claimants; to argue otherwise is contrary to Argentine law.62\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 45-48.\n\n***B. There is no consent to arbitrate because Claimants failed to accept Argentina's offer to arbitrate in the BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nRespondent further contends that consent to arbitration under the BIT was never perfected as Claimants failed to comply with the conditions for consent listed in Article 8 of the BIT.63\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 51; Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 49; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\n*(i) Article 8 of the BIT contains compulsory jurisdictional requirements and is part of Respondent's offer to arbitrate*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the unilateral consent given in the BIT constitutes an offer to arbitrate subject to several conditions. An investor must accept this offer on the terms on which it was made. This means that an investor must comply with these conditions in order to perfect consent. An acceptance purportedly given under different or modified terms is not capable of perfecting consent.64\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 55-63; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 50-54 and 57-59.\n\n86.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the compulsory nature of the conditions is \"irrespective of whether the investor believes them to be useful or convenient.\"65 In addition to being compulsory, these conditions are cumulative and must be fulfilled in a certain order: first, there must be an attempt to settle the dispute through negotiations with the State during a period of six months; second, if the dispute is not resolved through negotiations, it must be submitted to the domestic courts of the host State; third, if the dispute persists after 18 months, either because no decision was rendered on the merits or because the parties are still in dispute despite such decision having been rendered, the investor must withdraw the domestic claim before bringing a claim to international arbitration.66\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 55-56.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 60 and 62-67.\n\n*(ii) Claimants did not accept the offer on the terms on which it was made*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants not only failed to comply with the conditions individually, but they also failed to follow the sequence of the provisions by submitting the dispute to domestic courts before engaging in amicable negotiations with the State.\n\na) Claimants failed to follow the order of the jurisdictional requirements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even though Claimants purport to have submitted the dispute to domestic courts months after they commenced amicable negotiations, the facts prove that Claimants filed a complaint with the courts of the Province of Salta on 5 February 2014 -almost three months before they notified the dispute and started negotiations on 30 April 2014.67 However, under Article 8 of the BIT, settlement negotiations of six months had to precede recourse to domestic courts.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 72-77; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 68-73; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 49.\n\nb) Claimants failed to meet the requirement of amicable negotiations for six months\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nRespondent further contends that the six-months period is not merely a cooling-off period, but a period during which the parties must attempt to settle the dispute amicably as a precondition for the submission of the dispute to the Argentine courts.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimants' contention that negotiations must only be attempted whenever possible and contends that Claimants' statement that negotiations would have been ineffective is speculative and aimed at justifying Claimants' failure to meet the negotiation requirement.68\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 79.\n\n91.\n\nInstead, what follows from witness testimony, in Respondent's view, is that the Argentine authorities were willing to engage in consultations and that it was Claimants who did not intend to resolve the dispute through negotiations.69\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 80-84; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66.\n\nc) Claimants failed to meet the requirement of submission to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction for 18 months\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent also disputes Claimants' allegations that under Article 8 of the BIT, resort to domestic jurisdiction is not entirely unconditional; that there is no requirement to submit to domestic jurisdiction when there are no competent administrative authorities or courts; and that the term \"dispute\" is to be understood broadly, such that the action filed by Claimants on 28 August 2013 complied with the requirements of Article 8(2) of the BIT. On the contrary, Respondent contends that the submission to domestic jurisdiction is mandatory and that Claimants' reliance of the word \"may\" in Article 8(2) of the BIT is deliberately taken out of context, that there were competent courts and administrative authorities to address Claimants' grievance, and that the term \"dispute\" submitted domestically could not be different from that submitted to international arbitration. Consequently, in Respondent's view, Article 8 of the BIT does not permit unrestricted access to ICSID jurisdiction.70\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 70-89; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 85-87.\n\n93.\n\nFirst, Respondent relies on the *Wintershall* case in support of its argument that an offer to arbitrate given by a State can only be accepted by an investor in a way that meets all conditions of the offer.71 Respondent contends that the term \"may\" does not mean that recourse to domestic courts is discretionary. To the contrary, a contextual reading of Article 8(2) of the BIT indicates that it does not contain options, but requires a mandatory sequential recourse to local courts, as a second step after amicable consultations, prior to submission of the dispute to international arbitration. The only circumstance in which submission to domestic court proceedings would not be required is if the Parties had agreed to disregard this step, which is not the case with the present dispute. Failing such agreement, Respondent emphasizes, recourse to local courts constitutes a jurisdictional requirement. Moreover, Respondent points out that international tribunals have found that the absence of imperative language does not equal the absence of a mandatory requirement nor mean that the treaty language can be ignored.72\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 88-89 (relying on *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008), paras. 116-117 (AL RA 38)).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 90-100.\n\n94.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that \"there are numerous jurisdictional forums available to which Claimants can resort to submit this dispute\" at the domestic level in Argentina. In particular, \"it is clear that the courts of the Province of Salta [\u2026] are the \u2018competent' forum pursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT,\" as demonstrated by the fact that \"the Bidding Terms, the Agreement and the License explicitly stipulated that any dispute concerning the License must be submitted to the courts of the Province of Salta\" and by the fact that Claimants themselves made use of those courts. According to Argentina, the courts of the Province of Salta were not only competent to hear disputes concerning the License, but \"also to apply the BIT.\" Respondent further disputes the argument that exhaustion of administrative remedies would have been required to bring the relevant action before Argentine courts. It points out that no exhaustion of administrative remedies is required when the judicial action is intended to challenge a final act of individual scope that is \"carried out by the Executive Power or the higher authority of a decentralized entity.\"73\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 101-113; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 80, 82-86.\n\n95.\n\nRespondent also counters Claimants' argument that the Request for Reconsideration that ENJASA had submitted against ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13 qualified as a submission of the dispute to an administrative jurisdiction in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and that the subsequent dismissal of that recourse through ENREJA's Resolution No. 315/13 constituted a decision on the merits,74 which allowed recourse to international arbitration under Article 8(3)(b) of the BIT. In this respect, Respondent argues that what Claimants filed was not a claim for breach of the BIT by the State, but a Request for Reconsideration that concerned an unrelated claim between different parties and that could not have possibly resolved the dispute under the BIT. Consequently, ENJASA's administrative recourses were insufficient to meet the BIT's requirement to have recourse to a domestic jurisdiction. ENJASA's recourse against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 in the courts of Salta, in turn, did not meet the requirements under the BIT for prior submission to domestic courts, because that recourse was filed on 5 February 2014, which is only 10 months before the dispute was submitted to ICSID arbitration - as opposed to the 18 months required by Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.75\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 88.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 114-119.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimants' argument that prior submission of the dispute to Argentine courts was not necessary, due to futility, because Argentine courts were allegedly unable to resolve that dispute within the 18-months timeframe established in the BIT. According to Respondent, this argument is refuted by the \"numerous decisions rendered by the Argentine courts in less than eighteen months, both final and interim, and in both summary and ordinary proceedings.\" Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants had at their disposal \"numerous abbreviated means to have the dispute heard\" in domestic courts. In addition, there is no applicable \"guarantee\" in the BIT or elsewhere that the dispute should be resolved within 18 months.76\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 120-124; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 97-99.\n\n97.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that the dispute filed with domestic courts cannot be different from that which is submitted to international arbitration, as this would defeat the purpose of giving local courts an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Respondent contends that the facts, cause of action, and the parties in the present proceedings and those before domestic courts had to be the same; the term \"dispute\", in Respondent's view, could not be interpreted broadly, as suggested by Claimants, to include just any dispute related to the investment in question without identity of the parties and of the cause of action. Respondent considers that the dispute submitted by ENJASA to local courts was different from the one submitted to the present arbitration proceedings, and therefore failed to meet the requirements of the BIT.77\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 82-86; Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 126-133; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 69-79.\n\nd) Alternatively, if the request filed with local courts is considered compliant with the terms of Article 8, Claimants still failed to withdraw from the pending judicial proceeding\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nRespondent finally refers to Article 8(4) of the BIT, which requires disputing parties to take all required measures to withdraw from any pending judicial proceedings. Respondent contends that this is a requirement of the host State's consent in the BIT. For Respondent, it is significant that this requirement is included in few of its BITs and in only one of Austria's BITs, thus denoting its essential nature. Respondent notes that ENJASA continues to pursue domestic court proceedings rather than having taken all required measures to withdraw from such proceedings. In Respondent's view, this is not only in contravention of the express terms of Article 8(4), but also \"irreconciliable with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\" Claimants therefore have failed to accept the terms of Argentina's offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 of the BIT.78\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 138-144; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 101-105 (quote at *id.*, para. 104).\n\n*(iii) Claimants cannot rely on the most-favoured-nation (MFN) clause to perfect consent*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants having failed to accept the terms of the offer to arbitrate in Article 8 of the BIT, their belated reliance on the MFN clause is untimely; in addition, the clause does not apply to matters of jurisdiction.79\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 145; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 107-115.\n\na) Reliance on the MFN clause is inadmissible because it is untimely\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nRespondent contends that, for the first time in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction did Claimants invoke the BIT's MFN clause. According to Respondent, Claimants' belated submission is \"contrary to the general legal principle establishing that no one may set himself in contradiction to his own previous conduct (*non concedit venire contra factum proprium*, estoppel),\" which forms part of, or is recognized in, the Argentine legal system, as well as contrary to \"the principle of good faith, which is firmly established in international law.\"80 Claimants' reliance on the MFN clause is therefore inadmissible.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 146-150; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 107.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimants' belated invocation \"seriously impairs the Argentine Republic's right of defence\" as it makes the jurisdiction of the Centre \"a moving target\" for Respondent to address.81\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 151; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 108.\n\nb) The MFN clause does not apply to jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Respondent, an MFN clause does not apply to matters of jurisdiction because it is not an arbitration agreement and it is not part of the offer to arbitrate. For an MFN clause to apply to issues of jurisdiction it is necessary that the relevant treaty records \"the clear and unequivocal intention of the State Parties\" to consent to the use of the MFN clause in this manner, an aspect that is not shown in the present treaty.82\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 152; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.\n\n103.\n\nPrevious treaties concluded separately by Argentina and Austria did not include the requirement that the dispute be submitted to local courts for 18 months. Therefore, in Respondent's view, \"at the time when the BIT was executed, it would have been impossible for the parties to intend that the MFN clause be interpreted as sought by Claimants, since such interpretation would have deprived the dispute settlement provision of any effect as from the entry into force of the Treaty.\"83 In addition, the dispute settlement mechanisms of the relevant treaties are incompatible, in that the Argentina-Austria BIT includes a jurisdictional requirement to submit the dispute to the local courts, whereas the Argentina-Denmark BIT contains a fork-in-the-road provision. There is also no evidence that the treatment invoked through the MFN clause would be beneficial to the Claimants.84\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 153; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 110-112.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 113-115.\n\n104.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent counters Claimants' reliance on the *Maffezini* case,85 arguing that this decision should not be taken into account as good precedent, because both Spain and Argentina had confirmed their position, resulting in an \"authentic interpretation\", that the MFN clause in question, contrary to the finding of the tribunal in that case, was inapplicable to dispute settlement provisions.86 Similarly, other States had established expressly in subsequent treaties the non-applicability of MFN clauses to dispute settlement mechanisms \"as a consequence of the decisions in which the MFN clause was wrongly interpreted on the basis of *Maffezini.*\"87\n\n*Mafezzini v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (25 January 2000) (AL RA 44).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 154-156.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 157.\n\n105.\n\nListing investment cases that have rejected this approach, Respondent contends that ICSID cases that have accepted the applicability of the MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions are in the minority. Respondent further refers to the *Wintershall* case,88 where the tribunal analysed this disparity of approaches and found that the tribunal in *Maffezini*, proceeding on a presumption incorrectly derived from the *Ambatielos* case,89 incorrectly decided that dispute resolution provisions fell within the scope of MFN provisions unless there was clear evidence to the contrary.90 Respondent finally observes that its approach is also in line with the views of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on this issue.91\n\n*Winterschall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008) (AL RA 38).\n\n*Ambatielos (Greece v.

There is no jurisdiction ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nRespondent does not deny that a shareholding may constitute an investment under the BIT, but contends that Claimants have not put forward a claim concerning their rights as indirect shareholders.92 In any event, the claim pertaining to the 40% stake acquired in L&E after the revocation of the License, which is the event identified by Claimants as the starting point of the dispute, is inadmissible as it would constitute an abuse of process.93 Respondent further contends that Claimants' indirect shareholding does not transform them into owners of ENJASA's assets - in particular the License.94 For Respondent, Claimants incorrectly allege that ENJASA's operating license was their investment (although in their various submissions, Claimants have presented different versions of what constituted their alleged investment). However, since the Licence was held by ENJASA and not by Claimants, Respondent argues that Claimants did not own an investment protected under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.95 Respondent concludes that the revocation of the License cannot be submitted as a breach under the BIT.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 122; Hearing Transcript of 23 March 2017, pp. 108-109.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 169-173.\n\n*(i) The License is not an investment protected under the BIT and Claimants are not its holders*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nRespondent first of all contends that the License does not constitute an investment protected under the BIT, given that the BIT's definition of investment only includes concessions conferred by public law \"to explore and exploit natural resources,\" which the License is not. In any case, Respondent argues, the issue \"is not whether a Licence is an investment according to the definition of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, but whether the License that constitutes the subject matter of their claim is an investment owned by Claimants.\" According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to establish an ownership link between a protected investment and a protected investor under the Treaty. This is true for all of ENJASA's assets claimed to constitute investments.96 Under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, such ownership by the claimant, who must be a national of a State party to the treaties in question, is required to enjoy protection.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 174-177; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 120-121.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent points to the fact that, for Claimants' experts, the investment consisted of the indirect shareholding in ENJASA, not of the License held by ENJASA.97 Under Argentine law, the economic rights of the shareholders did not entail ownership of the corporate assets: \"[a] shareholder is the holder or owner of its shares, but this does not mean it is the owner of the assets of the corporation.\" Because the BIT required that the \"contents and scope of the rights relating to the various categories of assets [...] be determined by the laws (...) of the Contracting Party,\" Respondent concludes that it followed from the limitations established by the Argentine Companies Act No. 19550 on the economic rights of shareholders that Claimants, as ENJASA's shareholders, did not own the License granted to ENJASA and, therefore, the License could not be Claimants' investment under the BIT.98\n\nAccording to Argentina, the same follows from the fact that Claimants address the issue of the legality of the investment merely with regard to the shareholding in L&E, but not with regard to the Licence. *See* Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 185.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 178-181.\n\n109.\n\nRespondent further contends that the above conclusion is confirmed by the BIT's definition of investor, by its provision on dispute settlement, and by the BIT's standards of protection. These provisions all make clear that \"the only protected investments are those owned by an investor that are affected by measures that allegedly breach the Argentina-Austria BIT,\" while excluding disputes \"in relation to measures affecting assets that are not owned by that investor or that do not constitute an investment.\"99\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 182-185.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent concludes from the above that Claimants' claim before this Tribunal is \"invalid\" because the dispute does not arise directly from an investment protected under the ICSID Convention and the BIT of which Claimants are the owners.100\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 186.\n\n*(ii) Claimants have no standing to bring an action in respect of the assets of ENJASA*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRespondent further contends that the principle that shareholders may not bring an action concerning the rights of the companies of which they are shareholders is a principle recognized by international law.\n\n112.\n\nIn this context, Respondent relies on arbitration awards and ICJ judgments rendered to the effect that shareholders are not entitled to bring an action in respect of the rights of the companies in which they hold shares, regardless of whether the shareholding is direct or indirect. Moreover, Respondent observes, the distinction between a company and its shareholders is widely recognized by legal systems, and is also acknowledged by Claimants.101\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 188-192; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123 (*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), paras. 142-144 (AL RA 152)).\n\n113.\n\nRespondent infers from the terminology used by Claimants, namely that it holds \"direct and indirect assets,\" that Claimants are not the holders of the Licence, the casinos, the slot machine halls, and the lottery operations, nor are they employers of the relevant employees. As a consequence, Claimants cannot bring action regarding measures that may have affected alleged investments related to them, but which they did not directly hold.102 In Respondent's view, Claimants' argument that the Licence is part of their operations, as well as their reliance on *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, are to no avail as CSOB directly owned the operation in respect of which it submitted its claim.103\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 193-195.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 196-197 (referring to *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisidiction (24 May 1999), para. 75 (AL RA 153)).\n\n114.\n\nRespondent also points to Article 4(3) of the BIT, which provides that a shareholder may bring a claim concerning certain assets of the company in which it holds shares. According to Respondent, however, this article establishes two requirements: (a) that the affected asset of the company constitutes a \"financial asset\", and (b) that the challenged measure qualifies as an expropriation.104\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 198; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 125-132.\n\n115.\n\nRegarding the first requirement, Respondent refers to a discrepancy between the Spanish and German versions of the BIT, being the Treaty's authentic languages. While the Spanish version refers to \"*activos financieros*\", the German version uses the term *\"Vermogenswerte\".* Claimants' translation into English of the relevant part of the BIT refers only to \"assets\" and not to \"financial assets\", the scope of the latter term being more limited. If Claimants were to hold that \"assets\" is an accurate translation of the German text, in Respondent's view, an interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties would confirm that the narrower notion of \"financial assets\" best reconciles the texts. Respondent also adds that this limitation \"is no obstacle to the achievement of the object and purpose of the BIT,\" as established in the treaty's Preamble.105 Consequently, in Respondent's view, the protection of shareholders under the BIT is limited to situations where \"financial assets\" of their company were expropriated. ENJASA's license, however, did not qualify as such a \"financial asset\".\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 199-211.\n\n116.\n\nRegarding the second requirement, Respondent argues that even if one considered that actions may be brought by shareholders in respect of company assets under Article 4(3) of the BIT, this provision would limit those actions to claims for expropriation, and exclude claims concerning the standards of fair and equitable treatment and national treatment from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.106\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 212-213.\n\n**2. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n117.\n\nClaimants counter all of Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. They argue that they have made out a *prima facie* claim for the violation of the BIT, that Respondent has validly consented to the present arbitration proceedings in Article 8 of the BIT, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n***A. Prima facie claim for the violation of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nClaimants claim that the revocation of its exclusive license was only superficially based on alleged violations of anti-money laundering rules and the hiring of operators without ENREJA's authorization. Instead, they argue, the motive for the revocation was to oust Claimants from the operation of gaming facilites and lottery activities in Salta in order to distribute their business to new operators at conditions more favourable to the Province.\n\n119.\n\nTo make this case, Claimants allege that Resolution No. 240/13 was passed arbitrarily following a letter sent to ENREJA by Videodrome S.A., a company which had leased slot machines to ENJASA and which had been in a joint venture with ENJASA for the installation and exploitation of slot machines in one casino in Salta since 2001. Claimants contend, Videodrome S.A. suggested to ENREJA that it could operate gaming facilities in Salta at more favorable conditions than ENJASA. Claimants claim that this letter contributed to the decision to oust ENJASA from its position in the gaming sector in the Province.\n\n120.\n\nMoreover, Claimants argue that political rivalries in the Province of Salta played a role in the revocation of ENJASA's license. To this end, they claim that, during a meeting with representatives of the Province of Salta on 27 August 2013, Mr. Tucek was informed that the real reason behind the revocation of ENJASA's license was the participation in L&E of the Uruguayan company Iberlux Int. S.A., which was allegedly held by a strawman of the former Governor of the Province of Salta, a political rival of the present Governor. For Claimants, the purchase of the remaining 40% shares in L&E from Iberlux Int. S.A. in November 2013 was a step towards reinstalling ENJASA exclusive license.\n\n121.\n\nClaimants therefore claim that the revocation of the License was not a case of *bona fide* enforcement of the laws in place in Salta, but \"a coordinated action of ENREJA and the government of Salta to create the impression that the revocation was justified and urgent.\"107\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 320.\n\n122.\n\nIn a nutshell, Claimants describe their claim as follows:\n\nIn 2013, the government of Salta took a series of orchestrated administrative measures leading to the revocation of [ENJASA's] gaming licence. The revocation of the licence was based on fabricated breaches of the regulatory framework and of anti-money laundering provisions, in total disregard of the actual facts and of ENJASA's due process rights. Following the revocation of the licence, some of ENJASA's former local business partners were awarded the rights to operate the gaming businesses previously held by ENJASA under its exclusive licence. Most of ENJASA's employees were assigned to the new operators. The administrative proceedings initiated against ENJASA by the provincial authorities were part of a concerted plan to take over the Claimants' investment without the payment of compensation.\n\nAs a consequence of the arbitrary and unlawful revocation of the license, ENJASA could not any longer carry on its business. ENJASA's operations were shut down and its management was forced to wind up its remaining assets. The Claimants effectively lost their investment.108\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 9-10.\n\n123.\n\nAgainst this background, Claimants argue that the claim brought in the present proceedings meets the test for a *prima facie* claim. Under that test, Claimants argue that their claims qualify as treaty claims that are subject to the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal. While taking the revocation of ENJASA's license as their starting point, Claimants consider their claims to qualify as constituting treaty claims, not contract claims. Furthermore, Claimants argue, the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal is also not barred by the forum selection clauses that are contained in the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Transfer Agreement concluded with the Province of Salta during ENJASA's privatization.\n\n*(i) The claims brought are treaty claims*\n------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClaimants argue that under the *prima facie* test applied in international dispute settlement, including in investment treaty arbitration, the Tribunal must only ascertain, as stated in *SGS v. Philippines*, whether \"the facts as alleged by the Claimant and as appearing from the initial pleadings fairly raise questions of breach of one or more provisions of the BIT.\"109 This test, Claimants continue, \"is two pronged. First, it requires tribunals to base their jurisdictional decision on the facts *\u2018as pleaded* or \u2018 *as alleged* by the claimant. [...] Second, it then requires the tribunal to determine whether the facts pleaded by the claimant \u2018 *fairly raise questions of breach* ' or \u2018 *may constitute possible breaches of* ' one or more substantive treaty provisions.\"110 Hence, it is for Claimants to characterize their case and to show that breach of the BIT based on the alleged facts in question is \"reasonably arguable on its face\" or \"sufficiently serious to proceed to a full hearing on the merits\" or that they have \"a reasonable possibility as pleaded.\"111\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 68; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66 (both quoting *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

First, they dispute Respondent's qualification of the License granted to ENJASA as a contract; instead they argue that the License was granted unilaterally by an administrative act of the Executive Branch of the Province of Salta under public law.114 Second, rather than constituting an exercise of a contractual right by the Province, the revocation of the License was, Claimants contend, an exercise of public authority by ENREJA in the exercise of its statutory powers under Law No. 7020.115\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 99-103.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 104-119; 158-173.\n\n127.\n\nThird, Claimants point out that they are not asking for relief under the License or any (other) contractual arrangements, but consider that the facts alleged qualify as a breach of the BIT. In particular, they argue that the License was not revoked for a legitimate public purpose, but as a result of a \"coordinated action of ENREJA and the Government of Salta\" through the use of \"orchestrated administrative proceedings.\"116 For Claimants, these administrative proceedings had the sole purpose of ousting ENJASA from the operation of gaming facilities and lottery activities under its exclusive license and to redistribute ENJASA operations to other operators under conditions more favorable for the Province of Salta. In Claimants' view, the revocation of ENJASA's license through Resolution No. 240/13 was only a pretext; it was not based on legitimate grounds.117 It was taken in breach of domestic law and in violation of due process, of the principle of proportionality, and of the prohibition to apply regulatory requirements retroactively.118\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 320 and 322.\n\n*See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 85-95.\n\n*See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123.\n\n128.\n\nAs a result of the revocation of ENJASA's license and the subsequent transfer of its operations to new operators, Claimants argue, their investment in Argentina was destroyed and their assets transferred to other operators.119 Furthermore, none of the new operators were subject to the same conditions that had been applied to ENJASA; the new operators also did not have to participate in a comparable public tender; their operations were also not subject to similar harassment and reviews of their compliance with anti-money laudering regulations. Finally, the new operators were awarded new operating licenses although some of them had been participants in what ENREJA had considered as an unlawful hiring of operators by ENJASA.120\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 120-122.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 86-88.\n\n129.\n\nThese facts, Claimants allege, constitute (1) a (direct and indirect) expropriation of their investment without compensation in violation of Article 4 of the BIT,121 (2) a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, in particular its requirements of transparency, stability and protection of legitimate expectations, procedural propriety and due process, good faith, and freedom from coercion and harassment,122 and (3) a breach of national treatment in light of the more favorable treatment the new operators had received as compared to ENJASA.123\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 68-83; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 124-137.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 84-85; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 138-145.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 86-88; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 146-157.\n\n*(ii) The forum selection clauses do not bar jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nClaimants also counter Respondent's argument that the forum selection clauses in favor of the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Salta, contained in Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and in Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement, constitute a bar to the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal. Claimants forward two arguments in this respect.124\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 89-98; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 79-89; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 189.\n\n131.\n\nFirst, Claimants point out that these forum selection clauses do not apply *ratione personae* to the parties to the present proceedings. They only apply to disputes between the Province of Salta and the UTE, that is, CAIH, Boldt S.A, and Iberlux Int. S.A., and Claimants as their successors.125\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 90; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 86.\n\n132.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that the forum selection clauses do not apply *ratione materiae* to the dispute at hand because the dispute before the Tribunal \"does not relate to the Bidding Terms and Conditions, the performance of the licence and the transfer of ENJASA's shares. Rather, it relates to the Argentine Republic's breaches of obligations under international law and, in particular, the BIT.\"126 To this end, Claimants point out that the revocation of the License was a regulatory act which took place in the exercise of ENREJA's police powers.127 In Claimants' view, the revocation of the License was therefore clearly not of a contractual nature. Moreover, the reference in the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Transfer Agreement to the need for the licensee to comply with the obligations stipulated in Law No. 7020 did not make the revocation of the License a contractual matter.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 91.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 80-81.\n\n133.\n\nIn addition, Claimants point out that the practice of arbitral tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations confirms that \"[a]s a general rule, a forum selection clause in a contract with the host state does not bar the submission of claims pursuant to the dispute resolution clause of an international investment protection treaty.\"128 In this context, Claimants refer to decisions by arbitral tribunals rendered against both Respondent and other States.129\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 94-97.\n\nClaimants make reference to *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003), para. 76 (AL RA 13); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (11 May 2005), para. 112 (CL-082), as well as to a large number of tribunal decisions in cases against other respondents).\n\n***B. Respondent consented validly to the present proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nClaimants also contend that they validly accepted Respondent's offer to arbitrate under Article 8 of the BIT. To this effect, they argue that strict compliance with the various procedural requirements of Article 8 \"is not a condition for the validity of the Parties' consent to arbitration.\"130 Instead, for Claimants, compliance with Article 8 of the BIT raises merely questions of admissibility.131\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 91.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 194 (invoking *Urbaser S.A. et al. v.

Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction (24 June 1998), p. 42, para. 84 (CL-132)).\n\n135.\n\nFor Claimants, the dispute arose with the passing of Resolution No. 240/13, not with Resolution No. 315/13. In this light, Claimants argue that they complied with the requirement to engage in amicable consultations under Article 8(1) of the BIT prior to submitting the dispute to domestic administrative authorities under Article 8(2) of the BIT, and that they obtained in those administrative proceedings a decision on the merits that allowed them to access international arbitration pursuant to Article 8(3) of the BIT. Claimants therefore contend that they did not violate the sequence of procedural steps required under Article 8(1) through (3) of the BIT. Claimants add that recourse to any other domestic remedy, as suggested by the Repondent, was either not possible or futile. Claimants also argue that Article 8(4) of the BIT, which requires the withdrawal of proceedings before domestic courts once the international arbitral tribunal is installed, does not constitute a bar to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n136.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimants point out that by now ENJASA's judicial claim against Resolution No. 315/13 had been pending undecidedly in the courts of Salta for more than 18 months. Moreover, the MFN clause in Article 3 of the BIT would grant them jurisdiction anyway.\n\n*(i) Compliance with the requirement for amicable consultations (Article 8(1) of the BIT)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nClaimants first point out that Article 8(1) of the BIT only requires to engage in amicable consultations \"as far as possible\". This indicates that the BIT does not require unconditional consultations.132\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 107-123 (still relying on a slightly different translation of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT into English which stated \"whenever possible\"); Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 95-108; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 196-252.\n\n138.\n\nClaimants also consider that they complied with the consultation requirement under different perspectives. Claimants contend that the meeting on 27 August 2013 between Mr. Tucek of CAI and representatives of the Province of Salta, during which a solution to the dispute was attempted, already qualified as a start of amicable consultations; it was followed by further meetings between these parties.133 Given that the conduct of the Province of Salta was attributable to Respondent under international law, negotiations conducted with the Province should be considered, Claimants argue, as negotiations between Claimants and Respondent.134\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 223-233.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 239-242.\n\n139.\n\nClaimants further contend that CAI's letter to the Argentine Republic of 30 April 2014, followed by seven further letters sent to the Argentine Republic and the Governor of the Province of Salta, also continued the consultations.135\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 235.\n\n140.\n\nClaimants also argue that their efforts at finding a negotiated solution of the dispute were genuine.136 Respondent's arguments to the contrary, in particular in connection with the correspondence and contact with Mr. Wajntraub, in Claimants' view, did not show otherwise, as Mr. Wajntraub allegedly had not engaged in constructive discussions.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 238.\n\n*(ii) Compliance with requirement to submit the dispute to a domestic jurisdiction (Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nClaimants further contend that they fulfilled their obligation under Article 8(2) of the BIT to submit the dispute to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction.137 They assert that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13 was a recourse to the competent administrative jurisdiction.138 In this context, Claimants point out that \"competent administrative jurisdiction\" is a term which the BIT - unlike most other BITs to which either Argentina or Austria are party - specifically mentions. Furthermore, Claimants assert that the amicable consultations started before the dispute was submitted. Yet, as they only were required under Article 8(2) of the BIT to conduct amicable consultations \"as far as possible\" before submitting the dispute to the domestic authorities, they were not required to consult for full six months given that the Recourse for Reconsideration had to be introduced under domestic law within 15 days after the passing of Resolution No. 240/13. In such circumstances, Claimants argue, the six-months consultation period could not be viewed as a mandatory waiting period.139\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 132-136; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 109-126; Claimants' PostHearing Brief, paras. 253-288.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 113; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 264-272.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 114.\n\n142.\n\nClaimants further point out that in ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration the same issues as those in the present arbitration were raised.140 For Claimants, the dispute raised in ENJASA's administrative recourse was, for purposes of compliance with Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT, the same dispute as the one pending in the present arbitration. By contrast, in Claimants' view, if the scope of a dispute were construed \"as narrow as proposed by the Argentine Republic, [this] would mean that a resort to domestic administrative jurisdiction could never, or only in exceptional circumstances, resolve an investment dispute. This result would be contrary to the text, context and object and purpose of Article 8 [of the] BIT.\"141 In other words, Article 8 of the BIT does not require, Claimants contend, that a completely identical dispute, covering the same parties and the same causes of action as the one before the present Tribunal, had to be submitted to the competent domestic administrative or judicial authorities. All that Article 8 of the BIT required is that \"the pleaded facts are substantially similar and concern the same protected investment.\"142 In this context, Claimants refer to arbitral jurisprudence, including in particular decisions on jurisdiction in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* and *Teinver v. Argentina*, to confirm their position.143\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 114-118; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 256-263.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 115.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 258.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 118 (citing *Philip Morris Brands SARL et al. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 July 2013), paras. 105, 106, 110, 113 (CL-134); *Teinver S.A. et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 December 2012), para. 132 (CL-137)); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 260-262.\n\n143.\n\nClaimants also point out that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration already had referred to the Argentina-Austria BIT.144\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 136.\n\n144.\n\nClaimants further argue that they complied with Article 8(3) of the BIT, which allows to proceed to international arbitration either if no decision on the merits has been reached within 18 months, as stipulated in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT, or once a decision on the merits was rendered, but the dispute persists, as stipulated in Article 8(3)(b) of the BIT. The latter, in Claimants' view, happened with Resolution No. 315/13,145 which they view as a \"decision on the merits\" on ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13. The fact that Resolution No. 315/13 could still be appealed, in turn, did not alter this situation. In this context, in Claimants' opinion, Respondent confuses the notion of a \"decision on the merits,\" as required by Article 8(3) of the BIT, and the notion of a \"final\", that is, an unappealable, decision.146\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 137-138; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 130-139; Claimants' PostHearing Brief, paras. 289-294.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 130-132.\n\n*(iii) Claimants respected the sequence of procedural steps under Article 8 of the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that Article 8 of the BIT required that the different procedural requirements (i.e., consultation, submission to domestic authorities, and finally international arbitration) be followed in sequence, Claimants submit that the deadlines under Argentine domestic law had to be taken into account. Thus, if Article 8(2) of the BIT required domestic recourses, such recourses must be understood to be had \"in accordance with the applicable time-limits and procedures under domestic law: if the domestic law and procedures are not respected, any domestic remedy is futile.\"147 Similarly, if domestic law required the initiation of remedies within certain time limits, it would be non-sensical to require that consultations under Article 8(1) be conducted beforehand for as a long as six months, as stipulated in Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 297.\n\n146.\n\nClaimants put the dilemma Respondent's interpretation of Article 8 of the BIT creates as follows:\n\nAccepting, for the sake of argument, the Argentine Republic's allegations, Claimants could have never fulfilled both the requirement to engage in amicable consultations and to resort to the domestic administrative authorities or courts. Had Claimants not filed a recourse within 15 days from the revocation of the licence, all further domestic remedies would have been barred. On the other hand, the compliance with the 15-days deadline would, in the Argentine Republic's view, \"*contaminate*\" amicable consultations. The Argentine Republic construed a *catch-22* situation.148\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 141.\n\n147.\n\nAll in all, Claimants argue that they have taken all procedural steps required under Argentine law to contest the revocation of ENJASA's license and to enforce their rights under the BIT. If compliance with the domestic recourse requirement sits squarely with a strict reading of Article 8 of the BIT, requiring compliance with the latter, in Claimants' view, would constitute bad faith.149\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 139-142.\n\n*(iv) Recourse to domestic courts as suggested by Respondent is either impossible or futile*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nIn addition, and arguendo that the dispute as submitted to the present Tribunal had to be fully identical in terms of the parties, the subject-matter and the causes of action to the dispute submitted to a domestic administrative or judicial jurisdiction, Claimants argue that Argentina's domestic legal system did not provide for any such recourse.150 Claimants instead argue that each of the domestic procedural options Respondent listed to this effect was unable to grant the compensation Claimants are seeking for breach of the BIT through the present arbitration.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 143-165; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 159-195; Claimants' PostHearing Brief, paras. 330-386.\n\n149.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming that an Argentine court had jurisdiction to hear a damages claim based on the breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT, Claimants point out that it would be futile for them to pursue such a claim. Invoking the decisions on jurisdiction in *Urbaser v. Argentina* and *Abaclat v. Argentina,* as well as a study prepared by the Treasury Attorney-General Office of the Argentine Republic, Claimants argue that \"there is no realistic possibility of securing a court decision on damages claims within 18 months in the Argentine Republic.\"151 To require Claimants nevertheless to pursue such remedies would not meet the very purpose of the requirement in question, which is identical to the *raison d'etre* of the requirement to exhaust local remedies, namely to give the local courts an occasion to provide a remedy.152\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 196-205 (quote at para. 196) (citing *Urbaser S.A. et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction (19 December 2012), para. 192 (AL RA 41); and *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (4 August 2011), paras. 582-583 (CL-131)); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 387-394; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 166-175.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 387-389.\n\n*(v) Article 8(4) of the BIT does not bar jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nClaimants also reject Respondent's argument that Article 8(4) of the BIT, which requires the withdrawal of domestic proceedings in case of recourse to international arbitration, operates as a bar to the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal.153 In Claimants' view, the obligation to withdraw does not exist before commencing international arbitration proceedings; on the contrary, the \"initiation of arbitration proceedings is a prerequisite for the obligation to take all measures to withdraw the pending judicial claim.\"154 Furthermore, any such obligation could only arise once the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal was confirmed. Otherwise, given that a withdrawal of ENJASA's domestic proceedings would be with prejudice, Claimants would risk losing both their domestic recourse and their recourse to international arbitration if the arbitral tribunal was to decline jurisdiction.155 This would be contrary to the stated purposes of the Argentina-Austria BIT to afford protection to foreign investors.156\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 144-158; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 401-408.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 150; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 402.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 151-157; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 403-406.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 152.\n\n*(vi) First alternative: A dispute has now been pending in domestic courts for 18 months without decision on the merits*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nIn the first alternative, Claimants point out that even if the Tribunal were to find that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 did not comply with Article 8(2) of the BIT, ENJASA subsequently submitted, on 5 February 2014, an Action for Annulment against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 in the domestic courts in Salta.157 This Action, Claimants point out, has been pending without decision for more than 18 months now. Relying on several arbitral decisions, for Claimants it is at the time the Tribunal renders a decision on jurisdiction that any pre-arbitral procedural requirement had to be fulfilled; the non-fulfilment of any such requirement at the time the arbitration proceedings were started, by contrast, was not an obstacle to a positive finding of jurisdicion.158 Cases relied upon by Respondent, which declined jurisdiction for noncompliance with the requirement to litigate in domestic courts for 18 months, such as *Wintershall v. Argentina*, *Impregilo v. Argentina*, *Daimler v. Argentina*, and *ICS v. Argentina*, in turn, should be distinguished as in none of those cases had claimants, or their local subsidiaries, actually initiated any domestic proceedings at all.159 After all, in Claimants' view, it would make little sense and be inefficient for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction on this ground since Claimants could immediately resubmit their case to arbitration as the 18 months of litigating in domestic courts had now expired.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 140; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 395-400.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 141 (relying on *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v.

Under this clause, Claimants consider to be entitled to the same favorable treatment in terms of dispute settlement as Danish investors under the BIT between Argentina and Denmark. Under Article 9(2) of that treaty, no prior recourse to local courts or administrative authorities for 18 months was necessary.160\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 176-185; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 206-229; Claimants' PostHearing Brief, paras. 412-442.\n\n153.\n\nIn response to Respondent's first objection regarding MFN treatment, Claimants argue that their invocation of the MFN clause in the Argentina-Austria BIT was timely. It occurred, they point out, in their first submission following Respondent's objections to jurisdiction (i.e., Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction), as required by Rule 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.161\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 216-221; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 414-421 (reyling on *RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. V 079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction (October 2007), para. 53 (CL-156)).\n\n154.\n\nClaimants further argue, in response to Respondent's second objection regarding MFN treatment, that the term \"treatment\" in Article 3 of the Argentina-Austria BIT was sufficiently wide to \"encompas[s] any conduct of the host State that affects the investor's investment, which includes its access to dispute settlement.\"162 For Claimants, this interpretation is confirmed by the fact that Article 3(2) of the BIT explicitly excluded from MFN treatment benefits arising under a customs union, a common market, and similar projects of regional economic integration, benefits in the area of taxation, regulations to facilitate border traffic, and specific benefits for preferential financing granted under Argentina's BITs with Italy and Spain.163\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 224; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 183; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 429.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 183; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 433-434.\n\n155.\n\nFinally, Claimants point to the \"prevailing practice\" in investment treaty arbitration under which \"the most favoured treatment also applies to dispute settlement and, in particular, to procedural obstacles (such as the requirement to resort to local courts or administrative authorities for a fixed period of time).\"164 Contrary decisions were, in Claimants' view, either \"driven by the particularities of the case\"165 or were based on differently worded BITs.166\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 181.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 436.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 430-431 (discussing *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 224 (AL RA 96)).\n\n***C. Jurisdiction ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nClaimants also counter Respondent's third objection concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. They contend they had made an investment in Argentina both in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and under Article 1 of the BIT. Claimants argue that the BIT is not limited to the protection of their rights as shareholders in L&E or ENJASA, but that the protection of the BIT extends to the assets of ENJASA, including most importantly its exclusive license. Furthermore, Claimants consider the present dispute to arise directly out of their investment in Argentina.\n\n*(i) Claimants' investment in the Province of Salta*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nClaimants point out that they \"were engaged in a complex investment operation\" in Argentina.167 This operation consisted of a variety of directly and indirectly held assets in Argentina, including Claimants' shares in L&E, their indirect ownership of ENJASA (through L&E), as well as the rights held, and operations conducted, by ENJASA. The latter included, most importantly, ENJASA exclusive license to operate games of chance in the Province of Salta, which was the basis for operating four casinos, fifteen slot machine halls, and fourteen lottery games, with a total of approximately 750 employees.168\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6; similarly, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 17.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\n158.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants point out that, in line with the investment plan that was part of the public tender for acquiring ENJASA, they had invested more than USD 20 million in the construction of a five-star hotel in Salta, sponsored two schools for hotel trade and gastronomy, and established the ENJASA Foundation.169 The latter had as its objective, inter alia, \"the promotion and research of cultural, tourist, hotel and gourmet activities in the province of Salta and the region to achieve its national [and] international expansion.\"170\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 121-133; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 132.\n\n159.\n\nIt is these activities as a whole that Claimants present as their investment, in economic and legal terms. Consequently, Respondent's\n\nattempt to separate the licence from the other assets belonging to Claimants' investment has no merit. ENJASA's licence was an essential part of Claimants' investment operation, forming an organic unit. The investment operation was only possible on the basis of the exclusive gaming and lottery licence granted to ENJASA by the Province of Salta pursuant to Decree No. 2126/1999. The licence was the *conditio sine qua non* of the investment.171\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 34 (internal citation omitted). Similarly, Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16 (\"The entire investment operation of Claimants in the Argentine Republic was inseparably connected to ENJASA's exclusive licence. Without ENJASA's licence, the operation of gaming and lottery business was not possible. The licence was the *conditio sine qua non* of ENJASA's existence and operation.\").\n\n*(ii) Claimants' activities qualify as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and under Article 1 of the BIT*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nTheir engagement in Argentina constitutes, Claimants argue, an investment in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. It meets, Claimants explain, all of the so-called *Salini* characteristics, including the need for a certain duration, regularity of profits and returns, the assumption of risk, the making of a substantial commitment, and a contribution to the development of the host State.172\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 37; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 17-26.\n\n161.\n\nClaimants further argue that several assets that formed part of their complex operation qualify as investments under Article 1 of the BIT, such as their shareholdings and participations in ENJASA and L&E.173\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 24-27; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 34-41.\n\n162.\n\nIn addition, Claimants consider that ENJASA's license and \"all assets constituting the economic value of the shares of [ENJASA and L&E]\" qualify as investments in the sense of Article 1(1) of the BIT.174 ENJASA's license, Claimants argue, qualifies as an investment pursuant to Article 1(1)(e) given that the BIT protected assets \"in any sector of the economy.\"175 Other assets of ENJASA and L&E were also protected under the BIT, Claimants contend, as \"[i]t follows from the broad definition of the term investment in the BIT that the treaty not only protects shareholdings and any form of participation, but all assets constituting the economic value of the shares.\"176\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 31-32.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42.\n\n163.\n\nThe distinction Respondent attempts to make in this respect between the rights of the company, and the rights of its shareholders, in Claimants' view, is relevant only for the protection of shareholders under customary international law, but had been superseded by BITs.177 As consistently held by investment treaty tribunals, under BITs, \"[s]hareholder protection extends from the ownership of shares to an action that affects the economic value of the shares because it affects the assets held by the corporation.\"178 Consequently, Claimants contend, their standing is not limited to bringing claims for breaches of their shareholder rights.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 30-41; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 44-45.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\n*(iii) Article 4(3) of the BIT confirms the wide scope of protection*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nClaimants further point out that Article 4(3) of the BIT specifically confirmed that the protection of shareholders in locally incorporated companies extended beyond their shareholding, and included assets held by the company. According to that provision, Claimants argue, shareholders were protected against the direct and indirect expropriation of assets held by a locally incorporated company.\n\n165.\n\nAs to the difference in the wording of the Spanish and German versions of the Argentina-Austria BIT, Claimants argue that the use of the Spanish term \"*activos financieros*\" was \"in all likelihood, a translation mistake and the two authentic language versions, although using a different term, both mean to protect all assets and not just financial assets.\"179 In Claimants' view:\n\nthe term \"*activos financieros*\" does not mean assets used in financial activities (such as banking), but rather assets having a financial value and thus being part of an investment. This interpretation is corroborated both by the immediate context of the term, a provision granting (financial) compensation for expropriation, as well as by the larger context of a treaty granting protection for any asset invested in any sector of the economy.180\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52. *See extensively also* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 46-60.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 53.\n\n166.\n\nAlso the object and purpose of the treaty, Claimants continue, suggested no reason to limit Article 4(3) of the BIT to the protection of a narrow class of assets,181 in particular considering that the German version of the BIT used the same term (\"*Vermogenswerte\")* in Article 1 of the BIT to refer to assets that qualify as protected \"investments\" in general.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\n167.\n\nApart from that, Claimants point out, any question as to the precise scope of protection of shareholders under the BIT concerned the merits of the dispute, not jurisdiction.182\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 27 and 29; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 57.\n\n*(iv) The dispute arises directly out of the investment*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that the dispute arises directly out of their investment in Argentina. Article 25 ICSID Convention required a relation between the dispute and the investment; not a direct ownership of the investment.183 The relationship between dispute and investment was met, as Claimants point out: the revocation of the License effectively destroyed Claimants' entire investment in the gaming and lottery sector in the Province of Salta.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 57.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAs provided for in Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\" It therefore falls upon it to assess whether the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre as laid down in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and whether the jurisdictional requirements under the Argentina-Austria BIT are met. In addition, the Tribunal will consider whether admissibility-related considerations suggest rejecting Claimants' claims, in whole or in part, at the present stage of the proceedings.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address whether Claimants' involvement in the gaming and lottery sector in Salta qualifies as an \"investment\" in the sense of both Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (i.e., part of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*). It will then assess, as a matter of the admissibility of the proceedings, whether Claimants have been able to show the existence of a *prima facie* claim (i.e., Respondent's first objection and remaining issues of her third objection). Finally, the Tribunal will determine whether the Parties' have validly consented to the present proceedings under Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT (i.e., Respondent's second objection).\n\n171.\n\nAs should be almost unnecessary to state, in interpreting the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Austria BIT, the Tribunal applies the rules on treaty interpretation laid down in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which is binding upon both the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Austria.184 These rules - and the interpretive canons flowing from them - are well-known and do not need to be further expounded in the abstract. They imply that the content of treaty rights and obligations are objectively ascertained by all members of an international tribunal in full judicial independence and neutrality. Specifically for investment treaties, this means that interpretation is not to be guided by interpretive presumptions in favor of either investors and their home States or of host States, nor by teleological preferences about investor-State relations that are extrinsic to the treaty commitments made in the present case.185\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (CL-001).\n\nAlthough the Vienna Convention ties the interpretation of international treaties to objective criteria, namely the principle of good faith and recourse to the text, context, and object and purpose of the treaty and, under certain circumstances, its *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, its rules on treaty interpretation are far from always leading the interpreter to only one possible and cogent solution. Instead, the Vienna Convention's rules on treaty interpretation often enough have the effect that reasonable arbitrators may reasonably disagree on the construction of treaty provisions. These disagreements result from the vagaries and indeterminacies inherent to using language to lay down rights and obligations in international treaties; they may relate to differences in pre-understanding or in weighing the respective interpretive canons. Consequently, the majority of the Tribunal respects that the dissenting arbitrator has come to different conclusions on the construction of the Argentina-Austria BIT based on his understanding of the hermeneutic exercise at stake. However, to ascribe differences in construction to \"manifest reckless misinterpretations and erroneous application of the relevant provisions,\" to criticize that \"the motives of the Decision look like the plea of a party,\" or to denote reasons given as \"gossip\" or \"rigmarole\", as the Dissent does (*see* Dissent, paras. 191, 151, 163 and 143 respectively), in the majority's view, fails to appreciate the nuances and difficulties an hermeneutic enterprise, such as the interpretation of international treaties, entails.\n\n172.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that, in its analysis of the governing law, it is not limited to the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties, but is required, under the maxim *iura novit curia* or, better, *iura novit arbiter*, to apply the law on its own motion. This approach corresponds to the Tribunal's public function as an adjudicatory body that is part of the administration of international justice. It justifies reliance on arguments and authorities on the governing law not submitted by the Parties, provided the latter are given an opportunity to comment on arguments and legal theories that were either not addressed or could not reasonably be anticipated.186 It also justifies that the Tribunal treats Respondent's objections in a different order than they were raised and that the Tribunal requalifies objections relating to the scope of protection of shareholder-investors under the BIT, in accordance with its assessment of the requirements for jurisdiction and admissibility under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n*See* *Lighthouse Corporation Pty Ltd And Lighthouse Corporation Ltd, IBC v. Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/2, Award (22 December 2017), para. 109 (\"When applying the governing law, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties. Under the *maxim iura novit curia* - or, better, *iura novit arbiter* - the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its own motion, provided always that it gives the Parties' an opportunity to comment if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.\") (citing to *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment (7 January 2015), para. 295 (\"[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, sua sponte, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"); *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland)*, Merits, Judgment (25 July 1974), para. 18 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award (23 April 2012), para. 141; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v.

The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 201403, Final Award (11 October 2017), para. 179.\n\n**1. Existence of a Protected Investment**\n------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nOne aspect of Respondent's objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* concerns the question whether Claimants have made an investment in Argentina that is protected under both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Austria BIT.187 This aspect of Respondent's objection has shifted over the course of the written and oral arguments, posing certain difficulties in grasping which aspects of this objections are still upheld - or have been dropped - during the Hearing on jurisdiction and/or in Respondent's PostHearing Brief. In light of these difficulties, and given that the Tribunal has to determine, objectively and independently of a Party's objection, its own jurisdiction, all possible aspects of Respondent's objections relating to the lack of a protected investment are hereafter addressed.\n\nThe other aspect of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because of limits the BIT imposes for the protection of shareholder-investors, in the Tribunal's view, does not, properly understood, concern a question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, but concerns the scope of the substantive protections the BIT grants to shareholder-investors. This is a question pertaining to the merits of the claim. At the present stage of the proceedings, any limitation on the substantive scope of protection is only relevant to the extent it results in the lack of a *prima facie* claim. *See infra* Section VI.2.\n\n174.\n\nRespondent's objection that Claimants have not made a protected investment can be understood: first, as an objection that Claimants have not made an \"investment\" in Argentina in the sense of Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT; second, that Claimants have not made an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention;188 and third, as questioning whether the dispute before the Tribunal directly arises out of an investment as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nWhether Claimants have made an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and whether their involvement in Argentina qualifies as an \"investment\" under Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, are conceptually separate, even though in substance the notions of \"investment\" in both instruments will overlap to a large extent. In addition, both concepts relate to two separate jurisdictional issues. The concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention constitutes one of the express jurisdictional elements under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The concept of \"investment\" in the sense of Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT is relevant for determining the scope of Respondent's consent under Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT *ratione materiae*. *See* *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award (14 July 2010), para. 108 (stating that \"the Tribunal considers that the notion of investment, which is one of the conditions to be satisfied for the Centre to have jurisdiction, cannot be defined simply through a reference to the parties' consent, which is a distinct condition for the Centre's jurisdiction. The Tribunal believes that an objective definition of the notion of investment was contemplated within the framework of the ICSID Convention, since certain terms of Article 25 would otherwise be devoid of any meaning.\"). These differences notwithstanding, both aspects of the Tribunal's jurisdiction are dealt with together in the Tribunal's analysis for purpose of efficiency, because the Parties did not always distinguish between both concepts of \"investment\" with the necessary conceptual clarity.\n\n175.\n\nClaimants, in turn, have identified a number of different assets that, in their view, suggest they have made an investment in Argentina that qualifies as such under both Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. These assets encompass:\n\ni. Claimants' 60% shareholding in L&E and (through L&E) its shareholding in ENJASA;189\n\nii. the assets held and operations conducted by ENJASA with the help of approx. 750 employees, which included 4 casinos, 15 slot machine halls, and 14 lottery operations; and\n\niii. the exclusive operating license of ENJASA.\n\nClaimants do not, by contrast, claim protection for the 40% share in L&E that they purchased on 18 November 2013, that is, subsequently to the revocation of ENJASA's license through Resolution No. 240/13. No claim for damages or other breach of Respondent's obligations relating to this 40% share has been submitted to this Tribunal. *See* Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 189; Hearing Transcript of 23 March 2017, pp. 110, 112, 113; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 25-39. Consequently, there is also no need to address Respondent's argument that Claimants' claim in this respect is abusive (*see supra* para. 106).\n\n176.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal will first address to which extent Claimants have made an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. It will then analyze to which extent Claimants have made an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and, finally, turn to whether the present dispute \"arises directly out of that investment.\"\n\n***A. Existence of an \"investment\" under Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants' (direct) 60% shareholding in L&E and its (indirect) shareholding in ENJASA (via L&E) qualify as an investment in the sense of Article 1(1)(b) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. This provision states, again indicating differences between the Parties concerning translation, as follows:\n\nThe term \"investment\" means any kind of asset invested or reinvested in any sector of the economic activity, provided the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made, and, in particular, though not exclusively: [...] shares [Respondent]/any shareholding [Claimants] and any other form of participation in companies [...].\n\n178.\n\nAs the wording of this provision makes clear, Claimants' (direct) shareholding in L&E qualifies as an \"investment\" under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n179.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants' indirect shareholding in ENJASA via L&E qualifies as an \"investment\" under the Argentina-Austria BIT. This becomes clear from how the structure of Claimants' shareholding in ENJASA developed historically.\n\n180.\n\nTo recall: Claimants' involvement in the gaming and lottery sector in Salta and in the two Argentine companies, L&E and ENJASA, was triggered by the privatization of the gaming and lottery sector in the Province of Salta. At the start of that process, Claimants' predecessor in right (the joint venture between CAIH, Boldt S.A., and Iberlux Int. S.A.) received, in 1999, a controlling share in ENJASA, a company that was fully owned by the Province of Salta, but whose only (significant) asset at that time was the exclusive 30-year operating license for gaming and lottery activities in Salta. This controlling share was received against the commitment to pay an annual license fee, to invest in a five-star hotel in Salta, to sponsor schools for hotel trade and gastronomy, and to establish a foundation for the promotion of cultural activities and the tourism industry in the Province Salta. In the implementation of their investment in the gaming and lottery sector in Salta, the participants in the joint venture then decided to establish L&E as a holding company to hold the shares in ENJASA. The shareholder structure in L&E corresponded to the respective participation of the members of the joint venture. Without the interposition of L&E, the participants in the joint venture, and later Claimants as their successor, would have been direct shareholders in ENJASA.\n\n181.\n\nAgainst this background, the shareholding in ENJASA was not principally one of L&E's assets; rather L&E was a vehicle to hold the shares in ENJASA, which were themselves the principal investment in Argentina. Consequently, it is clear that the indirect shareholding in ENJASA was an investment of Claimants in Argentina, which their predecessors in right first held through the structure of a joint venture and thereafter via the Argentina-incorporated holding company L&E. For this reason, there is no reason not to consider Claimants' indirect shareholding in ENJASA as falling under the notion of \"shares [...] in a company\" that qualify as a protected investment in Argentina in the sense of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT.\n\n182.\n\nConsequently, as also Respondent accepts,190 both Claimants' direct shareholding in L&E and their indirect shareholding in ENJASA qualify as \"investments\" under Article 1(1)(b) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n*See* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123 (stating that \"the Argentine Republic does not deny that a shareholding may constitute an investment under the terms of the BIT\").\n\n183.\n\nWhat is debated between the Parties, by contrast, is to which extent assets of ENJASA, in particular its operating license, qualify as Claimants' \"investment\" under the Argentina-Austria BIT independently of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and ENJASA. The issue here is not whether an operating license in the abstract could qualify as an asset, and hence as an investment, in the sense of Article 1(1) of the BIT, as it is not sufficient, for the purpose of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction, that the License may be characterized as an asset and fall under the definition of investment in the BIT. Instead, as rightly pointed out by Respondent, in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, the License must qualify as an \"investment\" that is owned by an Austrian \"investor\", as only investments of investors of the other Contracting Party are protected under the Argentina-Austria BIT, whereas investments of nationals of the host State, or of nationals of a third State, are not. The question therefore is whether ENJASA's operating license can be considered as Claimants' \"investment\" in the sense of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n184.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is not the case. Even though ENJASA's operating license was the only significant asset ENJASA held at the time of the privatization in 1999/2000, and although it was, from an economic perspective, the reason why the bidders in the public tender were willing to make economically significant promises in return for becoming shareholders in ENJASA, the operating license as such was an asset that belonged, already at the time of the public tender, to ENJASA. Different from the role of L&E, which was created subsequently as a vehicle to hold the shares in ENJASA, the participants in the privatization process did not bid for the 30-year operating license and later created ENJASA to hold that license. They participated in the bid in order to become shareholders of ENJASA. Unlike Claimants' shareholding in ENJASA, which is held indirectly through L&E, ENJASA's license, therefore cannot be considered as an \"investment\" that is held indirectly by Claimants through their (indirect) participation in ENJASA. The same holds true for other assets owned by ENJASA; these as well do not qualify as \"investments\" that are indirectly held by Claimants through their participation in ENJASA. Consequently, for the Tribunal, ENJASA's operating license and its other assets do not qualify as protected \"investments\" themselves in the sense of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n185.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that interferences with ENJASA's assets are irrelevant for Claimants' rights as shareholder-investors protected under the BIT. Yet, the question to which extent Claimants enjoy protection as (indirect) shareholders against interferences with ENJASA's assets, such as the revocation of its operating license and subsequent events, is, in principle, an issue for the merits of the case. At the present jurisdictional stage, and despite Respondent's formulation as part of its objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, the issue (i.e., the scope of protection of Claimants as shareholder-investors) is only relevant in order to assess whether Claimants have successfully presented a *prima facie* claim. This issue is discussed in connection with Respondent's objection that Claimants have failed to present a *prima facie* claim.191\n\n*See infra* Section VI.2.\n\n***B. Existence of an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) ICSID Convention***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants' involvement in the operation of gaming and lottery activities in Salta through their participation in L&E and, indirectly, in ENJASA also qualifies as an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In the absence of a definition of this notion in the ICSID Convention, the precise contours of this notion are debated, both in the jurisprudence of investment tribunals and in scholarly writing. Debate exists in particular as to the precise elements or criteria that should be used to delineate economic activities undertaken, or assets held, by foreign nationals that qualify as an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention from those that do not.192\n\n*See* Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclar, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press 2009), Article 25, paras. 113-174.\n\n187.\n\nThe starting point of the analysis is regularly the so-called *Salini* test.193 According to this test, an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is characterized by the following elements: (1) the existence of a substantial contribution by the foreign national, (2) a certain duration of the economic activity in question, (3) the assumption of risk by the foreign national, and (4) the contribution of the activity to the host State's development.194\n\nThe test is named after *Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade SpA v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (23 July 2001), paras. 50-58 (CL-075).\n\nSometimes, the regularity of profits and returns is listed as an additional element. *See* *Fedax N.V. v. The Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (11 July 1997), para. 43 (CL-076).\n\n188.\n\nThe first three *Salini* criteria are broadly accepted in ICSID practice and doctrine. They help to circumscribe the type of economic activity or asset protected as an \"investment\" and delineate it from non-protected activities or assets in relation to the risk certain forms of economic involvement abroad entail. The specific risk in question arises out of the fact that certain long-term forms of economic involvement in a host State (which are termed \"foreign investment\") require foreign nationals to place their economic activities and assets upfront under the sovereign authority of the host State in order to recoup economic returns over time. It is the investment-specific risk stemming from the non-synallagmatic nature of investor-State relations that the ICSID Convention aims, if not to minimize, at least to make more manageable by providing a mechanism for settling disputes between investors and host States.\n\n189.\n\nIn this context, the first three *Salini* criteria help to circumscribe the activities and assets of foreign nationals in host States that the ICSID Convention considers not only in need of protection against political risk, but also worthy of access to its specific dispute settlement mechanism. These three *Salini* criteria thus exclude non-economic activity and the noncommercial use of assets of foreign nationals from the concept of \"investment\". They also exclude short-term economic activity, or assets used in that context, such as one-time sales transactions that do not face investment-specific risk, from access to dispute settlement under the ICSID Convention. And finally, these three *Salini* criteria may exclude wholly insignificant activities and assets that, while having a commercial value, do not amount to a significant contribution to the host State's economic life.\n\n190.\n\nQuite controversial, however, is whether the activity undertaken, or the asset held, by a foreign national also must fulfil the fourth criterion, that is, to contribute positively to the development of the host State. This criterion is put forward by some ICSID tribunals and annulment committees as a necessary component in light of the ICSID Convention's object and purpose to contribute to economic development, as expressed in its Preamble.195 Other ICSID tribunals and annulment committees object to the inclusion of this criterion, inter alia, because they consider it either as superfluous, as conferring too much discretion on arbitral tribunals and thus creating legal uncertainty, or as limiting access of foreign nationals to ICSID arbitration in light of aspects that should be assessed as part of the merits, rather than jurisdiction, such as whether investments that are harmful to the host State's development receive substantive protection.196 Again other ICSID tribunals consider that the contribution to the host State's development, while a necessary element of the definition of \"investment\", should generally be presumed.197\n\n*See, for example,* *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award (1 November 2006), paras. 27-41 (AL RA 151); *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v.

The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), paras. 84-85 (AL RA 152).\n\n191.\n\nFor purposes of establishing jurisdiction in the present case, the Tribunal does not need to address this controversy, as it has no impact on the outcome of the present case. Instead, in the present case, all of the *Salini* criteria are fulfilled, including that of contribution to the host State's development. Thus, Claimants' shareholdings in L&E and, indirectly, in ENJASA, coupled with the undertakings made as part of the privatization process to invest in the gaming, lottery, and tourism sector in Salta, constitute a substantial commitment of resources by Claimants; this commitment has been made to achieve profits and returns for a substantial duration; and it also entails the assumption of risk.\n\n192.\n\nFurthermore, the operation of gaming and lottery activities in Salta also contributed to development in the Provice of Salta. Not only did ENJASA employ, at the time its operating license was revoked, approx. 750 employees; the privatization of the operating and gaming industry in the Province also included the committment to build two schools, one for hoteling, one for gastronomy, as well as a five-star hotel, and to establish a foundation for the purpose of enhancing and promoting education and research in the tourism and gastronomy sectors in Salta. In light of these aspects, Claimants' involvement in the gaming and lottery sector in Salta through their shareholding in L&E and, indirectly, ENJASA also contributed positively to the development in the Province of Salta and, by extension, the Republic of Argentina.\n\n193.\n\nConsequently, Claimants' shareholding in L&E and ENJASA also qualifies as an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***C. Existence of a \"dispute arising directly out of an investment\" under Article 25(1) ICSID Convention***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nFinally, there is no doubt, in the Tribunal's view, that the present dispute, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, arises directly out of Claimants' investment in Argentina. The directness requirement in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention relates to the connection the dispute has to have to the investment; it does not restrict jurisdiction to claims arising out of direct investments.198 The requirement is met, in the present case, because Claimants' claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license, coupled with the subsequent transfer of ENJASA's operation and employees to new operators, is the cause of the alleged destruction of Claimants' investment in the gaming and lottery sector in Salta, that is, its (direct) shareholding in L&E and (its indirect shareholding) in ENJASA.\n\n*See* *Fedax N.V. v. The Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (11 July 1997), para. 24 (CL-076) (\"It is apparent that the term \u2018directly' relates in this Article to the \u2018dispute' and not to the \u2018investment.' It follows that jurisdiction can exist even in respect of investments that are not direct, so long as the dispute arises directly from such transaction.\"); *see also* *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003), paras. 26-27 (AL RA 13); *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Decision on Jurisdiction (22 February 2006), para. 73 (AL RA 32).\n\n***D. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n195.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have made, in the form of their shareholding in L&E and, indirectly, in ENJASA, an investment in Argentina in the sense of both Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the present dispute arises directly out of Claimants' investment in Argentina, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. By contrast, ENJASA assets, including, but not limited to, its operating license, do not qualify as Claimants' investment for purposes of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n196.\n\nConsequently, Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is hereby rejected insofar as it relates to the argument that Claimants have not made an investment in Argentina that is protected under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. The other aspect of Respondent's third objection related to limitations in the protection of shareholder-investors under the Argentina-Austria BIT, is dealt with together with Respondent's first objection in the following section.\n\n**2. Existence of a** ***Prima Facie*** **Claim**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Respondent's objection that Claimants have not presented a *prima facie* claim for breach of the BIT based on the facts they allege. This encompasses both Respondent's first objection, as well as the part of Respondent's third objection concerning the scope of protection of shareholder-investors under the BIT. In the Tribunal's view, both sets of issues raise questions that concern the scope of substantive protections offered under the Argentina-Austria BIT to foreign investors and their investment.199\n\nSee also footnote 187.\n\n198.\n\nAs presented by Respondent, the underlying objection does not strictly relate to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,200 but rather concerns the admissibility of the claim(s) brought. This notwithstanding, such an objection is a valid reason for an investment tribunal to dismiss a case, in whole or in part, at the jurisdictional stage. Such dismissal would be justified both by the principle of judicial economy and by the need to respect the rights and interests of both parties, which is inherent in the idea of fair administration of international justice. After all, it would be both inefficient (for the Tribunal and the Parties) and prejudicial in law and in costs (to Respondent as well as Claimants) to proceed with a claim to the merits, that clearly has no foundation in law, even though the Tribunal otherwise may have jurisdiction over such claim.\n\nRespondent's objection could be read as relating to the subject-matter limitations of Respondent's consent in Article 8(1) of the BIT to \"dispute[s] [\u2026] concerning any subject matter governed by this Agreement,\" a question that is relevant as a jurisdictional criterion under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Yet, Respondent's objection is broader. Respondent is not merely arguing that the Tribunal is limited to assessing the legality of Respondent's action under the BIT, as provided for in Article 8(1) of the BIT. Repondent's argument is that the case presented by Claimants does not *prima facie* give rise to a successful claim for breach of the BIT.\n\n199.\n\nRespondent's first objection for lack of a *prima facie* claim has two prongs: first, that Claimants' claims arising in connection with the revocation of ENJASA's license have to be qualified as \"contract claims\" rather than \"treaty claims\"; and second, that the forum selection clauses in favor of the First Instance Court of Salta in both the Bidding Terms and Conditions and in the Transfer Agreement bar recourse to the present Tribunal for such claims. As already stated, the remaining part of Respondent's third objection equally raises the question to which extent Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events have resulted in a breach of Claimants rights as shareholder-investors in L&E and ENJASA under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n200.\n\nAfter addressing the applicable test for determining the existence of a *prima facie* claim, the Tribunal turns to the characterization of the claims brought by Claimants as treaty claims. It then assesses to which extent Claimants have met the threshold to present *prima facie* claims for breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT given the pleaded facts and Claimants' status as shareholder-investors. Finally, the effect of the forum selection clauses on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is addressed.\n\n***A. The applicable test for determining the existence of a prima facie claim***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe test for determining the existence of a *prima facie* claim at the jurisdictional stage is well-established in the practice of investment treaty tribunals. It follows the test applied by international courts and tribunals more generally, in particular the ICJ. Based on this jurisprudence, the Tribunal must be satisfied that the facts alleged by Claimants are plausibly capable of constituting a breach of the law applicable to the dispute, that is, in the present case, the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n202.\n\nThe ICJ elaborated the test to determine the existence of a *prima facie* claim in *Ambatielos* as follows:\n\n[...] it is not necessary for that Government [i.e., the Hellenic Government as claimant] to show, for present purposes, that an alleged treaty violation has an unassailable legal basis. [\u2026] If the interpretation given by the Hellenic Government to any of the provisions relied upon appears to be one of the possible interpretations that may be placed upon it, though not necessarily the correct one, then the Ambatielos claim must be considered, for the purposes of the present proceedings, to be a claim based on the Treaty of 1886.\n\nIn other words, if it is made to appear that the Hellenic Government is relying upon an arguable construction of the Treaty, that is to say, a construction which can be defended, whether or not it ultimately prevails, then there are reasonable grounds for concluding that its claim is based on the Treaty.201\n\n*Ambatielos (Greece v. United Kingdom)*, Judgment (19 May 1953), ICJ Reports 1953, p. 18 (AL RA 235).\n\n203.\n\nSimilarly, in *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ held that, in order to meet the *prima facie* claim, it\n\nmust ascertain whether the violations of the Treaty of 1955 pleaded by Iran do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain, pursuant [to that Treaty].202\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)*, Preliminary Objection, Judgment (12 December 1996), ICJ Reports 1996, pp. 803, 810, para. 16 (AL RA 6).\n\n204.\n\nRosalyn Higgins, in her Separate Opinion in *Oil Platforms*, famously formulated the *prima facie* test even more plastically as requiring that \"[t]he Court should thus see if, on the facts as alleged by [the Applicant], the [Respondent's] actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles.\"203\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)*, Preliminary Objection, Judgment (12 December 1996), Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, ICJ Reports 1996, pp. 847, 856, para. 33 (AL RA 8).\n\n205.\n\nThe same test has been applied consistently in investment treaty jurisprudence. As one of the first cases to address it, the Tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* held:\n\nIt is not enough that the Claimant raises an issue under one or more provisions of the BIT which the Respondent disputes. To adapt the words of the International Court in the *Oil Platforms* case, the Tribunal \"must ascertain whether the violations of the [BIT] pleaded by [SGS] do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the [Tribunal] has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain\" pursuant to Article VIII(2) of the BIT.204\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v.

The People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures (21 March 2007), para. 141 (CL-050).\n\n207.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal under this test is therefore to determine whether the facts pleaded by Claimants, if established to be true, could possibly result in a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT. This test has implications both for the treatment of questions of fact as well as for questions of interpretation and application of the applicable law at the jurisdictional stage.\n\n208.\n\nAs for the treatment of facts, the Tribunal must not, as part of its analysis under the *prima facie* test at the jurisdictional stage, determine the veracity of the facts alleged by Claimants or question them in light of factual allegations made by Respondent that would, if found to be true, invalidate Claimants' version of what indeed happened. This exercise of factfinding is a matter for the merits of the proceedings and requires not only full briefing by both parties, but possibly also the taking of evidence by the Tribunal. What the Tribunal must do instead at the jurisdictional stage under the *prima facie* test is to determine whether the facts as pleaded by Claimants can plausibly result in a finding of breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT, namely of its prohibition of expropriations without compensation, of its obligations to extend fair and equitable treatment, and of its obligation to grant national treatment, as invoked by Claimants.\n\n209.\n\nThis raises the question as to what the *prima facie* test implies for the Tribunal's task in dealing with competing propositions of the Parties as to the proper interpretation of the applicable law and its application to the alleged facts. This issue is particularly salient in the face of legal indeterminacies and competing legal theories or lines of jurisprudence relating to the applicable law, a phenomenon regularly occurring in investment arbitration. In such a situation, an investment tribunal must steer a careful course. On the one hand, it should take into account the right of both parties to fully present their case and their legal arguments to the Tribunal, including arguments that are novel or go against the predominant views and would hence contribute to the further development of the law. On the other hand, the Tribunal should prevent frivolous, spurious, and legally clearly unfounded cases, which would impose an illegitimate burden on the time and resources of both Respondent and the Tribunal, from going forward to the merits.\n\n210.\n\nIn finding the right balance, an investment tribunal should not simply rubberstamp Claimants' legal qualification of their case on the merits, but make an independent determination on the interpretation of the applicable law, here the Argentina-Austria BIT.206 At the same time, the Tribunal's independent determination should not, as suggested in *SGS v. Philippines* \"require the definitive interpretation of the treaty provision which is relied on,\"207 as this may cut short the Parties' possibility of making a full presentation of their case. Instead, the Tribunal's determination of whether a *prima facie* claim exists should be limited to ascertaining whether Claimants' case relies on a plausible interpretation of the applicable law.\n\nSimilarly, *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction (6 August 2014), para. 30.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. The Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (29 January 2004), para. 157 (AL RA 25).\n\n211.\n\nIn determining the plausibility of Claimants' case, the Tribunal should take into account existing legal indeterminacies and ambiguities, as well as competing legal theories or competing lines of prior arbitral jurisprudence. Similarly, as part of establishing the plausibility of Claimants' case in law, room must be made for arguments that are novel or that go against the predominant view on the applicable law. This is necessary in light of the absence of a possibility for an appeal in investment arbitration, which could review findings of law, resolve indeterminacies in the law authoritatively, and allow for the law's further development.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal should therefore limit its assessment of the applicable law in respect of the merits, in the words of the *Ambatielos* case, to determining whether Claimants' case \"rel[ies] upon an arguable construction of the Treaty, that is to say, a construction which can be defended, whether or not it ultimately prevails.\"208 Only if, as stated in *Mytilineos v. Serbia*, \"the facts as pleaded are plainly incapable of supporting a finding of breach of treaty, all or part [of] the claim might fall outside of the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\"209 In such a case, there is no interest, neither for Claimants nor for the international community, in proceeding with a case to the merits. By contrast, as long as the case fairly raises issues relating to the interpretation and application of the substantive law in question, the claims should proceed to the merits and allow the Parties to plead fully their respective arguments on the interpretation and application of the applicable law.\n\n*Ambatielos (Greece v. United Kingdom)*, Judgment (19 May 1953), ICJ Reports 1953, p. 18 (AL RA 235).\n\n*Mytilineos Holdings SA v. The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia*, UNCITRAL Case, Partial Award on Jurisdiction (8 September 2006), para. 184 (AL RA 17).\n\n213.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal's exercise at the present stage of the proceedings does not entail a conclusive determination on the interpretation of the treaty provisions breach which is invoked, nor does it require a conclusive legal qualification of the facts pleaded. Instead, it is sufficient that a plausible argument can be made that a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT occurred in light of the alleged facts, even if the Tribunal ultimately were to adopt, in its decision on the merits, a different legal interpretation of the applicable law, or apply the law differently to the then determined facts of the case. In other words, under the *prima facie* test, the ultimate legal qualification of the case at hand remains a question reserved to the merits and will be determined conclusively only following a full briefing by both Parties on the factual and legal issues at stake.\n\n***B. Characterization of the claims brought by Claimants as treaty claims***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Parties in the present case do not differ substantially on the abstract legal test to be applied to determine the existence of a *prima facie* claim; rather their differences lie in the concrete characterization of the claims brought. For Respondent, Claimants merely label their claims as treaty claims, whereas the \"essential basis\" of those claims, namely the revocation of ENJASA's license, in Respondent's view, relates to a breach of contract.210 To this end, Respondent argues that the License conferred to ENJASA had to be seen as a contractual arrangement211 and that, in turn, the revocation of the License was equally a contractual matter that fell outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction for treaty claims.212 Claimants, by contrast, stress that their claims had to be qualified as treaty claims.\n\n*See* Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 28-39.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 5-19.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 20-26.\n\n215.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent's first objection relating to the lack of a *prima facie* claim mischaracterizes the nature of Claimants' claim before this Tribunal. In the present proceedings, Claimants do not bring claims for breach of an agreement they are party to with the Province of Salta, such as the Transfer Agreement or the contractual or quasi-contractual arrangements to implement the privatization of the gaming and lottery sector in Salta. Claimants also do not bring claims for the breach of ENJASA's license under the domestic law applicable to that License as such.\n\n216.\n\nRather, for Claimants, the revocation of ENJASA's license, and its consequences on Claimants' investment in Argentina, is the trigger that results in the alleged breach of their rights as foreign investors under the Argentina-Austria BIT. It is Claimants' argument that the revocation of the License did not take place in the normal exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers, but formed part of a larger plan, an \"orchestrated action\" aimed at ousting ENJASA, and by prolongation L&E and its shareholders, from their 30-year monopoly in Salta's gaming and lottery sector and redistributing its operations to other operators. Claimants' claim, in other words, is not limited to the question of whether the revocation of ENJASA's license was lawful, under domestic law or otherwise. Claimants are also not bringing a claim on behalf of ENJASA. Instead, they claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events violated their own rights as (indirect) investors in ENJASA under the Argentina-Austria BIT. Claimants thus frame their case as a treaty claim, not as a contract claim.213\n\nFor the majority of the Tribunal, neither the need for an \"investment\" to have been made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\" (Article 1(1) of the BIT), nor the requirement that \"[t]he contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\" (Article 1(1) *in fine* of the BIT), nor the provision that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute with reference to the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute\" (Article 8(6) of the BIT) excludes the assessment of whether the acts of a regulatory authority, such as ENREJA, that affect a foreign investor or its investment and are taken to implement domestic law and regulations, are in line with the substantive standards of treatment in the Argentina-Austria BIT (*contra* Dissent, para. 218).\n\n217.\n\nIn light of how Claimants frame their claim, it is irrelevant for present purposes whether ENJASA's license is to be qualified under Argentine law as a contractual or quasi-contractual arrangement. After all, even if it were correct that the License had to be qualified as a contractual or quasi-contractual arrangement, Claimants' claim is not framed as a breach of that License, but as part of the broader factual matrix just outlined.\n\n218.\n\nFurthermore, even if Claimants' claim was limited to the question whether the revocation of ENJASA's license - looked at in isolation - resulted in a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT, there would be a plausible claim that this revocation did not constitute the exercise of a contractual right. Instead, there would be a plausible claim that by the very terms of Resolution No. 240/13, the revocation was based on the authority conferred to ENREJA under Law No. 7020. It concerned, as stated in Resolution No. 240/13,\n\na *police activity of the government*, understood as an \"*administrative*\" function which is intended to protect the security, morality or public health [\u2026], which, in the case under analysis, seeks to secure the proper provision of a licensed activity.214\n\nExhibit C-031 p. 21 (emphases in the original).\n\n219.\n\nIn addition, Claimants present a plausible argument that the revocation of ENJASA's license was not based upon the operation of the contractual termination clause in Article 6 of the Transfer Agreement. As stated in Resolution No. 240/13:\n\n[T]he revocation of the license as a penalty shall not be confused with the right to *declare*, *automatically and by operation of law*, the extinction and/or cancellation of the license, provided for in Article 6 of Decree No. 3616/99, which power is vested in the Executive Branch in six events: expiration of the license, breach of the payment of the royalty, violation of the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Law No. 7020, exploitation of any game of chance without ENREJA's prior authorization and the total or partial assignment and transfer of the powers granted in the license without prior authorization of the Executive Branch.215\n\n*Id.*, at p. 31.\n\n220.\n\nAgainst this background, there is a plausible claim that ENREJA qualified the revocation of ENJASA's license as a sanction in the sense of Article 13 of Law No. 7020 for alleged breaches of ENJASA's legal obligations under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 concerning antimoney laundering provisions and the hiring of operators without ENREJA's authorization. This sanction, in ENREJA's own words, could plausibly be said to be imposed in the exercise of public authority, not as a matter of any contractual authorization.\n\n221.\n\nConsequently, even if the present case was limited to the question of whether the revocation of ENJASA's license in and of itself constituted a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT, and even if the License was to be qualified under Argentine law as a contractual or quasi-contractual instrument, there would still be a plausible claim that the revocation of that License was an act of public power or *puissance publique*. This, in turn, would plausibly allow to qualify a claim concerning the legality of the revocation of ENJASA's license under the BIT as a treaty claim, rather than a contract claim given that a well-established line of jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals distinguishes between contract claims and treaty claims in cases relating to the termination of investor-State contracts based on whether the termination constituted a commercial act any party to a contract, including a private actor, could engage in, or whether the act in question constituted the exercise of public authority that is to be measured against the standards of treatment in the BIT.216\n\n*See, for example*, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award (12 May 2005), para. 299 (AL RA 101 / CL-014); *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004), para. 174 (AL RA 119).\n\n222.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal therefore concludes in respect of the first prong of Respondent's first objection, that the claims triggered by the revocation of ENJASA's license, as presented by Claimants in the present proceedings, do not constitute contract claims, but relate to the breach of substantive standards granted under the Argentina-Austria BIT and constitute treaty claims.\n\n***C. Prima facie breaches of the BIT***\n----------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to determining whether the factual matrix presented by Claimants is *prima facie* able to result in a breach of the substantive rights under the Argentina-Austria BIT, in particular its provisions on expropriation in Article 4 of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment in Article 2(1) of the BIT, and national treatment in Article 3(1) of the BIT. It is in this context that Respondent's third objection insofar as it relates to the scope of protection of shareholder-investors becomes relevant whereby the Tribunal must determine to which extent Claimants as direct shareholders in L&E and indirect shareholders in ENJASA enjoy protection under the substantive treaty standards contained in the Argentina-Austria BIT and have a *prima facie* claim that their rights as shareholderinvestors under the treaty have been breached by the revocation of ENJASA's license through Resolution No. 240/13 and subsequent events.\n\n224.\n\nIn making this determination, the Tribunal therefore addresses not only aspects that are part of Respondent's first objection that Claimants have failed to show the existence of a *prima facie* claim proper, but also those aspects of Respondent's third objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* which concern Respondent's claim that, in light of Respondent's construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT, Claimants, as indirect shareholders in ENJASA, are unable to bring claims relating to assets held by ENJASA, in particular claims arising out of the revocation of ENJASA's operating license unless the revocation of the license resulted in an expropriation of \"assets\"/\"financial assets\" of ENJASA.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal will first turn to the question whether Claimants have been able to show a *prima facie* breach of Article 4 of the BIT. In this context, the Tribunal will also address Respondent's argument on the impact of Article 4(3) of the BIT on claims by shareholder investors, both in respect of expropriation and other causes of action under the Argentina-Austria BIT. The Tribunal will then analyze whether Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT (fair and equitable treatment). Finally, it will assess whether Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT (national treatment).\n\n*(i) Prima facie breach of Article 4 of the BIT*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT protects investments against uncompensated expropriations and \"measures having an equivalent effect;\" Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT provides, as per the translation agreed by the Parties, as follows:\n\nARTICLE 4\n\n(1) The term \"expropriation\" includes both nationalization as well as any other measure having an equivalent effect.\n\n(2) The investments of investors of a Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law and against compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or the impending expropriation became public knowledge. Compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall bear interest until the date of payment, at the customary bank rate of the State in whose territory the investment has been made; shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Assessment and payment of compensation shall be adequately provided for no later than at the time of expropriation.\n\n227.\n\nThe question in the present context therefore is whether the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events can be understood, in a *prima facie* plausible manner, to result in an expropriation in the sense of Article 4(1) of the BIT of Claimants' investment, that is, their direct shareholding in L&E as well as their indirect shareholding in ENJASA.\n\n228.\n\nClearly, the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events do not constitute a direct expropriation, which requires the taking and transfer of title, of Claimants' investment. Claimants, as is undisputed between the Parties, continue to own title to their shares in L&E and ENJASA. Yet, the notion of expropriation in Article 4(1) of the BIT also encompasses \"measures having an equivalent effect,\" that is, so-called indirect or *de facto* expropriations. In the jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals, it has been held that such indirect expropriations can occur, inter alia, when host State measures, which directly affect assets of the company, substantially and permanently deprive the shareholder-investor of her investment in the shareholding in the company and effectively destroy the value of those shares. In such cases, shareholders can bring claims based on (indirect) expropriation of their shareholding in the host State.217\n\nFor examples, see only the cases invoked by Claimants to support their *prima facie* claim that an indirect expropriation of their investment as shareholders has occurred through interference with assets of the company in Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 32-36: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

After all, Claimants claim that without ENJASA's exclusive operating license, and taking into account the transfer of ENJASA operations to new operators, their investment in Salta's gaming and lottery sector, as well as the value of their shares in L&E and ENJASA, have been effectively destroyed.218 This satisfies, in the Tribunal's view, the threshold for presenting a *prima facie* claim that Claimants have suffered an indirect expropriation of their investment in Argentina contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n*See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 397 (\"The revocation of ENJASA's licence without the payment of any compensation in itself destroyed the entirety of Claimants' investment in Argentina. The subsequent transfer of lease agreements and employment contracts to ENJASA's competitors confirmed the definitive taking of the investment, leaving Claimants without any economic basis to continue their investment.\"). Similarly, CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 80 (\"[\u2026] by revoking ENJASA's licence, the Argentine Republic prevented Claimants from operating 46 gaming tables in four casinos, 1376 slot machines in 15 slot machine halls and from operating and/or commercializing 14 lottery games. Thus, the revocation enacted in Resolution No. 240/13, destroyed the commercial value of Claimants' investment. There was thus an indirect expropriation of Claimants' investment.\" - (footnote omitted)).\n\n230.\n\nWithout prejudging the test ultimately applicable on the merits, it would seem, however, that certain factors will play a role during the merits phase in determining whether a breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT has occurred. First, it would seem relevant to consider whether the revocation of the License and subsequent acts have substantially and permanently deprived Claimants of the economic benefits attached to their shareholding in L&E and ENJASA. In this context, one issue would seem to be the influence of the circumstance that the Sheraton Hotel Salta remained operative and under ENJASA's control after the revocation of ENJASA's license on the determination of whether an indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and ENJASA has occurred. Similarly, the fact that Claimants were allegedly offered to continue operating certain parts of their hitherto exclusive gaming and lottery operations would seem to be a factor for consideration in determining the existence of an indirect expropriation, namely whether Claimants' investment has been effectively destroyed.\n\n231.\n\nSecond, it would seem relevant to consider to which extent the revocation of ENJASA's license constituted a regular exercise of the host State's regulatory power. During the merits phase, it would thus seem to be an issue whether the revocation of ENJASA's license constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA's supervisory powers under Law No. 7020, as argued by Respondent, or whether the revocation constituted an abuse of ENREJA's regulatory powers.\n\n232.\n\nApart from a *prima facie* breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, the Parties have also debated the role and interpretation of Article 4(3) of the treaty. This article reads, in its authentic German and Spanish versions, as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ARTIKEL 4 [...] (3) Enteignet eine Vertragspartei die Verm\u00f6genswerte einer Gesellschaft, die in Anwendung von Artikel 1 Absatz 2 dieses Abkommens als ihre eigene Gesellschaft anzusehen ist, und an welcher der Investor der anderen Vertragspartei Anteilsrechte besitzt, so wendet sie die Bestimmungen des Absatzes 2 dieses Artikels dergestalt an, da\u00df die angemessene Entsch\u00e4digung dieses Investors sichergestellt wird. [...] | ARTICULO 4 [...] (3) Cuando una Parte Contratante expropie los activos financieros de una sociedad que, conforme con las disposiciones del Art\u00edculo 1, apartado 2 del presente Convenio, sea considerada como sociedad perteneciente a esa Parte Contratante y en la cual el inversor de la otra Parte Contratante tuviera derechos de participaci\u00f3n, aquella aplicar\u00e1 las disposiciones del apartado 2 de este Art\u00edculo de manera tal que la indemnizaci\u00f3n apropiada del inversor resulte asegurada. [...] |\n\n233.\n\nAs detailed above, the Parties debated the application of this provision to ENJASA's operating license in light of the potentially differing meanings of the German term \"*Verm\u00f6genswerte*\" and the Spanish term \"*activos financieros*\" in the two authentic versions of the BIT. While the German term \"*Verm\u00f6genswerte*\" would seem to cover ENJASA's license as an asset, as argued by Claimants,219 the Spanish term \"*activos financieros*\" might not, as argued by Respondent.220 Moreover, for Respondent, Article 4(3) of the BIT limits shareholder-investors, such as Claimants, to claims for expropriation and excludes claims by shareholder-investors for breach of other treaty commitments, such as fair and equitable treatment or national treatment.221\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 46-60.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 199-211.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 212-213.\n\n234.\n\nAs a result of the differences in the authentic German and Spanish versions of Article 4(3) of the BIT, the Parties have provided diverging translations of this provision into English. Indicating the differences in the Parties' translations, the English text of Article 4(3) of the BIT is as follows:\n\nWhere a Contracting Party expropriates the financial [Respondent] assets of a company that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 2 hereof, is deemed to be a company belonging to that Contracting Party, and in which the investor of the other Contracting Party owns [Respondent]/has [Claimants] shares, the provisions set forth in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied by the former so as to guarantee the appropriate compensation of the investor.\n\n235.\n\nIt is not necessary that the Tribunal comes to an ultimate conclusion on the interpretation of Article 4(3) of the BIT at the present stage of the proceedings. Instead, it is sufficient that Claimants have presented a *prima facie* plausible construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT. Paraphrasing *Ambatielos,* \"[i]f the interpretation [...] relied upon appears to be one of the possible interpretations that may be placed upon it, though not necessarily the correct one, then the [\u2026] claim must\" proceed to the merits.222\n\n*Ambatielos (Greece v. United Kingdom)*, Judgment (19 May 1953), ICJ Reports 1953, p. 18 (AL RA 235).\n\n236.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants have made out a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license resulted in an expropriation of one of ENJASA's assets, entitling Claimants as indirect shareholders in ENJASA under Article 4(3) of the BIT to compensation. To start with, ENJASA qualifies, as required by Article 4(3), as an Argentine company, as defined in Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\n237.\n\nIn addition, Claimants have presented a plausible construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT under which ENJASA's operating license is protected as an \"asset\". In this context, the Tribunal is of the view, that it does not yet have to resolve the Parties' controversy about the proper interpretation of the notion of \"asset\" in Article 4(3) of the BIT in light of the differing language used by the German and Spanish versions of the BIT (\"*Vermogenswerte\"* versus \"*activos financieros\u2019\")* under the applicable *prima facie* test. What is sufficient, at the present stage of the proceedings, is that Claimants' construction plausibly covers ENJASA's operating license as a protected \"asset\" in the sense of Article 4(3) of the BIT and that the revocation of that License and subsequent events can be plausibly understood as having resulted in an expropriation of ENJASA. Claimants have forwarded such a plausible construction of Article 4(3) of the BIT by arguing that, according to Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the meaning of the German version of Article 4(3) of the BIT should be adopted as it best reconciles the diverging texts.\n\n238.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants have alleged that the revocation of ENJASA's operating license, and the subsequent transfer of operations to new operators, destroyed ENJASA's business operation in the gaming and lottery sector in the Province of Salta. As pleaded, it is *prima facie* plausible to consider the revocation of the License, and the subsequent transfer of operations to new operators, as an act that results in an expropriation in the sense of Article 4(1) of the BIT of certain of ENJASA's assets or ENJASA as a whole. Also in this context, as the Tribunal has pointed out above, it would seem relevant to consider during the merits stage of the proceedings to which extent the revocation of the License and subsequent events have indeed resulted in a substantial and permanent deprivation of ENJASA's assets under the circumstances and whether the revocation of the License was, or was not, a regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers pursuant to Law No. 7020. For purposes of the present stage of the proceedings, however, Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim that ENJASA was faced with an expropriation, which in turn could entitle Claimants as ENJASA's indirect shareholder to compensation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the BIT.\n\n239.\n\nAll in all, with respect to Article 4 of the BIT, in the Tribunal's view, Claimants have made a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events constituted an indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and ENJASA contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Furthermore, Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events constituted an expropriation of certain of ENJASA's assets or of ENJASA as a whole which could entitle Claimants to compensation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the BIT.\n\n240.\n\nAs a final issue, the Tribunal must address Respondent's argument that Article 4(3) of the BIT limits the protection of shareholder-investors under the BIT in cases where the assets of the company have been expropriated, to the exclusion of other standards of protection, such as fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT, or national treatment under Article 3(1) of the BIT. In this respect, it bears noting that nothing in the text of Article 4(3) of the BIT supports such argument, on a *prima facie* reading of that provision. Instead, the formulation of Article 4(3) of the BIT *prima facie* suggests that that provision was intended to grant shareholder-investors an additional cause of action when a local company, in which a covered investor holds shares, is expropriated.\n\n241.\n\nThis additional cause of action differs from a claim of shareholder-investors under Article 4(2) of the BIT for an (indirect) expropriation of their shareholding. Under Article 4(3) of the BIT, a claimant would only have to show that assets/financial assets of the company were subject to an expropriation, without the need to demonstrate any detrimental effect on the value of the shareholding. By contrast, for a claim under Article 4(2) of the BIT, the shareholder-investor would need to show that the interference of the host State with assets of the company had an effect on the shareholding that was so severe that it qualifies as a \"measure having an equivalent effect\" on that shareholding.\n\n*(ii) Prima facie breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to determining whether Claimants have presented a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT. Given the circumstances of the revocation of ENJASA's license, a breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT, which, as per the English translation agreed between the Paties, requires the Contracting States to \"accor[d] at all times fair and equitable treatment\" appears *prima facie* plausible. Fair and equitable treatment has been interpreted, *inter alia*, to protect covered investors and their investments against the arbitrary exercise of public powers, as well as against harassment by public authorities, to require public authorities to administer the applicable law in good faith, to entitle foreign investors and their investments to due process, and to protect an investor's legitimate expectations.223\n\nFor examples, see only the cases invoked by Claimants to support their *prima facie* claim that they were not accorded fair and equitable treatment in Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 84-85: *El Paso Energy International Company v.

In such situations, the shareholder-investor has been considered to have a right, and consequently standing, under the fair and equitable treatment standard that the company in which she has invested is treated in accordance with the above mentioned rule of law-elements.224\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Yet, without prejudging the test ultimately applicable on the merits, it would seem relevant to consider, and for Claimants to show, to which extent deficiencies existed in ENREJA's revocation of ENJASA's license as alleged by Claimants, or whether instead ENREJA's action was the regular exercise of its regulatory authority under Law No. 7020 that conformed to the requirements of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*See* Memorial on the Merits, paras. 423-432; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 84.\n\n*(iii) Prima facie breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nWhile claims for (direct and indirect) expropriation and breach of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT have *prima facie* been demonstrated to be plausible, the Tribunal considers that the invocation by Claimants of a breach of the national treatment provision in Article 3(1) of the BIT has not been substantiated in a plausible manner, therefore failing the *prima facie* test.\n\n246.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT provides as follows in its authentic German and Spanish versions:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ARTIKEL 3 Behandlung von Investitionen (1) Jede Vertragspartei behandelt Investoren der anderen Vertragspartei und deren Investitionen nicht weniger g\u00fcnstig als ihre eigenen Investoren und deren Investitionen oder Investoren dritter Staaten und deren Investitionen. [...] | ARTICULO 3 Tratamiento de las inversiones (1) Cada Parte Contratante otorgar\u00e1 a los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante y a sus inversiones, un tratamiento no menos favorable que el otorgado a sus propios inversores y a sus inversiones o a los inversores de terceros Estados y a sus inversiones. [...] |\n\n247.\n\nThe Parties have provided slightly diverging translations into English of this provision. In the Tribunal's view, these differences, however, are irrelevant for interpreting Article 3(1) of the BIT. This notwithstanding, the Parties' respective translations are reproduced here as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Translation by Claimants | Translation by Respondent |\n| ARTICLE 3 | ARTICLE 3 |\n| Treatment of Investments | Treatment of Investments |\n| (1) Each Contracting Party shall treat investors of | (1) Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors |\n| the respective other Contracting Party and their | of the other Contracting Party and to their |\n| investments no less favourable than its own | investments treatment no less favourable than the |\n| investors and their investments or investors from | treatment it accords to its own investors and to their |\n| third countries and their investments. | investments or to the investors of any third State |\n| [...] | and to their investments. [...] |\n\n248.\n\nClaimants allege that, after the revocation of its License, ENJASA's operations have been transferred to local operators without the same stringent requirements that ENJASA had to meet at the time the gaming and lottery industry in Salta was privatized in 1999/2000.226 Moreover, Claimants point out that operating licenses for gaming activities were granted, at least in part, to those operators whose alleged hiring by ENJASA ENREJA had used as a ground to revoke ENJASA's license.227 Claimants consider both of these factors to result in a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n*See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 208; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 87-88.\n\n*See* Memorial on the Merits, para. 349.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, is unable to see how either one of these aspects, or both aspects together, could plausibly result in a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Article 3(1) prohibits nationality-based discriminations between foreign investors and their investments, on the one hand, and national investors and their investments, on the other. Such discrimination, however, presupposes that foreign and national investors and their investments are affected differently, *de iure* or *de facto*, either by the same government measure or by measures that are sufficiently closely connected so as to result in a discriminatory treatment.228\n\n*See* Andrew Newcombe and Llu\u00eds Paradell, *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Protection* (WoltersKluwer 2009) 182-83 (CL-027).\n\n250.\n\nYet, in the scenario pleaded by Claimants, the Tribunal is unable to detect any *prima facie* discrimination of the type targetted by Article 3(1) of the BIT. First, in light of the above, Article 3(1) of the BIT does not plausibly allow, for purposes of establishing discrimination or differentiated treatment, a comparison of the conditions between the tender process in 1999/2000 and the award of new operating licenses in 2013/2014. Instead, governments remain free to change the conditions for tendering public concessions or licenses for the operation of economic activities at different points in time as part of their regulatory powers and their right to regulate. The purpose of non-discrimination provisions is to ensure equal treatment as a precondition for fair competition at any given moment in time, not to freeze market regulation over time. The latter, however, would be the case if operating licenses in 2013/2014 in completely different economic, social, and political circumstances would have to be awarded under the same conditions as in 1999/2000. For the same reason, that is, the need to ensure flexibility in government regulation over time, the Tribunal does not find that Article 3(1) of the BIT can plausibly be interpreted to be violated because the Province of Salta decided to switch from a one-firm monopoly in the gaming and lottery sector in 1999/2000 to a system with multiple operators in 2013/2014.\n\n251.\n\nSecond, for purposes of the analysis of Article 3(1) of the BIT it is irrelevant that the new operators who were awarded a license in 2013/2014 had been in business relations with ENJASA found to be illegal by ENREJA - which was one of the grounds ENREJA invoked to justify the revocation of ENJASA's exclusive license. Here again, the revocation of ENJASA's exclusive license and the award of new non-exclusive licenses to new operators are separate scenarios. The revocation of ENJASA's exclusive license itself cannot plausibly be considered to have been discriminatory as Claimants do not allege that a license benefitting an investor of another nationality was, in similar circumstances, not revoked. Likewise, the award of the new licences to other operators cannot be plausibly considered to have been discriminatory for Claimants as Claimants had not tendered for these licenses.\n\n252.\n\nIn respect of the latter, it could have been a *prima facie* plausible claim that Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT if ENJASA had been allegedly prevented from participating, at equal terms with the new operators, in the award of new licenses, or if, because of foreign ownership, it had been treated differently in that process. Yet, this is not Claimants' claim. They do not argue that they could not have participated in 2013/2014 in the award of new licenses at equal terms with national operators; instead, they claim that the award of licenses to the new operators in 2013/2014 as such resulted in a nationalitybased discrimination of Claimants in contravention of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Such a claim, however, cannot be made to be plausible in law. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have been unable to make a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n253.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal has now determined that Claimants have presented plausible claims that their rights as foreign shareholder-investors under Articles 4 and 2(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT *prima facie* have been breached. By contrast, the Tribunal has found that Claimants have not presented a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. This finding responds both to aspects of Respondent's first objection and to Respondent's third objection insofar as it relates to the scope of protection of shareholderinvestors.\n\n***D. The effect of the forum selection clauses***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turns to Respondent's argument - the second prong of Respondent's first objection - that the forum selection clauses in both the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Transfer Agreement affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. However, in the Tribunal's view, the forum selection clauses in these two instruments do not exclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n255.\n\nFirst of all, both clauses do not extend *ratione personae* to the present dispute with Respondent who is not herself party to the Transfer Agreement, nor was involved in the privatization of ENJASA through the public tender in 1999/2000. More importantly, however, both forum selection clauses do not encompass *ratione materiae* Claimants' claims for breach of the BIT. This holds true with respect to both Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement.\n\n*(i) Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nArticle 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions, the wording of which, including the Parties diverging translations, is reproduced above,229 provides that all participants in the public tender process for the sale of Class A-shares of ENJASA by the Province of Salta submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of the Province of Salta. It applies to all documents and instruments related to the public tender and the Transfer Agreement.\n\n*See supra* para. 39.\n\n257.\n\nHowever, the wording and context of Article 8.3 also make clear that the forum selection clause only applies to disputes arising out of the public tender and its implementation, that is, disputes of successful as well as unsuccessful bidders who participated in the tender proceeding and who wish to complain, for example, about the conduct of those proceedings. It concerns the submission of participants in the tender process to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Salta in respect of the public tender. By contrast, Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Condition cannot be read so as to cover disputes for breach of the BIT arising in connection with the revocation of ENJASA's license in 2013 and subsequent events, which is entirely unconnected to the privatization of ENJASA in 1999/2000. Such treaty disputes are beyond the remit *ratione materiae* of Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Condition.\n\n*(ii) Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nArticle 13.1 of the Agreement, the wording of which is reproduced above,230 contains a forum selection clause that provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Salta. Yet, this provision does not apply *ratione materiae* to disputes under the BIT in connection with the revocation of ENJASA's operating license and subsequent events.\n\n*See supra* para. 42.\n\n259.\n\nInstead, as becomes clear from its wording, Article 13.1 is limited to disputes arising out of, and relating to the rights and obligations under, the Transfer Agreement. Sentence 2 of Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement stipulates that the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Salta applies to all effects derived from the present agreement (\"[\u2026] todos los efectos derivados del mismo [ie este contrato]\"). From the wording of this forum selection clause, it is therefore clear that disputes under the BIT are not covered *ratione materiae*.\n\n260.\n\nWhat is more, neither the revocation of ENJASA's license in 2013, nor subsequent events, are effects derived from the Transfer Agreement. This is confirmed by Article 7.1.2 of the Transfer Agreement, which deals with consequences arising out of a breach of the buyer's duties under the Agreement after the transfer has been effected. It stipulates that contractual consequences that may attach to the breach of the buyer's obligations, are \"without prejudice to those [sections] determined by Law No. 7020, the Regulatory Decree or the License.\"231 This provision therefore makes clear that the consequences of a breach of the Transfer Agreement, and by prolongation disputes arising therefrom, are independent from sanctions both under the regulatory regime governing gaming in Salta and under the License, and by prolongation disputes arising in that context. Consequently, disputes arising in connection with public law sanctions cannot be regarded as disputes derived from the Transfer Agreement and are thus not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction clause of Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement.\n\nExhibit A RA 11: \"Si realizada la transferencia de las acciones el Comprador incumpliere con alguna de las obligaciones impuestas por este Contrato y/o el Pliego y/o dem\u00e1s documentaci\u00f3n integrante de la licitaci\u00f3n, se aplicar\u00e1n las siguientes sanciones sin perjuicio de las determinadas en la ley 7020, su Decreto Reglamentario y la Licencia.\" The Parties agreed on the following translation of this clause: \"7.1.2. If once the transfer of shares has been performed, the Purchaser failed to comply with any of the obligations arising from this Agreement and/or from the Bidding Terms and Conditions and/or any other documents that form part of the Bidding Process, the following penalties shall apply, notwithstanding those penalties set forth in Law No. 7020, its Regulatory Decree and the License.\"\n\n261.\n\nGiven the limited scope *ratione materiae* of both Article 8.3 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and Article 13.1 of the Transfer Agreement, it is also not necessary to address the question to which extent contractual forum selection clauses are able to waive treaty claims or recourse under the Argentina-Austria BIT. Neither forum selection clause applies *ratione materiae* to the present dispute and, already for this reason, can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal.\n\n***E. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n262.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have met the threshold of presenting *prima facie* claims for breach of Article 4 of the BIT relating to expropriation, and for breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT relating to fair and equitable treatment. Their claims as presented qualify as treaty claims, not contract claims. They have also presented *prima facie* claims that these treaty provisions were breached in relation to Claimants as shareholder-investors in L&E and ENJASA. In particular, the Tribunal found that Article 4(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT cannot be interpreted *prima facie* as limiting claims by shareholder-investors to breaches of Article 4 of the BIT for expropriation. Moreover, as indicated above, the forum selection clauses in the Bidding Terms and Conditions as well as the Transfer Agreement have a limited scope, which does not cover claims for breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT arising out of the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events. By contrast, Claimants have, in the Tribunal's view, not been able to present a *prima facie* claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT relating to national treatment. The Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent's objection relating to a lack of a *prima facie* claim insofar as it relates to claims for breach of Articles 2(1) and 4 of the BIT, but upholds it with respect to Claimants' claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the treaty.\n\n**3. Respondent's Consent to Arbitrate**\n----------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nFinally, Respondent objects that she has not validly consented to arbitrate the present dispute under Article 8 of the BIT. Her objection rests, at its core, on the view that Claimants have not complied with the various and sequential requirements Article 8 of the BIT sets out for Austrian investors to follow prior to submitting their claim to ICSID arbitration. In Respondent's view, Claimants have not, contrary to Article 8(2) of the BIT, submitted the dispute now pending before this Tribunal to domestic courts after the amicable consultations they initiated on 30 April 2014 (for CAI), respectively 7 August 2014 (for CASAG), and have not, contrary to Article 8(3) of the BIT, waited for the lapse of 18 months while that dispute was pending in domestic courts, nor for a decision on the merits of that dispute.\n\n264.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent argues that any dispute submitted by ENJASA before domestic courts in order to review the legality of the revocation of its operating license could not fulfill the requirements under Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT as that dispute was not identical, in terms of the parties and the causes of action, to the dispute pending before this Tribunal. Moreover, Respondent argues that theses claims, even if they qualified as domestic recourses under Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT, were not preceded by amicable consultations for six months, as required by Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n265.\n\nInstead, what Claimants should have done, according to Respondent, in order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction, is to bring a claim for breach of the BIT in Argentine courts after initiating amicable consultations and waiting for six months, and only proceed to international arbitration once that claim had been pending domestically for 18 months or had not been granted on the merits. Respondent also contends that the necessary recourses for breach of the BIT exist under Argentine law and that they are capable of leading to a resolution of such a dispute within 18 months.\n\n266.\n\nFurthermore, for Respondent the alleged breach of the BIT - and thus also the dispute to which it led - arose only with the issuance by ENREJA of Resolution No. 315/13, not with the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13. The latter, Respondent argues, was not a final decision and therefore no dispute under the BIT could have existed yet. Consequently, ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 could not be considered as a submission of the dispute to \"the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\" in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT. For Respondent, Resolution No. 315/13 was also not a \"decision rendered\" in the sense of Article 8(3)(b) of the BIT.\n\n267.\n\nAs a subsidiary argument, Respondent further points out that, even if ENJASA's recourses against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13, in particular its Action for Annulment brought in the First Instance Court of Salta on 5 February 2014, were considered to fulfill the domestic remedy requirement under Article 8(2) of the BIT, Claimants' initiation of the present arbitration on 4 December 2014 would have been premature, as ENJASA's domestic recourse had not been pending for 18 months yet, nor had it resulted in a decision on the merits. Finally, Respondent considers that, in all events, Article 8(4) of the BIT bars this Tribunal's jurisdiction as ENJASA's claims against the revocation of its operating license in domestic courts have not been withdrawn.\n\n268.\n\nClaimants view the application of Article 8 of the BIT differently, as regards both that provision's abstract interpretation and its concrete application to the facts of the case. In Claimants' view, Article 8 of the BIT only provides, with its duty to engage in amicable consultations and to submit the dispute to domestic courts or an administrative jurisdiction, requirements that affect the admissibility of claims; it does not, by contrast, establish jurisdictional conditions, or conditions precedent, of Respondent's consent, which must be fulfilled prior to the initiation of its claims before the Tribunal.\n\n269.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants consider that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13, which resulted in Resolution No. 315/13, fulfilled the requirement in Article 8(2) of the BIT to have recourse to a domestic administrative jurisdiction. The issuance of Resolution No. 315/13, in turn, constituted, in Claimants' view, a decision on the merits in the sense of Article 8(3)(b) of the BIT, which allowed it to submit the dispute to international arbitration. These procedural steps, Claimants further point out, were accompanied by various meetings with representatives of the Province of Salta in order to discuss how ENJASA's license could be reinstated. In Claimants' view, the domestic recourses ENJASA had submitted in the present case were the only available and pertinent remedies within Argentina's domestic legal order to address the grievance Claimants allege to have suffered. Bringing claims for violation of the BIT against Respondent in her domestic courts, as suggested by Respondent, in Claimants' view, was not possible and in any event futile within the 18 months-framework Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT establishes.\n\n270.\n\nIn addressing the present objection, the Tribunal will, first, address the source and existence of Respondent's consent and the nature of the pre-arbitral requirements contained in Article 8 of the BIT. It will then turn to the question of Claimants' compliance with the requirement to conduct amicable consultations for a certain duration in Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT, address Claimants' compliance with Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT, and finally turn to the arguments concerning Article 8(4) of the BIT.\n\n***A. Source and existence of Respondent's consent and nature of the pre-arbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIn dispute settlement proceedings under public international law, consent is the cornerstone of, and *conditio sine qua non* for, the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal. This has been held consistently in the jurisprudence of the ICJ.232 Similarly, as a key element for the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the consent of both parties to submit the dispute to the Centre is needed.233 Whether, in the present instance, consent has been given by Repondent and whether, together with Claimants' consent, it can be relied on by the Tribunal as a basis of jurisdiction, is a question of interpreting Article 8 of the BIT pursuant to the rules on treaty interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n*See Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (15 June 1954), ICJ Reports 1954, pp. 19, 32 (AL RA 199); *East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)*, Judgment (30 June 1995), ICJ Reports 1995, pp. 90, 104-105, para. 34 (AL RA 200); *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment (3 February 2006), ICJ Reports 2006, pp. 6, 39-40, para. 88 (AL RA 39).\n\n*Daimler Chrysler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 168 (AL RA 96); *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008), para. 116 (AL RA 38). *See also* Report of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 18 March 1965, para. 23 (AL RA 154) (providing that consent \"is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\").\n\n272.\n\nIn this context, it is important to note that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not require that the Parties' consent is cast in the form of a contractual or contract-like \"arbitration agreement\" or \"agreement to arbitrate.\"234 It is equally possible that parties express their consent in the absence of privity, for example when the host State consents in advance and in relation to a generally defined class of potential claimants in an international investment treaty, and the claimant investor consents by bringing a concrete claim for breach of that treaty.\n\n*Contra* Dissent, paras. 4, 10, 19, 39, 43-56, 61, 65, 80, 188, 189, 191, 202-205.\n\n273.\n\nIn the latter scenario, analogies with contract-based arbitration and inter-State arbitration on the basis of compromissory clauses in international treaties should be treated with caution. Investment treaty arbitration is very different from contract-based arbitration, even if both take place under the ICSID framework. It does not involve the assessment of whether breach of an agreement concluded between the disputing parties has occurred, but whether the respondent State abided by commitments made in an international treaty concluded with the claimant investor's home State. But investment treaty arbitration is also different from inter-State arbitration because its disputes, while governed by public international law, are resolved between investors and host States. Investment treaty arbitration involves the review of legality under public international law of the host State's conduct initiated by an affected foreign investor. In terms of its function, it has therefore been likened to mechanisms of judicial review found domestically in administrative or constitutional courts or internationally in human rights courts.\n\n274.\n\nThese specificities of investment treaty arbitration also affect how investment treaty tribunals should analyze pre-arbitration requirements contained in the investor-State dispute settlement provisions of BITs. First, because its jurisdictional basis is not a contract, an investment treaty tribunal should not ask whether Respondent's offer to arbitrate in the BIT was matched by Claimants' acceptance, including compliance with any strict pre-arbitration requirement, so as to result in a contractual \"arbitration agreement.\" Instead, like in the context of dispute settlement under public international law, compliance with pre-arbitration requirements in a BIT should be analyzed as a question concerning the validity of the seisin of the Tribunal.235\n\nFor this conceptual approach *see* *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (1 April 2011), ICJ Reports 2011, pp. 70, 121 *et seq.*, paras. 122 *et seq*.\n\n275.\n\nYet, unlike in inter-State dispute settlement, where the ICJ has insisted, in certain cases,236 on the strict compliance with conditions of seisin under compromissory clauses, the Tribunal considers that, unless pre-arbitration requirements are formulated clearly and unmistakably as strict conditions to the validity of seisin, in investment treaty arbitration a more flexible and less formalistic approach is warranted. Such less formalistic approach is more in line with the object and purpose of investment treaties to promote and protect foreign investment for the development of economic cooperation between States. Moreover, investors - who are, unlike States, not subjects of public international law -cannot be expected to be accustomed to the formalities of inter-State communication and inter-State dispute settlement. Consequently, absent a clear and unmistakable formulation to the contrary, investors should not be held to the formalities of public international law dispute settlement with the same strictness as States.\n\n*See* *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment (3 February 2006), ICJ Reports 2006, pp. 6, 39-40, para. 88 (AL RA 39); *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (1 April 2011), ICJ Reports 2011, pp. 70, 125 *et seq.*, paras. 132 *et seq.* For the alleged relevance of these cases, *see* Dissent, paras. 6, 33-37, 92-93, 186.\n\n276.\n\nThese considerations also affect the interpretation of Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Article 8 of the BIT is the dispute settlement provision of a treaty, whose object and purpose is to promote and protect foreign investment. It cannot be seen in a pure inter-State context but is in fact addressed to investors, entitled to protection, and consequently has to be interpreted in that light.237 This does not mean that pre-arbitration requirements are optional. On the contrary, they remain, in principle, mandatory requirements. But - again, unless the pre-arbitration requirements are formulated clearly and unmistakably to require the same formalistic approach in assessing compliance with them - an investment treaty tribunal should accord greater flexibility to the disputing parties than the ICJ accords to conditions of seisin under compromissory clauses. It is against this background that the Tribunal proceeds to analyzing Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\nSimilarly, Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides that a non-party beneficiary third State \"shall comply with the conditions for its exercise provided for in the treaty or established in conformity with the treaty,\" can play no role in the current context. As investors are not States, the rules for beneficiary third States under Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention are not applicable to the relations between host States and investors covered under the BIT.\n\n277.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent's consent to arbitrate disputes under the BIT is contained in the first sentence of Article 8(4) of the BIT, which provides, as per the English translation agreed to by the Parties, that \"under the terms of this Agreement, each Contracting Party irrevocably consents in advance to the submission of any dispute to arbitration.\" This provision is a clear, certain and unequivocal manifestation of the consent of both Argentina and Austria to arbitrations initiated by investors of the other Contracting State. As stated in Article 8(4) of the BIT, this consent has been given \"irrevocably\" and \"in advance\" at the time the treaty entered into force.\n\n278.\n\nAs per the wording of Article 8(4) of the BIT, the consent of the two Contracting Parties to the BIT, therefore, does not only come into existence after any pre-arbitral requirements contained in Article 8 of the BIT have been fulfilled by the investor prior to her submission of the dispute to ICSID arbitration; instead, the two States' consent to arbitrate has existed all along since the time the Argentina-Austria BIT has entered into force. In light of the clear wording of Article 8(4) of the BIT, there is no room here for the conclusion other tribunals have reached on the basis of differently worded Argentine BITs, notably in *ICS v. Argentina*, that prior to the fulfillment of pre-arbitral requirements contained in a BIT's investor-State dispute settlement clause, \"[c]onsent is nonetheless not yet present.\"238\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited v. Argentine Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award in Jurisdiction (10 February 2012), para. 262 (AL RA 40).\n\n279.\n\nThe fact that consent to arbitrate disputes with an investor has been given in advance and irrevocably in the relationship between the two Contracting States to the Argentina-Austria BIT at the time the BIT entered into force also affects the legal nature of the requirements contained in Article 8 of the BIT. Since Respondent's consent clearly already existed since the time the BIT has entered into force, the pre-arbitral requirements laid down in Article 8 of the BIT, such as the need for amicable consultations in Article 8(1), or the need for prior recourse to domestic remedies in Article 8(3), cannot be viewed as constituting conditions precedent to the Respondent's consent, non-compliance with which prior to initiating the present arbitration would automatically and necessarily exclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as held by other tribunals on the basis of differently worded Argentine BITs.239 Instead, rather than affecting the existence of Respondent's consent to arbitrate, the pre-arbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT establish a procedure Claimants have to follow before the Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over the merits. This procedure concerns the \"how\" and \"when\" of the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction, not its \"whether.\"\n\n*See* *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 183 (AL RA 96); *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award (21 June 2011), para. 94 (AL RA 46); *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008), para. 160(2) (AL RA 38).\n\n280.\n\nIn that sense, the pre-arbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT concern the validity of Claimants' seisin and do not go, as conditions precedent to Respondent's consent, to the question of jurisdiction. This does not mean, as stated above, that the pre-arbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT are optional; they cannot be modified and their sequence cannot be altered. On the contrary, they have to be complied with before the Tribunal is able to proceed to analyzing the case on the merits. Yet, unless pre-arbitral requirements are formulated clearly as conditions precedent for the respondent State's consent, they do not all necessarily need to be complied with prior to initiating the present arbitration, but can also be fulfilled, as further detailed below, subsequent to that point in time and until a decision on jurisdiction is taken. This is one way how excessive formalism, which is inapposite in investment treaty arbitration, should be avoided.\n\n281.\n\nThat the pre-arbitral requirements set out in Articles 8(1)-(3) of the BIT do not constitute conditions precedent to Respondent's consent, also becomes clear from the wording of Article 8(4) itself. While the Spanish version of that provision uses the term \"*condiciones*\", a term that could lend itself to the view that the requirements in Article 8 conditioned Respondent's consent, the German version simply speaks of \"*Bestimmungen*\" (i.e., provisions), not \"*Bedingungen*\" (i.e., conditions), under which Respondent has given its consent. As the more differentiated use of words in the German version thus makes clear, the Contracting States to the BIT did not establish the pre-arbitral requirements in Article 8 of the BIT as conditions precedent to the existence of the host State's consent to investorState arbitration, but rather as mandatory procedural steps investors have to take before a claim can be decided by an international arbitral tribunal on the merits.\n\n282.\n\nAgainst this general background, the Tribunal now turns to addressing what the pre-arbitral requirements contained in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT require of Claimants and whether they have complied with them.\n\n***B. Amicable consultations pursuant to Article 8(1) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nArticle 8(1) of the BIT provides, as per the agreed English translation of the Parties, as follows:\n\nAny dispute with regard to investments between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Contracting Party concerning any subject matter governed by this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n284.\n\nThis provision establishes an obligation that investor-State disputes under the Argentina-Austria BIT be settled amicably. Yet, Article 8(1) of the BIT contains no more than a soft or \"best efforts\" obligation incumbent on both parties to try to settle the dispute through amicable consultations. As the wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT makes clear, this obligation only exists, per the agreed translation of the Parties into English, \"as far as possible.\" Consequently, if there are reasons why consultations are not possible at all (for example because there is no willingness to find a negotiated settlement between the Parties, or because the time-limits under domestic law for initiating the domestic recourses provided for under Article 8(2) of the BIT do not permit for negotiations to be pursued) or there are reasons why consultations cannot be pursued for full six months as envisaged by Article 8(2) of the BIT (for example because the time-limits under domestic law for initiating the domestic recourses provided for under Article 8(2) are shorter than six months), Article 8(1) of the BIT does not mandate the Parties to pursue negotiations, depending on the circumstance, either at all or beyond the point in time when the domestic remedies mentioned in Article 8(2) of the BIT have to be initiated.\n\n285.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants have complied with the requirement to conduct amicable consultations to settle the dispute pending before the Tribunal. Already on 27 August 2013, and therefore before any formal steps were taken by ENJASA to contest the validity of ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13, Mr. Tucek, the CEO of CASAG, met with representatives of the Province of Salta and of ENREJA to discuss what steps needed to be undertaken in order to reinstate ENJASA's exclusive license. Further meetings between representatives of Claimants and the Province of Salta addressing the consequences of the revocation of ENJASA's license took place after ENJASA had submitted its Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13.\n\n286.\n\nAlthough the principal point at issue during these meetings was the reinstatement of ENJASA's license, agreement on this issue would have settled any dispute between Claimants and Respondent under the BIT and avoided that the present proceedings be brought. In addition, representatives of Claimants were already involved in these negotiations, indicating that the issues at stake were not limited to the relationship between ENJASA and ENREJA, or the Province of Salta, but already concerned the rights and interests of the foreign shareholders in ENJASA. Finally, ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13, even if only in the form of a reservation of rights, expressly alluded to the breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT resulting from the revocation of the License. All of this shows that the \"dispute\", at the time, was not limited to claims for breach of domestic law between ENJASA and ENREJA, or the Province of Salta, but already concerned the rights of Claimants as foreign investors under the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n287.\n\nIn that context, the Tribunal accepts that Article 8(1) of the BIT contains a broad understanding of the \"dispute\" that must form the object of amicable consultations. Differently from what is provided for under the inter-State dispute settlement provisions in Article 9 of the BIT,240 Article 8(1) does not require that the dispute needs to relate specifically to the interpretation and application of the BIT to the case at hand. Instead, under Article 8(1) of the BIT, it is sufficient that the \"dispute\" be \"with regard to investments [\u2026] concerning any subject matter governed by this Agreement.\" This way of framing the notion of \"dispute\", in the Tribunal's view, encompasses not only treaty claims between the parties to the present proceedings, but any dispute that relates to how investments protected under the treaty are treated by authorities of the host State. In the present circumstances, the notion of \"dispute\" also covers negotiations concerning the reinstatement of ENJASA's license, even if at the time the breach of the BIT was not raised as the principal argument. Such a controversy qualifies as a dispute \"with regard to\" a covered investment and \"concer[ns] any subject matter governed by this Agreement.\"\n\nArticle 9(1) of the BIT provides that \"[a]ny dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, whenever possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.\"\n\n288.\n\nFurthermore, while the meetings and consultations took place between representatives of Claimants and of the Province of Salta, they fulfill, in the Tribunal's view, the need for Claimants to attempt the settlement of the dispute with Respondent, as the acts of the Province of Salta are attributable under international law to the Argentine Republic pursuant to Article 4(1) of the International Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal also has no indication of fact to conclude that Claimants engaged in these negotiations, which they initiated, without the genuine intention of trying to settle the dispute arising out of the revocation of ENJASA's license amicably. In the Tribunal's view, it cannot be required that Claimants furnish positive evidence of the existence of such genuine intentions in the absence of clear indications suggesting their absence.\n\n290.\n\nFinally, it needs to be noted that what is relevant in this context is not that, at the time, Claimants deliberately and intentionally qualified or denominated their actions as \"amicable consultations\" in the sense of Article 8(1) of the BIT; relevant is only that, objectively an attempt at settling the dispute has been made prior to initiating the domestic recourses mentioned in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT. As the Tribunal has laid out above,241 substance, in this context, should be preferred over form. Amicable consultations under Article 8(1) of the BIT do not require the same formalities as the use of \"diplomatic channels\" by the BIT's contracting States parties under Article 9(1) of the BIT as the first step in their inter-State dispute settlement under the BIT.\n\n*See supra* paras. 275-276.\n\n291.\n\nConsequently, that Claimants have again initiated, what in their view at the time were \"amicable consultations\" with the Argentine Republic through their letters of 30 April 2014 (in the name of CAI) and of 7 August 2014 (in the name of CASAG) is immaterial for purposes of determining whether Claimants have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in Article 8 of the BIT before. The renewed initiation of consultations from 30 April 2014 onwards would not override or invalidate the fact that earlier amicable consultations had taken place that fulfilled Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\n292.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimants have fulfilled the prior consultation requirement provided for in Article 8(1) of the BIT with the meeting between Mr. Tucek and representatives of the Privince of Salta of 27 August 2013 and its followups before ENJASA initiated its Action for Annulment against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13.\n\n***C. Compliance with Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nArticle 8(2) and (3) of the BIT provides, indicating slight, but immaterial differences in the translations of the Parties, as follows:\n\n(2) If the dispute cannot be settled through consultations within a term of six months, the dispute may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n(3) The dispute may be submitted to an arbitral tribunal in the following cases:\n\na) where, after a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the date of notification of the initiation of the proceeding before the afore-mentioned jurisdiction [Respondent]/authorities [Claimants], no decision was rendered on the merits;\n\nb) where such decision has been rendered, but the parties are still in dispute [Respondent]/the dispute persists [Claimants]. In such case, recourse to the arbitral tribunal shall render ineffective any decision previously adopted at the national level;\n\nc) where the parties to the dispute have so agreed.\n\n294.\n\nThus, in addition to the need to engage in amicable consultations pursuant to Article 8(1) of the BIT, Article 8(3) provides for conditions under which the dispute can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. Apart from the - presently not relevant - case of the parties' agreement (Article 8(3)(c)), this can occur if the dispute has been submitted, either for 18 months without a decision on the merits (Article 8(3)(a)) or until such a decision is rendered without resolving the dispute (Article 8(3)(b)), to one of the domestic jurisdictions or authorities referred to in Article 8(2) of the BIT. Thus, before Claimants are able to proceed to ICSID arbitration, they need to have obtained either a decision on the merits by a domestic judicial or administrative jurisdiction or waited for such a decision for 18 months. Furthermore, Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that the submission to the domestic jurisdictions or authorities should be preceded by unsuccessful amicable consultations for six months.\n\n295.\n\nTo determine whether these requirements have been fulfilled in the present case, the Tribunal will first address the nature of the dispute that must have been submitted to a domestic judicial or administrative jurisdiction. It then addresses whether any of the domestic recourses initiated by ENJASA fulfills the requirement in Article 8(2) of the BIT to have recourse to the \"competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction.\" Subsequently, the Tribunal addresses whether Claimants have complied with the requirement in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT that the dispute must have been pending for 18 months in a domestic jurisdiction.\n\n*(i) The notion of dispute in Article 8 of the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nA first issue that must be addressed in this context by the Tribunal is whether the recourse to a domestic jurisdiction required under Article 8(3) of the BIT must involve, as argued by Respondent, a dispute identical to that submitted to ICSID arbitration, that is, a dispute between identical parties and relating to an identical cause of action, namely a breach of the BIT, or whether it is sufficient, as argued by Claimants, that the dispute in the domestic context involves substantially similar facts, without the need for identity between the parties and causes of action. Only if Respondent's position was the correct one, would it be necessary for the Tribunal to determine the issue, which was highly contested between the Parties and their experts, whether recourses of shareholder-investors for liability of the federal State for breach of a BIT in case the complained of conduct originated from conduct of one of the federated provinces are possible within Argentina's domestic legal order or not and whether they can result in a decision on the merits within 18 months.\n\n297.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the notion of \"dispute\" for which recourse to domestic remedies must be had pursuant to Article 8(3) of the BIT cannot be understood in the narrow terms presented by Respondent. Instead, the notion of \"dispute\" under Article 8(3) of the BIT must be understood, as already pointed out above in the context of Article 8(1) of the BIT,242 in a broad manner. What is relevant, in the Tribunal's view, is not that the specific cause of action, i.e., liability for damages for breach of the BIT, has been examined domestically in proceedings between identical parties to the present arbitration, but that a domestic jurisdiction had the opportunity to correct the complained about measure, thus avoiding the need for formal international dispute settlement through investor-State arbitration. This is all that is required in order to meet the object and purpose of a domestic-remedies-first provision, such as Article 8(3) of the BIT, namely to provide domestic institutions with an opportunity of self-correction.243\n\n*See supra* para. 287.\n\n*Cf.* *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 December 2012), para. 135 (CL-137); *Philip Morris Brands S\u00e1rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 July 2013), para. 148 (CL-134).\n\n298.\n\nIn the present case, exactly such an opportunity, which would have avoided the need for formal recourse to investor-State arbitration was afforded in Argentina's domestic legal order when ENJASA challenged the legality of the revocation of its operating license, first through its Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13, and later through its Action for Annulment against Resolution No. 315/13. Incidentally, also in this respect, it bears noting that ENJASA's Action for Annulment made the argument that the revocation of the License constituted a breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT.244 ENJASA Action for Annulment thus already vindicated the treaty claims pending before the Tribunal, even though the domestic recourse was between different parties and involved a different remedy.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-221, pp. 130.-131.\n\n299.\n\nThat this reading of the notion of \"dispute\" in Article 8 of the BIT is the correct one also follows from a look at the text of Article 8 of the BIT *in toto*. Thus. Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that the \"dispute\" in question \"may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\" In particular the fact that Article 8(2) of the BIT speaks of the possibility that the \"dispute\" may be submitted to the competent \"administrative jurisdiction\" is a clear indication that the contracting parties to the Argentina-Austria BIT did not understand the notion of \"dispute\" in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT to be limited to treaty claims between the parties to the later international arbitration.\n\n300.\n\nIndeed, it is uncommon that claims for breach of an international treaty are assigned to an \"administrative jurisdiction,\" that is, administration-internal adjudicatory recourses entertained by bodies or entities that are part of the executive, rather than the judiciary.245 In fact, the Tribunal has not been pointed to the existence of such a mechanism in either the Republic of Austria or the Republic of Argentina where claims for the breach of a BIT between foreign investors and the host State could be resolved by an \"administrative jurisdiction.\"\n\nThat this is the interpretation to be given to the notion of \"administrative jurisdiction\" becomes particularly clear from the German version of Article 8(2) of the BIT, which speaks of \"*Verwaltungsverfahren*\" (i.e., proceedings before administrative agencies or bodies) not \"*Verwaltungsgerichtsverfahren*\" (i.e., proceedings before administrative courts). To the same effect, the German version of Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT speaks of *\"Behorden\"* as the superordinate concept covering \"the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction,\" not of \"*Gerichte*\". \" *Gerichte*\", however, would have been the correct technical term, if what was intended by the use of the contracting parties of the term \"the competent administrative jurisdiction/authorities,\" was a reference to proceedings before an administrative court, rather than before an administrative entity or body that is part of the executive, not the judiciary. The Spanish version of the BIT, in turn, uses the generic term \"jurisdicci\u00f3n\", which can equally be used to refer to proceedings before administrative courts and administration-internal recourses.\n\n301.\n\nArticle 8(4), second sentence of the BIT, in turn, confirms this broad understanding of \"dispute.\" It requires that \"[f]rom the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, each party to the dispute shall take all the required measures to withdraw the pending judicial proceedings.\" As detailed further below, this obligation of the parties is not limited to withdrawing from domestic courts a pending treaty claim between the identical parties to the present proceedings, but covers the broader set of proceedings that relates to the same factual matrix as the present proceedings, whether between identical parties or between the local subsidiary of foreign shareholder-investors and domestic authorities with separate legal personality under domestic law from the respondent State.\n\n302.\n\nFinally, the narrow reading of the notion of \"dispute\" supported by Respondent would have the effect that shareholder-investors who wish to vindicate their rights as protected investors under the BIT could only do so in an investor-State arbitration after two types of domestic proceedings have been pursued: first, a recourse by the locally incorporated company against the government's conduct itself (as otherwise the effects of that act would also become binding and un-appealable for the shareholder under domestic law); and secondly, a recourse by the shareholder-investor before domestic courts for damages based on an alleged breach of its rights under the BIT. Recourse to treaty-based arbitration, in turn, would then only be open after the second type of proceedings had been pursued for at least 18 months, or until a decision on the merits in those proceedings has been issued. Such inefficiencies in the system of recourses under a BIT would not merely provide domestic institutions with an opportunity of self-correction; they would unnecessarily increase the length and costs of dispute settlement proceedings between foreign investors and host States. That this is what the contracting parties to the BIT intended to do by agreeing on a domestic-courts-first requirement in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT is hard to imagine and does not result in a good faith reading of Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT under the rules on treaty interpretation of the Vienna Convention.\n\n303.\n\nAgainst this background, it is not surprising that investment treaty tribunals have often adopted a broader notion of dispute to determining whether domestic-remedies-first requirements in investment treaties have been complied with in cases involving investorState dispute settlement provisions similar to Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Thus, the tribunal in *Teinver v. The Argentine Republic* ruled that\n\ninternational legal remedies may apply \"different law to different parties\" than local law remedies do, and this should not be a barrier to the fulfillment of any local court remedy requirements.246\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 December 2012), para. 133 (CL-137).\n\n304.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* concluded that the\n\nterm \"disputes\", as used in Article 10(2), is to be interpreted broadly as concerning the subject matter and facts at issue and not as limited to particular legal claims, including specifically BIT claims. The dispute before domestic courts under Article 10(2) does not need to have the same legal basis or cause of action as the dispute brought in the subsequent arbitration, provided that both disputes involve substantially similar facts and relate to investments as this term is defined by the BIT.247\n\n*Philip Morris Brands Sarl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 July 2013), para. 113 (CL-134).\n\n305.\n\nAgreeing with these considerations, in the Tribunal's view, the domestic recourses by ENJASA against the revocation of its operating license fulfill the domestic-remedies-first requirement contained in Article 8(3) of the BIT, even if the dispute pending before this Tribunal is between different parties, namely a foreign shareholder of ENJASA and the Republic of Argentina, and relates to the breach of the Argentina-Austria BIT, rather than to the breach of domestic law. No other recourse between Claimants and Respondent for breach of the BIT before a domestic jurisdiction was necessary to fulfill the requirement in Article 8(3) to have recourse to domestic remedies first because Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT, in the Tribunal's view, does not require that the domestic recourse be between the same parties and concerning the identical cause of action and requested remedy.\n\n*(ii) Relevant domestic recourse in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe next question the Tribunal needs to address is which of the various domestic remedies ENJASA made use of, if any, is the relevant one for determining whether Claimants can have recourse to international arbitration pursuant to Article 8(3) of the BIT. In this context, Article 8(3) of the BIT refers back to \"the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made\" mentioned in Article 8(2). Two amongst ENJASA's domestic recourses have been the main focus of the Parties' discussions: (i) ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 with ENREJA of 28 August 2013, which resulted in Resolution No. 315/13; and (ii) ENJASA's Action for Annulment against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 of 5 February 2014 before the First Instance Court of Salta.\n\n307.\n\nBoth of these recourses aimed at squashing ENREJA's decision to revoke ENJASA's operating license. In case of success, they would have put ENJASA and Claimants back into the *status quo ante* of operating in Salta's gaming and lottery sector on the basis of an exclusive license. Both of these recourses concerned, in the words of the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, \"substantially similar facts\"248 as the dispute pending before the Tribunal under the BIT and, for this reason, in principle fulfill the domestic-remedies-first requirement established in Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n*Philip Morris Brands Sarl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 July 2013), para. 113 (CL-134).\n\n308.\n\nYet, the Tribunal does not consider that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 to ENREJA of 28 August 2013 was sufficient to fulfill the need to submit the dispute to a domestic jurisidiction in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT. Notably, Article 8(2) of the BIT does not require recourse to a domestic court before the present Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction - submission to a \"competent administrative jurisdiction\" is sufficient. Yet, the notion of \"administrative jurisdiction\" does not refer to just any type of involvement of an administrative institution or agency in the resolution of an investment dispute. Instead, the use of the idea of \"jurisdiction\" in Article 8(2) of the BIT clarifies that the administrative agency in question has to make an independent analysis of the legality of the host State's conduct and decide in a binding manner on a recourse by the person aggrieved in a way that is comparable to a court. Even if the result is binding, without an independent analysis of the legality of government action, it is not meaningful to speak of the existence of an administrative \"jurisdiction\" comparable to that of a court.\n\n309.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is satisfied from the expert testimony given during the Hearing by Professors Garc\u00eda Pulles, Bianchi and Mata249 that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration was a proper remedy under domestic law in order to contest the legality of the revocation of the License, the decision on that Recourse was taken by the same agency that issued the measure in question, namely ENREJA. Although it may be possible that an administrative jurisdiction in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT is organized as an independent unit within the same executive agency whose acts are under review, the expert testimony on the law in place in the Province of Salta did not establish positively that ENREJA's decision on ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration involved such an independent analysis of the legality of ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13. On the contrary, there were doubts as to the independence of ENREJA's review of the legality of Resolution No. 240/13 in response to ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration.250 For this reason, the Tribunal considers that ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration does not meet the requirement that the dispute has been submitted to an \"administrative jurisdiction\" in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\nExhibit C-273, para. 50, Exhibit C-274, para. 28, *see also* Hearing Transcript of 25 March 2017, pp. 496-500, (Professor Mata), p. 564 (Professor Garc\u00eda Pulles).\n\nOn the contrary, there was doubt as to the independence of the review of ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration within ENREJA. Professor Garc\u00eda Pulles stated in response to a question by one of the arbitrators whether in the internal organization of ENREJA a decision on a Recourse for Reconsideration was taken by a different person than the original decision, the following: \"No. From the point of view of the body it is the same body. I cannot say if the same people were involved when the two decisions were taken. It could have been the same people because it is the same body.\" *See* Hearing Transcript of 24 March 2017, p. 409.\n\n310.\n\nWhile ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 therefore does not qualify as the submission of the dispute to a competent administrative jurisdiction, ENJASA has also initiated, on 5 February 2014, an Action for Annulment of Resolutions No. 240/13 and 315/13 with the First Instance Court of Salta. Unlike ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration, this action qualifies, in the Tribunal's view, as a recourse to domestic courts in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT. ENJASA's Action for Annulment, which involves the review of legality of the revocation of the License, involves, as termed by the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, \"substantially similar facts\" as the present dispute, and, in case of success, would have done away, in principle, with the need to have recourse to international arbitration before this Tribunal.\n\n311.\n\nLast, but not least, there is a question of timing, as Article 8(2) of the BIT stipulates that the domestic remedies in question may be initiated in case the dispute cannot be settled through amicable consultations within six months. However, ENJASA submitted its Action for Annulment already on 5 February 2014 and therefore less than six months after it had its first consultations with ENREJA and the Province of Salta on 27 August 2013.\n\n312.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the term of six months mentioned in Article 8(2) of the BIT cannot be read as a waiting period that has to be fully exhausted. Rather the term during which negotiations should be pursued as provided for in Article 8(2) of the BIT cannot be read in isolation. Instead, it has to be read and applied in connection with the requirement to make use of domestic remedies before recourse to international arbitration, as provided for in Article 8(3) of the BIT, and in light of any deadlines domestic law stipulates for the domestic recourses in question. In this context, foreign investors, or their local subsidiaries, as the case may be, can only be expected and required to engage in amicable consultations as long as this is possible in light of existing deadlines under domestic law to initiate the domestic recourses required under Article 8(3) of the BIT. Any other construction would create a contradiction between the six-months consultation period laid down in Article 8(2) of the BIT and the need to have recourse to domestic remedies in Article 8(3) of the BIT, which need to respect requirements under domestic law in respect of form and timing in order to be validly interposed.251\n\nFor this reason, the majority of the Tribunal also considers any parallel to the reasoning in *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (15 December 2010), paras. 140 *et seq.* (AL RA 204), which related to a \"waiting period\" under Article VI(3)(a) of the Ecuador-United States BIT, inapposite. *But see* Dissent, paras. 29, 188.\n\n313.\n\nGiven that the Recourse for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13 had to be submitted to ENREJA by 28 August 2013, that is, 15 days after Resolution No. 240/13 was issued, and that subsequent to the issuance of Resolution No. 315/13 an Action for Annulment had to be brought within a further delay provided for under domestic law in order to challenge the revocation in the courts of Salta as required under Article 8(3) of the BIT, the Tribunal finds that no breach of the period for amicable consultations laid down in Article 8(2) of the BIT has occurred. Likewise, the sequence of the interposition of the various pre-arbitral requirements, that is, amicable consultation and recourse to domestic remedies, has been respected and not side-stepped by Claimants.\n\n*(iii) Compliance with the 18-months requirement in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nHaving determined that ENJASA's Action for Annulment before the First Instance Court of Salta was the relevant domestic remedy in the sense of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and considering that no decision on the merits of that Action has been rendered, the Tribunal must now address whether Claimants have complied with the requirement that their domestic recourse is pending domestically for 18 months pursuant to Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n315.\n\nAlthough by now 18 months have passed since 5 February 2014, when ENJASA submitted its Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 to the First Instance Court of Salta, Claimants initiated the present arbitration on 4 December 2014, i.e., less than 18 months after ENJASA had recourse to the court in Salta. The question therefore arises whether non-compliance with this 18-months requirement at the time of initiating the ICSID arbitration make Claimants' claims inadmissible under Article 8(3) of the BIT or whether it is sufficient that the 18 months have passed when the Tribunal decides on its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claim. The wording of Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT certainly does not mandate that the 18 months necessarily must have passed prior to Claimants' recourse to international arbitration, given that the Tribunal has decided that this pre-arbitral requirement is not a condition precedent to Respondent's consent. Article 8(3) of the BIT merely states that the dispute may be \"submitted to an arbitral tribunal\" under the three circumstances mentioned. \"Submission\", however, does not necessarily have to refer to the time of the actual seisin of the arbitral tribunal. It can equally be understood to refer to the time when the tribunal can actually exercise jurisdiction over the claim and proceed to the merits.\n\n316.\n\nThat this is the understanding of Article 8(3) of the BIT is confirmed by the fact that, under Article 8(3)(c) of the BIT, the dispute can be submitted to an international arbitration \"whenever the parties to the dispute have so agreed.\" Given the consent-based nature of jurisdiction of an investment-treaty tribunal, it would be sufficient for the tribunal to base its jurisdiction on the parties' agreement under Article 8(3)(c) of the BIT, independently of whether that agreement was reached before or after the seisin of the arbitral tribunal. Considering that questions of timing of the seisin are irrelevant for purposes of Article 8(3)(c) of the BIT, they must also, *mutatis mutandi*, be irrelevant for purposes of timing of the seisin under Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n317.\n\nA strict reading of comparable domestic litigation requirements under different Argentine BITs may indeed be suggested based on the decisions by the tribunals in *Wintershall v. Argentina*, *Daimler v. Argentina*, *Impregilo v. Argentina*, and *ICS v. Argentina*.252 However, in none of these cases was the respective tribunal faced with the situation that the respective claimant, or its local subsidiary, had actually initiated domestic proceedings, but started investor-State arbitration under the BIT before 18 months had passed in the domestic forum. Instead, in all of these cases, no domestic recourse at all had ever been initiated.253 Consequently, the issue about subsequent compliance with the domestic-remedies-first requirement was never considered in these cases. This notwithstanding, the tribunal in *Daimler Financial Services v. Argentina* suggested that the subsequent fulfilment of the 18-months requirement may have been sufficient when it answered the question in the negative \"whether the dispute has, at least in the interim, been litigated for 18 months before the Argentine domestic courts.\"254\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 183 (AL RA 96); *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award (21 June 2011), para. 94 (AL RA 46); *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008), para. 160(2) (AL RA 38); *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited v. The Argentine Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award in Jurisdiction (10 February 2012), para. 262 (AL RA 40).\n\n*Wintershall AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008), paras. 7-11 (AL RA 38); *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award (21 June 2011), para. 90 (AL RA 46); *ICS Inspection and Control Services v. Argentina*, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction (10 February 2012), para. 246 (AL RA 40); *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 191 (AL RA 96).\n\n*See* *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012), para. 190\n\n318.\n\nBe that as it may, in the Tribunal's view, requiring that 18 months must have passed before international arbitration is initiated is overly formalistic and not in line with the object and purpose of a domestic-remedies-first requirement, such as that contained in Article 8(3) of the BIT. After all, the purpose of such a requirement is to give the courts of the host State an opportunity, for a certain time, to remedy the alleged grievance before an international tribunal assumes jurisdiction, thus coordinating dispute settlement between national and international jurisdictions. Nothing different is suggested by the wording of Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n319.\n\nConsequently, if it is clear, at the time the international arbitral tribunal decides on its jurisdiction and on the admissibility of the claims, that the period the BIT required domestic recourses to be pursued has passed without the dispute having been settled, the purpose of the domestic-remedies-first requirement cannot be achieved anymore. To still insist on strict compliance with it by dismissing the dispute in the present proceedings as inadmissible, would be an exaggerated procedural formalism that is incompatible with the fair administration of international justice in investment treaty disputes and the principle of good faith, which govern the settlement of international disputes. After all, strict insistence on the 18-months term before the present arbitration had been initiated by this Tribunal, would not prevent Claimants to reinitiate an identical international arbitration without facing obstacles to jurisdiction and admissibility in light of their non-compliance with the 18-months requirement in Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n320.\n\nMoreover, the view that it is sufficient that domestic-remedies-first requirements, such as that contained in Article 8(3) of the BIT, be fulfilled subsequently to the initiation of ICSID arbitration, but before a decision on jurisdiction is taken, has even been accepted by a number of investment treaty tribunals that qualified the domestic-remedies-first requirement in the applicable treaty as going to the jurisdiction of the tribunal. If, however, domestic-courts-first requirements that are found to be of a jurisdictional nature can be complied with subsequently to the initiation of arbitration, but before a decision on jurisdiction is taken, this must hold true *a fortiori* for domestic-courts-first requirements such as those in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n321.\n\nThus, the tribunal in *TSA Spectrum v. Argentina* concluded in a case where the claimant had initiated ICSID arbitration before 18 months in domestic courts had passed without a final decision, as required under the Argentina-Netherlands BIT, that\n\n[...] despite the fact that ICSID proceedings were initiated prematurely, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it would be highly formalistic now to reject the case on the ground of failure to observe the formalities in Article 10(3) of the BIT, since a rejection on such ground would in no way prevent TSA from immediately instituting new ICSID proceedings on the same matter.255\n\n*TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award (19 December 2008), para. 112 (AL RA 158).\n\n322.\n\nSimilarly, in *Teinver v. Argentina*, the tribunal decided in respect of the claimant's noncompliance with a comparable domestic-courts-first clause in Article X(3) of the Argentina-Spain BIT:\n\n[...] while Claimants concede that the 18-month local court period had not lapsed at the time they filed their Request for Arbitration, they are correct to note that 18 months have subsequently passed, and the local suit remains pending. As such, the core objective of this requirement, to give local courts the opportunity to consider the disputed measures, has been met. To require Claimants to start over and re-file this arbitration now that their 18 months have been met would be a waste of time and resources.256\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 December 2012), para. 135 (CL-137) (footnote omitted).\n\n323.\n\nLikewise, the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* addressed a similar issue under Article X(2) of the Switzerland-Uruguay BIT. The tribunal decided, basing itself on an analysis of cases decided by the Permanent Court of International Justice and the ICJ, that it was satisfied to proceed with the case, even though certain procedural preconditions to jurisdiction had been met only after the initiation of the arbitration:257\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ICJ's decisions show that the rule that events subsequent to the institution of legal proceedings are to be disregarded for jurisdictional purposes has not prevented that Court from accepting jurisdiction where requirements for jurisdiction that were not met at the time of instituting the proceedings were met subsequently (at least where they occurred before the date on which a decision on jurisdiction is to be taken).258\n\n*Philip Morris Brands Sarl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 July 2013), paras. 144-149 (CL-134).\n\n*Id.*, at para. 144 (footnote omitted).\n\n324.\n\nThe tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* therefore concluded that\n\nit would be perfectly possible for the Claimants to commence these same proceedings on the day after a decision by this Tribunal is handed down, a situation where dismissal of the Claimants' claims would merely multiply costs and procedures to no use.259\n\n*Id.*, at para. 147.\n\n325.\n\nThis jurisprudence also conforms to the approach both the Permanent Court of International Justice and the ICJ have taken in a number of cases in respect of conditions to the Court's jurisdiction that were only fulfilled after the court had been seized. Thus, in the *Mavrommatis* case, the Permanent Court held:\n\nEven if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant's suit. The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. Even, therefore, if the application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications.260\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. United Kingdom)*, Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment No. 2 (30 August 1924) PCIJ Series A, No. 2, p. 34 (AL RA 162).\n\n326.\n\nSimilarly, in *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia)*, the ICJ found repeatedly that the fact that Serbia had only become a party to the Court's Statute after the proceedings had been instituted did not affect the Court's jurisdiction for reasons related to judicial economy and the sound administration of justice:\n\nWhat matters is that, at the latest by the date when the Court decides on its jurisdiction, the applicant must be entitled, if it so wishes, to bring fresh proceedings in which the initially unmet condition would be fulfilled. In such a situation, it is not in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel the applicant to begin the proceedings anew \u2014 or to initiate fresh proceedings \u2014 and it is preferable, except in special circumstances, to conclude that the condition has, from that point on, been fulfilled.261\n\n*Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (18 November 2008) ICJ Reports 2008, pp. 412, 441, para. 85. *Similarly id.*, at pp. 442-443, paras. 87 and 89. *See also* *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (11 July 1996), ICJ Reports 1996, pp. 595, 613-614, para. 26.\n\n327.\n\nOnly the case of Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)262 departs from this consistent line of jurisprudence.263 In that case, the Court reasoned that the reference in Article 22 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) to negotiations between the parties264 established a condition precedent to the Court's jurisdiction.265 Given that qualification, there was no need for the Court to consider whether the negotiation requirement could have been fulfilled in parallel or subsequently to seizing the Court. At the same time, there is also no indication that the claimant in that case had made an attempt to fulfil the negotiation requirement subsequently to initiating the case in question.266 This distinguishes the Racial Discrimination case from both the Court's earlier jurisprudence and the situation in the present case, where domestic proceedings have now been pending for more than 18 months without a decision on the merits and where the Tribunal has found that the pre-arbitral requirements contained in Article 8 of the BIT did not constitute conditions precedent to the Respondent's consent.\n\n*Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (1 April 2011), ICJ Reports 2011, p. 70.\n\nPointing out that departure and criticizing the Court for it: *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (1 April 2011), Joint Dissenting Opinion of President Owada, Judges Simma, Abraham and Donoghue and Judge *ad hoc* Gaja, ICJ Reports 2011, pp. 142, 153-154, para. 35.\n\nThat Article provides:  \n Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not settled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.\n\n*Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment (1 April 2011), ICJ Reports 2011, pp. 70, 126, para. 136.\n\nSimilarly, in the *Armed Activities* case, there was neither an indication nor argument that the conditions under Article 29 of the Convention on Discrimination against Women, including the attempt to initiate international arbitration, had been met subsequent to the seisin of the Court. *See* *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment (3 February 2006), ICJ Reports 2006, pp. 6, 39-41, paras. 88-93 (AL RA 39).\n\n328.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that ENJASA's Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 complied with the need to have recourse to domestic remedies under Article 8(3) of the BIT. This recourse has also been submitted after amicable consultations had been initiated with the meeting of Mr. Tucek with representatives of the Province of Salta of 27 August 2013 and pursued in subsequent meetings. Since this recourse has now been pending for more than 18 months without a decision on the merits, the Tribunal finds that it can exercise its jurisdiction in the present case and proceed to the merits.\n\n***D. Effect of Article 8(4) of the BIT***\n------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must address Respondent's argument that the fact that ENJASA has not withdrawn its Action for Annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13, which is pending before the First Instance Court of Salta, constitutes a bar to the Tribunal exercising jurisdiction over the case under Article 8(4), second sentence of the BIT. This provision stipulates, as per the English translation agreed between the Parties, that \"[f]rom the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, each party to the dispute shall take all the required measures to withdraw the pending judicial proceedings.\"\n\n330.\n\nAs becomes clear from its wording, Article 8(4) of the BIT establishes a duty for both parties to take all required measures that the present \"dispute\" is not pending before the Tribunal and in a domestic jurisdiction. The \"dispute\" in this context, as explained before,267 is a broad one and encompasses both the treaty claim pending before the Tribunal as well as ENJASA's recourses in domestic court, which already encompassed the claim that ENREJA's action breached the Argentina-Austria BIT. Under Article 8(4) of the BIT, both of these proceedings cannot go forward in parallel, even if the parties to the respective proceedings are different and the causes of action and requested remedies differ.\n\n*See supra* para. 304.\n\n331.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal's view, Article 8(4) of the BIT cannot be read as requiring Claimants to withdraw domestic proceedings already before initiating ICSID arbitration or prior to receiving a decision on jurisdiction. This is clear from the wording and context of Article 8(4) of the BIT. As per its wording, Article 8(4) of the BIT imposes an obligation on both parties to take all required measures to withdraw the pending judicial proceedings; but it does not formulate this obligation as affecting Respondent's consent to international arbitration nor as some other condition on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n332.\n\nAlthough having to defend against two related claims, one in a domestic court, one in international arbitration, is a burden for the host State, requiring Claimants to withdraw all pending domestic proceedings prior to a decision on jurisdiction of this Tribunal would impose an even greater burden on Claimants and risks bringing about a denial of justice. After all, if Claimants were required to withdraw domestic proceedings prior to having received a decision by the arbitral tribunal on jurisdiction, they would risk being left without any remedy, both at the domestic and the international level, if the arbitral tribunal decided to decline jurisdiction. Given that the domestic proceedings, once withdrawn, could not be revived in order to address Claimants' claims, this could result in a situation where justice would in effect be denied. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the obligation in Article 8(4) of the BIT to withdraw any pending domestic proceeding only arises once the present decision comes into effect.\n\n333.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal takes note of Claimants' undertaking that once a positive decision on jurisdiction is rendered in the present arbitration, they will take all required measures to withdraw any proceedings relating to the dispute pending in Argentine courts. Yet, Article 8(4), second sentence of the BIT does not only impose an obligation on Claimants. It imposes obligations on both Parties. The Tribunal accordingly finds that both Parties have to take all required measures to withdraw the pending domestic proceedings in order to comply with their obligation under Article 8(4), second sentence of the BIT.\n\n334.\n\nArticle 26, first sentence of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[c]onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy,\" does not suggest a different conclusion or a different construction of Article 8(4) of the BIT. While Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides for the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration to resolve the dispute in question, the provision only has an effect on the proceedings pending in parallel to the ICSID arbitration; Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not stipulate that parallel pendency in another forum has an effect on the jurisdiction or admissibility of the ICSID arbitration. Instead, the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, and by prolongation the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, remain unaffected by the existence of parallel proceedings in another forum.268 Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does therefore not suggest a different construction of Article 8(4) of the BIT from the one adopted by the Tribunal above. On the contrary, the exclusivity rule of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention supports the Tribunal's conclusion that the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration should be achieved by withdrawing the proceedings pending in parallel before Argentine courts as stipulated in Article 8(4) of the BIT.\n\n*See* Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclar, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press 2009), Article 26, para. 2 (explaining that \"once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in another forum, national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID. This principle operates from the moment of valid consent. This exclusive remedy rule of Art. 26 is subject to modification by the parties. The phrase \u2018unless otherwise stated' in the first sentence gives the parties the option to deviate from it by agreement.\").\n\n335.\n\nArticle 8(4), second sentence of the BIT imposes an obligations of conduct, not result. Consequently, both Parties have to take the measures that are in their power to bring about the withdrawal of the proceedings concerning the present dispute that are pending in Argentine courts. In the Tribunal's view, they have to do so within two months from the time the present Decision is issued, a timeframe the Tribunal considers reasonable in the present circumstances. In order to monitor the Parties' compliance with this obligation, the Parties have to inform the Tribunal of the steps taken once the two-months timeframe expires.\n\n***E. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n336.\n\nAs a result of the above, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Respondent has validly consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the present arbitration under Article 8 of the BIT at the time the BIT entered into force. It is at this time that both Contracting States to the BIT, that is, the Republic of Austria and the Argentine Republic have declared their consent to ICSID arbitration. This consent thus has existed since the entry into force of the BIT. Claimants, in turn, have consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the present arbitration when they initiated the present claim against Respondent.\n\n337.\n\nThe pre-arbitral requirements equally laid down in Article 8 of the BIT, that is, the need to attempt to settle the dispute through amicable consultations and to have recourse to domestic remedies, do not constitute conditions precedent to Respondent's consent, which would need to be fulfilled at the time of initiating ICSID arbitration. They merely concern criteria for the validity of the seisin of the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that it suffices that these criteria are fulfilled at the time a decision on jurisdiction is taken. A contrary view would be overly formalistic and would have the effect that, while the present Tribunal would need to dismiss the present case, Claimants could immediately reinitiate the same dispute in another ICSID arbitration proceeding. Such a situation would go against the principle of fair administration of international justice.\n\n338.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal has found that Claimants have complied with the requirement to first engage in amicable consultations pursuant to Article 8(1) of the BIT and subsequently to submit the dispute to a domestic jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT. Meanwhile, domestic recourses have been pending for more than 18 months without a decision, thus permitting the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction and assess the pending claims on the merits pursuant to Article 8(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n339.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that the pendency of the domestic court proceedings concerning the review of the revocation of ENJASA's license does not affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This notwithstanding, once the present Decision has been issued, both Parties are under an obligation to take all required measures that domestic proceedings relating to the present dispute are withdrawn within two months and inform the Tribunal about the steps taken.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n340.\n\nAll Parties have requested the Tribunal to order costs and fees against the opposing Party. The Tribunal reserves its decision on this question for subsequent determination.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n341.\n\nOn the basis of the reasoning above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1) that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute insofar as Claimants' claims for breach of Articles 2(1) and 4(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT are concerned;\n\n2) that it has no jurisdiction over the present dispute insofar as claims for breach of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT are concerned;\n\n3) that both Parties will within two months as from the issuance of this Decision take all required measures to withdraw the domestic proceedings relating to the present dispute and inform the Tribunal of their actions;\n\n4) that a decision on costs is reserved for subsequent determination."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2021-11-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n----------------\n\n**A. The Subject-Matter and Nature of the Dispute, and the Tribunal's Competence and Function**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe first question of principle for which I feel compelled to dissent from the Award rendered by the majority is the determination of the subject-matter of the present dispute defined by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration filed before ICSID. The *petitum* and *causa petendi* of such Request are perfectly clear, and thus, so is the subject-matter of the dispute submitted to arbitration. That is what the Arbitral Tribunal understood, unanimously, when adopting the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n2.\n\nThis Decision by the Tribunal corrected the scope of Claimants' original *petitum*, limiting it to the obligations assumed by the Argentine Republic under Articles 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment) and 4 (expropriation) of the Argentina/Austria BIT, but maintained the original *causa petendi*. Consequently, such correction entailed no modification of the original subject-matter of the dispute defined in the Request for Arbitration, or the legal nature of the dispute inherent therein, which remained a \"treaty claim\" only, as evidenced by both Parties' written and oral arguments in this merits phase, as well as the final conclusions of their respective Post-Hearing Briefs (PHB).\n\n3.\n\nThere is no reason, therefore, for the present Award to deem \"this dispute\" as if it were a contract claim existing within the framework of Salta's domestic legal system between Argentine company ENJASA under Claimants' control and the Province of Salta concerning the revocation by the Provincial Regulatory Agency (ENREJA) of ENJASA's exclusive License (for the exploitation of games of chance under provincial jurisdiction) as a sanction on account of violations or breaches by the company of its obligations as Licensee as regards the prevention of money laundering in accordance with Article 5 of Law No. 7020 of the Province. This contract claim ceased to exist when ENJASA withdrew from the proceedings instituted before the competent court in contentious-administrative matters for such Province for the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13, in compliance with the order issued by this Arbitral Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction pursuant to the second sentence of Article 8 (4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n4.\n\nAs a result of such withdrawal, the decision whereby ENJASA's License was revoked has become final in Respondent's legal system. So, not only has the original contract claim ceased to exist, but the revocation itself has become a legal *event* under Respondent's domestic law. This Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to treat it as such when applying such law as \"proper law\" applicable to the resolution of this treaty claim, as prescribed by Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. However, the majority resurrects in this Award Salta's extinct contract claim, or certain aspects thereof, and rises as *appellate court* of the actions undertaken by ENREJA and the Provincial Executive Branch, as though such dispute was part of the subject-matter of this treaty claim and as if this Arbitral Tribunal had the power and jurisdiction to act as such. To me, there is no room in this ICSID arbitration either to reconsider the evidence on which the sanction imposed by ENREJA upon company ENJASA was based, or to decide *de novo* on that sanction, which, as stated *supra*, has become final under Respondent's domestic law, which this Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to observe and apply in the resolution of the present dispute as per the provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT so mandate.\n\n5.\n\nAs frequently highlighted in ICSID awards, the arbitral tribunals constituted by application of the ICSID Convention are not appellate courts for domestic decisions, and this Arbitral Tribunal is no exception. Hence, this Arbitral Tribunal must abide by Salta's decision on the extinct contract claim, despite taking into consideration, of course, the actions undertaken, and the final decisions adopted in the Province of Salta insofar as necessary to resolve the subject-matter of this treaty claim at the time of settling the present dispute by means of the \"proper law\" applicable thereto as determined by Argentina and Austria in their BIT. In such regard, I fully share the assertion made by the tribunal in *Lemire v. Ukraine* whereby \"\u2026 *arbitrators are not superior regulators; they do not substitute their judgment for that of national bodies applying national laws*\" (Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability of 14 January 2010, para. 283); that by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v. United States* whereby \"*It is not the role of this Tribunal, or any other international tribunal, to supplant its own judgment of underlying factual material and support for that of a qualified domestic agency*\" (Award of 8 June 2009, para. 779); that by the tribunal in *SD Myers v. Canada* whereby \"*(A) tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making*\" (Partial Award of 13 November 2000, para. 261); that by the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* whereby \"*It is not for an investment-state tribunal to second-guess the substantive correctness of the reasons which an administration were to put forward in its decisions, or to question the importance assigned by the administration to certain policy objectives over others*\" (Award of 4 April 2016, para. 583); and so on and so forth.\n\n6.\n\nThe decision adopted by the majority Award in the instant case has manifestly exceeded the duty and jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, as well as the very subject-matter of the present treaty claim between Claimants and the Argentine Republic. It is unacceptable to assume the functions of an *appellate court* that are not inherent in an ICSID arbitral tribunal, without a specific mandate under the Argentina-Austria BIT. It is also unacceptable to act without the slightest deference to the domestic actions undertaken by the competent authorities and to manifestly rule out or ignore key allegations, arguments and evidence submitted by Respondent, along with its reliance upon the customary rule of international law concerning the regular exercise in its territory by competent bodies of the regulatory and police powers of the Argentine Republic that are inherent in its State sovereignty.\n\n**B. The Applicable Law**\n-------------------------\n\n7.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that: \"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" Since Claimants and Respondent have agreed on no rules of law, it is the rule contained in the second sentence of Article 42 (1) that applies to this arbitration as far as the ICSID Convention is concerned. In turn, Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT establishes the following on the \"proper law\" applicable to the settlement of investment disputes:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute\u2014including its rules on conflict of laws\u2014the provisions of this Agreement, and the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.\"\n\n8.\n\nIt is thus perfectly clear that the Contracting States to the relevant BIT, i.e., Argentina and Austria, have agreed therein that the law applicable to \"*the settlement of investment disputes*\" under Article 8 of the BIT is composed of rules from the four sources expressly mentioned in paragraph (6) thereof. The express reference in such paragraph to \"the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute\" is in line with relevant provision of Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention and undoubtedly, entails *renvoi* to the domestic law of Respondent, i.e., the Argentine Republic. Claimants have denied it, but the majority Award has no alternative but to recognize it, even though it immediately tries to exclude its application by means of groundless considerations. It is not for arbitrators to rewrite or ignore the decision on \"applicable law\" adopted by the Contracting States to a BIT which has been invoked by Claimants in order to institute this arbitration, but to apply it as and when necessary, as in the case of the present dispute. Many BITs fail to mention \"the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute\" in their respective provisions on \"applicable law,\" but the Argentina-Austria expressly does so, and this intention shared by both States must be observed, and the provision in which it is enshrined, applied by this Arbitral Tribunal in good faith or otherwise the Tribunal risks to manifestly exceeds its powers.\n\n9.\n\nAccordingly, what has been stated in awards or decisions issued by investment arbitral tribunals on either the application of the domestic law of the host State of the investment or on the scope of application, in relation to BITs that make no express reference to the domestic law of the host State involved in the dispute as \"applicable law,\" is completely irrelevant in this arbitration. In the case at issue, except for the \"specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment,\" which do not exist, the other three legal systems listed in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT (the laws of the host State of the investment; the provisions of the BIT; and the principles of international law on the matter) include rules, provisions or legal principles that this Arbitral Tribunal must apply where relevant to the settlement of this treaty claim raised by Claimants in reliance upon such BIT. There is no contradiction between the fact that the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal is a treaty dispute and the fact that the \"domestic law of the Argentine Republic\" is involved in the settlement thereof, as the Tribunal has the authority and duty to apply it by virtue of two rules of international treaty law: Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention. These two rules of international treaty law are also the ones that authorize and compel this Arbitral Tribunal to apply the relevant principles and rules of international law which have not been expressly excluded by the BIT to the settlement of this dispute, as per the case-law of the ICJ in *ELSI.* Lastly, the type of claim filed does authorize neither an investor nor an arbitrator to alter the definition of \"applicable law\" stated in the BIT or multilateral treaty in question at whim. The notion of \"applicable law\" does not refer to the \"investor's claim,\" but to the broadest notion of \"dispute or controversy,\" which, apart from such claim *(petitum),* encompasses the cause of or reason for the claim *(causa petendi)* and the *parties* to the dispute. The term \"applicable law\" refers to all those components of the notion of \"dispute or controversy,\" not just to the type of claim or the investor's *petitum*.\n\n10.\n\nIt is thus striking that Claimants have proposed as an *a priori* allegation that Argentine law be excluded from the settlement of this dispute in spite of the provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT, and that they have attempted to limit rules or principles of applicable international law, or replace them with the practices of some international investment tribunals which are not always consistent with the principles and rules laid down by international law on the matter or the circumstances of this arbitration. This attempt to mutilate or alter the \"applicable law\" determined by Argentina and Austria in Article 8 (6) of the BIT is not a proposition acceptable to me. No foreign investor relying upon a given BIT in order to institute an international arbitration before ICSID against the host State of its investment can unilaterally rule out such provisions of the BIT as it may deem inconvenient to its claims, since BITs are international treaties concluded between States to which the investor is a third party who receives an offer that is conditional upon what the Contracting States provide in the BIT in question. Claimants have sought to do that with \"applicable law\" now as they did in the jurisdictional phase with the provisions conditioning the international arbitration offer made by the Contracting States to the Argentina-Austria BIT. But BITs are not an *a la carte* menu that allows investors to rely upon some of their provisions while ruling out or ignoring other provisions of the same BIT.\n\n11.\n\nTherefore, I have no choice other than to readily dismiss such allegation made by Claimants on \"applicable law\" whereby they purport to self-define such law thus impairing the provisions of Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. This allegation made by Claimants on \"applicable law\" is even more striking in view of the fact that it is materially contrary to their claims on direct and indirect \"expropriation,\" because, as highlighted by the tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador* presided over in 2006 by today's ICJ Judge Professor James Crawford*:* \"However, for there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return (in a situation involving legal rights or claims as distinct from the seizure of physical assets) the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador\" (Award, para. 184).\n\n12.\n\nSuch material contradiction is coupled by another one regarding the content and scope of the rights pertaining to the various categories of assets listed in Article 1 of the Argentina-Austria BIT, an issue on which both Claimants and the majority Award remain inexplicably silent. In the jurisdictional phase, Claimants invoked Article 1 (b) (shares and any other form of participation in companies) to assert their condition as Austrian investors protected by the said BIT. Accordingly, they may not be presumed to ignore the content and scope of such category of asset, which the final paragraph of Article 1 of the BIT defines as follows: \"The contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.\" That is to say, in this case, by the laws and regulations of the Argentine Republic and/or its Province of Salta. This provision supplements the express reference in Article 8 (6) of the BIT, explained *supra*, whereby the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with, *inter alia,* the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute, i.e., the domestic law of the Argentine Republic in this arbitration. Consequently, I agree with Respondent's view that Argentine law also determines the scope of Claimants' rights as investors \"under the BIT\" and reject the contrary opinion adopted by the majority Award. The citation of the judgment issued in *ELSI* by the majority Award in this context is inapposite.\n\n13.\n\nThe majority Award formally rejects Claimants' request to exclude the law of the Argentine Republic and avoids applying the relevant customary international law on the matter despite the importance of both systems to the resolution of the present dispute in accordance with the applicable law determined by Article 8 (6) of the BIT, such as the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent as a defense on the merits. It also fails to apply other relevant provisions of the BIT, such as the final paragraph of Article 1 mentioned *supra*, or misapplies others, such as Article 4 (2) on expropriation. The same happened at the jurisdictional phase. Therefore, the majority disregarded Claimants' failure to meet the conditions precedent to the international arbitration offer by Contracting States under Article 8 of the BIT, and now, at the merits phase, affords similar treatment to the provision of Article 8 (6), which determines the law to be applied by the Arbitral Tribunal to the settlement of the present dispute.\n\n14.\n\nThis Dissenting Opinion applies legal rules and principles relevant to the settlement of the present dispute from the three \"applicable law\" systems listed in Article 8 (6) of the BIT that exist in this arbitration. The relevant rules and principles stemming from those three systems are a perfect supplement to each other in the circumstances of the case. Nor is there any legal impediment to applying such rules or principles, as far as their relevance to the settlement of the present dispute is concerned, since, by virtue of Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, the rule stated in such paragraph on \"applicable law\" is clearly a \"provision of this Agreement.\"\n\n**C. The Burden of Proof**\n--------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe principle *actori incumbit probatio,* generally applied by international tribunals, also governs the imposition of the burden of proof in ICSID investment arbitrations, *where the international responsibility of the host State of the investment is not presumed.* It shall be established. In the instant case, it is thus for Claimants to prove their assertion that Respondent violated Articles 2(1), 4(1) and (2), and 4(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. This means, in the words of the tribunal in *Les Laboratoires v. Poland*, that:\n\n\"the burden then falls onto the Claimants to show that Poland's regulatory actions were inconsistent with the legitimate exercise of Poland's powers,\" and that \"(it) would be unreasonable to demand that Poland 'prove the negative' in the sense of demonstrating an absence of bad faith and discrimination, or the lack of disproportionateness in the measures taken\" (Award of 14 February 2012, paras. 583-584).\n\n16.\n\nHowever, this general principle of administration of evidence applied by international tribunals does not relieve Respondent of the burden of proving, where appropriate, the facts invoked in its own defense. In fact, a respondent can merely deny claimant's assertions, but it may also defend itself by making its own assertions against claimant, which can lead to the allegation of elements of fact. When this occurs, as in the case at issue, respondent has the burden of proving the facts alleged in its defense. So, in this arbitration, each Party has the burden of proving the facts alleged thereby. In contrast, neither Party has to prove what has been admitted by the other Party, or the facts which are known to the public at large.\n\n17.\n\nGenerally speaking, Claimants have had difficulties with the administration of evidence of their allegations. For instance, Claimants maintain that ENJASA neither violated nor breached the obligation to request ENREJA's authorization to hire third-party operators (first paragraph of Article 5 of Provincial Law No. 7020), although they have been unable to submit to the Arbitral Tribunal an original or a copy of such request for any of the 11 third-parties recognized (by ENREJA's Resolution No. 324 of 20 November 2013) as operators prior to 13 August 2013 (C-219), the date on which ENJASA's License was revoked under ENREJA's Resolution No. 240.\n\n18.\n\nAnother example: concerning the interpretation of the obligation stated in the second paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, ENJASA informed ENREJA, by means of a letter of 30 August 2005 signed by the company's attorney-in-fact, Mr. Petersen, that it agreed that the Anti-Money Laundering Law and Law No. 7020 actually provide that prizes of over ten thousand Argentine pesos shall be paid by check prior identification of the person to collect the prize. ENJASA has always met this requirement (Exhibit RA 193), while, in these arbitral proceedings, Claimants object to the interpretation of the provision then accepted by the company and confirmed by subsequent letters from Mr. Petersen in like capacity of March 2008 (Exhibit RA-173) and May 2010 (Exhibit RA-165).\n\n19.\n\nIt is also perplexing that Claimants argue that the revocation of ENJASA's License was a measure having effects tantamount to an expropriation absent any showing that the requirements of the international standard applicable on the matter, which has been formulated by the ICSID tribunal in *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v. Venezuela* (Guillaume, Kaufmann-Kohler and El-Kosheri) as follows, are met:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that, under international law, a measure which does not have all the features of a formal expropriation may be equivalent to an expropriation if it gives rise to *an effective deprivation of the investment as a whole*. *Such deprivation requires either a total loss of the investment's value or a total loss of control by the investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature*\" (Award of 9 October 2014, para. 286) (emphasis added).\n\n**D. Claimants' Claim and the Rule of Previous Exhaustion of the Local Remedies of the Respondent State**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAnother hindrance to be circumvented by Claimants in connection with the establishment of international responsibility of the Argentine Republic in the instant case is the rule of previous exhaustion of the local remedies of the respondent State, described by the Chamber of the ICJ in *ELSI* as an \"important principle of customary international law\" (*ICJ Reports 1989,* p. 42, para. 50). The Parties have not discussed this principle, but the issue is objectively raised before the Arbitral Tribunal which knows the law (*jura novit curia*), in view of the definition of \"applicable law\" under Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n21.\n\nIndeed, Article 44 (b) of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts contained in Part III entitled \"*The Implementation of the International Responsibility of a State*\" establishes that \"The responsibility of a State may not be invoked if: \u2026the claim is one to which the rule of exhaustion of local remedies applies and any available and effective local remedy has not been exhausted.\" Paragraph (3) of the commentary to such article specifies that:\n\n\"The paragraph is formulated in general terms in order to cover any case to which the exhaustion of local remedies rule applies, whether under treaty or general international law, and in spheres not necessarily limited to diplomatic protection.\"\n\n22.\n\nIn light of the terms of paragraph (b) of Article 44 and its commentary, as well as the fact that the Argentina-Austria BIT does not contain \"any words making clear an intention to dispense with (the) rule\" of previous exhaustion of local remedies (*ELSI, dixit.*), this Arbitral Tribunal may not presume that the provision included in such Article 44 is *prima facie* alien to this case. Nevertheless, both Claimants' allegations and some considerations and conclusions of the majority Award encompass cases which undoubtedly fall within the scope of application of the rule of previous exhaustion of local remedies under customary international law. The provisions of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention on such rule does not settle the issue arising in this context, because the reference made by such article of the ICSID Convention to the previous exhaustion of local remedies concerns the \"consent to arbitration\" of the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, not the claims on the merits filed by third-party investors in order to establish the international responsibility of an ICSID Contracting State. The issue arises in this phase of these ICSID proceedings, since Claimants have not exhausted, prior to this arbitration, Respondent's local judicial remedies, and without that exhaustion, Respondent cannot be found to have incurred, for example, a \"denial of justice\" or \"manifest arbitrariness\" or anything similar as alleged by Claimants and admitted by the majority Award.\n\n23.\n\nParagraph (1) of the ILC commentary to Article 44 explains the distinction to be made between certain admissibilities and others. According to such paragraph, the ILC Articles on international responsibility of States are not concerned with questions of the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, or in general with the conditions for the admissibility of cases brought before such courts or tribunals, but define the conditions for establishing the international responsibility of a State and for the invocation of that responsibility, thus concluding as follows on such distinction:\n\n\"Thus, it is not the function of the articles to deal with such questions as the requirement for exhausting other means of peaceful settlement before commencing proceedings, or such doctrines as litispendence or election as they may affect the jurisdiction of one international tribunal *vis-\u00e0-vis* another. By contrast, certain questions which would be classified as questions of admissibility when raised before an international court are of a more fundamental character. They are conditions for invoking the responsibility of a State in the first place. Two of such matters are dealt with in article 44; the requirements of nationality of claims and exhaustion of local remedies.\"\n\n24.\n\nIt is evident that, in this case, Claimants have exhausted Respondent's local administrative remedies before submitting their claim to ICSID, but not Respondent's local judicial remedies, as a consequence of which local remedies have not been exhausted. On the other hand, the exhaustion of local remedies is a *primary rule* of customary international law that is generally treated like something other than what is called the \"merits of the case,\" as it is sufficient to comply with such primary rule if the \"essence of the claim\" has been previously submitted to local remedies until their exhaustion before bringing it before the relevant international tribunal (*ELSI, ICJ Reports 1989,* p.46, para. 59 *(in fine)*). But this was not the case here either. It is thus confirmed that Claimants resorted to ICSID without having previously exhausted Respondent's local remedies, which exerts a negative impact thereon, because it prevents them from invoking the responsibility of Respondent, i.e., the secondary rules of international law on international responsibility of States, in all such cases where their claims on the merits are based on primary rules of international law subject to the primary rule of customary international law of previous exhaustion of local remedies. In those cases, the Responsibility of the State may not be invoked and, therefore, the claim will not be admissible (Article 44 of ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts).\n\n**E. The Duty to Make Reparation**\n----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nAny internationally wrongful act gives rise to international responsibility the main content of which is the obligation to make reparation for the injury caused by means of one of the forms of reparation admitted under international law, *inter alia*, in practice, compensation for the injury caused, unless there is a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in any given case. Without an internationally wrongful act, there is no international responsibility of a State under the relevant Articles codified by the International Law Commission (ILC). In the specific case of this arbitration, Claimants allege that the Argentine Republic has an obligation to compensate them for the injury caused to their investment in ENJASA, as a consequence of the revocation by the Province of Salta (Argentine Republic) of the License held by the company for the exploitation and management of games of chance subject to provincial jurisdiction, since, in their view, such measure had purportedly violated Articles 2 (1), 4(1), 4(2) and 4 (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. In their final conclusions, Claimants request on those grounds reparation by Respondent in the form of compensation for an amount of at least USD 51,919,998 (PHB, para. 584)\n\n26.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that, in the case at issue, there is no room for compensating Claimants for the amount mentioned *supra*, or any other, based on two decisive legal considerations. First, because the adverse effect alleged by Claimants does not stem from an internationally wrongful act by Respondent towards them, but from the regular exercise by the competent authority of the Argentine Republic of its regulatory and police powers as a sovereign State, which is why the adverse effect in question gives rise neither to international responsibility nor to an obligation to make reparation on the part of Respondent. And, secondly, because Claimants have failed to prove that Respondent violated the obligations stated in the articles of the Argentina-Austria BIT on which they rely in any of the three claims brought, and, absent evidence of violation - of, at least, one of those international treaty obligations - Respondent was unable to incur international responsibility giving rise to an obligation to make reparation for the adverse effect that Claimants allege to have suffered, neither in the form or compensation nor in any other form of reparation admitted by the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Consequently, in my opinion, adjudication of the present dispute does not raise any question on the assessment of injuries or adverse effects, as Respondent has incurred no international responsibility *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants that may give rise to an obligation to make reparation.\n\n27.\n\nThe majority, however, has erroneously concluded in the Award that Respondent has incurred international responsibility *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants and the latter must be compensated. This unfounded conclusion in the Award calls on certain legal questions usually raised by the \"obligation to make reparation\" before international arbitral tribunals. First, such tribunals need to determine whether the injury or adverse effect that the investor-claimant alleges to have suffered is compensable as provided by the \"proper law\" applicable to the relevant dispute. Secondly, if that is not the case, tribunals must then determine whether the injury or adverse effect alleged by the investor-claimant is a direct consequence of the commission by the host State of an internationally wrongful act giving rise to the international responsibility of the State *vis-\u00e0-vis* the investor-claimant in question. Lastly, if reparation for an injury or adverse effect is due because the host State has incurred international responsibility *vis-\u00e0-vis* the investor-claimant, the arbitral tribunal is to determine the most suitable form of reparation in light of the nature of the injury or adverse effect found and, in the event of \"compensation,\" assess the *quantum* thereof.\n\n28.\n\nAny and all stages of the decision process mentioned *supra* are governed by international law; none of them is a question that the international system has left to arbitrators' utmost discretion. The determination of the existence of an obligation to make reparation, its forms, and the assessment of the *quantum* of a potential compensation entail an exercise regulated by international law, as well as the fundamental previous determination of the existence of international responsibility on the part of the host State for having committed an internationally wrongful act. The rules codified in the ILC Articles referred to *supra* leave no room for doubt. In other words, there is no room to invoke the case-law of *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* on the obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act if the rules of international law governing the different aspects of such obligation are subsequently ignored or excluded, starting with the very existence of the internationally wrongful act giving rise to the international responsibility alleged, as it occurs in the instant case within the framework of each of Claimants' three claims, as such existence requires both the subjective element (attribution) and the objective element (violation of an international obligation) of the internationally wrongful act alleged to concur.\n\n29.\n\nIn paragraphs 480 and 481 of their PHB, Claimants seem to argue that the *quantum* of the compensation claimed would be the same or very similar whether Respondent had violated Article 4 (expropriation) or Article 2 (1) (fair and equitable treatment) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, or both. I do not agree that, under international law, the identity and nature of the internationally wrongful act giving rise to the international responsibility in question are not important to the determination of the amount of compensation as a form of reparation. In any case, as confirmed by the relevant commentaries of the ILC in its Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the scope of the \"principle of full reparation\" is strictly limited to the \"reparation of the injury actually caused\" by the specific wrongful act in question, and any claim in excess of the value of such injury in relation to the capital invested by the relevant investor, or, where applicable, a potential loss of profits is dismissed as abusive. On the other hand, with regard to loss of profits, it may also be the case that, as it occurs in the case at issue, international law prevents claiming a given loss of profits due to the fact that it arises from a risk that, like \"business risk,\" is attributed to the investor-entrepreneur under international investment law.\n\n30.\n\nParagraph 5 of the commentary of the ILC to Article 34 (Forms of reparation) of its Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts specifies that \"[c]ompensation is limited to damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act and excludes damage which is indirect or remote\". Legal scholars fully supports this commentary, as shown by the fact that Article 13 of the Resolution of the International Law Institute (ILI) on \"Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-state Treaties\" provides that: \"Compensation due to an investor for violation of the FET standard shall be assessed without regard for compensation that could be allocated in case of an expropriation, in accordance with the damage suffered by the investor\" (*Annuaire de l'IDI*, Tokyo Session, vol. 75, 2013, p. 431).\n\n31.\n\nAnother rule of international law governing the obligation to make reparation concerns the \"contribution to the injury\" of the victim of the wrongful act, a topic on which Claimants and the majority Award remain in such utter as inexcusable silence, although the relevant rule is codified in Article 39 of Chapter II (Reparation for injury) of Part two (Content of the international responsibility of a State) of such ILC Articles. It is worth recalling that such rule establishes that: \"In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State *or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought*.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n32.\n\nAs pointed out by the decision on annulment issued by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD Equity v. Chile*, \"[t]here is no reason not to apply the same principle of contribution to claims for breach of treaty brought by individuals\" (paragraph 99 of the Decision). In the instant case, Respondent has submitted documentary evidence that Claimants were invited to participate in the \"transition plan\" for the granting of new licenses, applied after the recourse for reconsideration of the sanction revoking ENJASA's License was dismissed (ENREJA's Resolution No. 315), an invitation which stood for some time (ENREJA's Resolution No. 324 of 20 November 2013 (C-219). Nevertheless, Claimants declined the invitation to participate in such plan, which undoubtedly contributed to the injury that they now allege to have suffered. Anyway, it is evident that, had Claimants agreed to participate in the \"transition plan,\" they would have obtained at least one of the new licenses, which would have reduced the amount of the loss of profits they now allege to have suffered as a consequence of the revocation of ENJASA's License and the fact that, when the violations or breaches by the company that gave rise to such revocation occurred, it was Claimants themselves who controlled, managed, ran and administered ENJASA as a businessperson.\n\n33.\n\nClaimants have referred to or invoked in connection with their \"indirect expropriation\" claim the requirement that compensation be \"prompt, adequate and effective\" (formula proposed by Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United States, in the 1920's and rejected by Mexico.) But the Argentina-Austria BIT concluded in 1992 - which is the treaty governing this arbitration - does not use such formula at all, but the following: \"Compensation shall be paid without *undue delay*\" and \"[a]ssessment and payment of compensation *shall be adequately provided for* no later than at the time of expropriation\" (Article 4 (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.) (Emphasis added.) These formulations of the applicable BIT are more consistent with contemporaneous sensitivities and the language used in relevant documents and resolutions of the United Nations. In any case, they are the formulas to be taken into consideration by this Arbitral Tribunal if compensation was due, as they pertain to the applicable BIT. The formula proposed by Cordell Hull is not included in any of the 59 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. This means that it is not a secondary rule of responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, but a primary treaty rule, which may be incorporated into BITs or other treaties when agreed by the Contracting States thereof, which is not the case here with the BIT applicable in this arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nIt is clear today that the temporary absence of compensation does not render an expropriation unlawful, as it makes no sense to advance the payment of compensation while the parties discuss whether there has been an expropriation or not (or whether the issue is *sub judice*.) The most recent awards so confirm. For instance, the award rendered by the tribunal in *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v. Venezuela* states: (i) that \"the mere fact than an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful;\" and (ii) that \"in the absence of payment of compensation, a tribunal must consider the facts of the case\" (paragraph 301 of the Award). There are other arbitral decisions to such effect, for example, that of *Tidewater v. Venezuela.* In his *Principles of Public International Law*, Professor Brownlie already noted that compensation is not a condition precedent to the lawfulness of an expropriation, nor is the absence of compensation a condition precedent to the unlawfulness thereof (7 nd ed., 1973, p 523).\n\n35.\n\nDespite the foregoing considerations, the majority Award imposes upon Respondent, absent any legal ground, a compensation based on the loss of profits of ENJASA, which was a going concern when ENREJA sanctioned it by revoking the License held by the company. Hence, it is worth pointing out in such regard that, in accordance with Article 36 (2) of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts: \"The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits *insofar as it is established.*\" There are criteria which take into account in that establishment no value above the market value, although more complex valuation techniques given their consideration of probability factors, such as the \"discounted cash flow (DCF)\" method, have also been devised. This may lead to double recovery as a consequence of the interrelation between the value of the capital of the company as well as that of its return, which should be avoided, which is why other tribunals have preferred more stable asset-based methods*.*\n\n36.\n\nThe commentary of the ILC to such Article 36 of its Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts distinguishes three categories of \"loss of profits\", i.e., lost profits. The third category concerns, as in the case at issue, claims for loss of profits in the context of concessions and other contractually protected interests (such as those of ENJASA's License), in which what is compensated is \"the future income stream [...], up to the time when the legal recognition of entitlement ends\" (paragraph (33) of the ILC commentary to Article 36). Such commentary concludes the following thereon: \"(that) [i]f loss of profits are to be awarded, it is inappropriate to award interest under article 38 on the profit-earning capital over the same period of time, simply because the capital sum cannot be simultaneously earning interest and generating profits. The essential aim is to avoid double recovery while ensuring full reparation.\" (paragraph 33 of the ILC commentary to Article 36).\n\n37.\n\nLastly, in relation to the award of interest, Article 38 (1) of the ILC Articles provides, *inter alia,* interest shall be payable on \"any principal sum due,\" but only \"when necessary in order to ensure full reparation,\" because, as specified by the ILC commentary to that article:\n\n\"Interest is not an autonomous form of reparation, nor is it a necessary part of compensation in every case. For this reason the term 'principal sum' is used in article 38 rather than 'compensation'. Nevertheless, an award of interest may be required in some cases in order to provide full reparation for the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, and it is normally the subject of separate treatment in claims for reparation and in the awards of tribunals.\" (paragraph (1) of the commentary).\n\n38.\n\nThe majority Award has failed to explaine why it awards \"compound interest\" to be borne by Respondent when the general rule of international law establishes that such interest is inadmissible. As Arbitrator Huber stated in 1924 in the *British Claims in the Spanish Zone of Morocco* case*:* \"the arbitral case law ... is unanimous ... In disallowing compound interest\" (cited by the ILC in paragraph (8) of its commentary to Article 38 of its Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts). In 2001, the ILC so confirmed when also pointing out that: \"The general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest.\" This Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to apply in the matter of interest as well as in any such other issue as may arise in this arbitration the \"applicable law\" as defined in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, which, as stated *supra*, includes the international law on the matter, not the statements made by other investment arbitral tribunals, absent a justification or otherwise. The majority Award fails to do so in a further manifest excess of powers.\n\n39.\n\nNeither the PCIJ nor the ICJ the function of which was and is, respectively, to resolve disputes under international law have awarded \"compound interest.\" In *Wimbledon* (*PCIJ, Series A, No. 1,* 1923, p. 32) and *Diallo case* (*ICJ, Reports* 2012(II), p. 343, para. 56), both Courts awarded simple interest at 6 per cent as from the date of judgment. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has also consistently denied claims for compound interest. For instance, in *R.J. Reynolds Tobacco v. Iran* (1984), the tribunal failed to find \"any special reasons for departing from international precedents which normally do not allow the awarding of compound interest\" (cited by the ILC in paragraph (5) of its commentary to Article 38 mentioned *supra*.)\n\n40.\n\nIn ICSID arbitration practice, tribunals have sometimes been inclined to award \"simple interest\" (for example, in *CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentina,* 2005), while, in other cases, they have opted to award \"compound interest\" (for example, in *MTD Equity v. Chile,* 2004). However, the award of \"compound interest\" by ICSID tribunals, in most cases, has not been duly grounded, as is to be expected since they depart from general international law, which disproves their frequent rhetorical assertions that they apply international law. On the whole, the decisions awarding \"compound interest\" merely indicate that claimants have so requestedwhich is contrary to the provisions of Rule 47 (1) (i) of ICSID Arbitration Rules. This is not acceptable either, especially, because the payment of interest is governed by secondary rules of international law which constitute the right to make reparation for the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, which is manifestly evidenced by the fact that Article 38 of the ILC is included in Chapter II of Part two of such ILC Articles entitled \"*Content of the international responsibility of a State*.\"\n\n**PART I: ON THE CUSTOMARY RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW INVOKED BY RESPONDENT WHICH SETS FORTH THAT A STATE IS NOT BOUND TO COMPENSATE AN ALIEN FOR POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ARISING FROM THE EXERCISE BY ITS COMPETENT AGENCIES OF THE STATE'S REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Customary Nature of the Rule and Applicability thereof to the Instant Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn its final conclusions, Respondent asserts it did not violate Articles 2(1), 4(1) and (2) and 4 (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and that, therefore, there is no room for compensation given that the revocation of ENJASA's license constituted a regular exercise by ENREJA, the provincial Regulatory Agency of games of chance in Salta, of the State's regulatory and oversight or police powers international law recognizes and protects insofar as it is one of the corollaries of the sovereignty thereof. It is a long-standing rule of customary international law that in recent years has regained prominence given the excesses which have accompanied the invocation of indirect expropriation in international cases on foreign investments. The majority Award fails to respond to the invocation by Respondent of the aforementioned customary rule of international law despite having been presented as defense on the merits against Claimants' conclusions, incurring, thus, in that regard, *infra petita*.\n\n42.\n\nI have already had the chance to refer to this rule of international law in my Dissenting Declaration attached to the Decision on Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in which I cited the formulation of any such rule made by the *Saluka v. Czech Republic* Tribunal in its partial award of 17 March 2006 (para. 255), as well as some other instruments, compilations, and studies on the international responsibility of States for the treatment afforded to the person or property of aliens, which is where the customary rule invoked by Respondent is enshrined in the general international body of law, as Professor Brownlie already asserted:\n\n\"State measures, *prima facie* a lawful exercise of powers of governments, may affect foreign interests considerably without amounting to expropriation. Thus, foreign assets and their use may be subject to taxation, trade restrictions involving licenses and quotas, or measures of devaluation. While special facts may alter cases, in principle such measures are not unlawful and do not constitute expropriation.\" (*Principles of Public International Law,* 2nded., Clarendon-Oxford University Press, 19, 1973 p. 517-518\n\n43.\n\nInternational law has traditionally granted States broad discretion to define, organize and manage their economies. The admission in the international body of law of rules on expropriation and other standards of foreign investment protection has neither substituted nor diminished in any way whatsoever the sovereign States' regulatory and police powers that are an essential instrument to make the exercise and development of public functions that contemporaneous societies claim from the State feasible. As stated by the *Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States*:\n\n\"An uncompensated taking of an alien property or a deprivation of the use or enjoyment of property of an alien which results from the execution of tax laws; from a general change in the value of currency; from the action of competent authorities of the State in the maintenance of public order, health or morality; or from the valid exercise of belligerent rights or otherwise incidental to the normal operation of the laws of the State shall not be considered wrongful\" *(* 55 American Journal of International Law, 545, 1961, p. 554))\n\n44.\n\nThese non-compensable deprivations are accompanied in the Harvard draft by the following conditions: (i) it is not a clear and discriminatory violation of the law of the State concerned; (ii) it is not the result of a violation of any provision of Articles 6 to 8 (of the draft Convention); (iii) it is not an unreasonable departure from the principles recognized by the principal legal systems of the world; and (iv) it is not an abuse of the powers specified in the paragraph for the purpose of depriving an alien of his property.\n\n45.\n\nIn turn, the United States of America *Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law* sets forth that: \"A State is not responsible for the loss of property of an alien or for other economic disadvantages resulting from bona fide general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted as within the police power of State, if it is not discriminatory,\u2026and is not designed to cause the alien to abandon the property to the state or sell it at a distress price\" (American Law Institute, 1987, Vol. 2, section 712, comment)\n\n46.\n\nSuccessive reports by Garc\u00eda Amador, Special Rapporteur of the International Law Commission (ILC) on the subject of the international responsibility of the State for the treatment afforded to the person or property of aliens also reflect the existence, effectiveness and operativety of the customary rule of international law under consideration. In his sixth and last 1961 report where he makes a general review of his draft articles, Garc\u00eda Amador distinguishes \"expropriation\" from \"other measures\" and reasserts the need to distinguish measures which \"are intrinsically contrary to international law and hence, directly and immediately, capable of involving the responsibility of the State, and measures which, on the contrary, constitute the exercise of a right by the State, whose responsibility is therefore only involved if the measures are attended by other factors or circumstances which represent in themselves an act or omission contrary to international law*.\"* As regards the \"duty to make reparation\", Garc\u00eda Amador holds that \"If in taking the measure which gives rise to the claim the State exercised one of its many powers in respect of patrimonial rights, whatever their nature or the nationality of the owner, one cannot and should not speak of 'reparation', although this term is ordinarily used both in practice and in the writings of learned authors,\" *(Yearbook of the ILC,* 1961, vol. II, pp. 39-40, paras. 154 and 156).\n\n47.\n\nIn more recent times, the State's regulatory and police powers have known a considerable development since the State had to undertake new tasks in order to promote the nations' welfare and international cooperation in different areas and sectors in an increasingly globalized international society. These developments have required, for instance, the State's intervention in areas such as fostering of a fair international trade, nations' economic development, environmental degradation prevention, renewable energy development, citizens' health and security protection, fight against poverty, terrorism and drug trafficking, tax evasion prevention and a long etc., among which we find money laundering prevention as an essential element in the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism which, in the instant case, triggered the revocation of the License the company ENJASA had for the exclusive exploitation of games of chance of provincial jurisdiction in the Province of Salta of the Argentine Republic.\n\n48.\n\nThis new dimension of the States' regulatory and police activity has concurred with the development, following the 1965 ICSID Convention, of international rules and proceedings on foreign private investment, which might have misled some people with respect to the full and continuous effect of the customary rule of international law which sets forth *ex origen* that no State is bound to compensate an alien for the potential adverse effects arising from the regular or ordinary exercise by its agencies of their regulatory and police powers, except to the extent the State has consented thereto.\n\n49.\n\nTherefore, it makes no sense, to assert that the distinction between \"regulatory measures\" and \"indirect expropriation measures\" began around 2004 or other recent date since that would mean disregarding that while the international protection of the so called \"indirect expropriation\" has developed in recent decades, the acknowledgement and protection by customary international law of the States' regulatory and police powers comes from yesteryears as an element inherent in their sovereignty and it is so reflected by contemporaneous public international law both before and after the conclusion of the ICSID Convention.\n\n50.\n\nWhat happened during the last years of the XX century and the early XXI century was that the legitimate concern of some arbitral tribunals and some publicists to protect foreign property against potential expropriations or deprivations by the investment host State was accompanied more often than desirable either by a silence or a baffling marginalization as regards the State's regulatory and police powers or by the accompaniment of limitations of said powers through an unusual extension of the scope of application of the so called \"indirect expropriation.\" See, *e.g.*, awards in *SPP v. Egypt* (1992), *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* (2000), *Metaclad v. Mexico* (2000) and *Tecmed v. Mexico* (2003).\n\n51.\n\nThis last case is a good example of the trend to admit, because of events that are inevitable, any such State's powers albeit curtailing them. In fact, the award in *Tecmed* holds, on the one hand, that \"The principle that the State's exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any compensation whatsoever is undisputable\" (Award of 29 May 2003, para. 119) whereas, on the other, it extrapolates to international law on foreign investment elements of the European Court of Human Rights case law which are alien thereto and it considers as protected investments the investors' mere subjective expectations which, to a large extent, voids of content the asserted \"undisputable principle\" facing the continuously expanding \"indirect expropriation\" claims. The criticisms raised by some aspects of said award are thus understandable.\n\n52.\n\nDecisions within the overall trend of *Tecmed* still fail to overcome the congenital regulatory gap any such trend undergoes, and which ultimately leads the dispute resolution between foreign investors and host States to depend on a subjective construction by the tribunal, instead of its being based upon application of the objective rules of the \"applicable law\" defined by the relevant BIT.\n\n53.\n\nIn any event, today, like yesterday, customary international law continues to recognize that the potential adverse effects for a foreign investor resulting from the regular exercise of the host State's regulatory and police powers do not create as such said State's international responsibility due to the fact that those effects are not the consequence or the result of an international wrongful act by the host State. In this respect, it is particularly enlightening that in 1999 - within the framework of the negotiations on the Draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment backed by the OECD (MAI) the member States Ministers stated as follows:\n\n\"Ministers confirm that the MAI must be consistent with the sovereign responsibility of governments to conduct domestic policies. The MAI would establish mutually beneficial international rules which would not inhibit, the normal non-discriminatory exercise of regulatory powers by governments and such exercise of regulatory powers would not amount to expropriation\" (OECD, *Ministerial Statement of 28 April 1999).*\n\n54.\n\nIn turn, the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency excludes non-discriminatory measures of general application which the governments normally take for the purpose of regulating economic activity in their territories. Another conventional example is the 1996\u00a0Energy Charter, Article 18 of which provides that each State \"continuous to hold the rights to \u2026 regulate the environmental and safety aspects of the (energy resources) exploration and developments.\" Besides, in the XXI century, an increasing number of States have included in their free trade, commercial or investment agreements, specific provisions on the so called \"indirect expropriation\" for the purpose of preventing interpretations by arbitral tribunals that disregard, diminish or affect States' regulatory and police authorities or powers. Thus, for instance, the free trade agreement between Peru and Canada provides as follows: \"The sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred.\" A like trend is also observed in multilateral treaties on foreign investment such as the Dominican Republic-CAFTA Convention.\n\n55.\n\nThe concern to protect the customary rule of international law discussed is also reflected in recent Model BITs of countries such as USA, Canada, Norway, etc... For instance, in Annex B to the \"2004 US Model BIT\" the following final commentary is made with reference to Article 6 thereof concerning expropriations: \"Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory action by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safetyand the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations\". In turn, the \"2012 US Model BIT\" provides that: \"The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to regulatory, compliance, investigatory, and prosecutorial matters, and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other environmental matters determined to have higher priorities\".\n\n56.\n\nThese new developments and the detailed and accurate language thereof, undoubtedly, respond to the alarm created by some arbitral decisions on foreign investment matters that have disregarded or hastily addressed the customary rule of international law discussed, notwithstanding the fact that any such developments and explanations also constitute an important additional acknowledgment of the aging and full effect of the aforementioned customary rule. For the avoidance of misunderstandings, it is worth recalling at the same time that a customary rule of general international law is always applicable or likely to be applied, except when it has been expressly excluded by the parties to the relevant agreement or treaty. The ICJ case law is absolutely clear in this respect: \"(an) important principle of customary international law should (not) be held to have been tacitly dispense with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so\" (*ELSI, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1989,* p. 15, para. 50). In the instant case, not only has the Argentina-Austria BIT not expressly excluded the customary rule under consideration but it has also listed among the applicable law, in Article 8 (6), \"the applicable principles of international law\", as also does Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n57.\n\nIn conclusion, the customary rule of international law under consideration is applicable to this dispute given that: (i) it formulates a relevant and important principle of customary international law not expressly excluded by the Argentina-Austria BIT; (ii) the provisions set forth under Article 8 (6) of the BIT and under Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention; and (iii) it has been expressly invoked by Respondent, a Contracting State of the applicable BIT, against Claimants' claims in the arbitration at issue.\n\n**B. General Acknowledgement of the Rule Applicability to International Arbitrations on Foreign Investments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs frequently quoted, including citation by both Parties to this arbitration, the *Saluka v. Czech Republic* tribunal in its partial award of 17 March 2006 stated as follows: \"It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at general welfare\" (para. 255 of the Award). And, in addition, that in the opinion of the tribunal:\n\n\"the principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are \"commonly accepted as within the police power of States\" forms part of customary international law today. There is ample case law in support of this proposition. As the tribunal in Methanex Corp. v. USA said recently in its final award, '[i]t is a principle of customary international law that, where economic injury results from a bona fide regulation within the police powers of a State, compensation is not required'\" (para. 262 of the Award).\n\n59.\n\nExpress acknowledgment in international arbitration on foreign investments of this customary rule of international law applicability, although relatively belated was, nevertheless prior to *Saluka*. For instance, back in 2000 already it was applied by the tribunal of the *SD Myers v. Canada* case (Partial Award of 13 November 2000, para. 263), in 2001 by the *Genin v. Estonia* and *CME v. Czech Republic* tribunals, in 2002 by the *Feldman v. Mexico* tribunal and in 2005 by the *Methanex v. United States* tribunal, which stated in this respect as follows:\n\n\"... as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alia, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\" (para. 7, p. 4, Chapter D, Part IV) (the Spanish version is the one that appears in the *El Paso v. Argentina* award, para. 243).\n\n60.\n\nApplicability to the instant case of this aforementioned rule of customary international law is, thus, undisputable given that it is a rule in force, its relevance to this dispute resolution, the reference to \"the applicable principles of international law\" in the definition of the \"applicable law\" formulated in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and the invocation of the rule by Respondent. Besides, both Parties have so acknowledged in their briefs. For its part, Respondent has also drawn the Arbitral Tribunal's attention to several recent examples of the aforementioned customary rule application by international investment arbitral tribunals in relation to alleged violations by the host State of the protection standards formulated in the BITs with reference to both direct and indirect expropriations as well as fair and equitable treatment. This is shown by a simple *prima facie* reading of awards such as *Crystallex v. Venezuela* (2016) and *Koch Minerals S.\u00e1 r.l. v. Venezuela* (2017) as regards indirect expropriation, *Burlington v. Ecuador* (2012) and *Quiborax v*. *Bolivia* (2015) with regard to direct expropriation, and *Philip Morris v. Uruguay (2016)* regarding fair and equitable treatment.\n\n61.\n\nThe aforementioned rule of customary international law is, thus, likely to be invoked, as Respondent does, against each and every one of the three foreign investment protection standards which Claimants allege have been breached by Respondent in the instant case. The *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* tribunal's award also specifies that the rule has an overall reach in the sense that its scope of application is not limited to executive authorities or regulatory entities' administrative decisions, but it also encompasses decisions of legislative nature provided that the new rules are grounded on rational bases and are not discriminatory (para. 430 of the Award).\n\n**C. International Arbitral Tribunals' Deference toward Decisions Adopted in the Domestic Forum by the State's Competent Body**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nRespondent has underscored all the deference international arbitral tribunals reveal for decisions adopted in the domestic forum by the host State's regulatory agencies and other competent supervision and enforcement authorities in matters related to the treatment afforded to foreign investors and/or their investments. In fact, the references in international tribunals' awards and decisions to the deference or the high level of deference owed to domestic decisions are very frequent, *inter alia,* because of the experience and higher competence the competent national authorities are supposed to have.\n\n63.\n\nThis is, in the first place, due to the fact that derogations or limitations of States' national sovereignty are not presumed in public international law, but also, and particularly, because the aforementioned deference is an integral part of the rule of customary international law which provides for that the adverse effects the ordinary or regular exercise by the State's agencies of their regulatory or police powers potentially cause to the person or property of aliens do not constitute an international wrongful act and, therefore, they do not entail the duty to make reparation for the injury potentially caused, neither through compensation nor through any other form of repair admitted in the rules of international law codified in the International Law Commission Articles on \"Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\" mentioned hereinabove (United Nations General Assembly Resolution of 12 December 2001).\n\n64.\n\nInternational investment arbitral tribunals have also recognized the *normativity* of the deference element as part of the aforementioned rule. For instance, the *SD Myers v. Canada* (2000) tribunal's award states that \"The determination (of whether the investor has been treated unfairly or arbitrarily) must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.\" (para. 263 of the partial award) and, in turn, the *Koch Minerals S.\u00e1 r.l. v. Venezuela* (2017) tribunal states that \"\u2026the standard of review of a State's conduct to be undertaken by an international tribunal includes a significant measure of deference toward the State making the impugned measure. Such a tribunal cannot simply put itself in the position of the State and weigh the measure anew, particularly with hindsight\" (para.7.20 of the Award). The majority Award fails to respect the \"deference\" element the aforementioned rule entails.\n\n**D. The High Level of Demand of the Exceptions to the Rule**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nInternational arbitral tribunals frequently underscore that a domestic regulatory decision or a decision adopted in the exercise of the regulatory role by the host State's regulatory agency or other competent authority shall not be arbitrary or discriminatory or unreasonable, but that asserting or stating so does not suffice to dismiss it. Who so invokes it shall duly prove it and the customary international law standards in this regard are particularly demanding.\n\n66.\n\nFor instance, the *Glamis Gold v. United States* (2009) tribunal stated with reference to the interpretation of Article 1105 of the NAFTA that the measure \"must be sufficiently egregious and shocking\" so that the arbitral tribunal's only task would be to decide whether Claimant \"has adequately proven that the agency's review and conclusions exhibit a **gross** denial of justice, **manifest** arbitrariness, **blatant** unfairness, a **complete** lack of due process, **evident** discrimination, or **manifest** lack of reasons so as to rise to the level of the breach of the customary international standard embedded in Article 1105\" (Award of 8 June 2009, para. 779.)\n\n67.\n\nIn other words, it does not suffice for Claimants to allege or even prove that the measure adopted is, for instance, merely unfair or arbitrary. What they shall prove is that, in this context, the measure challenged has caused, or resulted in causing such an unfairness or arbitrariness that it may be defined, for example, as a \"gross denial of justice\" or a \"manifest arbitrariness\" so as to conclude there is *in casu* a breach of the relevant standard of international law that prevails over the customary rule invoked by Respondent or dismisses the application thereof. That is to say, Claimants shall prove that in the case at issue there is a concurrence of circumstances or elements of such a degree of unfairness or arbitrariness that international law rejects flatly. The following paragraphs of the *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru* tribunal's award of 19 June 2009 clearly present an example of what Claimants shall prove *mutatis mutandis* in this context:\n\n\"180. Even when the Tribunal acknowledges the State's regulatory power deserves a deferent treatment, it is essential to do so without losing sight of the reasons that so warrant.\n\n181. Scrutiny of a number of arbitral awards which have considered arguments on indirect expropriation arising from the Tax authorities' conduct, evinces that they have frequently been dismissed. However, these awards also reveal a considerable consensus regarding the fact that the imposition and application of tax measures *may acquire an expropriatory nature* if the measure is confiscatory, arbitrary, abusive or discriminatory.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n68.\n\nTherefore, in the present case it is for Claimants to prove that the revocation of ENJASA's License by ENREJA, Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020, was such gross a measure that it displaces the application of the customary rule invoked by Respondent concerning the regular exercise by the competent body of the Province of Salta of the sanctioning role thereof in response to serious and repeated violations or breaches by ENJASA of its Licensee's obligations. But this evidence has not been produced by Claimants among other things because their \"political conspiracy\" theory gradually vanished as the proceedings developed until it lost all aspects of credibility during the oral stage.\n\n69.\n\nThe ICJ case law in the *ELSI* case (1989) has defined the notion of \"arbitrariness\" in international law as follows: \"(arbitrariness is) not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law\" (*Reports ICJ, 1989,* para. 128). This definition confirms the high level or degree of demand that the \"arbitrariness\" shall have when being invoked to dismiss application of the aforementioned customary rule of international law. Nevertheless, when Claimants assert in their allegations that the revocation of ENJASA's License was \"arbitrary\", they do not use such term in the special sense the notion of \"arbitrariness\" has in international law as defined by the ICJ. This means that even if Claimants had proved, which they have not done either, an arbitrariness in the ordinary meaning of the term, that would not have sufficed to dismiss in the instant case application of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent which internationally protects the revocation by ENREJA of the License ENJASA had as it constitutes a particular representation of the exercise of the Argentine State's regulatory and police powers. Revocation of a license or concession by way of sanction for the breach by licensee or concessionaire, as the case may be, of the obligations thereof, is in no way whatsoever a measure against but for assertion of the *\"rule of law*, provided that, as it occurs in the case at issue, both due process and the right of defense be respected.\n\n70.\n\nIn addition, this majority Award incurs in *infra petita* in view of the little consideration given to the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent as affirmative defense facing Claimants' claims, despite the fact that the disputed measure - the revocation of the ENJASA license - is the result of a sanction imposed to the company by the competent authorities of the Argentine Province of Salta due to prior violations or breaches by the company of the applicable provincial framework law and of the provisions set forth in the license agreement itself. In other words, the sanction imposed to ENJASA is the result of the normal exercise by ENREJA of its obligations as the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority at the provincial jurisdiction and as such, it participates in the Argentine State's regulatory and police powers regarding games of chance management and exploitation by the company, which in Salta constitutes a public ownership activity exercised by the Provincial Authorities through the grant of licenses to private parties.\n\n71.\n\nAs a disputed measure, it shall be highlighted that the revocatory decision actually complies with each and every constitutive element of the standard that\u2014as Claimants themselves admit (PHB, para. 299)\u2014would determine in international law the lawfulness of a license revocation which, for instance, the *Quiborax v. Bolivia* tribunal's award defines in the following terms:\n\n\"The Tribunal must thus consider whether, in light of all the circumstances, the Revocation Decree was a legitimate cancellation of the Claimants' concessions in the exercise of Bolivia's sovereign power to sanction violations of Bolivian law and is therefore not a compensable taking or whether it is a veritable taking disguised as the exercise of the State's police powers. This will depend on whether (i) the Revocation Decree is based on actual violations of Bolivian law by the Claimants; (ii) whether those violations of Bolivian law are sanctioned with the termination of the concessions (whether by revocation, cancellation, annulment or otherwise), and (iii) whether the revocation was carried out in accordance with due process.\" (Award of 16 September 2015, para. 207)\n\n72.\n\nThe revocation of ENJASA's license by ENREJA actually complies with the three conditions of the text quoted hereinabove: (i) it is based upon repeated and proven prior violations by the company of the Province of Salta pertinent legislation (Law No. 7020) and of the license agreement itself; (ii) the violations at issue could eventually be sanctioned with the revocation of the license pursuant to the provisions set forth at Law No. 7020; and (iii) the revocation was conducted by ENREJA, the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020, in accordance with the effective legislation in the matter and respecting due process before, during and following the revocation. Ratification of the Regulatory Agency's decision by decree of the Province of Salta Executive Branch was carried outwithout prejudice of the administrative recourse for reconsideration before ENREJA exercised by Claimants and the contentious-administrative proceedings subsequently brought thereby before the competent provincial court requesting annulment of ENREJA Resolutions No. 240/13 and No. 315/13.\n\n73.\n\nThe public purpose of the measure warrants no debate whatsoever since the reasons that determined the sanction of revocation were violations or breaches by ENJASA of their legal and contractual obligations related to money laundry control and hiring of third party operators without ENREJA's authorization in a historical context of repeated violations or breaches during the 2005- 2013 period which had already given rise, prior to revocation, to more than twenty formal administrative proceedings against ENJASA concluded with many others sanctions imposed by ENREJA and on the occasion of which the company had already been warned time and again of the possibility of the License being revoked should violations or breaches thereof not cease.\n\n**E. Claimants' Admission of the Existence of a Customary Rule of International Law Concerning the State's Exercise of its Regulatory and Police Powers, and Challenge to the Application of the Rule in the Instant Case**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nClaimants acknowledge the existence in customary international law of the rule concerning the State's regulatory and police powers invoked by Respondent but challenge its application to the instant case (PHB, para. 280 *et seq*). In such regard, Claimants highlight what they describe as conditions for application of the rule, which, in their opinion, would be reflected in Article 4 (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. In support of this contention, Claimants take as a starting point of their position certain passages of the awards rendered in *El Paso v. Argentina* (Award of 31 October 2014, para. 240) and *Methanex v. United States* (Award of 3 August 2005, Part IV, Chapter D, p. 4, para. 7).\n\n75.\n\nClaimants rely upon the *El Paso* award so as to identify the constituent elements of the alleged conditions stated in Article 4 (2) of the BIT, which, in their view, would be useful to distinguish between the exercise of a legitimate general regulation and an expropriation. Nevertheless, Claimants' citation to such award in paragraph 281 of their PHB is misleading, as it mistakes the award's conclusion that, in principle, general regulations do not amount to indirect expropriation with the issue of potential exceptions to such principle when such general regulations are \"unreasonable\". As to the general principle, *El Paso*'s finding cannot be more precise:\n\n\"In sum, a general regulation is a lawful act rather than an expropriation if it is non-discriminatory, made for a public purpose and taken in conformity with due process. In other words, *in principle, general non-discriminatory regulatory measures, adopted in accordance with the rules of good faith and due process, do not entail a duty of compensation*\" (para. 240 of the Award) (emphasis in the original).\n\nAccordingly, administrative measures or decisions adopted by the competent authority in accordance with the reasonable general regulation in question do not entail a duty of compensation. Moreover, in the words of the *El Paso* tribunal, \"as a matter of principle, a general regulation \u2013 whose object is not the taking of property as in the case of direct expropriation \u2013 does not amount to an indirect expropriation\" (para. 236 of the Award).\n\n76.\n\nThat being said, the *El Paso* tribunal *-* which shares the sociological argument of the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal whereby \"*a blanket exception for regulatory measures*\" would readily create a gaping loophole in the international protection of investments against expropriations \u2013 goes on to admit that there are exceptions to the principle that general regulations do not amount to expropriation although they: \"do not, in any way, weaken the principle that certain takings or deprivations are non-compensable. They merely remind the legislator, or, indeed, the adjudicator, *(sic!)* that the so-called 'police power exception' is not absolute\" (para. 235 of the Award). Then, the *El Paso* tribunal wonders if, \"[b]y exception, *unreasonable* general regulations can amount to indirect expropriation,\" concluding in that regard that:\n\n\"If general regulations are unreasonable, i.e. arbitrary, discriminatory, disproportionate or otherwise unfair, they can, however, be considered as amounting to indirect expropriation if they result in a neutralization of the foreign investor's property rights\" (para. 241 of the Award).\n\n77.\n\nThese \"unreasonable general regulations\" of *El Paso* are described by the award as \"exceptions,\" and are, thus, subject to a restrictive interpretation and, in any case, as far as the present dispute is concerned, irrelevant, since Claimants have alleged neither that Law No. 7020 is an unreasonable general regulation, nor that it is intentionally or objectively discriminatory, or that the rights revoked were property rights. With regard to the term \"unreasonable\", it would seem to be inspired by the expression \"unreasonable interference\" under Article 10 (3) (a) of the Harvard Draft Convention on Responsibility of States mentioned *supra*. The *El Paso* award also points to the requirement that the measures adopted by the State be reasonable and proportionate, as stated by other tribunals, such as those in *LG&E v. Argentina* and *Tecmed v. Mexico.*\n\n78.\n\nIn relation to proportionality, a protean notion that is prone to abuse, it should be borne in mind that, within the particular framework of the current international law on protection of foreign investments, such notion neither is nor operates as a self-contained principle or standard (such as good faith or fair and equitable treatment), even though, in given contexts or situations, it may be applied as a supplement, either as a general principle of law or because the notion is incorporated in a rule of domestic law and/or a rule of international law that is part of the \"proper law\" applicable in order to settle the dispute by virtue of the applicable BIT. This occurs in this case where Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta applied to the revocation of ENJASA's license includes, *inter alia*, in weighing the sanction, the proportionality criterion, Claimants not having shown, on the other hand, the existence of defects in the application of such criterion by ENREJA in the context of the administrative proceedings pursued. It should also be noted that the universe of domestic administrative sanctions of State legal systems is not to be confused with the \"countermeasures\" institute of public international law applicable to the relations between States, where proportionality between the countermeasure and the injury suffered indeed plays a critical role (see Article 51 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts).\n\n79.\n\nIn view of the general considerations mentioned *supra*, I cannot agree that the scope and role of \"proportionality\" in the international law on protection of foreign investments, corresponds to the operation of \"proportionality\" in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Anyway, proportionality is a notion alien to the definition of the material scope of application of the customary rule of international law whereby any potential adverse effects on the foreign investor resulting from the ordinary exercise by States of their regulatory and police powers are not subject to reparation. Nor does it seem admissible that a subjective conception of the notion of the \"investor's expectations\" can somehow alter the application of such customary rule or curtail its material scope of application. On this matter, I am in full agreement with the following passage of the decision of annulment issued by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD Equity v. Chile*:\n\n\"... For example the TECMED Tribunal's apparent reliance on the foreign investor's expectations as the source of the host State's obligations (such as the obligation to compensate for expropriation) is questionable. The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly\" (paragraph 67 of the Decision on Annulment).\n\n80.\n\nDoctrine also confirms that an investment is certainly protected by the applicable BIT, but the BIT should not be used as a means to rewrite license agreements such as that of the case at issue or such other arrangements as may be concluded with the foreign investor (see, for example, James Crawford, *\"Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration\",* Kluwer Law International 2008, vol. 24. Issue 3, p. 374). In this case, for instance, it would be unacceptable to invoke Claimants' subjective \"legitimate expectations\" in this arbitration in order to rewrite ENJASA's exclusive license agreement within the regulatory framework of games of chance under Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta whereby the license revoked by ENREJA had been granted.\n\n81.\n\nAs to the citation to *Methanex v. United States* in paragraph 282 of Claimants' PHB, we should first wonder its *raison d'\u00eatre* in this context. I understand that the purpose would be to support Claimants' contention that the provisions of Article 4 (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT would be tantamount to a kind of specific promise by the Argentine Republic to putative Austrian investors, i.e., Claimants CAI and CASAG in this case, to refrain from exercising its regulatory and police powers in whole or in part when they invested in ENJASA on the occasion of the privatization of the company. In other words, the provisions of Article 4 (2) of the BIT would be tantamount to a particular commitment assumed by the Argentine Republic towards CAI and CASAG that their investment in ENJASA would be protected from all or some of the potential adverse effects of the exercise by ENREJA, in its capacity as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority, of its duties and functions.\n\n82.\n\nIf that were the *raison d'\u00eatre* of the citation to *Methanex*, we would be in the face of a downright fallacy, since Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT makes a clear distinction between \"the provisions of this Agreement,\" on the one hand, and \"the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment,\" on the other, and, concerning the latter, there is no evidence on record that any specific agreements were concluded with Claimants when ENJASA was privatized, exempting them from the potential adverse effects of ENREJA's exercise of its obligations as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta. None of the relevant documents on record submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal mentions or refers to any agreement, promise or exemption in favor of Claimants with respect to such potential effects. For example, the Transfer Agreement for ENJASA's Class A Shares, Article 2.1 of which defines and lists \"the specific rules applicable to, and the documents that form part of, the AGREEMENT,\" mentions no promise, exemption or favorable treatment to Claimants or BOLDT and/or IBERLUX. Nor is there evidence of any specific agreement on the matter after the date of the investment. The Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN) does not exempt ENJASA or its shareholders from the potential adverse effects of the sanctions that ENREJA might impose on the company in the event of violations or breaches of its legal and/or contractual obligations.\n\n83.\n\nAs regards the potential exceptions to the customary rule of international law whereby the deprivation suffered by the foreign investor does not warrant compensation when it arises from the State's regular exercise of regulatory and police powers, Claimants have alleged that the sanction entailing the revocation of ENJASA's license had been expropriatory in nature as it failed to meet the following four liberally self-defined conditions: \"public purpose and good faith,\" \"adequacy and proportionality,\" \"due process,\" and \"not arbitrary\". As to each of these categories, Claimants have cited purportedly relevant references from awards rendered by investment arbitral tribunals but have failed to submit evidence of a single aspect of any of those broad categories of conditions, i.e., evidence that the revocation sanction was not for a public purpose; was adopted in bad faith; was inadequate, disproportionate or arbitrary; or was in violation of due process.\n\n84.\n\nNor have Claimants shown that, due to a particular environment or event outside the revocation of ENREJA's license as such, that sanction has become expropriatory in nature in international law for being \"confiscatory, arbitrary, abusive or discriminatory\" in the words of the arbitral tribunal in *Mr. Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru* (para. 181 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Competence of 19 June 2009). Moreover, for a given sanction measure to be described as \"unreasonable\" in international law when it was adopted by the competent body of the State in question in exercise of its authority and functions, the \"unreasonable\" of the measure must be of such a superlative degree or level as to be able to prevail over the customary rule governing sovereign States' regulatory and police powers.\n\n85.\n\nIn fact, as highlighted by arbitral tribunals and doctrine, a conclusion that is consistent with international law on the matter requires a showing, by means of a thorough analysis of the specific factual and legal elements of the case, such superlative degree or level of the sanction measure in question, since the admitted exceptions to the application of the customary rule under study are not intended to weaken such rule, but, as rightly stated by the *El Paso* tribunal, to remind the legislator or adjudicator that its regulatory and police powers are not absolute. However, nor have Claimants shown that ENREJA's revocation of the license was, in the circumstances of the case, such an \"unreasonable\" measure as to allow an international arbitral tribunal to conclude that the application of the customary rule governing the State's regulatory and police powers has been ruled out in the case.\n\n86.\n\nThe foregoing considerations confirm that Claimants have failed to prove the *in casu* existence of an exception to the customary rule invoked by Respondent, and, therefore, I reject Claimants' argument that such customary rule of general international law would not apply in the context of this dispute. In contrast, I believe that it is not only fully applicable, but also critical to the adjudication of the dispute.\n\n**F. The Treatment Given to the Customary Rule of International Law Invoked by Respondent and Admitted by Claimants in the Majority Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe majority Award tries to ignore the impact of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent and admitted by Claimants on the resolution of this dispute, in spite of the recognition, scope, effect and currency of such rule in contemporaneous foreign investment international arbitration. The position of the majority is one of the main reasons why, in my view, the decision adopted in the Award is manifestly wrong for failing to duly apply the \"proper law\" in accordance with Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, which, in turn, explains this lengthy and detailed Dissenting Opinion.\n\n88.\n\nIt is unacceptable that the application of a rule of customary international law of general importance to States' everyday activities such as that invoked by Respondent, which is in full force and effect and critical to the resolution of this dispute under applicable law is ignored or ruled out as the majority does, which leads me to cite once again the case-law of the ICJ in *ELSI:* \"*(an) important principle of customary international law should (not) be held to have been tacitly dispensed with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so*\" (ICJ Reports, 1989, Judgment*,* p. 15, para. 50)*.*\n\n89.\n\nIn addition, failing to consider the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent, in the circumstances of this case, is particularly wrong. There are systemic and procedural reasons for the rule under analysis to be addressed as a preliminary question before pondering Claimants' claims, because, if it is confirmed that the disputed measure actually stems from the host State's regular exercise of its regulatory and police powers, such claims should not be considered for decisive purposes, although they may be for confirmation reasons or *ex abundante cautela*.\n\n90.\n\nThis opinion is independent from the nature of each of the three claims made by Claimants, namely, \"indirect expropriation,\" \"direct expropriation,\" and \"fair and equitable treatment.\" For instance, the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador* rightly begins its analysis of the \"direct expropriation\" standard with the following consideration:\n\n\"Burlington argues that the takeover of the Blocks constituted a direct expropriation of its investment. Ecuador does not object to reviewing the takeover under the standard applicable to direct expropriation and the Tribunal agrees. Accordingly, a State measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the investor of his investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) *the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine. The Tribunal will examine these elements in reverse order*\" (Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012, para. 506) (emphasis added).\n\nIn a case related to the analysis of a purported \"indirect expropriation,\" the tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia* (Award of 26 September 2015, para. 200) adopted a similar approach. This is also the exposition model followed in this Dissenting Opinion, given that, in the circumstances of this case, it is also consistent with procedural logic to examine, first of all, if the application of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent in its defense is warranted.\n\n91.\n\nIn search of exceptions to the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent, the majority Award rules out some of those alleged by Claimants, for example, violation of due process, but artificially admits others, such as arbitrariness and proportionality, for me, on insufficient grounds, in light of the facts proved or acknowledged by each of the Parties and the applicable law set forth in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. The majority Award pretends to ignore:\n\n(i) that none of the citations to awards invoked by Claimants concerning proportionality and due process dealt with sanction measures adopted by a State's competent provincial authority in response to previous violations or breaches by licensee of applicable laws and the license agreement. Claimants have mentioned awards concerning licenses or concessions, such as *Tecmed v. Mexico,* but not awards in which the purported adverse effect of the measure disputed by claimant resulted from a legitimate sanction imposed by the competent regulatory authority upon licensee for having violated or breached its legal and/or contractual obligations;\n\n(ii) that applicable provincial laws expressly provide that the revocation of the license is one of the sanctions to be imposed in the event of such violations or breaches, and that, consequently, both ENJASA and Claimant shareholders upon privatization of the company unconditionally assumed such risk prior to revocation of the license. In such regard, it should be borne in mind that \"risk\" is one of the key elements of the generally accepted notion of the term \"investment\";\n\n(iii) that Claimants chose to resort to ICSID whereupon they had to withdraw from the contentious-administrative proceedings instituted thereby before the courts of Salta for the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315 on the revocation of ENJASA's license, pursuant to Article 8 (4) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, and that, as a consequence of such withdrawal, ENREJA's decisions on the revocation of ENJASA's license have become final in Respondent's domestic law;\n\n(iv) that nor is there any room to conclude that Respondent breached \"due process\", since Claimants opted not to have the injury that they claim to have suffered remedied by means of a judgment of the competent court for Salta in contentious-administrative matters to which they had resorted. That is so not because Claimants were compelled under the Argentina-Austria BIT or the ICSID Convention to exhaust local remedies prior to instituting this arbitration, but due to the fact that such failure makes it impossible to verify within the international framework the potential existence of an expropriation of the investment or an unfair or inequitable treatment thereof by Salta authorities. As rightly pointed out in *EnCana v. Ecuador* (2006): \"The question is not whether the claim is admissible but whether the relevant rights have been expropriated as a matter of substance\" (footnote 138 of such Award). Undoubtedly, in international law, a claim for breach within the domestic framework of \"due process\" by a respondent State cannot succeed if the claimant investor resorts to an international tribunal when it still has at its disposal domestic means of settlement that it fails to use (see, for example, the Award in *Parkerings v. Lithuania* (2007)). The claimant investor may eventually institute an international arbitration, but not prove that respondent in those arbitral proceedings breached the \"due process\" standard within the domestic framework;\n\n(v) that nor is there any room to conclude that the regular administrative proceedings whereupon ENREJA revoked ENJASA's license breached a proportionality criterion established by customary international law, since, even for Claimants themselves, references to such purported criterion in this context are merely a \"dominant position\" (PHB, para. 286), rather than a well-known legal criterion that is an integral part of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent, without prejudice of the provisions or mandates of a given treaty in such regard, or the proportionality criteria laid down in applicable domestic laws, as prescribed by both Article 13 of Provincial Law No. 7020 and ENJASA's License Agreement in this case;\n\n(vi) that the findings in the Award are not well-founded. They do not show that, at the time of revocation of ENJASA's license, events occurred that could give rise to an exception admitted by international law to the customary rule invoked by Respondent and admitted by Claimants. For instance, the Award shows nothing remotely similar to the occurrence of \"egregious and shocking\" events like those mentioned in *Glamis* (paragraph 66 *supra*) or circumstances leading to exceptions such as those stated by Harvard Draft Convention in *Saluka* (para. 257\u00a0of the Award). Lastly, the majority Award refrains from taking into consideration the normality of the situation in the Province of Salta when ENJASA's license was revoked within the framework of a democratic rule of law like that of the Argentine Republic. Hence, there is no reason to extrapolate into this case, presumptions of abnormality as it occurs in other past and present international arbitrations;\n\n(vii) that the majority Award also presents several inconsistencies by failing to give effect to the twofold circumstance that, first, Claimants did not own the license revoked (as nor did ENJASA), and, secondly, that the decision to revoke ENJASA's license as a sanction imposed on account of the previous violations or breaches of its obligations did not permanently and completely neutralize Claimants' investment in the company. A mere reduction of the value of an investment, even if significant, is not an \"indirect expropriation.\" Furthermore, the condition of permanent and complete disappearance of all the critical elements of a property right (or a like contractual right) of licensee is not met in this case, as ENJASA did not have such right when its License was revoked and the License was revocable in nature (see Charles Leben, *\u00ab La libert\u00e9 normative de l'Etat et la question de l'expropriation indirecte \u00bb* in \u00ab *Le contentieux arbitral international relatif \u00e0 l'investissement \u00bb,* Arthemis, 2006, pp. 173-174, cited in *El Paso* Award*,* para. 233).\n\n92.\n\nI understand that Claimants' reference to the \"dominant position\" mentioned *supra* is appropriate only for those who subscribe to the so-called \"sole effects\" doctrine, which is in decline for being excessive and incomplete, as stressed in 2006, *inter alia*, by the tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* (para. 194 of the Award). In addition, this doctrine is especially and wholly inappropriate in this case, since ENREJA's revocation of the license was not an ordinary measure, but a **sanction** expressly provided for in Provincial Law No. 7020 (and the License Agreement) imposed upon ENJASA for having repeatedly violated or breached its legal obligations as Licensee (as well as the provisions of the License Agreement.) On the other hand, ENREJA imposed the revocation sanction - as evinced by the documents in possession of the Arbitral Tribunal \u2013 upon conclusion of duly administrative proceedings, in exercise of the ordinary powers and authority conferred thereupon in its capacity as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority by Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta on games of chance, which is a public activity subject to provincial jurisdiction in such Province, and without prejudice of the administrative remedies available and/or the judicial control of ENREJA's decision by the courts of Salta.\n\n93.\n\nLike any sanction, the revocation of ENJASA's license was a measure which, by definition, had adverse effects on the company (the License Agreement uses the term \"penalties\" with reference to such effects.) Those adverse effects may also apply indirectly to investors in such company. But it is a measure which does not, by its nature and its object and purpose, give rise *ex origen* to Respondent's international responsibility before ENJASA or Claimants, or, for that matter, to compensation to ENJASA or Claimants. The \"sole effects\" doctrine mentioned *supra* was applied a few years ago by some investment arbitral tribunals which failed, at the outset, to pay due attention to the States' regulatory and police powers as recognized and safeguarded by international law. In any case, such doctrine lacks the normativity necessary to prevail over such a relevant customary rule of international law inherent in States' sovereignty as that invoked by Respondent in its defense. On the other hand, such doctrine is, nowadays, going out in practice, and international investment arbitral tribunals, in general, make the impending distinction between \"the State's regulatory and police measures\" and \"indirect expropriation measures.\" Both kinds of measures cannot be mistaken or assimilated anymore.\n\n**G. Conclusion on the Customary Rule Invoked by Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe revocation of the License was a legitimate measure adopted by ENREJA in exercise of its functions of Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 as a sanction upon ENJASA for its serious and repeated violations or breaches of its legal and contractual obligations as Licensee. By its nature and given its object and purpose, such measure was an act undertaken by ENREJA in exercise of its ordinary legal powers and authority, which are recognized and safeguarded both by the domestic legal system of the Argentine Republic in the Province of Salta, as well as the rule of customary international law invoked by Respondent.\n\n95.\n\nThe adverse effects or deprivations suffered by Claimants as a result of the exercise by the competent provincial authorities of the Province of Salta of the Argentine State's regulatory and police powers do not violate in the instant case the standards alleged by Claimants on direct or indirect expropriation, or fair and equitable treatment, enshrined in the Argentina-Austria BIT. Even though the conduct of such provincial authorities may indeed be attributed to Respondent, if such attribution is not accompanied by a violation by Respondent of an international obligation towards Claimants, there is no internationally wrongful act, as is actually the case here. In other words, since, in this case, the objective element of international responsibility is absent, there is no internationally wrongful act, and, without an internationally wrongful act, Respondent bears no international responsibility, and, if Respondent bears no international responsibility, it has no obligation to make reparation for the injury allegedly suffered by Claimants due to the revocation of ENJASA's license by means of compensation (Articles 1, 2, 28 and 31 of the Articles of the International Law Commission on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.)\n\n96.\n\nThe majority Award makes findings opposed to those mentioned *supra*, which, I deem groundless in light of the information on record and the evidence submitted by the Parties. The majority Award fails to take into consideration facts that are highly relevant and duly proved or admitted in the resolution of this dispute. The Award also mutilates part of the \"proper law\" applicable to the dispute pursuant to Article 8 (6) of the BIT. The *adverse effects* of the revocation of the License on ENJASA are specific to the very notion of sanction, and that possibility was known to and accepted by Claimants when they invested in the company. In addition, those effects in no way exhaust the elements to be weighed by this Arbitral Tribunal in order to adjudicate this case.\n\n97.\n\nMoreover, apart from the *effects*, we should bear in mind the *causes* of those effects; the *nature* of the measure, which, in the case at issue, is a sanction on account of violations or breaches of obligations by the sanctioned party; and the *kind* of rights affected by the sanction. Without giving due consideration to all these elements, neither this Tribunal nor any other can reach conclusions in accordance with the law applicable to this dispute. The equation cannot miss or disregard the following: (i) the causes of the revocation of the License (ENJASA's previous violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and the License); (ii) the nature of the measure adopted by ENREJA (a legitimate sanction expressly prescribed under Article 13 of Law No. 7020); (iii) the number, seriousness and repetition of violations or breaches by ENJASA despite ENREJA's prior warnings of which there is abundant documentary evidence on record; and (iv) the kind of rights revoked by the sanction (Licensee's administrative exploitation and management rights), which may not be expropriated under Respondent's Argentine domestic law. The majority has failed to pay due attention to all these issues, or others that are just as relevant, as a consequence of which their Award regrettably decides *infra petita* on the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent in its defense.\n\n98.\n\nThe sanction measure disputed did not go beyond the revocation of ENJASA's License. It affected, for example, no property rights or other rights *in rem* of the company. ENJASA was certainly a \"licensee\", but not the \"owner\" of the License, and the administrative rights to manage a State activity, such as the exploitation of games of chance in Salta under its provincial jurisdiction, cannot, by definition, have been subjected to direct or indirect expropriations by the Provincial Executive Branch, which is the license-granting authority. No-one expropriates itself. Now, if, under domestic law, there is no possibility of expropriating the rights or assets in question, it cannot be asserted in this international arbitration that an expropriation did occur, because that assertion would be, *inter alia,* contrary to the provisions of Article 1 (*in fine)* of the Argentina-Austria BIT on the contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets listed therein. Nor can it be ignored that, in the present case, the Provincial Executive Branch might well, in accordance with the License Agreement, not only ratify the revocation of a license determined by the Regulatory Agency, as was the case, but also declare the license null and void by operation of law, on account of ENJASA's breach of the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Provincial Law No. 7020 (Article 6 of the License Agreement).\n\n99.\n\nNor did the revocation of the license infringe upon the rule of law, as Claimants have purported, since both Articles 5 and 13 of Law No. 7020, and those which therein define ENREJA's powers and authority, are perfectly clear and were not questioned but accepted by ENJASA while it was the Licensee, as well as by Claimants when they invested in the company both on the occasion of its privatization and, later, when they became majority shareholders by acquiring around 60% of the company equity or when they acquired virtually all the rest of the company's shares after ENREJA issued Resolution No. 240. Neither ENJASA nor Claimants challenged at any of those times before the courts of the Province of Salta the Regulatory Agency's powers, authority or ability to impose sanctions, or the sanctions imposed on ENJASA throughout the years prior to Resolution No. 240. They resorted to the court in contentious-administrative matters for the Province of Salta only after ENREJA's Resolution No, 315 rejected the recourse for reconsideration of the decision to revoke the License under Resolution No. 240. Nor did ENJASA resort to the Provincial Executive Branch on appeal against any of the sanctions that ENREJA imposed thereon (*recurso de alzada)*\n\n100.\n\nLastly, the contentious-administrative proceedings instituted in Salta by Claimants, requesting the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315 concluded by means of an early withdrawal, as Claimants (majority investors in ENJASA and managers exercising control over the company for years) chose to resort to ICSID arbitration, arguing that, as a consequence of the revocation of ENJASA's license, Respondent had allegedly violated certain provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT. They did not wait for the provincial court in contentious-administrative matters to decide in the domestic forum on the annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315, which thus became final in the Argentine domestic system, which is one of the sources of the law applicable to the resolution of the dispute for being, pursuant to Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, \"the laws of the Contracting Party party in the dispute.\"\n\n**PART II: ON RESPONDENT'S POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS ALLEGED BY CLAIMANTS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nHaving concluded that the alleged adverse effects for Claimants of the revocation of ENJASA's license do not constitute an internationally wrongful act, but rather a mere consequence of measures issued by Respondent's competent body in response to violations or breaches by the company and, as such, supported by the customary rule of international law on the exercise of State regulatory and police power, Respondent has not incurred any international responsibility to Claimants for said alleged adverse effects. Therefore, all three claims by Claimants are rejected. However, I have *ex abundante cautela* decided to examine in detail the merits of each claim*,* further concluding also that Respondent has not violated any international obligation *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants and, in the absence of this objective element of international responsibility, Respondent could have not performed the internationally wrongful acts attributed to him by Claimants. The findings from the analysis of Claimants' claims are therefore similar to those from the analysis of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent in its defense.\n\n**A. Claimants' First Claim: Alleged Violation of Article 4(1) and (2) of the TBI by Respondent (Indirect Expropriation)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Relevant Texts**\n----------------------\n\n**(i) Agreement between the Republic of Argentina and the Republic of Austria for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 7 August 1992, effective since 1 January 1995**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nAs regards this first claim, Claimants rely on Article 4(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, which provides:\n\n\"(1) The term \"expropriation\" includes both nationalization or any other measures having an equivalent effect.\n\n(2) Investments of investors of one Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party for more than a public purpose and under due process and compensation. The amount of compensation shall correspond to the value of the investment immediately before the expropriation or impending tender was issued. The compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall produce interest until the time of payment, in accordance with the usual banking rate of the State in whose territory the investment has been made; effectively realizable and shall be freely transferable. The determination and the payment of compensation shall be set out in an appropriate manner at the latest at the moment of the expropriation.\"\n\n103.\n\nClaimants CAI and CASAG, both Austrian, are indirect shareholders of the Argentine company *Entretenimientos y Juegos de Azar S.A* (ENJASA), which, prior to the revocation of ENREJA by means of Resolution No. 240 (dated 13 August 2013) owned around 60% of the shares and, since November 2013, 99.94% of the shares of Leisure and Entertainment S.A. (L&E). As shareholders, Claimants state in this arbitration that the aforementioned revocation of ENJASA's license by the Regulatory Agency resulting in an interference with their investment tantamount to an \"indirect expropriation\", which would be in breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of Argentina-Austria BIT cited above.\n\n104.\n\nThe text of these paragraphs of Article 4 of Argentina-Austria BIT is slightly different from what could be deemed as the usual wording of BITs. First, the title of the Article is \"Compensation\" instead of \"Expropriation\". Second, paragraph (1) defines \"expropriation\" in a narrower sense than other BITs, as it merely mentions \" nationalization\", on the one hand, and \"any other measures having an equivalent effect\", on the other hand, the latter in reference to the term \"nationalization\" alone which is not the only possible form of expropriation. In turn, as I have already explained in the Introduction of this Opinion, paragraph (2) of Article 4 does not require that compensation be \"prompt, adequate and effective,\" but rather provides that \"compensation shall be paid *without undue delay*\" and that \"the determination and the payment of compensation shall *be set out in an appropriate manner* at the latest at the moment of the expropriation.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n105.\n\nEvery interpretation undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention should take into consideration *inter alia* the \"context\" represented by the other provisions of the treaty being interpreted. As regards the Argentina-Austria BIT, the interpreter must take into account the Definitions under Article 1, the relevant paragraphs of which read as follows:\n\n\"For the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term \"investment\" means every asset invested or reinvested in any sector of the economy, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory has been made and, in particular, though not exclusively:\n\nb) The rights of participation and other forms of participation in companies;\n\nThe content and scope of rights for the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located.\"\n\n106.\n\nLastly, for the purposes of application of paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 4 of the BIT, it should also be noted that the law of the Argentine Republic, and as a consequence, the law of its Province of Salta is \"applicable law\" to this dispute by virtue of Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT, as we also stated in the Introduction.\n\n**(ii) The Applicable Law of the Argentine Republic**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn this case, the relevant instruments of applicable Argentine law are legal instruments of the Province of Salta, which is the entity constitutionally competent to operate \"Games of Chance\" in said provincial jurisdiction. The underlying instruments of this arbitration are:\n\n1. Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta published on 12 January 1999 (as amended by Law No. 7133 of 2001);\n\n2. Decree No. 3616 of the Executive of the Province of Salta, dated 1 September 1999, creating ENJASA and conferring a License thereto (the terms of the license agreement are included as Annex 1 thereof);\n\n3. Decree No. 419 of the Executive of the Province of Salta, dated 15 February 2002, approving the Transfer Agreement of ENJASA, executed on 14 February 2000 between the Ministry of Production and Employment and the UTE **(**Casinos de Austria Internacional Holding, Boldt and Iberlux Internacional), attached to said Decree.\n\n4. Text of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (Agreement Review and Renegotiation Unit - UNIREN).\n\n5. Decree No. 5313 of 25 November 2008, approving the Memorandum of Understanding between UNIREN and ENJASA**.**\n\n108.\n\nAll these instruments have been provided to the Tribunal by the Parties, which have frequently invoked or cited them in their pleadings and oral arguments. Hence, their texts are an integral part of the record of these proceedings. For the sake of economy, they shall not be reproduced in this Opinion. All of them are in the public domain.\n\n**(b) Consideration of the Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Revocation of ENJASA's License Was Not an \"Indirect Expropriation\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nEvidently, the revocation of ENJASA's License by ENREJA as a sanction for violation or breach of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and the License itself was not an expropriation of the shares of L&E and/or ENJASA, unless the legal language is no longer a means of communication among jurists. As stated by the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada:* \"In general, the term expropriation carries with it the connotation of a 'taking' by a government-type authority of a person's property with a view to transferring ownership of that property to another person, usually the authority that exercised *de jure* or *de facto* power to do the taking\" (partial award of 13 November 2000, para. 280).\n\n110.\n\nHere, the disputed measure, *i.e.*, the revocation of ENJASA's License, may not qualify as a *\"taking\"* because ENJASA was not the owner but the holder of the License, that is, a \"licensee\" rather than \"owner\"; hence, there could not be a transfer of non-existent property whatsoever. Instead, there was a sanction applied to ENJASA by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020, for serious and repeated violations and breaches of the company's obligations as Licensee to prevent money laundering as set forth under Article 5 of Law No. 7020, almost all of which occurred when Claimants to these arbitration proceedings were already majority shareholders and not only controlled but also directly managed the company that incurred the violations and breaches that led to the revocation. That is, Claimants initiated these proceedings before the ICSID against the Argentine Republic (in order to seek economic compensation for the alleged adverse impact on their actions as a result of the loss of ENJASA's old license for violations or breaches of its legal and contractual obligations) when they controlled, managed and ran the company.\n\n111.\n\nBeing aware of the non-existence of the *\"taking\"* and, at the same time, determined to resort to Article 4(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, Claimants have brought a main claim in the terms of the so-called \"indirect expropriation\", relying on international arbitral decisions on foreign investments rendered to deal with factual and legal situations arising from the adoption of measures that bear little or no relevance to the revocation in this case.\n\n112.\n\nThus, Claimants are seeking to use \"indirect expropriation\" or \"*de facto* expropriation\", justified in other situations for basic reasons of justice, in order to obtain economic compensation for the adverse effects they suffered as a result of a legal sanction applied to ENJASA for failure to comply with its obligations as Licensee as regards money laundering prevention (part of States' fight against drug trafficking and terrorism), when by the time the revocation was mandated the company had been controlled, managed and ran by the very Claimants for ten years. This has nothing to do with \"indirect expropriation\". In the language of international arbitral tribunals, the concept of \"indirect expropriation\" has been described in different ways but its original meaning is clear. It refers to measures typically with smaller negative effects than those of direct expropriation but which, given their magnitude, ownership rights are so affected by the interference that the owner is deprived of the exercise or economic benefit of its right or control over its property, without any actual transfer of title. As stated, for instance, by the tribunal in *Metalclad v. Mexico:*\n\n\"expropriation \u2026 includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favor of the host State, but also cover or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State\" (Award of 30 August 2000, para.103).\n\n113.\n\nNormally, these are measures of a permanent nature whose interference causes a loss of complete or near complete value of the investment or a loss of control over the company which prevents the investor from obtaining the economic return on its investment. Numerous claims of expropriation have been dismissed precisely because the investor remained in control of the company, as is this case *(Feldman v. Mexico, Methanex v. United States, Sempra v. Argentina, CMS v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina, LG&E v. Argentina)*. It also appears that, in the first investment arbitral proceedings, \"indirect expropriation\" was alleged by claimants and considered by tribunals mainly or exclusively in light of the effects of state measures on an investor's investment, a unilateral view of the concept that inevitably came into conflict with State regulatory and police powers. However, in practice, that stage has been left behind by investment arbitral tribunals.\n\n114.\n\nIn any case, the central issue of this dispute is by no means, as Claimants suggest, the adoption by the authorities of the Province of Salta of a measure likely to qualify as \"indirect expropriation\" for the following considerations: (i) it is a measure aimed at sanctioning prior violations or breaches by ENJASA of Licensee's obligations under Article 5 of Law No. 7020; (ii) the sanction was applied by the relevant Regulatory Agency in the regular performance of its duties as Enforcement Authority under said law; (iii) the ordinary administrative procedure applied to every licensee was followed by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority; (iv) said procedure was conducted in accordance with due process and ENJASA's right of defense was guaranteed; and (v) Claimants were fully aware of and accepted both such procedure and Law No. 7020 when, upon privatization, they decided to invest in ENJASA through their shareholding in a *Uni\u00f3n Transitoria de Empresas* (*UTE* - a joint venture under Argentinian law) as well as when, subsequently, after becoming majority shareholders of L&E, they managed the company and controlled its business activities.\n\n115.\n\nUnlike other disputes between investors and host States, this dispute has not been caused by significant modifications of the legal framework and/or the license agreement between the date when Claimants decided to start investing in ENJASA and the date when the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority decided to revoke ENJASA's License for its serious and repeated violations and breaches of its obligations under Article 5 of Law No. 7020, which also infringed the provisions on Article 5 of the License' contrat. Moreover, it does not concern issues related to, for example, a revision or renewal of a license or concession. Therefore, many awards on investments and concessions have little or nothing to do with the subject-matter of this dispute, such as, by way of example, the award in *Tecmed v. Mexico* often cited by Claimants in these proceedings*.*\n\n**(ii) The So-Called \"Sole Effects\" Doctrine is not Applicable to This Case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nClaimants have not only alleged \"indirect expropriation\" but also, in doing so, they have relied on a unidimensional version of the concept, namely, the so-called \"sole effects\" doctrine which excludes from consideration all elements, aspects or factors other than the adverse effects of the disputed measure. This doctrine, currently disproved, is at all events not applicable to a dispute like this. Hence, Claimants' reliance on arbitral decisions on \"indirect expropriation\" based on the \"sole effects\" doctrine is of no use to adjudicate this case. Arguing that the only factor to be considered in determining the existence of \"indirect expropriation\" should be the degree of interference of the effects of the adopted measure, that is, the revocation of ENJASA's license, with the company's or Claimants' property rights, does not make any sense. It is like requesting that the decision of this Arbitral Tribunal be based on absurd and unreasonable grounds.\n\n117.\n\nThe \"sole effects\" doctrine, especially developed in the particular context of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, has had certain prestige among some commentators who have disregarded or tried to disregard said context. It is therefore appropriate to recall the origins of this doctrine, as in this passage of another doctrinal sector: \"Seemingly, the (Mixed) Tribunal has effectively assumed that, in light of the prevailing circumstances in Iran between 1978 and 1981, a loss of property was attributable to Iran as a result of irregular measures contrary to international law\" [Translated by me] (Alejandro Faya Rodr\u00edguez, *\u00bfC\u00f3mo se determina una expropiaci\u00f3n indirecta bajo tratados internacionales en materia de inversi\u00f3n? Un an\u00e1lisis contempor\u00e1neo\",* Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Instituto de Investigaciones Jur\u00eddicas 2013, p. 230).\n\n118.\n\nIn the Province of Salta, both before and after the measure whereby ENJASA's License was revoked, the circumstances were and continue to be peaceful and completely normal, from a constitutional and democratic perspective. Furthermore, the Argentina-Austria BIT is not precisely the \"Algiers Declaration\", which accords jurisdiction on the aforementioned Claims Tribunal beyond expropriation, as it extends to \"other measures affecting property rights\". So, it is inappropriate that this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal assumes or presumes that said sanction against ENJASA was the result of measures inconsistent with Argentina laws, the provisions of the BIT, or international law, although Claimants have repeatedly attempted so by referring to a so-called \"political conspiracy\", which they have been incapable of establishing.\n\n119.\n\nThe \"political conspiracy\" argument has lost weight during the hearings at the present phase, but Claimants have still alleged it in their Post-Hearing Brief (PHB). In turn, the majority Award contains some ambiguity in that regard since, on the one hand, it affirms that such I plea is not taking into account in the decision but, on the other hand, it fails to state that Claimants have produced no evidence of the alleged \"political conspiracy used to lend some credibility to their claims, in particular, to the claim of \"indirect expropriation\".)\n\n**(iii) The Arbitral Practice and Contemporaneous Authors Reject the \"Sole Effects\" Doctrine**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nIn recent practice, even in relation to proper \"indirect expropriation\", there is a clear rejection of the \"sole effects\" doctrine. It makes little sense to state that just because a measure has a negative impact on a foreign investment, there is inexorably and conclusively unlawful \"indirect expropriation\". The seriousness of the impact of the measure is not the only element that should be weighed because, in international law, it cannot be assumed that States, having admitted the legal concept of \"indirect expropriation\", have implicitly and simultaneously admitted the limitation of the regulatory and police powers inherent in their sovereignty. That would be contrary to systemic principles of international law, such as the principle that both the limitations of State sovereignty and State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts are not presumed.\n\n121.\n\nIn general, the exercise of such regulatory and police powers does not produce any serious economic adverse impact on investments, though there might be cases where such an impact could take place without the investor being entitled to compensation by virtue of the customary rule of international law examined *supra* in this Opinion. One of those cases is precisely the revocation of a license or concession by the Regulatory Agency on account of violations or breaches of licensee's or concessionaire's obligations, as is the present case..\n\n122.\n\nIn order to determine when a specific legitimate sanction or regulation with adverse effects does not entitle the investor to compensation, as in this case, or when there has been \"indirect expropriation\" subject to compensation, investment arbitral tribunals consider, in light of the particular circumstances of the case, the powers of the host State to regulate and sanction in the public interest all the activities conducted in their territories (even by foreign investors) and the rights of foreign investors for the benefit of their investment. As described in the following scholarly commentary: \"There is a prevailing tendency towards recognizing, explicitly or implicitly, that the nature of the measure, together with its effects**,** are the elements required to determine the existence (or non-existence) of indirect expropriation. Therefore, tribunals usually move away from extreme versions and consider both the nature and the practical impact of the measure\" [Translated by me] (Alejandro Faya Rodr\u00edguez, *op. cit.,* p. 232). For the sake of accuracy, I would add to this comment the causes and context of the measure, as expressly stated by the tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* in 2006 as follows:\n\n\"It is this Tribunal's opinion that there must be a balance in the analysis both of the causes and the effects of a measure in order that one may qualify a measure as being of an expropriatory nature. It is important not to confound the State's right to adopt policies with its power to take an expropriatory measure. This determination is important because it is one of the main elements to distinguish, from the perspective of an international tribunal between a regulatory measure, which is an ordinary expression of the exercise of the state's police power that entails a decrease in assets or rights, and a de facto expropriation that deprives those assets and rights of any real substance\" (Award of 3 October 2006, para.194) (emphasis added).\n\n123.\n\nIn this case, the revocation of ENJASA's license was not an extraordinary, irregular, discriminatory or arbitrary act. Neither was it a deprivation which, by its nature, could qualify as direct or indirect expropriation, as deprivation in this case was caused by a measure adopted in the ordinary exercise of the regulatory and police powers of the State\u2013through the Regulatory Agency and the relevant Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020, in the national and international general public interest, in order to prevent money laundering\u2013 by means of a sanction under that Law for prior serious and repeated violations or breaches of legal and contractual obligations assumed by ENJASA as Licensee, as well as after ENREJA had warned it that the License could be revoked in pursuance of Article 13 of the said Law if the said violations or breaches were not remedied, as finally happened in the present case.\n\n124.\n\nThis is certainly the conclusion of every analysis that properly takes into consideration the factors that should be weighed (effects; causes; context; nature of the measure). In any case, I have come to my conclusions on Claimants \"indirect expropriation\" claim in view not only of the effects of the measure (revocation of ENJASA's License) but also its causes (prior violations and breaches of ENJASA's legal and contractual obligations as Licensee), the nature of the measure adopted (sanction for violation or breach of the obligations listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020), and the class or type of asset affected by the disputed measure (ENJASA's contractual rights as Licensee to operate games of chance within the relevant provincial jurisdiction).\n\n**(iv) Were Licensee's Rights Subject to Expropriation?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nSeemingly, Claimants' first claim assumes that the Licensee's rights could be expropriated, since otherwise they could not have been subject to the indirect expropriation that they allege having suffered as a result of the revocation of the license. I acknowledge that, while in national legal systems as a general rule, only rights *in rem* such as property are subject to expropriation, that is not the case at the international level. Under international law, according to circumstances, the term \"expropriation\" may have a broader scope and encompass contractual rights or even some type of intangible rights, though without going so far like some tribunals which have ruled, as regards investments, that any interest with economic value may be subject to expropriation, as if such a proposition was a generally accepted rule. Again, this excess extrapolates ICSID and PCA arbitration proceedings relating to investments\u2013 tendencies applied by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal which, as stated *supra*, operates within the specific framework of the Algiers Declaration. Present proceedings are conducted under the Argentina-Austria BIT of 7 August 1992 (effective since 1 January 1995), and the ICSID Convention, not under the Algiers Declaration.\n\n126.\n\nIn investment arbitration proceedings based on treaties, the scope of property subject to expropriation may be somewhat broad according to the provisions of the BIT or treaty concerned, either directly when regulating expropriation or indirectly, for example, when defining the term \"investment\" in the BIT or treaty concerned. In this case, since Article 1 (*in fine)* of the Argentina-Austria BIT provides that the content of rights for the various categories of assets protected by the BIT\u2013including the one invoked by Claimants (the rights of participation and other forms of participation in companies)\u2013shall be determined \"by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located,\" the scope of what may be expropriated under the Argentina-Austria BIT defined by the laws and regulations of the Argentine Republic. Therefore, in this regard, the decisions of other international investment arbitration tribunals or relevant legal opinions should not be extrapolated.\n\n127.\n\nIn addition, under Article 8(6) of the BIT as well, Argentine law is undoubtedly applied as one of the three main legal sources that form the \"applicable law\" to the settlement of this dispute since Argentina and Austria so decided in their BIT. Thus, there is no reason to challenge the statement of the tribunal in *Encana c. Ecuador* that \"\u2026for there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return (...) the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them\" (Award of 3 February 2006, para. 184). In this case, it is under the laws of the Argentine Republic and/or the Province of Salta, but Claimants have failed to establish that such laws provide for the expropriation of the administrative rights or benefits enjoyed by ENJASA in its capacity as licensee.\n\n128.\n\nTherefore, all those submissions by Claimants or the majority Award affirming or inferring that ENJASA was the owner of the revoked License, referred to as *\"contrato de licencia\"* under Law No. 7020, are completely inapposite. Under such License, ENJASA was permitted or authorized to operate games of chance in the Province of Salta, on an exclusive basis, for thirty years within the regulatory framework of Law No. 7020 and the terms of the License contract itself, but under no circumstances and at no point was ENJASA the owner of the License. The definition of the purpose of the License in Article 1 excludes any idea of ownership by Licensee over the license in the following terms:\n\n\"1.1. The object of the license is to authorize the operation of games of chance in the provincial territory *with the scope and limitations set forth herein...*\n\n1.2. The authorization entails *the management, marketing and operation* of games of chance belonging to the jurisdiction of the province...\n\n1.3. The Licensee may *market* the games of chance belonging to the jurisdiction of the province, and which are subject matter of this licence, not only within the provincial territory but also in the national territory...\n\n1.4. The Licensee shall subject its activity, in everything related to the development of the license, to the provisions set forth in Law No. 7020, the regulatory decree and the rules issued by the Games of Chance Regulatory Agency in use of the powers conferred to it. (Emphasis added)\n\n129.\n\nTo sum up, in Salta, the power to regulate games of chance is vested in the Province, and Article 4 of provincial Law No. 7020 conferred the power to grant licenses for exploitation of such games upon the Provincial Executive. Therefore, it was said Executive that, by Decree No. 3616 of 1 September 1999, granted the License to ENJASA, a company created by the same decree and later privatized. It is thus evident that ENJASA's contractual rights as Licensee were not property *in rem* or contractual rights subject to direct or indirect expropriation by the Province of Salta, unless it is absurdly admitted that one may expropriate oneself. In short, ENJASA' contractual rights as licensee were not an asset subject to expropriation when the License was revoked *since, by their very legal nature, they were not an asset subject to expropriation within the Province of Salta.* The License could be revoked, terminated, or declared no longer valid, but could not be expropriated, either directly or indirectly. Hence, it cannot be stated, at the international level, that the revocation of ENJASA's license was an \"indirect expropriation\".\n\n**(v) Has There Been Complete or Near Complete Deprivation of Value or Control of Claimants' Investment?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAs stated by legal authors, an \"expropriation\" affects an asset in its entirety on a permanent basis. There is no partial expropriation as the notion would make no sense. However, in the case of investments comprising a variety of rights and assets, the expropriation of one specific item could be admitted in certain circumstances, provided such item is not an integral part of the same legal transaction and, by its nature, may be expropriated. This is not the case here.\n\n131.\n\nIn the present case, a potential violation of the expropriation standard under the BIT would first require determining whether Claimants have been deprived, both substantially and permanently, of the economic return on their investment. This would also entail deciding, in the first place, if the revocation of ENJASA's License was in the regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers. But if it was not, *quad non*, the tribunal should determine *inter alia* the interference of the revoking sanction with Claimants' investment in ENJASA on account of all the assets of the latter, that is, both the profits earned as the exclusive licensee for the operation of the gaming and lottery business in the Province of Salta and the ownership and operation of Hotel Sheraton Salta and other potential assets of the company. As stated by the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina,* the weight of authority appears to draw a distinction between \"a partial deprivation of value\" of the investment (not an expropriation) and a complete or near complete deprivation of value of the investment (expropriation). (Award of 20 August 2007, para.7.5.11). Another form of interference that could qualify as expropriation is a loss of control by the company or subsidiary concerned, regardless of the degree of loss of value of the investment. However, in this case, Claimants did not lose control of ENJASA or their shares in the company.\n\n132.\n\nHaving concluded *supra* that the revocation of ENJASA's License by Resolution No. 240 issued by ENREJA\u2013the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020\u2013was the result from the regular exercise by said body of the regulatory and police powers of the Argentine Republic as a sovereign State, I am under no duty to determine whether such revocation substantially and permanently deprived Claimants of the benefits of their investment in ENJASA. However, since this last issue has been long discussed between the Parties, I shall also provide my opinion *ex abundante cautela* on that matter. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent states:\n\n\"With respect to the ownership and operation of Hotel Sheraton Salta, the revocation of the License did not affect its ownership and operation. In effect, ENJASA continued to be the owner of this hotel and obtained considerable economic benefits derived from it. Furthermore, it has been established that the hotel was built with tax allowances and benefits and subsequently sold at market price. For this sale transaction, ENJASA yielded a considerable accounting profit.\" (ENJASA's Financial Statements as of 31/12/2017, Notes 3.15, 19 and 20 (Exhibit-299). In Note 3.15, it is confirmed that the profit obtained through the sale was ARS 20,590,902) (PHB, para. 266)\n\n133.\n\nThe factual elements mentioned by Respondent in that citation are duly documented and have not been essentially disproved by Claimants. So, ENJASA was not only the exclusive Licensee for the operation of games of chance in the provincial jurisdiction of Salta, but also the owner and manager of a five-star hotel, *i.e.*, the aforementioned Hotel Sheraton Salta. Indeed, ENJASA operated those two economic elements subject to the same legal business, as evidenced *inter alia* by the \"Transfer Agreement\" of ENJASA, attached to Decree No. 419 of 15 February 2000, executed between the UTE (Casinos, Boldt and Iberlux) and the Province of Salta upon privatization of the company, whereby the parties not only agreed on the sale and transfer of ENJASA's stock to the UTE but also defined the obligations of the purchaser (*i.e.*, such *UTE*), which essentially consisted of (i) payment of an annual fee for ENJASA's License to operate games of chance, and (ii) the construction of the aforementioned Hotel Sheraton as part of the so-called \"Tourism Development Plan.\" Both obligations are therefore an integral part of a single legal business, the transaction consisting in the privatization of ENJASA, concluded between the aforementioned *UTE* and the Province of Salta.\n\n134.\n\nThe tenders presented by the *UTE* (Casinos, Boldt and Iberlux) covered both proposals on the annual fee in consideration for the exclusive thirty-year License for the operation of games of chance in the provincial jurisdiction by ENJASA, and the financing of the Tourism Development Plan, including the construction of the Hotel. The improved economic bid submitted by the *UTE*\u2014successful bidder in the public tender\u2014proposed an annual fee of USD 2,500,000 for the first three years, an annual fee of USD 4,100,000 for the remaining twenty-seven years, and a total investment in the Tourism Development Plan of USD 20,700,000, based on information included in the Preamble of Decree No. 419 mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\n\n135.\n\nThe Transfer Agreement of ENJASA clearly confirms the unity of business under the agreement between said UTE and the Province of Salta, as it first sets forth in Articles 3, 4 and 5 the stock sold, the price, the method of payment and the manner of transfer of the stock, and then includes in Article 6 as *obligations of purchaser under this contract* not only those related to payment of the annual fee but also those undertaken by the *UTE* as regards construction of the Hotel as per the Tourism Development Plan.\n\n136.\n\nThere is no doubt in that regard, as such \"obligations of purchaser under this contract\" provide *inter alia* for: (i) payment of the fee and execution of the Tourism Development Investment Plan; (ii) that the purchaser shall comply with the Development Plan in due time and form; (iii) that the purchaser shall submit to the Regulatory Agency a certificate of the investments undertaken in the tender for each year; (iv) that the Regulatory Agency shall monitor and certify compliance with the Investment Plan; (v) that the purchaser shall prepare and submit to the Regulatory Agency on a two-monthly basis a progress report on the works carried out during the period; (vi) that the tasks requiring the execution of works included in the Investment Plan shall be performed at purchaser's risk and expense, which shall assume all necessary expenses until total completion thereof; and (vii) that in no event shall the seller be liable for the consequences arising from those tasks or contracts executed by the purchaser for their performance.\n\n137.\n\nIn light of the above, I undoubtedly conclude that: (i) the two economic aspects of Claimants' investment pertained to the same transaction, a single and indivisible legal business between the UTE concerned and the Province of Salta; and (ii) hence, the revocation of ENJASA's License did not deprive Claimants of the complete value of their investment since it did not affect ownership and operation of Hotel Sheraton Salta or any other assets of the company, or their control over the company and/or stock. Consequently, Claimants' allegation that they suffered \"indirect expropriation\" as a result of the revocation of ENJASA's License is untenable.\n\n**(vi) The Power of the Regulatory Agency as the Enforcement Authority to Take Action for Violation or Breach of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, as Amended by Law No. 7133**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nTitle I of Law No. 7020, \"Regulatory Framework Applicable to Games of Chance\", provides in Chapter I (General Provisions) that the operation and management of Games of Chance in the entire territory of the Province of Salta shall be comply with the guidelines, procedures and conditions established by this law and its regulations (Article 1), defines the term \"Games of Chance\" (Article 2), states that the Enforcement Authority of the law shall be the Games of Chance Regulatory Agency created under Title II thereof (ENREJA) and that such Agency shall have sufficient authority to issue operative rules to enforce the Law (Article 3), specifies that such games in the Province of Salta shall be operated through licenses granted by the Provincial Executive under the terms and for the periods to be determined by the latter (Article 4), and that licensee shall act in compliance with Law No. 7020, shall be liable for the selection and use of operation and maintenance methods to ensure compliance with the provisions of said Law, may not hire operators without the prior authorization of the Enforcement Authority, and shall designate a person responsible for anti-money laundering who shall be entrusted with obligations earmarked to prevent said money laundering (Article 5).\n\n139.\n\nThe following articles of Chapter I of Title I of Law No. 7030 deal with the preparation of financial statements by licensee (Articles 6 to 9), audits by the Regulatory Agency (Articles 10 to 12), and sanctions applied by the Regulatory Agency (Article 13). Article 13, entitled \"Breaches\", together with Article 5, is especially relevant in this arbitration, and provides that**:**\n\n\"Any violations or breaches of this law, its regulatory provisions, the License Agreement, and the rules and regulations issued by the Agency shall be punishable by the Enforcement Authority by:\n\na) Warning\n\nb) Fine\n\nc) Disqualification\n\nd) Suspension of the License\n\ne) Revocation of the License\n\nSuch sanctions shall be applied taking into account the seriousness of the violation or breach, notwithstanding any criminal liability or liability for contraventions.\"\n\n140.\n\nThese sanctions under Title I of Law No. 7020 relating to the \"obligations of Licensees\" should not be confounded with the administrative sanctions of Article 41, Chapter IV, Title II of said Law, entitled \"Administrative Infractions,\" which ENREJA may also apply to \"natural or legal persons\" who, with or without its authorization, carry out any of the activities defined as \"games of chance\" under Article 2 of Law No. 7020 and, in doing so, violate one or more of the provisions of Law No. 7020, the regulatory decree thereof and the resolutions issued by the Regulatory Agency, notwithstanding any sanctions for contraventions, or criminal and civil liability imposed upon the infractor (Article 40). While the sanctions set out under Article 41 of Law No. 7020 differ from those under Article 13, there is no conflict because the provisions of both articles punish different scenarios and pursue different goals. The sanctions under Article 41 are irrelevant to these proceedings as they relate to scenarios and purposes different from those under Article 13, which relate to violations or breaches of \"*licensee's obligation\"*, such as those under Article 5 of Law No. 7020.\n\n141.\n\nThe situation described above is clear. A simple reading of Articles 13 and 41 in the context of Law No. 7020 will suffice. But Claimants in this arbitration have made allegations expressly or impliedly based on the argument that both articles are applicable to a licensee in breach of its \"obligations as licensee\". This statement \u2013 actually a fallacy\u2013 repeats what ENJASA alleged in that regard in Salta, which Resolution No. 240/13 issued by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020 expressly rejects in the following terms:\n\n\"Whereas, in relation to infringements and consequences thereof, two situations are distinguished by the provisions of Law No. 7020, as amended Law 7133: a) Breaches, the penalties of which are contemplated in Article 13 and applicable to breaches or violations of the law, its regulations, license contract and other regulations enacted by the Entity: *which shall be* punished with a Warning, Inability to operate, Suspension of the License and Revocation of the License; of b) Administrative Infringements, the penalty of which are provided for in Article 41: which *shall be subject*, indistinctly or jointly, to a Fine, Inability to operate, Seizure or Closure (Article 41).\n\nWhereas, both rules intend to punish, not only the negative disobediences (abstentions or omissions) but also the behaviors generally committed with the intention to be inconsistent with a rule. However, there is an imperceptible distinction in the list of penalties, since, for instance, Article 13 authorizes the suspension and revocation of the license while Article 41 has, in addition, to provide for the inability to operate and the fine, the seizure and the closure. It should be also observed that the breaches are infringements to the laws, to the contract and to general regulations; the violations \u2013leave aside the contract and the general regulations referred to the violations of the law, decree and the resolutions of the Entity when they are not of regulatory nature\" (pages 30/31 of Resolution 240) (emphasis in original).\n\n142.\n\nENREJA decided to revoke ENJASA's license for violations or breaches of legal and contractual obligations assumed by the company as Licensee for the operation of games of chance within the provincial jurisdiction of Salta, and it obviously did so as it should by means of a sanction applied in compliance with Article 13 of said Law. It appears that if Article 41 had been applicable, ENREJA would not have been able to revoke the license, given that Article 41 does not provide for revocation as a sanction. The irrefutable evidence that Article 41 was not applicable *in casu* is the proven fact that, in the Notice of Resolution No. 240/13, ENREJA informed ENJASA that it could submit a request for clarification, reconsideration or appeal, against said Resolution, whereas Article 50 of Law No. 7020 provides that, in the case of administrative infractions, the resolutions to apply sanctions pursuant to Article 41 may only be challenged by clarification and/or revocation. Accordingly, the provisions on \"administrative infractions\" of Chapter IV of Title II of Law No. 7020 (including the one-year time-bar of actions and sanctions under Article 49) were alien both to the dispute between ENJASA and the Province of Salta, as the company could submit a request for reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13, and to the subject-matter of these ICSID proceedings between Claimants (CAI and CASAG) and Respondent (Argentine Republic).\n\n143.\n\nFurther evidence that confirms that the provisions on \"administrative infractions\" of Chapter IV of Title II of Law No. 7020 are alien to the central issue of these proceedings is the fact that the \"legal obligations\" of a Licensee under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 concerning the prior authorizations from ENREJA (first paragraph of the Article), along with the prevention of money laundering (second paragraph) are also \"contractual obligations\" of Licensee under the \"License Agreement\" executed by ENJASA. Indeed, Articles 4 (Obligations of the Licensee), 5 (Sanctions) and 6 (Events of Extinction and/or Cancellation) of the \"license agreement\" of Annex I to Decree No. 3616, issued by the Provincial Executive, provide, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\n\"4.1 The licensee shall have the following obligations:\n\n4.1.2. To comply in its exercise of the license with all the provisions set forth in Law No. 7020 and the regulatory decree.\n\n4.1.3. To comply in its exercise of the license with all the rules issued by ENREJA within the framework of its competence.\n\nArticle 5\n\n5.1. Each of the violations or breaches on the part of the licensee to Law No. 7020, its regulation provisions and the regulations issued by ENREJA *shall be punished* with the sanctions and graduation established in Law No. 7020 and its implementing regulation. (Emphasis added)\n\n5.2 Consideration, application and grading of the sanction shall be analyzed by ENREJA and sanctions should be proportional to the seriousness of the committed infraction.\n\n5.3. For the sake of grading the sanction, ENREJA shall take into account: the seriousness of the infraction, the extent to which the rule of law, morality and good customs are impaired, the damages it causes to the provincial State and/or private persons, the social commotion it may produce and the licensee\u00b4s record of recidivism.\n\nArticle 6\n\n6.1. Notwithstanding the grounds set forth in the share transfer agreement... the following shall be grounds for extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the license by operation of law:\n\n\\* Failure to comply with the obligations set forth in article 5 of Law N\u00ba 7020.\n\n\\* Operation of any games of chance without the previous authorization of ENREJA.\n\n\\* Total or partial assignment or transfer of the powers granted under this license without previous authorization of the Provincial Executive Branch.\"\n\n144.\n\nThese provisions of the \"license agreement\" of Annex I to Decree No. 3616 dated 1 September 1999\u2013Article 6 of which expressly mentions Article 5 of Law No. 7020\u2013 could not make reference to the provisions on \"Administrative Infractions\" under Articles 40 to 51 of said Law for three reasons. First, in 1999, those provisions did not form part of Law No. 7020 as they were added thereto by Law No. 7133 in 2001 (Law 7133/2001). Second, as stated by the passage of ENREJA Resolution No. 240 cited above, the \"infractions\" of Law No. 7020 incorporated in 2001 *\"put aside\"* the agreement and regulations, including resolutions issued by the Regulatory Agency, and \"Licensee's obligations\" of ENJASA were subject to a double condition of being \"legal obligations\" and \"contractual obligations\". Lastly, the sanctions under Article 5 of the \"license agreement\" concern only the sanctions of Article 13 of Law No. 7020 for violations or breaches of \"obligations of a Licensee\" both because the text says so and because in 1999 said Article 13 was the only article on sanctions under Law No. 7020, since the current Article 41 had not yet been incorporated into the Law.\n\n145.\n\nArticle 31 of Title II of Law No. 7020 creates the Games of Chance Regulatory Agency (ENREJA) of the Province of Salta\u2013as an \"Autarchic Entity\" of the Government\u2013which is \"vested under the terms of this law with the necessary and sufficient powers to regulate Games of Chance in all their forms.\" The categories of powers of the Agency are listed in Article 32, the most relevant of which in these proceedings is the one mentioned in paragraph (d) of said Article, namely:\n\n\"(d) Exercise police powers in all matters related to the management and operation of games of chance, in order to ensure strict compliance with the law, issuing any and all regulations required to this end and imposing any applicable sanctions.\"\n\nLastly, in furtherance of achieving its goals, the Agency is vested with the following powers pursuant to Article 33 of Law No. 7020: (a) regulatory; (b) administrative-jurisdictional; and (c) disciplinary.\n\n146.\n\nThese powers of ENREJA granted thereupon by Law No. 7020 are unquestionable and have not been challenged by Claimants. Claimants do allege\u2013as previously done by ENJASA in Salta\u2013 that the exercise by ENREJA of these powers in August 2013 in connexion with the revocation of the thirty-year exclusive license granted to ENJASA in 1999 by the Provincial Executive when it created the company as an Argentine company that was shortly thereafter privatized.\n\n147.\n\nLater on, additional powers to those under Law No. 7020 where granted to ENREJA, as confirmed by the documentation submitted by the Parties to the Tribunal. For example, Decree No. 5313 of 25 November 2008 whereby the Governor of the Province of Salta, after recalling *inter alia* that the ENREJA is an autarchic entity, mandates that the Regulatory Agency \"shall be responsible for controlling, supervising and auditing, and shall take all necessary action to follow up and collect the (new) fee payable by ENJASA to the Provincial State for the license to operate games of chance on an exclusive basis\" [Translated by me]. This decision was because the Memorandum of Understanding executed on 7 May 2008 between UNIREN and ENJASA changed the method for calculating the annual fee payable by the company to the Province for such license. In effect, the Memorandum of Understanding replaced the initial fee with a new one based on a percentage of ENJASA's income for the immediately preceding period, wherefore a strict control of the basis of calculation of those percentages was required, since then the amount of fee to be paid by the company depended as from that time on ENJASA's income.\n\n148.\n\nIn accordance with Articles 34 to 36 of Law No. 7020, ENREJA is ran and managed by a Board of Directors consisting of three members appointed by the Provincial Executive for a term of three years, with a possibility of being reappointed. The Directors of such Board act on an exclusive basis and are subject to the same disqualifications and incompatibilities as the judges for the Province. The Board is therefore a collegiate body that elects a President and a Vice-President. It meets whenever called upon by the President (at least, once a month),and takes decisions with a majority vote of the members present. Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and No. 7315/13 were unanimously adopted and are not accompanied with the individual opinion of any of its three members.\n\n149.\n\nArticle 38 of Law No. 7020 stipulates that the Board of Directors of ENREJA shall \"[e]xercise all the powers and competences vested in the Agency in the Regulatory Framework applicable to Games of Chance\" and provides a detailed list of its roles, the most relevant of which to these proceedings are: (i) to apply the legal and regulatory provisions on games of chance in the Province and enforce them through the respective Police Power; (ii) to issue any regulations required to achieve its goals and exercise its powers; (iii) to perform audits and further control techniques in order to determine compliance with contractual obligations of licensees; and (iv) to prepare an Annual Report and Balance Sheet and report the results to the Provincial Executive on an annual basis.\n\n150.\n\nENREJA Resolution No. 240/13 confirms that \"sections 34 and subsequent provisions of Law No. 7020 set the plural nature of the Regulatory Entity and how its decisions must be validly adopted\" and, on this basis, rejects the argument alleged by ENJASA on the existence of an oral authorization in relation to the obligation not to hire operators absent the Enforcement Authority's authorization under the first paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, in the following terms:\n\n\"Whereas, the argument made with respect to an alleged verbal authorization is neither justified. Ignoring its inexistence and the absence of any evidence in this regard, it is not possible to understand it as a tacit authorization to the behaviors performed by the officers of the Controlling Authority, since such behaviors are carried out under the general tasks assigned to lower ranking officers for the performance of acts preliminary to the analysis of the petition and the rendering of the resolution, even less to consider this alleged 'verbal' authorization as an administrative act. This is so because such assertion is contrary to the manner expressly set out in Article 37 and, especially, Article 39, by the Administrative Procedural Law of Salta, which provides that the acts shall be documented in writing and, at the collegiate bodies, through the record of minutes of each meeting. In this regard, sections 34 and subsequent provisions of Law No. 7020 set the plural nature of the Regulatory Entity and how its decisions must be validly adopted.\" (Page 5 of Resolution 240/13)\n\n151.\n\nIn this arbitration, Claimants have also often implied the argument on ENJASA's oral authorization in Salta for the same purpose, which I reject on account of Resolution No. 240. Besides, under Article 38(L) of Law No. 7020, the ENREJA's Board of Directors is the collegiate body vested with all powers and competencies granted to the Agency within the Regulatory Framework of Games of Chance in the Province of Salta and, moreover, the text of the first paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 (\"\u2026 *shall not hire operators without the authorization of the Enforcement Authority*\") admits no exception to the requirement of prior authorization thereunder.\n\n152.\n\nIt should also be recalled that ENREJA, as the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority, is unquestionably empowered to sanction any violation or breach of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by a licensee through, *inter alia*, revocation of the license in pursuance of Article 13 of said Law, but it has no authority to grant new licenses since, under Article 4 of said Law, the power to grant licenses and to determine their terms and duration is vested in the Provincial Executive. Therefore, understandably, once ENJASA's license was revoked by Resolution No. 240/13, ENREJA's Board of Directors reported the revocation to the Provincial Executive. Claimants' argument in that regard is thus inapposite in light of applicable texts.\n\n153.\n\nTo conclude, the revocation of ENJASA's license was adopted by ENREJA's Board of Directors in the exercise of its powers and functions\u2013within the Regulatory Framework of Games of Chance in the Province of Salta\u2013as a sanction against ENJASA for serious and repeated violations of its obligations to prevent money laundering, listed in Article 5 of said Law, perfectly known to and accepted by Claimants when they freely decided to invest as shareholders in ENJASA through a UTA upon privatization. As stated by ENREJA Resolution No. 315/13:\n\n\"\u2026 the gaming regulatory framework existed before the privatization of shares of EN.JA.S.A, and before the creation thereof, so investors knew in advance the exploitation rules.\" (Page 12 of the Resolution)\n\nMoreover, it should be noted that Claimants were majority shareholders and directly ran and managed the company when most violations and breaches of Article 5 of the Law were committed by said company, which led to revocation of the ENJASA's License.\n\n154.\n\nDescribing such sanction, as Claimants do, as \"indirect expropriation\" and, on that basis, seeking compensation for a repeated business behavior sanctioned by the Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020 for violating said Law and also the provisions of the License agreement at issue, finds no support in any of the three sources that constitute the \"applicable law\" to this dispute, as defined in Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT. Accordingly, such description is inappropriate and against the legal certainty on which the relationship between a host State and a foreign private investor, always bound by the principle of good faith, rests.\n\n**(vii) The Final Nature of ENREJA's Revocation Sanction and Considerations and Conclusions of Resolution No. 240 on the Violations or Breaches by ENJASA of Article 5 of Law No. 7020**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Notice of ENREJA's Resolution No. 315 of 19 November 2013 which rejects the recourse for reconsideration of Resolution No. 240 informed ENJASA, pursuant to provincial procedural Law No. 5348, that the decision was final and conclusive, but that the contentious-administrative proceedings could be instituted within thirty days of the notice. ENJASA resorted to any such means, instituting contentious-administrative proceedings before the Province of Salta competent court requesting the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions No. 240 and No. 315.\n\n156.\n\nSubsequently and without waiting for the conclusion of any such contentious-administrative proceedings in Salta, CAI and CASAG, in their capacity as Austrian investors filed before the ICSID a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic invoking in such regard the Argentina-Austria BIT and asserting that the proceedings in the Province of Salta with reference to the revocation of ENJASA's license by ENREJA was tantamount to a violation by the Argentine Republic of certain standards of the aforementioned BIT and requesting a reparation by means of an economic compensation for the injury arising from the alleged violation.\n\n157.\n\nThus, over a certain period of time there were two simultaneous proceedings regarding the same event but with different *parties, cause of action and petitum;* therefore, there were, as a result, two disputes, one in Salta on the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315 for the revocation of ENJASA's license and another one before the ICSID on the alleged violation by the Argentine Republic of certain provisions of the aforementioned BIT; in Salta with ENJASA in its capacity as claimant and before the ICSID with CAI and CASAG (ENJASA's shareholders) as Claimants. This situation could not be sustained for long as it was contrary to the provisions set forth at the second sentence of Article 8 (4) (paragraph 4, second sentence) of the BIT, and, in addition, it defied any logic since, on the one hand, the annulment of the revocation of ENJASA's license was being pursued and, on the other, an economic compensation for the effects of any such revocation was being requested.\n\n158.\n\nThis Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction put an end to the situation described hereinabove when mandating Claimants to withdraw from the contentious-administrative proceedings instituted in Salta. Claimants did so through a request for withdrawal which, once consented by Respondent, was granted by the competent court in contentious-administrative matters for the Province of Salta.\n\n159.\n\nAs a consequence of any such withdrawal, the dispute between ENJASA and the Province of Salta has extinguished and the ENREJA's administrative act revoking the license ENJASA had has become final in domestic system of the Argentine Republic. This supervening fact cannot be disregarded or set aside since - as already mentioned hereinabove\u2014Argentine law is one of the components of the \"law applicable\" to this ICSID arbitration proceedings pursuant to the provisions set forth under Article 8 (6) of Argentina-Austria BIT. Since the aforementioned withdrawal, the revocation of ENJASA's license is a final administrative act and, certainly, not subject to appeal before this Arbitral Tribunal this which is without jurisdiction to intervene in a contract claim dispute like the one that took place in Salta between ENJASA and the Province of Salta.\n\n160.\n\nClaimants' implausible proposition that this Tribunal exclude from the \"law applicable\" to this dispute the law of the Argentine Republic, Respondent to this arbitration, is an utterly unacceptable proposition as it is contrary to the provisions agreed upon by Argentina and Austria in their BIT. And, in addition, because ICSID arbitrators' duty is applying to the dispute resolution the \"applicable law\" as defined by the relevant BIT and not substituting the Contracting States' common intention articulated in the text of the BIT at issue. The ICSID Convention does not know the arbitrator-legislator figure. Besides, Claimants cannot invoke a BIT to institute ICSID arbitration proceedings and immediately thereafter ignore the BIT provisions that make them uncomfortable. BITs are not an *a la carte* menu.\n\n161.\n\nArticle 5 of Law No. 7020 is one of the five General Provisions of the Chapter I of Title I (Regulatory Framework Applicable to Games of Chance) thereof. This preponderant place in the Law provisions it formulates, relating, *inter alia,* to prevention of money of the laundering\u2014an aspect underscored by ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 - shows the importance ascribed by the Provincial Legislator to any such provisions within the framework of an activity favorable to the commission of this kind of crimes, an activity that in Salta, it is worth recalling, is a public function of provincial jurisdiction the exploitation of which is carried out through licenses granted by the Provincial Executive which is the one that *determines the terms and the periods of time of the licenses* (Article 4 of Law No. 7020). And this happened with the exclusive license granted to ENJASA for a thirty-year term. Among the terms of the license - to which ENJASA was subject in its capacity as Licensee - there appeared, accordingly, the obligations formulated in Article 5 of the Law the text of which reads as follows:\n\n\"The licensee shall act in accordance with the provisions of this law and shall be responsible for selecting and using the operation and maintenance methods necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this law, and shall not hire operators without the authorization of the Enforcement Authority, which shall establish the requirements and conditions to be met by each operator.\n\nThe licensee shall appoint an individual responsible for anti-money laundering issues, who shall be in charge of:\n\na) Centralizing all the information about clients, any transactions that may be known to, or suspected by, him or her, or which give him or her reason to suspect;\n\nb) Reporting all transactions made by the same person that are not consistent with that person's reported activities; and\n\nc) Demanding presentation of a valid ID card or passport by any client in whose favor a check is drawn or a wire transfer is made to a foreign account in an amount exceeding ten thousand Argentine Pesos (ARS 10,000.00).\"\n\nENJASA was sanctioned by the ENREJA for violations or breaches of the obligations formulated both in the first and second paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020.\n\n162.\n\nAs regards the obligation not to hire operators without the authorization of the Enforcement Authority contained at the first paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, namely, file (282-040/08), ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 analyzes the relationship and/or existing contracts with Emsenor, Navarrete, Colloricchio, New Star, Norberto Herrera, Video Dome and Prodec and Dek with ENJASA pointing out, *inter alia,* that the latter had not denied or questioned the validity of the instruments underlying the charges attributed thereto, that it had barely produced exculpatory evidence, that submissions thereof on the situation had been rather unclear, when not contradictory, and that the alleged oral or tacit authorizations for the junior staff's behaviors did not constitute ENREJA's Board of Directors' authorizations.\n\n163.\n\nIn this regard, the Resolution reasserts that being gaming, an administrative activity carried out within the ambit of the State, \"can only be exploited by private parties in the manners prescribed by law, which does not provide for ENREJA\u2014not to mention its personnel\u2014granting licenses, let alone in an oral manner.\" (page 6 of the Resolution.) Granting of licenses in Salta belongs exclusively to the Provincial Executive.\n\n164.\n\nFor Resolution No. 240, the issue to be decided regarding the obligation set forth at the first paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 was limited to determining whether ENJASA requested and had the Enforcement Authority's authorization to hire game Operators as requested by Article 5 of Law No. 7020, in the corse of the handling of certain files by the Regulatory Agency \"certain documents\u2014unknown to ENREJA until then\u2014came up and reports were issued which showed that certain persons alien to ENJASA had an active participation in the gaming activity in the Province of Salta\" (page 6 of the Resolution.) (In the references of quotations of Resolutions 240 and 315 of this Section the number of the pages correspond to the number of pages in the original Spanish text of the said Resolutions).\n\n165.\n\nResolution No. 240 states that far from having conducted a *\"reorganization\"* as alleged by Licensee, the Enforcement Authority had no doubt whatsoever that \"ENJASA incorporated Game Operators\u2014mainly with respect to slot machines and live games\u2014 which were hired by it without ENREJA's authorization\" and that \"regardless of the definition to be ascribed to the term \"game operator,\" there can be no doubt that EMSENOR S.R.L., Enzo Colloricchio, Video Drome S.A., Sixto Rafael Navarrete, Prodec S.A., Dek S.A., and Newstar S.R. L. acted in such condition, given their direct participation in gaming houses and activities in the Province of Salta. However, they are presented to ENREJA under the guise of ENJASA's license\" (page 9 y 10 of the Resolution.)\n\n166.\n\nResolution No. 240 also dismisses the fact that these operators had anything to do with the *\"preexisting\"* permits granted at the time by the extinct *Banco de Pr\u00e9stamos y Asistencia Social* (page 10) and it considers irrelevant whether or not there was a 'delegation of powers' on the part of ENJASA in favor of such third parties given that the crux of the question was the irregular hiring of an Operator \"in blatant violation of anti-money laundering regulations\", concluding as follows:\n\n\"Taking into account the foregoing considerations, it has been shown that ENJASA did not commence the formalities for obtaining the permit\u2014let alone for obtaining the relevant authorization \u2014whereby the Games of Chance Regulatory Agency would have allowed ENJASA to hire the above-mentioned operators\u2014upon a prior review of their background and the establishment of certain conditions\u2014as mandated by Article 5 of Law No. 7020, as amended. Quite on the contrary, ENJASA only sought to justify the execution of such contracts. Nor did ENJASA explain the reason why it excluded from its annual and monthly sworn statements the revenues obtained from some of such gaming houses\u2026 The seriousness of such breach will be assessed below in light of the particular significance attributed by the lawmaker to the compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 5 of Law No. 7020.\"\n\n(page 11 of Resolution No. 240.)\n\n167.\n\nWith respect to the violations or breaches by ENJASA of the obligations set forth at the second paragraph of Article 5 of Law No.7020, Resolution No. 240 substantiated the charges brought in two files: File (282-215/11) and File (282-302/12). The purpose of the first of those files were charges brought against ENJASA regarding payments exceeding ARS 10,000 with no record or compliance with anti-money laundering rules which had been detected in live or table games at the Golden Dreams and Salta casinos. In turn, the second file sought to elucidate, on the one hand, the expired payment made to a certain customer and, on the other, the failure to record two payments exceeding ARS 10,000 corresponding to evening T\u00f3mbola raffles.\n\n168.\n\nAs regards File (282-215/11), Resolution No. 240 rejects ENJASA's statute of limitations defense, and it explains that unlike the case of slot machines (online system,) in live games there is no control system of the financial transactions, and it is, thus, necessary to collect evidence that accounts for payments made to gamblers on account of prizes obtained in the above-mentioned gaming houses and live-games tables operating therein (poker, roulette, etc.) \"Thus, the controls of the revenues and expenses for the purposes of the calculation of the license fee and the audit fee are conducted on the basis of monthly and annual sworn statements submitted by ENJASA and on-site and manual audit processes carried out by the different areas of ENREJA\" (page 15 of the Resolution.)\n\n169.\n\nThe Resolution also explains that it was necessary to cross the information of the payments to gamblers of ENJASA's sheets and internal records *Daily Reports, Relevant Payments or Rating Cards Forms)* with the data of the audit area of the Regulatory Agency, and the financial transactions detected were consistent with the monthly sworn statements submitted by ENJASA. The reports prepared on the basis of the above-mentioned documents show that, \"only in the period audited (August 2008), at least 52 payments of more than ARS 10,000 were made to customers (involving an aggregate movement in that month of ARS 943,780.00) on account of prizes won at the live-game tables, for which the registration duties provided for by Law No. 7020 as amended, and Resolution No. 026/00 were not complied with\" (Resolution No. 240, pages 13 and14.)\n\n170.\n\nResolution No. 240 also mentions witness statements by the staff in charge of the gaming tables which stated the following: (i) that amounts exceeding ARS 10,000 were clearly paid; (ii) that the beneficiaries' identifications were inaccurate; (iii) that cash movements involved in this type of game of chance confirmed those witness statements; and (iv) that in some months, monthly prizes were paid in an aggregate amount for January/September of ARS 57,837.542 (as per ENJASA's monthly sworn statement for Golden Dreams Casino.) There was also, according to the Resolution, conclusive evidence (images obtained from ENJASA's recording system acknowledged by witnesses) of prizes above ARS 10,000 paid in cash that were not identified as required by anti-money laundering regulations.\n\n171.\n\nWith respect to the cases of File (282/215/11), Resolution No. 240 concludes that ENJASA did not show it made the relevant payments by check or that it recorded them in either of the two anti-money laundering books kept for such purposes. Given that the data examined revealed that the last entry of a relevant payment, *i.e.*, above ARS 10,000, was made on 10 December 2009 in the case of Salta casino and on 9 October 2011 in the case of Golden Dreams casino, and that:\n\n\"Consequently, ENJASA has been unable to rebut the fact that Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and Articles 1 and 2 of Resolution No. 026/00 were infringed. Proof of this is the fact that ENJASA failed to show in its defense brief that such payments were recorded in the anti-money laundering book or that it made the relevant payments by check as mandated by Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and its implementing regulation, contained in Resolution No. 026/00.\" (page 16 of Resolution No. 240.)\n\n172.\n\nAs regards File (282-302/12), the charges were three: (i) the case of payment of an expired prize of an amount above ARS 10,000; (ii) the failure to register payment corresponding to evening T\u00f3mbola raffle for an amount of ARS 12,000; and (iii) the failure to register a second payment corresponding to another evening T\u00f3mbola raffle for an amount of ARS 15,000.00. In general, Resolution No. 240 mentions (i) that ENJASA had acknowledged the facts; (ii) that ENJASA's defense arguments in such respect are confusing and contradictory (pages 16, 17 and 18 of the Resolution.)\n\n173.\n\nWith respect to the first charge, the Resolution underlines that ENJASA had admitted the facts in their entirety \"*i.e.*, that the above payment was made after it had expired and that it was belatedly recorded one month later, that the failure to record the payment was caused by the fact that the branch did not have an anti-money laundering book, and that the system operated by it failed\" and the Resolution considers that the explanations provided with respect to the system failures are inacceptable, as they are unclear and based on internal procedures unrelated to ENJASA's relationship with the ENREJA (Resolution, pages 18/19.) Having rejected the grounds for justifications provided by ENJASA, the Resolution considers that the entry of the payment at issue, one month and five days following the prize expiry date, resulted suspicious not only because it related to an improper (expired) payment\u2014this being an unprecedented course of conduct on the part of ENJASA, but also because:\n\n\"\u2026such belated registration leads to a presumption that the entry is bogus. This is so given that T\u00f3mbola tickets are bearer instruments\u2026 therefore, it is not possible to identify the holder unless the payment is registered when it is made. If the payment is registered one month later, it is impossible to verify such entry\" (pages 19/20 of the Resolution.)\n\n174.\n\nAs regards the two payments of T\u00f3mbola raffle prizes, Resolution No. 240 explains that they were detected by means of the software used for real-time online gambling capture and the determination of the winners of the T\u00f3mbola lottery game (a system approved by ENREJA's Resolution No. 078/98). Payment of the ARS 12,000 prize was not recorded in the Book kept for such purposes and as concerns the payment of ARS 15,000 the manual corrections that ENJASA might have made could not be invoked because they were never reported to the Regulatory Agency (page 19 of the Resolution).\n\n175.\n\nAt the end of its consideration of File (282-302/12) as a whole, the Resolution concludes that there were three payments made to winners for prizes above ARS 10,000, which were not recorded or paid as mandated by law and that, consequently, ENJASA's explanation had been fruitless once again. ENJASA had failed to reasonably justify:\n\n\"the reasons why it breached the provisions contained in Article 5(2) of Law No. 7020, pursuant to which ENJASA was to register payments above ARS 10,000 in the manner provided for in Resolution No. 026/00, in force at the time. Similarly, ENJASA's references to mistakes are also unavailing, as their seriousness exceeds what might logically be tolerated as a mistake, as such mistakes appeared repeatedly and adversely affect essential aspects of gaming\" (page 21 of the Resolution.)\n\n176.\n\nENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13 explicitly states in sections XII and XIII thereof (pages 30-33 of the Resolution) that revocation of the license was adopted by the Enforcement Authority as sanction pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 13 (e) *in fine* of Law No. 7020, as amended by Law No. 7133. Article 13, entitled \"Breaches,\" enumerates from lesser to more serious the sanctions applied by any such Authority to violations or breaches of Law No. 7020, *inter alia,* its Article 5, its regulatory provisions, the License Agreement and the rules and regulations issued by the Regulatory Agency. Resolution No. 240 also distinguishes, as already explained *supra* herein, those sanctions from those explicitly stated in Article 41 *et seq*. of Law No. 7020 in the event of \"Administrative Infractions.\" Nevertheless, in its recourse for reconsideration, ENJASA alleged that the breaches attributed thereto \"were mere infractions which were not relevant and did not have significant practical impact on the business operated by the company.\" Resolution No. 315/13 responds to this allegation by the company pointing out as follows:\n\n\"This argument confirms the little regard paid by ENJASA to provincial money laundering laws throughout these years. Additionally, the successive administrative enquiries are clear evidence that the facts occurred and that licensee received gradual warnings and sanctions. By means of Resolutions Nos. 031/08, 032/08, 232/08, 106/10, once a warning that no further infringing behaviour was to be tolerated, and in Resolution No. 104/10, the State informed the licensee of the fact that compliance with the obligations rigorously described in Law No. 7020, Article 5 and implementing regulations, was a matter of the utmost importance\" (pages 20 of Resolution No. 315/13.)\n\n177.\n\nIn these arbitral proceedings, Claimants, with the assistance of some of their experts, have attempted, as ENJASA did in Salta, to create certain interpretative uncertainty about the respective scope of application of the aforementioned Articles 13 and 41 of Law No. 7020 to which neither the terminology nor the text of certain excerpts of the majority Award which, in my opinion, are inapposite and with which, in any event, I absolutely disagree because of their erratic nature. Anyways, what it is worth recalling is that there is no possible doubt whatsoever that for ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 ENJASA's conducts constituted serious and repeated violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and, accordingly, the Enforcement Authority sanctioned them with the most serious sanction listed in Article 13 of Law No. 7020, *i.e.*, with the revocation of the License ENJASA had at the time.\n\n178.\n\nSanctions for the \"administrative infractions\" contained in Article 41 of Law No. 7020 are alien to the violations or breaches of the obligations formulated in Article 5 of the Law for which ENJASA was sanctioned. As are also, for similar reasons, the provisions on the statute of limitations of Article 49 of Law No. 7020 regarding which Resolution No. 240 comments as follows:\n\n\"However, taking into account the chapter where Article 49 is included, it is evident that it is not applicable to the cases at hand, and it only applies to the infractions contained in Article 40 (this interpretation being in line with its restrictive nature), rather than to the breaches contemplated in Article 5 of the above-mentioned law\" (page 22 of Resolution No. 240.)\n\nAnd, the Resolution adds that the limitations period applicable to any such breaches is governed by Article 59 *et seq.* of the Criminal Code, thus, the applicable term would be of five years as long as such infractions are not tolled by recurrences or by the filing of an administrative enquiry *(ibid*.)\n\n179.\n\nAs any sanction measure, the revocation of the license given its very nature sought to inflict sanctions (the term used in Article 5.1 of the License agreement) to ENJASA for having breached or violated obligations concerning the company under Law No. 7020; as well as those of the license agreement. A sanction measure cannot by definition be neutral in its effects given that what is being sought is punishing the perpetrator for the breach or violation of a legal obligation or obligations under the responsibility thereof for the purpose of reestablishing the integrity of the rule or rules breached or violated.\n\n180.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the so called \"*sole effects*\" theory is, as already stated, not applicable in the instant case, since any sanction has by definition an adverse effect for the party being sanctioned and, eventually, for anyone that has invested in the party being sanctioned or has somehow partnered therewith, notwithstanding the fact that any such theory can conform to law in other contexts or in different circumstances. Accordingly, the invocation in the case at issue of decisions by arbitral tribunals that have applied the so called *\"sole effects\"* theory, to scopes alien to those of sanctions, are irrelevant as a guide for this dispute resolution.\n\n181.\n\nTherefore, when the measures adopted are sanctions imposed by the competent Enforcement Authority to a Licensee for the violation or breach of one or more of the obligations the latter is subject to, the *\"sole effects\"* theory is unacceptable for being absurd, since it would imply admitting the existence in the relevant legal system of a duty to reward social actors for the breach of their obligations. There is no domestic or international legal system in which an oxymoron of such magnitude can have a place. In any event, there is no such duty in any of the sources of law applicable hereto under Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n182.\n\nThe introduction of the above-mentioned theory in the scope of sanctions would be tantamount to denying the power any State has to sanction violations or breaches of the laws thereof with the resulting legal uncertainty, since the exercise of any such power responds to evident social and administrative needs as recalled by Resolution No. 240 in the following excerpt in which ENREJA's conviction is expressed:\n\n\"\u2026 that the logical consequence of the public administration's right to \"control\" is its right to \"sanction\"\u2014as it is not sufficient to vest in the administration the authority to prove the breaches committed by a contractor\u2014such disciplinary power finds its foundation in the need for the administration to be vested with the authority to demand that the concessionaire provide the service as required by law\" (page 32 of the Resolution.)\n\n183.\n\nIt is understandable that Claimants in this arbitration have attempted, as ENJASA did in Salta, to hide, deny, diminish, conceal, or sidestep the power reserved to the Executive Branch of the Government of Salta by the License's agreement to declare the extinction or caducity of the License Agreement, *grounds* that determined the revocation of the license ENJASA had. For instance, the already mentioned \"political conspiracy\" theory (described as \"fallacious\" at Resolution No. 315, page 3) or that of the \"xenophobia against Austrians\" also alleged with no evidence production whatsoever, and others such as \"ENJASA's defenselessness\" or that of \"disproportion of the sanction\" [Translated by me.] Against this background, it is worth recalling the so called \"UNIREN's *oblivion* or *pardon* theory\" with which Claimants have attempted to undermine the consequences which, in determining the degree of the sanction imposed by the ENREJA, ENJASA's recidivism or repetition in the commission of proven violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 has had, despite ENJASA's having been priorly warned in such regard by the ENREJA duly in advance.\n\n184.\n\nThe \"UNIREN's *oblivion* or *pardon* theory\" has been expressly rejected by both ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 (page 31) and Resolution No. 315 (page 3.) Nevertheless, it has been alleged once again by Claimants in these arbitral proceedings. It is thus worth quoting the excerpt of Resolution No. 315 in which ENREJA rejects the argument that the State would have accepted or acknowledged in the Memorandum of Understanding the nonexistence of any \"legal breach\" by ENJASA:\n\n\"As explained in Resolution No. 240/13, it is inaccurate that Article Two of the Agreement entered into by licensee and UNIREN, approved by Decree No. 3428/08, has included a generalized 'oblivion' or 'pardon.' Clearly and with no hesitation, the article at stake refers to the duties undertaken by licensee on a contractual basis (more specifically, to the duty to make tourism-related investments undertaken together with the proposal to acquire shares that were subsequently awarded to licensee). Such article did not apply and would never apply to any legal breach\" (page 3 of Resolution No. 315.)\n\n185.\n\nIt is worth underscoring that the decree approving the Memorandum of Understanding of 7 May 2008 is subsequent to several ENREJA's Resolutions sanctioning ENJASA for violations or breaches of anti-laundering rules following such date.\n\n186.\n\nLastly, it shall also be borne in mind, that the revocation of ENJASA's License by ENREJA's sanction shall not be confused with the power - reserved to the Executive Branch of the Province of Salta by the license agreement - to declare the termination and/or expiration of the license *automatically and by operation of law,* on one or any of the six grounds set forth in Article 6 of the License Agreement annexed to Decree No. 3616/99. This is also expressly recognized by Resolution No. 240 when stating that the above-mentioned power could only be exercised by that which granted the license, *i.e.* the Executive Branch of the Province of Salta (page 31 of the Resolution,) even though it admits that an unscrupulous conduct with respect to anti-money laundering rules could have resulted in a request by ENREJA to the Executive Branch to declare the expiration of the license pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 5 of the license agreement (page 29 of the Resolution).\n\n187.\n\nIt is, thus, worth recalling that three out of the six grounds for termination or expiration of the License Agreement ENJASA had, listed in Article 6 are the following: (i) failure to comply with the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Law No. 7020; (ii) operation of any games of chance without the previous consent of ENREJA; and (iii) total or partial assignment or transfer of the powers granted under this license without previous consent of the Provincial Executive Branch. In light of these grounds, it is evident that the violations or breaches by ENJASA of the \"legal obligations\" imposed thereon by Article 5 of Law No. 7020 confirmed by ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 also constituted many other violations or breaches of the relevant \"contractual obligations\" of ENJASA's license agreement, which, as such, undoubtedly enabled the Provincial Executive Brach to declare the termination of such license agreement by operation of law.\n\n188.\n\nThe above-mentioned grounds are undoubtedly part of the context in which some other allegations and arguments by Claimants, such as that of \"political conspiracy\" or ENJASA's alleged \"defenselessness\" in the administrative proceedings pursued in the three administrative enquiries resolved by Resolution No. 240, despite the fact that the company could and did exercise at each stage of such proceedings its right of defense, of submitting an administrative request for reconsideration of Resolution No. 240 and of instituting before the courts of Salta contentious-administrative proceedings requesting the annulment of Resolutions No. 240 and 315, shall be weighed. And all this happened when, according to the terms of the License Agreement, the Provincial Executive Branch of Salta could have declared the termination or expiration of the license automatically and by operation of law through a decision or decree. The \"political conspiracy\" and/or \"defenselessness\" allegations lack all credibility in face of this evident possibility of Salta authorities.\n\n189.\n\nThe existence of the above-mentioned grounds for termination or expiration of the license agreement underscores the legal relevance that strict compliance by Licensee with each and every obligation listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 had for the conservation of the License, relevance expressly confirmed at the License Agreement and at Resolution No. 240 itself. Furthermore - as this Resolution declares - \"if the violation of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 constitutes express grounds for the automatic expiration... (of the license agreement), this is all the more so grounds for revocation of the license, as a sanction to be imposed by the Regulatory Agency...\" (page 32 of Resolution No. 240.)\n\n**(viii) Claimants Have Failed to Establish their Allegations Exempting ENJASA from Liability for its Violations or Breaches of the Obligations to Prevent Money Laundering under Article 5 of Law No. 7020**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nClaimants to these ICSID proceedings have attempted to mitigate or even disregard the effects of the repeated violations or breaches of the provisions on money laundering prevention under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by ENJASA, as confirmed by ENREJA Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315 which, as stated before, have become final under Argentine law, one of the three sources of applicable law in these proceedings pursuant to Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT. Moreover, they have frequently done so by means of arguments like those of ENJASA (already rejected by Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315), as if this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal was an appellate court in the proceedings initiated in Salta by the Regulatory Agency and the Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020. They have also ignored the finality of the decision to revoke ENJASA's License, as well as the scope of jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n191.\n\nHowever, Claimants have barely produced documentary evidence in support of their allegations and arguments in this dispute in order to mitigate or justify the violations or breaches of the obligations listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by ENJASA, which led to the revocation of the company's exclusive license by ENREJA. As regards the obligation stated in the *first paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020*, Claimants have attempted, like ENJASA in Salta, to ascribe an especially narrow sense to the term \"operators\", subjectively defined by them, rather than adopting its ordinary meaning of \"any person or mechanism that performs specific actions\", as translated from the definition of the *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola*. They have also sought to limit the scope of the expression \"hire operators\" to contracts for a specific purpose, whereas the provision's scope of application encompasses any contract with a third party. As explained at the hearing by Mr. Marcer, Respondent's legal expert, \"[a]n operator is the one [...] who has some kind of function according to license: license-holder\" and \"it's something that has to do with the definition by the administration [the Regulatory Agency].\" (Day 5, 196: 3-5, 8-9)\n\n192.\n\nCertainly, ENJASA had constantly failed to request authorization to the Regulatory Agency, not only in relation to the recruitment of third parties but also in relation to many other matters subject to authorization, as established in Resolutions Nos. 15/05, 244/08, 286/09, 39/10, 210/10, and 161/13. Resolution No. 240 specifies that said authorizations should be issued by the Regulatory Agency by means of an \"administrative act\", including oral or implied authorizations, and that \"silence per se is just an administrative inexpressive behavior\" (pages 5/6 of the Resolution.) In any case, most of the sanctions imposed by ENREJA upon ENJASA were for the latter's failure to request proper authorization it was bound to request. This is baffling since paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 1 of the ENJASA's License were perfectly clear in that regard:\n\n\"1.1. The object of the license is to authorize the operation of games of chance in the provincial territory *with the scope and limitations set forth herein* and to authorize the operation of games of chance in such other jurisdictions that have subscribed the pertaining multilateral conventions from time to time.\n\n1.2. The authorization entails the management, marketing and operation of games of chance belonging to the jurisdiction of the province on an exclusive basis, except for bingos and raffles operated by public and not-for-profit entities at their own risk *performed with prior authorization by the Games of Chance Regulatory Agency*.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n193.\n\nClaimants have also alleged that the third parties hired by ENJASA were, in whole or in part, individuals with permits granted by the old *Banco de Pr\u00e9stamos y Asistencia Social (BPAS)*, when such permits\u2014always precarious\u2014expired upon transfer of their shares to ENJASA, in its new corporate structure following privatization, as clearly indicated in the \"Notes to the Financial Statements\" for 2001 and 2007 (CEMA-26) by Mr. Anselmi, general manager of ENJASA. These Notes were timely submitted by the company to ENREJA, and their contents were validated by Mr. Anselmi himself on Day 2 of the hearing. Both Notes are identical, and their contents read as follows:\n\n\"The transfer contract of shares class A mentioned above was approved by Decree 419/00 of the Executive Branch of the Province of Salta, dated 15th February 2000. From then on, ENJASA, in this new model of company, starts to operate games of chance in the jurisdiction of the province. Up until then, this was under the responsibility of the ex-BPAS. According to Article 12 of Decree 2126/98 of the Executive Branch of the Province of Salta, at the time of the transfer of the share covenant, any kind of relation and obligation is extinguished, whichever the state of execution, and also any kind of debt and credit and labor obligations.\"\n\n194.\n\nIn view of the above, there is no doubt that ENJASA, as a privatized company and *exclusive* Licensee should have requested authorization to ENREJA to hire third parties, according to Article 5 (first paragraph) of Law No. 7020. However, Claimants have been unable to submit to the Arbitral Tribunal any single copy of a letter from ENJASA requesting proper authorization to ENREJA in relation to the third parties hired, as they should have done if ENJASA had complied with said obligation under Article 5 of the Law, which enshrines the general principle of Argentine law that a licensee or concessionaire under a public contract may not subcontract unless previously authorized by the relevant authorities, as explained by Expert Marcer on Day 5 of the hearing. ENJASA failed to do so either before the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN) in relation to the company's UTEs with Cachi Valle Aventuras and Video Drome, or afterwards, as there is no single piece of evidence to the contrary on the record. In other words, ENJASA failed to comply with the obligation under Article 5 (first paragraph) of Law No. 7020 and hence Claimants now are in no position to submit to this Arbitral Tribunal a single copy of a request for authorization by ENJASA, which in turn evinces that the company was in breach of said obligation during the period from privatization of the company in 2000 to revocation of the License in 2013.\n\n195.\n\nHowever, there is evidence on the record of the fact that during the negotiations of UNIREN one of the most controversial issues was precisely the situation of ENJASA's unauthorized UTEs with Cachi Valle Venturas and Video Drome, which contracts were seemingly already subject to administrative enquiry. In any case, following such negotiations, the Memorandum of Understanding stipulates: (i) to change the method for calculating the annual fee, (ii) to formally take note of the existence of the aforementioned unauthorized *UTE*s of ENJASA without imposing the relevant sanction on the company, while (iii) Licensee's obligation under Article 5 (first paragraph) of Law No. 7020 remains unchanged. However, ENJASA in Salta and Claimants to these proceedings seem to suggest that the Memorandum of Understanding evidences that the Administration had agreed that, *in most cases*, contracts executed with third parties without ENREJA's prior authorization would not violate anti-money laundering laws. This suggestion is legally impractical since the parties for both UNIREN and ENREJA involved in the negotiations of the Memorandum of Understanding had no power to modify or amend the regulatory framework of Law No. 7020 and, as a consequence, the obligation under Article 5 (first paragraph) thereof. In any case, Claimants have produced no evidence in support of such suggestion.\n\n196.\n\nThe *bona fide* consideration of the facts related to negotiations and the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding also confirm that there was no acquiescence from Salta's competent authorities, which Claimants now purport or suggest. The references in the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding to the two *UTE*s mentioned above concern ENJASA's UTEs with Video Drome and Cachi Valle Aventuras *only* (as declared on Day 3 of the hearing by witness G\u00f3mez Naar in his examination by Mrs. Etchegorry). However, ENJASA continued executing contracts with third parties without ENREJA's authorization\u2014as described in detail in the recitals of Resolution No. 240/13\u2014despite having been involved in the negotiations of the Memorandum of Understanding and further written warnings received from ENREJA. These contracts with third parties following the Memorandum of Understanding were one of the reasons why ENREJA sanctioned ENJASA with revocation of the license. Subcontracting by ENJASA had not been occasional but rather an actual pattern of behavior by then that disregarded a Licensee's legal and contractual obligations, which threatened the integrity of the powers and roles conferred by the legislator upon ENREJA in its dual capacity as both Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020.\n\n197.\n\nAs regards the obligations to record and the methods for payment of prizes exceeding ARS 10,000\u2014a provision stipulated in the second paragraph of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 (and regulated by ENREJA Resolution No. 26/00 dated 10 April 2000)\u2014the Regulatory Agency has construed and applied said provision on a uniform, consistent and repeated basis, considering that the object and purpose of the provision is to prevent money laundering. Both Resolution No. 26/00 and subsequent ENREJA resolutions related to this law, such as Resolutions Nos. 31/08 (C- ADD), 32/08 (C-151), 232/08 (C-155), 104/10 (C-152), 106/10 (C-156) and 161/10 (C-157), interpret the law in a similar way as Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13.\n\n198.\n\nClaimants to these proceedings cannot purport to have had their legitimate expectations about the interpretation and application of the aforementioned provision of Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020 frustrated by ENREJA's decisions, on account of the following proven facts: (i) ENJASA expressly acknowledged in writing in 2005 and beyond the scope of the obligation set forth in Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020, as interpreted and applied by ENREJA; (ii) ENJASA paid, prior to Resolution No. 240/13, the fines imposed by ENREJA as a sanction for violations or breaches of said obligation without objecting by means of any of the administrative remedies available; and (iii) it appears that ENJASA filed no contentious-administrative proceedings, prior to Resolution No. 240/13, with the courts for the Province of Salta against ENREJA's interpretation and application of the obligation under Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020, either globally or in respect of any of the specific sanctions successively imposed by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority upon ENJASA for the violations and breaches of said obligation by Licensee\n\n199.\n\nFor ENREJA, as explained in its resolutions, the provision of Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020 creates a *money laundering prevention system* which, for instance, Resolution No. 32/08 describes in the following terms:\n\n\"[T]hrough Law No. 7020, as amended, the legislator has introduced an antimoney laundering prevention system and, in this regard, the second part of Article 5 thereof provides for a number of obligations to be complied with by the licensee. The scheme adopted by the law for the purposes of antimoney laundering prevention contains two criteria for the registration of transactions, a quantitative one: payment of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 (by means of the identification of the beneficiary and payment by check, or in the case of foreigners, by wire transfer) and a qualitative one: suspicious transactions and those bearing no reasonable relationship between the individual and the performance of the activities declared\" (C-151) [Translated by me].\n\n200.\n\nTo facilitate the application of such system, ENREJA's resolutions have also provided that Licensee should designate a person responsible to accomplish the purpose of the system, as well as to keep an \"anti-money-laundering book\" in which the company should record the prize winner, the amount to be paid, and the methods of payment (check; wire transfer) of prizes exceeding ARS 10,000 (Resolution No. 26/00). Thus, the purpose of the book is not to record the prize as such, but rather the identification of the winner that receives the prize above ARS 10,000, as it is this record that allows following up the transaction and verifying whether there has been money laundering or not (Resolution No. 32/08). Keeping such \"anti-money laundering book\" is not therefore, within the scope of the system, a mere formality and its loss could entail a sanction, as was the case of ENJASA, based on the documentation before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n201.\n\nLicensee's specific obligations within the scope of the system established under Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020 have been stated on the basis of its object and purpose by ENREJA in exercise of its powers to issue regulatory operating rules \"in order to ensure strict compliance with the law, issuing any and all regulations required to this end and imposing any applicable sanctions\" (Articles 32 and 33 of Law No. 7020). These specific obligations were expressly admitted by ENJASA at least since 2005, as confirmed by the following citations of documents forwarded by the company's attorney-in-fact to ENREJA:\n\n(i) \"1. Anti-Money Laundering Law No. 7020 effectively provides that prizes in excess of ten thousand Argentine pesos must be paid by cheque once the person collecting the prize has been duly identified; ENJASA has always complied with this provision\" (Letter from ENJASA, 30 August 2005, signed by Mr. Petersen in his capacity as attorney-in-fact for the company) (RA-193);\n\n(ii) \"\u2026 the staff working in that sector did not inform ENJASA's authorities of [the] prizes paid in connection with the machines in question. We were thus prevented from acting as we do in similar situations with respect to the identification of the beneficiary and the method of payment pursuant to the anti-money laundering legislation and, while the party responsible before the Agency is ENJASA, for reasons beyond our control, we were not able to comply with the Agency's requirements.\" (Defense filed by ENJASA, signed by Mr. Petersen in his capacity as attorney-in-fact for the company, against ENREJA Resolution No. 70/10, March 2008) (RA-173)\n\n(iii) \"\u2026 the events occurred as clearly stated in our defence: the persons that paid the prizes were unaware of the requirements to be complied with for the payment of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000\u2026\"\n\n(Administrative recourse for reconsideration against ENREJA Resolution No. 104/10, filed by ENJASA and signed by Mr. Petersen in his capacity as attorney-in-fact for the company, 20 May 2010) (RA-165). Confirmed by Mr. Anselmi, general manager of ENJASA, on Day 2 of the hearing. This recourse for reconsideration is one of the very few recourses filed by ENJASA against resolutions issued by the Regulatory Agency to sanction its behavior before Resolution No. 240/20.\n\n202.\n\nEvidently, in light of these citations, ENJASA not only knew but also agreed to \u2013 and this is what matters here - the interpretation and application by the Regulatory Agency of the contents, scope and purpose of the master obligation under Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020. Therefore, some references or objections by Claimants to the principle of legality, statute of limitations or the difficulties in applying the qualitative criterion of the system in practice (treatment of the so-called \"suspicious transactions\") are not so significant for the administration of the evidence of the facts discussed in the context of this Opinion. As regards the principle of legality, in addition to Articles 32 and 33 of Law No. 7020 mentioned above, consideration should be given to the license agreement, in particular, Articles 4 (Obligations of the Licensee), 5 (Sanctions) and 6 (Events of Extinction and/or Cancellation), as well as the fact that all these provisions stem, in their interpretation and application, from \"administrative law\", which should not be confounded with \"criminal law\" for the purposes of the principle of legality.\n\n203.\n\nAs regards the reference to the statute of limitations, it is evident that the provision of Article 49 of Title II, Chapter IV (Administrative Infractions) of Law No. 7020 is not applicable to Article 5 of Title I, Chapter I (General Provisions) of such Law, as confirmed by ENREJA Resolution No. 240/13. Finally, with respect to the so-called \"suspicious transactions\", the *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola* defines \"suspicious customer\" as an \"individual whose behavior or background raises suspicion or mistrust\" [Translated by me]. Undoubtedly, transactions with suspicious customers require a considerable level of competence, professionalism and tact by the company's personnel in charge of handling them, but they do not seem to have been an excessive burden at all for a company with the dimensions, means and experience of ENJASA, in view of the explanations provided by Mr. Tucek, CAI CEO and member of ENJASA's Board of Directors, during his examination on those transactions, on Day 2 of the hearing, as well as the testimony of some former officers of the company that prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 were very rare. In any event, as explained by Mr. Kusa, Claimants' expert, at the hearing in 2018, the Supreme Court of the Argentine Republic ruled on the concept of \"suspicious transaction\" in a case filed against the UIF as follows: \"\u2026 that the principle was ambiguous but they [sic] didn't go against legality, and this subject must take all measures to examine when a transaction qualifies as suspicious.\" (Day 6, 37:19-38:3).\n\n204.\n\nMoreover, ENJASA was perfectly aware that the violations or breaches of the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of Article 5 of Law No. 7020\u2014that is, either provision on money laundering prevention\u2014were grounds for sanction by ENREJA pursuant to both such Law and the License Agreement. It is also undisputed that the applicable sanctions for violations or breaches of the provisions of both paragraphs of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 are those listed in Article 13 of said Law, which states as follows: \"Any violations or breaches of this law, its regulatory provisions, the License Agreement and the rules and regulations issued by the Agency shall be punishable by the Enforcement Authority.\" This introduction to Article 13 is enough to dismiss as reckless Claimants' attempt to turn the violations or breaches by ENJASA of the provisions of Article 5 on money laundering prevention into mere \"administrative infractions\" in order to challenge ENREJA's decision to revoke the license.\n\n205.\n\nThis Resolution aimed at revoking the License, issued by ENREJA, was adopted upon compliance with \"due process\", without any incident and in full observance of the right of defense of the party sanctioned for the company's violations or breaches of its obligations to prevent money laundering (first and second paragraphs of Article 5 of Law No. 7020). As regards violation of the obligation in the first paragraph (hiring operators without ENREJA's prior authorization), an administrative enquiry was filed by decision of the Regulatory Agency through Resolution No. 384/12, whereas with respect to the obligation in the second paragraph of said Article, it was through Resolutions Nos. 380/12 (failure to record lottery prizes in excess of ARS 10,000) and 381/12 (failure to record live game prizes in excess of ARS 10,000). Those were failures to record the identity of the winner of the prize, the prize itself or the method to pay the prize by check. Moreover, the activities of an individual who unlawfully lent money to customers inside the casinos' game halls were also called into question.\n\n206.\n\nIn its defense, ENJASA attempted to justify its behavior by means of several allegations and arguments, though without questioning, as a general rule, the facts attributed to it and thus accepting them as such. It was those generally accepted facts that ENREJA, in its conclusions, qualifies as violations or breaches by ENJASA of the provisions of the first or second paragraph, as appropriate, of Article 5 of the Law in the three administrative enquiries settled. Now, Claimants to this arbitration are not in a position to dispute those facts accepted by ENJASA or their qualification by ENREJA, as they withdrew the annulment proceedings filed with the courts for the Province of Salta against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13, and since then both Resolutions are final under Argentine law, which is an integral part of the \"applicable law\" in these proceedings pursuant to Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n207.\n\nThe revocation of the License by ENREJA through Resolution No. 240, confirmed by Resolution No. 315/13, cannot be deemed baffling, as purported by Claimants, for two equally decisive reasons. First, after increasing the amount of the fines on account of the seriousness of the ENJASA's breaches and recidivism, ENREJA warned, expressly and formally, to the company\u2014i.e., by Resolutions Nos. 39/10 and 128/10, that the license could be revoked if the violations of Law No. 7020 continued, as was eventually the case in 2013. Second, the sanction that revoked the License was preceded by twenty-one sanctions applied to the company by Resolution of ENREJA for violations or breaches of the company's obligations as Licensee, six of which were violations of its obligations to prevent money laundering under Article 5. Both Article 13 Law No. 7020 and Article 5(2) of the License Agreement provide that sanctions shall be applied taking into account \"the seriousness of the violation or breach\" and, as in every system of sanctions, recidivism aggravates the \"seriousness of the breach.\" ENJASA's management should have taken this into account in order to avoid being sanctioned with revocation of its License, as the warnings were timely provided for it to conform its behavior with its obligations as Licensee.\n\n208.\n\nENJASA's management had enough time to take internal action to avoid sanctions for violations or breaches of core obligations, as those related to the prevention of money laundering under Article 5 of Law No. 7020, since by nature such category of violations or breaches increased the seriousness of the sanction, just like recidivism. But ENJASA failed to do so despite ENREJA's warnings. At the time of the events, measures against money laundering were adopted, both at the national and international level, and an online system was created which made it easier for the Regulatory Agency to immediately take knowledge of any unlawful acts committed in slot machines. The company's contribution to aggravate incidental sanctions is evident since prevention of money laundering fell in full within the scope of application of both Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and Article 5(3) of the License Agreement (cited *supra*) which provides that *\"[f]or the sake of grading the sanction\"*, the following factors shall be taken into account:\n\n1. the seriousness of the infraction;\n\n2. the extent to which the rule of law, morality and good customs are impaired;\n\n3. the damages it causes to the provincial State and/or private persons;\n\n4. the social commotion it may produce; and\n\n5. the licensee\u00b4s record of recidivism.\n\n209.\n\nThere is no evidence on the record whether ENJASA's Board of Directors was aware of this provision in its written exchanges with ENREJA. Rather, the testimony of Mr. Tucek, CAI CEO and member of ENJASA's Board of Directors, on Day 2 of the hearing in this phase of the proceedings, shed some light on the reasons why ENJASA paid all the fines imposed thereon by ENREJA, without filing any administrative recourse or any action with contentious-administrative courts, even where it alleged in its defense that the sanction applied by ENREJA was unfounded. According to Mr. Tucek:\n\n\"\u2026 if there's a fine of ARS 10,000 or 15,000 or 20,000, and if you consider the cost of a court case, and by going into court against the regulator for the fine of ARS 10,000/15,000/20,000 would basically jeopardize the relationship with the authorities and would cost more money than paying ARS 10,000 or 15,000.\"\n\nOne can understand the simplicity approach taken by the company with regard to the fines, as stated by Mr. Tucek, but then it would not be surprising, as he also asserts, that ENJASA's license was revoked because paying the fines amounts to acknowledging the breach or violation at issue which, in turns, amounts to creating a record of recidivism.\n\n210.\n\nIt is true, as explained by Mr. Tucek at the hearing, that he is not a lawyer and had not read all the legal provisions of the regulatory framework of games of chance in the Province of Salta. Therefore, he could be unaware of Article 13 of Law No. 7020 which provides for revocation of the license by ENREJA, though the License Agreement also states so, but the company had its own lawyers that should have timely advised him of the existence of said Article 13 and that the number of fines paid without filing any administrative recourse and/or legal action would have serious legal consequences for Licensee. First, having a record of recidivism increases the level of recidivism with the resulting aggravation of the nature of subsequent offenses and their applicable sanctions, as was the case of ENJASA. And second, as recognized by Mr. Bianchi himself, Claimants' legal expert, in the absence of a legal action brought before the courts by Claimants, the acknowledgment of the violation or breach that led to the sanction becomes final and cannot then be alleged as illegitimate in another subsequent legal action (statute of limitations of the action to challenge a decision) (Day 5, 32:10-19). ENJASA's officers were negligent in failing to foresee that the seriousness of the violation of the provisions on money laundering prevention, along with recidivism, could well lead to revocation of the License as a sanction. This was what happened eventually, but Respondent may not be held liable for the negligence or casual deficiencies of ENJASA's Board of Directors particularly where, as in this case, Claimants were not shareholders alien to the daily operations of the company, but rather controlled, ran and managed ENJASA's business and administered the company.\n\n211.\n\nLicensee's obligations to record payments under Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020 apply only to \"payment of prices in an amount exceeding ARS 10,000.\" This standard matches the international standard under EU Law which, as informed to the Arbitral Tribunal, provides for \"payment of prizes exceeding EUR 2,000.\" In any case, it should be noted in this context that all prize payments authorized by ENREJA Resolution No. 240 exceeded the standard ARS 10,000. Specifically, the amounts paid were ARS 11,080, ARS 12,000, ARS 15,000, and ARS 11,480, respectively. These amounts have not been disputed by Claimants. Additionally, payment of prizes exceeding ARS 10,000 was by no means frequent, which indicates that the obligation to record such payments was not an excessive burden for a company like ENJASA. As testified at the hearing by Mr. Fade, auditor of the company, in reply to the question about how frequently these payments occurred:\n\n\"\u2026 in terms of frequency, with lottery it was probably two or three times a week we would make such payments; and in the bigger halls, probably once a week. In the smaller halls, probably not so frequently: maybe only once a month in the interior. In some halls, the machines were really good, so there might be prizes more often, but it usually wasn't more often than once, twice a week at the most\" (Day 4, 83: 2-9.)\n\n212.\n\nContrary to Claimants' allegations, this discussion allows concluding that the adverse effects of the revocation of ENJASA's License by ENREJA Resolution No. 240/13 on their investment are not at all the result of the adverse effects of an \"indirect expropriation\" of Claimants' investment by Respondent. Certainly, there was an adverse effect for the investor, not as a result of \"indirect expropriation by Respondent\" but rather of serious and repeated violations or breaches by ENJASA\u2014controlled, ran and managed by Claimants\u2014of its legal and contractual obligations as Licensee to prevent money laundering. It was these violations or breaches that led the Respondent's competent authority in the Province of Salta to be compelled to revoke the License by applying a statutory sanction to the company in exercise of its regulatory and police power of the Provincial State, in compliance with the laws, rules, the license agreement and regulations issued by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020.\n\n213.\n\nClaimants have been unable to establish in these proceedings that the revocation of ENJASA's License was \"indirect expropriation\" of their investment in the company by the authorities of Salta, which as such would amount to an internationally wrongful act on the part of Respondent by virtue of the provisions of Article 4(1) and (2) of Argentina-Austria BIT. They have failed to do so because said allegation is not consistent with what actually happened in light of the proven or admitted facts and the applicable law in this dispute as defined in Article 8 (6) of such BIT. The artificial nature of the allegation is evident and can only be explained by the desire to turn a domestic contractual dispute into an early ICSID arbitration against Respondent, that is, without waiting for the decision of the courts of Salta on the proceedings filed to annul ENREJA Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315.\n\n214.\n\nAs a consequence of ENJASA's withdrawal of such proceedings, the revocation of the license has, as stated *supra*, become final under the laws of the Argentine Republic which, for the purposes of this arbitration, amounts to a new adverse effect *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, by the time of ENJASA's violations or breaches (grounds for revocation of the License), the company's business was run and controlled by Claimants, as evidenced by Mr. Tucek's dual capacity as CAI CEO and member of ENJASA's Board of Directors, who confirmed at the hearing that ENJASA regularly reported from Salta to CAI in Vienna and Vienna supposedly gave instructions to Salta. Claimants were not at all unfamiliar with ENJASA's activities in Salta and therefore are also liable for the company's violations or breaches of the obligations listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020. Thus, Claimants contradict themselves in this arbitration as ENJASA has never alleged in Salta, as regards revocation of its License, that it had been subject to any sort of \"expropriation\". This contradiction makes Claimants' allegation on \"indirect expropriation\" and its previous behavior in SALTA in relation to the same facts, unacceptable (*allegans contraria non audiendus est*) to the extent that the contradiction benefits Claimants at the expense of Respondent for being against the principles of good faith and estoppel.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, again, it should be noted that the gaming regulatory framework in the Province of Salta of Law No. 7020 existed before the creation of ENJASA and privatization of its shares, so Claimants were aware of such framework before investing in the company, as recalled by ENREJA in ENREJA Resolution No. 315 (page 12 of the Resolution) and, therefore, the company's duty to comply with its obligations as Licensee, as those listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020, also undertaken by ENJASA under its License Agreement.\n\n**(ix) Due Process and ENJASA's Right of Defense Were Observed at All Times**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nClaimants also contend, once again without supporting evidence, that the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority observed neither due process nor ENJASA's right of defense in the administrative proceedings concerning the revocation of the License. However, the facts proved or admitted and applicable law lead to the opposite conclusion, i.e., that both due process and the right of defense were scrupulously observed by the Province of Salta.\n\n217.\n\nThe procedural and substantive law of such Province, applied in the proceedings mentioned *supra*, corresponds exactly to that of an advanced rule of law, such as that of Respondent and its Provinces. ENREJA revoked the License on account of ENJASA's violations or breaches of its obligations as Licensee set out in Article 5 of Law No. 7020, a conduct also in violation or breach of the provisions of the company's License Agreement itself. The revocation of the License was in no way an arbitrary or capricious administrative act as purportedly characterized by Claimants and the majority Award, but a regulated and orderly administrative act, which developed as usual and in accordance with the guarantees offered by Salta's provincial legal/administrative system and the Respondent.\n\n218.\n\nENJASA was served timely notice of the commencement of the preliminary investigation of each of ENREJA's administrative enquiries with its respective charges by means of a formal act issued by the Regulatory Agency, so that the company was able to prepare its defense. Those administrative enquiries were the case concerning the hiring of operators without prior authorization under Resolution No. 384/12, the case concerning omissions in the record of payments of lottery prizes under Resolution No. 380/12, and the case concerning omissions in the record of payments of live or board game prizes under Resolution No. 381/12. ENREJA learned about the events giving rise to the institution of such enquiries through third-party complaints or inspections of the relevant casinos or gaming houses carried out by its own officials.\n\n219.\n\nWith regard to ENJASA's right of defense, I am puzzled by Claimants' assertion that such right was not duly observed, since all the information on record in this arbitration disproves it, even the statements made at the hearing by their expert, Mr. Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s, in relation to the observance of the four allegedly constituent elements of the right to be heard. According to that information, in exercise of its right of defense, ENJASA filed its answers to the charges; had access to and was able to take copies of the files; requested that terms be extended; submitted evidence in its defense; obtained Resolution No. 240 with a detailed recital explaining the facts and the law in support of the revocation of the License; had the opportunity to file an administrative recourse for clarification, reconsideration or appeal against the resolution, and chose a recourse for reconsideration; pending such recourse, requested and was granted interim relief in order to safeguard its rights; obtained a decision on such recourse by means of Resolution No. 315, which also contains a detailed recital explaining the grounds for its dismissal; and, lastly, instituted contentious-administrative proceedings before the competent court for Salta, requesting the annulment of Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315.\n\n220.\n\nThe few complaints by ENJASA's counsel that are entered on record concern issues such as the tightness of certain time limits and the inability to introduce new evidence into the proceedings for reconsideration of Resolution No. 240, both of which are regulated by the Law of Administrative Procedure of Salta (LPAS, for its Spanish acronym), to which ENREJA's proceedings were, of course, subject. The first paragraphs of Resolution No. 315 address such issues. Resolution No. 315 states, on the one hand, that the \"challenge filed is admissible as appellant has duly complied with the legal time limits prescribed\" by the LPAS, and, on the other, that such procedural system does not allow evidence to be received \"in proceedings under which the subject damaged by an action has actually been a party to the case. This is especially true in the case of the above-mentioned enquiry proceedings, as appellant has had an active and wide participation in connection with its right of defense\" (page 1 of Resolution No. 315).\n\n221.\n\nThat being said, I consider that the allegation that the Salta proceedings failed to observe ENJASA's right of defense when Claimants have not exhausted local court remedies is an indefensible contradiction, especially within the framework of their claim for indirect expropriation. Moreover, it weakens what they are supposed to prove for such claim to prevail over Respondent's defense on the merits, as the \"non-exhaustion\" of such remedies does not correspond to the meaning under general international law of notions such as \"serious denial of justice,\" \"manifest arbitrariness,\" \"complete lack of due process,\" or \"evidently unfair decision.\" None of these situations can arise in international law without the previous exhaustion of Respondent's local remedies, and international law is one of the sources of the \"proper law\" applicable to the resolution of the present dispute, as provided for by Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n222.\n\nFurthermore, in my opinion, as pointed out by the arbitral tribunal in *Metalclad v. Mexico* (2000), a \"denial of justice\" can also refer to domestic administrative proceedings such as those pursued by ENJASA before ENREJA, although Claimants in their first claim in this arbitration allege that they have been victims of an \"indirect expropriation\" due to the violation of Article 4 (1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, rather than a \"denial of justice\" on account of the violation of customary international law concerning one or more of the four types of \"denial of justice\" identified in arbitration practice by investment tribunals, such as the ICSID tribunal in *Azinian v. Mexico,* presided over by Jan Paulsson, which did so in the following paragraphs of the award:\n\n\"102. A denial of justice could be pleaded if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way\u2026\n\n103. There is a fourth type of denial of justice, namely the clear and malicious misapplication of the law\u2026\" (Award of 1 November 1999).\n\n223.\n\nIn any case, Claimants have failed to demonstrate in this arbitration that ENREJA incurred any of these four types of \"denial of justice\" under customary international law in the course of the administrative proceedings pursued in connection with the revocation of ENJASA's License in the Province of Salta.\n\n**(x) The Proportionality of the Sanction Imposed by ENREJA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe fact that the sanction imposed by ENREJA, i.e., the revocation of ENJASA's License, was the most severe of all those provided for in Article 13 of Law No. 7020 has been alleged by Claimants as an example of an undue bias against them, if not an abuse of rights by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority. The majority Award partly accepts this allegation in search for some crack which allows it to find the Argentine Republic liable for having violated Article 4 (1) y (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and, thus, reach the goal of a compensation, which, in my view, is inappropriate.\n\n225.\n\nIndeed, Article 13 of Law No. 7020 provides *in fine* that the \"sanctions shall be applied taking into account the seriousness of the violation or breach,\" and Article 5.2 of the License Agreement lays down a similar criterion regarding the \"sanctions and graduation established in Law No. 7020 and its implementing regulation.\" In addition, this proportionality criterion applies to the violations and breaches of Law No. 7020 and its regulations, as well as to the provisions of the License Agreement and the regulations issued by the Regulatory Agency. Lastly, Article 5.3 of the License Agreement adds \"*[f]or the sake of grading the sanction*\" the criteria listed *supra* in this Opinion.\n\n226.\n\nIn order to examine this issue, it is worth remembering the provisions of ENREJA's Resolution No. 240 itself on the elements taken into account by its Board of Directors so as to impose the sanction concerning the revocation of ENJASA's License. In accordance with such Resolution, those elements were the following:\n\n1. ENJASA's background;\n\n2. The importance of the breaches proved;\n\n3. The effect of those breaches on the public activity entrusted to ENJASA; and\n\n4. The sanctions authorized by law.\n\nAs to the first of these elements, i.e., the company's background, Resolution No. 240 is particularly specific. It states, on the one hand, that the Board of Directors took into consideration \"the countless occasions on which it had to issue decisions concerning ENJASA's repeated and manifest refusals to comply with the law\" and, on the other, that \"[n]otwithstanding all the corrective measures adopted in this regard, ENJASA has exceeded the bounds of legal tolerance in acting in disregard of the rules that regulate the gaming industry\" (page 27 of the Resolution).\n\n227.\n\nAs evidence of those assertions, Resolution No. 240 goes on to list twenty-one Resolutions issued by ENREJA - from February 2005 to May 2013 \u2013 imposing sanctions on ENJASA for breaches of laws and/or regulations governing its activity as exclusive Licensee of games of chance in the provincial jurisdiction of Salta (pages 27 to 29 of the Resolution). Six of those twenty sanctioning Resolutions prior to Resolution No. 240 impose fines on ENJASA precisely for the violation of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and its regulation then in force and effect (ENJASA's Resolution No. 026/00) on the prevention of money laundering, as Resolution No. 240 itself also did in August 2013 when imposing a sanction on ENJASA, as stated *supra*, for hiring operators without ENREJA's prior authorization and/or making payments of prizes for over ARS 10,000 without recording in the \"anti-money laundering book\" the identity of the customer who had won the prize and/or the payment of the prize itself and/or the payment of the prize through the methods of payment authorized, i.e., check or wire transfer, as the case may be.\n\n228.\n\nNeither ENJASA at the relevant time nor Claimants in this arbitration have questioned the authenticity of any of those resolutions sanctioning ENJASA's conduct and listed in Resolution No. 240 as examples of the company's repeated unlawful conduct. Those sanctions should be considered together with the following concurrent factors, which are relevant in order to appreciate the proportionality of the revocation of ENJASA's License determined by such Resolution adopted by ENREJA: (i) the prior penalties or warnings by the Enforcement Authority concerning the possibility that the License be revoked if the violations or breaches persisted; (ii) the importance and identity of the laws and regulations violated in the legal system of the Province of Salta where the exploitation and administration of games of chance is subject to provincial jurisdiction; (iii) the social, economic and political sensitivity existing over the crime of money laundering in the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism; (iv) the development of international cooperation in the fight against tax evasion, drug trafficking and international terrorism during the period in question in which the Argentine Republic actively participates; (v) the fact that the public function entrusted to ENJASA's management as Licensee (the exclusive administration of casinos and games of chance) is objectively an activity prone to be used by criminals for their felonies; and (vi) the adverse effects of failing to duly record the transactions relevant so as to determine the amount of the yearly license fee to be paid by ENJASA.\n\n229.\n\nDue to the fact that the events admitted or proved in connection with Licensee's violations or breaches of its legal and contractual obligations on the prevention of money-laundering were serious and repeated, it is clear to me that the sanction of revoking ENJASA's License, adopted by Resolution No. 240 of 13 August 2013, was as proportionate as prescribed by the relevant provisions of both Law No. 7020 and the License Agreement, which is the proportionality that ENREJA had to weigh and did weigh in determining the graduation of the sanction imposed on ENJASA pursuant to Article 13 of Law No. 7020. In the words of ENREJA's Board of Directors in Resolution No. 240, such violations or breaches revealed, given their repeated and serious nature, a model of conduct adopted by Licensee that was inconsistent with the obligations stated in Article 5 of Law No. 7020, since, in accordance with the Resolution:\n\n\"\u2026Law No. 7020 clearly sets forth that certain controls must be conducted as a condition for the operation of games of chance, in order to prevent the laundering of money of illegal origin. For such purposes, the most comprehensive legal protection is afforded, an anti-money laundering provision\u2014Article 5\u2014is included in a chapter in the Law where it cannot go unnoticed, and all of the actors involved\u2014the Regulatory Agency, operators and gamblers\u2014are included\" (page 26 of the Resolution).\n\n230.\n\nENJASA failed to conduct such necessary legal controls, as a result of which it was sanctioned with the forfeiture of the License after a long period of tolerance and warnings by ENREJA, which latter eventually proceeded to impose the sanction of revoking ENJASA's License in strict compliance with its duties as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020.\n\n**(c) Conclusion on Claimants' First Claim**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nIn light of all the foregoing considerations, I reject Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim, which was allegedly based on the treaty provisions of Article 4 (1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT for lacking the objective element of Respondent's violation of an international obligation owed to Claimants, in the absence of which the existence of an internationally wrongful act by Respondent to the detriment of Claimants may not be inferred under international law.\n\n232.\n\nNot only has Respondent not engaged in any conduct in violation of such provisions of the BIT when the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta adopted the sanction of revoking ENJASA's License, but it has acted in accordance with the Argentine law of the Province of Salta, as well as the customary rule of general international law protecting the regular exercise by States' competent bodies of their sovereign regulatory and police powers, both of which, together with the relevant BIT, form the \"proper law\" applicable to the resolution of this dispute under Article 8 (6) of the BIT itself.\n\n233.\n\nThe actions undertaken by ENREJA in the Province of Salta on the occasion of the revocation of ENJASA's License \u2013 which has become final ever since \u2013 could not have violated or breached the standard fixed by Article 4 (1) and (2) of the BIT, as Claimants assert, since ENJASA's revoked asset (administrative rights of a licensee) was not, by its nature, liable to any kind of expropriation in the Argentine legal system of the Province of Salta. No-one expropriates itself either directly or by adopting measures having a tantamount effect. In addition, the revocation of ENJASA's License did not cause a total and permanent loss in the value of Claimants' investment in ENJASA or the control of the company.\n\n234.\n\nIn the case at issue, the revocation measure disputed by Claimants was a \"sanction\" imposed on ENJASA by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta on account of previous violations or breaches by the company of its obligations as a Licensee, upon conclusion of ordinary administrative proceedings known to and admitted by the company (and by Claimant foreign shareholders), which renders the so-called \"sole effects\" doctrine or criterion inapplicable in this case, because, in the event of sanctions revoking licenses or concessions, merely weighing the effect(s) of the measure when the purpose of any sanction, by definition, is to cause an adverse effect on the party being sanctioned leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable outcome, an oxymoron, unless foreign investors are claimed to enjoy in the territory of the host State of the investment the privilege of an immunity which does not exist under international law, a hypothesis that has not been raised by Claimants.\n\n235.\n\nThe adverse effects of the revocation of ENJASA's License do not entitle Claimants to compensation, since that measure is not an internationally wrongful act by Respondent as such giving rise to international responsibility *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants, and *quad non* as neither Claimants nor the majority Award have shown that, on the occasion of such revocation, Respondent incurred any other \"internationally wrongful\" act of such relevance and to such extent as general international law requires for the effects of this potential wrongful act, such as a \"denial of justice,\" to prevail over the international customary rule invoked by Respondent as a defense on the merits**.**\n\n236.\n\nLastly, in a case like this one, where the measure adopted sanctioned ENJASA's improper conduct as a consequence of its repeated violations or breaches of its legal and contractual obligations as Licensee, requesting that Respondent compensate Claimants for the allegedly indirect adverse effects of that sanction on their investment is a proposition that defies reason and is, thus, unacceptable for the ridiculous outcome to which it would lead. It is also inadmissible for attempting against the legal certainty that should govern the relations between foreign investors and the host State, in both the domestic and the international framework. Moreover, in view of the fact that, in the instant case, it was Claimants themselves who controlled, managed, ran and administered ENJASA when most of the violations or breaches that were sanctioned occurred, claiming compensation is inadmissible in an ICSID arbitration governed by good faith.\n\n**B. Claimants' Second Claim: Alleged Violation by Respondent of Article 4(3) of the BIT (Direct Expropriation)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Relevant Texts**\n----------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Argentina-Austria BIT is a treaty authenticated in German and Spanish, as provided for by its final clause: \"DONE in Buenos Aires, on August 7, 1992, in two counterparts, in the German and Spanish languages, each version being equally authentic.\" Both texts are duly signed by both the representative of the Argentine Republic and the representative of the Republic of Austria, which is why they have been established as authentic and definitive (Article 10 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)). The Parties so admit, and neither has claimed the existence of amendments or modifications to the BIT after 7 August 1992, but they disagree on the meaning and scope of the provision contained in Article 4 (3) of the BIT. Based on the German text, Claimants assert that Respondent committed a direct expropriation of their investment for violating Article 4 (3) of the BIT (Compensation), while Respondent, on the basis of the Spanish text, denies Claimants' allegation and deems it inadmissible in light of the provisions of Article 33 of the VCLT on the interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages.\n\n238.\n\nIn the jurisdictional phase, Respondent had already filed a preliminary objection for lack of *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over this second claim, on the grounds that Claimants' shareholding in ENJASA was not an \"*activo financiero*\" (\"financial asset\") in the express terms of the authentic text in Spanish of Article 4 (3) of the BIT: \"*Cuando una Parte Contratante expropie los activos financieros de una sociedad* \u2026\" (\"Where a Contracting Party expropriates the financial assets of a company.\") Claimants, in turn, rejected this preliminary objection, arguing that the authentic text in German of Article 4 (3) of the BIT uses the word \"*Verm\u00f6genwerte*,\" a broad term which did not limit the material scope of application of the provision to \"*activos financieros*\" (\"financial assets\").\n\n239.\n\nHence, an interpretation dispute arose between the Parties as to the meaning and scope of the provision included in Article 4 (3) of the BIT, which was not settled in the Decision on Jurisdiction adopted by the majority and which, therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal is to resolve now in this merits phase - as a preliminary question in relation to Claimants' second claim - by application of Article 33 of the VCLT in order to be able to decide on the merits of Claimants' second claim. The text of Article 33, which the jurisprudence of the ICJ considers declaratory of customary international law on the matter, reads as follows:\n\nInterpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages\n\n1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.\n\n3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.\n\n4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\n\n**(b) Consideration of the Interpretation Question Preliminary to the Second Claim**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nBy virtue of the interpretation dispute between Claimants and Respondent described *supra*, the Arbitral Tribunal must first resolve such dispute before being able to decide on the merits of Claimants' second claim (direct expropriation), which, in turn, compels it to verify and determine the material scope of application of Article 4 (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT by application of Article 33 of the VCLT.\n\n241.\n\nArticle 33 of the VCLT corresponds to Article 29 of the Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties of the International Law Commission (ILC), which served as basic proposal for the work undertaken by the United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties. The text of the said Article 33 adopted by the Conference is materially identical to that of Article 29 of the ILC Draft Articles, except for paragraph 4 *in fine* where the Conference added the words \"having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty\" to the text of the ILC.\n\n242.\n\nThese words were added by the Drafting Committee of the Conference after taking into account amendments proposed by the U.S. and Australia that the Plenary Commission had submitted to its consideration. Both amendments suggested reinforcing and facilitating the application of the rule of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts\" proposed by the ILC in Article 29 (3) of its Draft Articles. The ICL had codified such rule for deeming it consistent with the general principle of international law on the matter of equality of languages and equal authenticity of the respective texts, in the absence of a specific clause providing otherwise in the treaty subject to interpretation. This principle was accepted absent objections by any of the States taking part in the Plenary Commission of the Conference. The amendments referred to *supra* were submitted without a prior vote thereon to the consideration of the Drafting Committee, so that it would determine the extent to which the application of the rule codified by the ILC could be improved, not for the purposes of modifying or distorting such rule.\n\n243.\n\nIt is in compliance with such mandate that the Drafting Committee added the words \"having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.\" The Drafting Committee believed that such addition facilitated the application of the rule of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts\" of customary international law proposed by the ILC. Finally, the Plenary Commission of the Conference adopted Article 33 of the VCLT including such addition with no votes against it.\n\n244.\n\nOn the other hand, the application by the Arbitral Tribunal of Article 33 of the VCLT in order to settle the interpretation dispute between the Parties in this arbitration poses no jurisdictional and/or procedural difficulty for the following reasons: (i) it is allowed by the definition of \"proper law\" applicable to this arbitration under Article 8 (6) of the BIT; (ii) both Argentina and Austria are Parties to the VCLT; (iii) in any case, the ICJ expressly declared that Article 33 (4) of the VCLT reflects customary international law (*LaGrand,* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 502, para. 101); (iv) the original texts in German and Spanish of the BIT are duly authenticated by the signatures of the representatives of the respective Republics; and (v) as stated *supra,* the final clause of the BIT cannot be clearer when providing that the BIT: \"DONE in Buenos Aires, on August 7, 1992, *in two counterparts, in the German and Spanish languages, each version being equally authentic*\" (emphasis added).\n\n245.\n\nOnce verified, by comparing the authentic texts in German and Spanish, that Article 4 (3) of the BIT actually coexisting - as it follows from that alleged by the Parties - the term \"*activos financieros*\" in the Spanish text and the term \"*Verm\u00f6genwerte*\" in the German text, I opine that the Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with the \"proper law\" defined in Article 8 (6) of the BIT \u2013 has a duty to apply the rule of international law of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts\" codified in Article 33 (4) of the VCLT in order to resolve the present dispute. Furthermore, to such effect, the Arbitral Tribunal must follow the sequence indicated in the very rule codified in such paragraph, i.e., starting with \"the application of articles 31 and 32\" of the VCLT and bearing in mind at all times the legal presumption that \"[t]he terms of the treaty [...] have the same meaning in each authentic text\" as prescribed by Article 33 (3) of the VCLT.\n\n246.\n\nThe Parties to this arbitration did not provide the Arbitral Tribunal with any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Argentina-Austria BIT, but did submit the complete original texts in German and Spanish of the BIT duly authenticated by means of their signature. This allows us to know the entire context, including the text, of the provision contained in Article 4 (3) of the BIT, as well as the object and purpose of such Treaty, for the purpose of application of the *general rule of interpretation* of Article 31 of the VCLT as a prelude to the application of the rule of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts\" under Article 33 (4) of the VCLT*.*\n\n247.\n\nThe provision included in Article 4 (3) of the BIT in its context, as defined by Article 31 (2) of the VCLT, confirms that such provision, like the rest of the provisions of the BIT, States rights and obligations that, without exception, are reciprocal in nature. In addition, the object and purpose of the Treaty is undoubtedly the mutual protection and promotion of the investments made by nationals of a Contracting State in the territory of another Contracting State, and vice-versa, pursuant to the Treaty itself. Like other BITs, the Argentina-Austria BIT is, therefore, a bilateral treaty based on strict principles of mutuality and reciprocity, and its provisions state, without exception, rights and obligations consented *ad idem* by Argentina and Austria.\n\n248.\n\nThe foregoing conclusions, which result from following the sequence of applying, first, the general rule of interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT as prescribed by Article 33 (4) of the Convention, do not resolve as such the issue of the equal meaning to be given to the German and Spanish terms in dispute, but they pave the way for its resolution by following that sequence, i.e., by applying, next, the rule of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts,\" having regard to the \"object and purpose\" of the BIT.\n\n249.\n\nIn view of the fact that the rights and obligations stated in Article 4 (3) of the BIT are, as we have just concluded, reciprocal in nature, the meaning that can reconcile the German text and the Spanish text to a greater extent is, undoubtedly, the term having the most limited material scope, which, in this case, is \"*activos financieros*\" of the authentic text in Spanish. It is only as regards the material scope of the term \"*activos financieros*\" of the Spanish text that it can be asserted that the rights and obligations under Article 4 (3) of the BIT are the same for investors who are nationals of both Contracting Parties, since the German text encompasses the term \"*activos financieros*\" of the Spanish text, whereas the Spanish text does not encompass the term \"*Verm\u00f6genwerte*\" of the German text. As stated by the PCIJ in the case concerning the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* and cited by the ILC in paragraph (8) of its commentary to Article 29 of its Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties:\n\n\"The Court is of opinion that, where two versions possessing equal authority exist one of which appears to have a wider bearing than the other, (the Court) is bound to adopt the more limited interpretation which can be made to harmonize with both versions and which, as far as it goes, is doubtless in accordance with the common intention of the Parties\" (PCIJ*,* 1924, Series A, No. 2, p. 19).\n\n250.\n\nThe *Mavrommatis* case adamantly supports the principle of reconciliation or harmonization of texts and that is why it was proposed by the ILC and approved by States at the Vienna Conference where the VCLT was adopted. Such jurisprudence of the PCIJ fully corresponds to the rule of \"a meaning which as far as possible reconciles the texts\" now codified in Article 33 (4) of the VCLT. Moreover, the application of such rule in the instant case poses no difficulty whatsoever, as the Argentina-Austria BIT is a bilateral treaty for the mutual and reciprocal promotion and protection of the investments made by Austrian investors in Argentina and by Argentine investors in Austria by means of identical treaty standards for the nationals of both Contracting States of the BIT.\n\n**(c) Conclusion on Claimants' Second Claim**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nGiven that, as a result of the application of Articles 31 and 33 of the VCLT to the interpretation dispute between the Parties concerning the equal meaning to be given in both languages to the relevant terms of Article 4 (3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, it is the term \"*activos financieros*\" that prevails, Claimants' claim on \"direct expropriation\" is inadmissible.\n\n**C. Claimants' Third Claim: Alleged Violation by Respondent of Article 2 (1) of the BIT (Fair and Equitable Treatment)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Relevant Texts**\n----------------------\n\n252.\n\nArticle 2 (1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investments,\" provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall, to the extent possible, promote in its territory investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, admit such investments in accordance with its legislation, and accord them at all times fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\nUnder this BIT provision, Respondent has undertaken the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to investments made by Austrian investors *admitted in the territory of the Argentine Republic in accordance with the legislation thereof* and Austria has undertaken an obligation of similar content and scope with respect to investments made in its territory by Argentine investors.\n\n253.\n\nBut, as it usually happens in bilateral agreements for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, the Argentina-Austria BIT fails to define the content and scope of \"fair and equitable treatment\" (FET; in Spanish, \"TJE\" for \"*tratamiento justo y equitativo*\") standard. Neither is there in said BIT any reference to the defining criteria or constituent components of the FET standard it formulates. In addition, Claimants and Respondent in this arbitration disagree on the content and scope of the above-mentioned standard. I am of the view that it is practical to reproduce, as a starting point in the consideration of the FET standard of the applicable BIT, a general reference to the International Law Institute's (ILI) collective doctrinal contribution on the matter, namely, Article 13 of the Institute's Resolution entitled \"*Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-state Treaties*\" adopted in its (2013) Tokyo session on the basis of reports submitted by the subject-matter rapporteur at the Institute, Professor Andrea Giardina. The Resolution, which is in the public domain, is published in the *Annuaire de l'IDI* of the above-mentioned session*.* The text of the aforementioned Article 13 provides the following on the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard:\n\n\"Fair and equitable treatment, which is a key standard of investment protection, must accord investors and investments, in particular: (i) due process, (ii) non-discrimination and non-arbitrary treatment, (iii) due diligence, and (iv) respect of legitimate expectations.\n\nThe notion of legitimate expectations, as applied to investors, shall not be construed to include mere expectations of profit, in the absence of specific engagements undertaken towards them by competent State organs.\n\nCompensation due to an investor for violation of the FET standard shall be assessed without regard to compensation that could be allocated in case of an expropriation, in accordance with the damages suffered by the investor.\"\n\n254.\n\nIt is also advisable to bear in mind, given that the question is raised at the outset of the instant case, that States' conduct, their respective BIT Models, treaties and other relevant international instruments, and the practice of international investment arbitral tribunals, reveal the existence of a fundamental division on the FET content and scope as a standard of protection of foreign investment that the UNCTAD has described in the following terms: \"\u2026 whether the obligation to grant 'fair and equitable treatment' is synonymous with the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investment required under customary international law, or whether it means something different \u2026 albeit with some overlap\" *(Identifying Core Elements in Investments Agreements in the APEC Region,* UNCTAD Series on International Investment Policies for Development, 2008, p. 29.\n\n255.\n\nIn other words, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard is an autonomous standard and of a scope wider than that provided for by customary international law as held, for instance, by the *Pope and Talbot* case tribunal, or it is identical to the so called \"customary international law minimum standard\" as held by other investment arbitral tribunals, notwithstanding eventual customary evolutions of this so called \"minimum standard.\"\n\n**(b) Consideration of the Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Prior Question of Distinction between Company Rights and Their Shareholders' Rights**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nIn their third final conclusion, Claimants assert that due to the revocation of ENJASA's license Respondent would have incurred in a violation of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" laid down in Article 2 (1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT regarding their investment in ENJASA. This conclusion raises a prior question given the fact that general international law distinguishes between the rights of the company holding the license, *i.e.*, ENJASA, and the rights of its shareholders, Claimants in these arbitral proceedings, as reflected in the ICJ case law in the *Barcelona Traction, ELSI* and *Diallo* cases*.*\n\n257.\n\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that this international law distinction can give rise to the submission of an inadmissibility substantive objection as defense in the merits stage of a particular case (see: Gabriel Bottini, *Admissibility of Shareholder Claims under Investment Treaties,* Cambridge University Press*.*) Nevertheless, in this arbitration, Respondent has not questioned Claimants' ability to directly file a claim for violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard laid down in the applicable BIT. What divided the Parties in the instant case regarding such treatment was the definition and scope of the FET standard that shall apply in this case, not the admissibility of Claimants' third claim based upon such standard.\n\n258.\n\nThe double presence in these arbitral proceedings of Claimants as a Party and of the Argentine company in which they made their indirect majority investment as shareholders of L&E, *i.e.*, of ENJASA as holder of the revoked license, is one of the particular circumstances of this dispute. I am of the view that the Arbitral Tribunal cannot ignore, with reference to the consideration of Claimants' third claim, the principle of good faith, given that not only were Claimants indirect majority shareholders of ENJASA, but they were also directly managing and running the company in its daily activities at the time of occurrence of most of the violations or breaches by Licensee of its obligations which were decisive for the imposition by ENREJA of the license revocation sanction provided for under Article 13 of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position on the Content and Scope of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nFor Respondent, the content and scope of the FET standard would correspond to the provisions set forth by the rule of customary international law that provides for the level of treatment to be accorded to aliens and/or their property, generally referred to as the rule of \"international minimum standard.\" Besides, this standard would not affect the State's power to adopt regulatory or police measures although these latter may have adverse effects for foreign investors, provided that for that customary international law \"minimum standard\" those measures would be inapposite due to their being manifestly arbitrary or unfair for said legal system.\n\n260.\n\nIn other words, for Respondent, the FET standard does not operate as an exception to the customary rule of international law regarding the exercise by the State of the regulatory and police powers thereof but, on the contrary, application of any such standard is subject to the non-application of said rule should it be in the sense that the adverse effects for the foreign investor of the exercise by the State of the aforementioned powers are not protected by FET standard applicable to foreign investments, which, as held by the *Methanex v. USA* tribunal in its final award: \"i(t) is a principle of customary international law that, where economic injury results from a *bona fide* regulation within the police power of a State, compensation is not required\" (MethanexCorp. v. USA, Final Award, 3 August 2005, 44 ILM 1343, para. 410 (2005)).\n\n261.\n\nIn addition, the practice of international investment arbitral tribunals that Respondent shares suggests that the States regulatory or police measures at issue shall be adopted in good faith, pursue a legitimate public purpose and be reasonable in the context of the prevailing circumstances (*e.g*.: *SD Myers v. Canada,* Partial Award of 13 November 2000, paras. 261-263; see also *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 17 May 2006, paras. 304-307).\n\n262.\n\nRespondent also recalls the wide margin of appreciation governmental authorities enjoy in the definition of State public policies, quoting in that regard the following excerpt by the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* tribunal:\n\n\"The fair and equitable treatment standard is not a justiciable standard of good government, and the tribunal is not a court of appeal\u2026 Some limit had to be set, and the balance to be struck between conflicting considerations was very largely a matter for the government \u2026 Provisions such as Article 3 (2) do not preclude governments from enacting novel rules, even if there are in advance of international practice, provided these have some rational basis and are not discriminatory\" (Award of 8 July 2016, paras. 418 and 430).\n\n263.\n\nThis citation is significant in order to understand and apply the FET standard as per the trend shared by Respondent even if in the instant case legal matters of temporary nature, for instance, because of new legislation or new regulations are not present. As we have seen *supra* the amendment in 2001 of Law No. 7020 by Law No. 7133 did not introduce legislative changes relevant for the resolution of this dispute, although there was an attempt to mislead the Arbitral Tribunal into the opposite. Besides, any such 2001 amendment is also prior to the relevant facts of the instant case. The measure adopted by the competent authority of the Province of Salta was, as demonstrated herein, a sanction by the Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 to the company ENJASA, in its capacity as Licensee of an activity (games of chance) of provincial jurisdiction, imposed pursuant to the provisions set forth under Article 13 of Law No. 7020 for violation of the obligations laid down under Article 5 thereof. None of these two articles of Law No. 7020, or, naturally, the License Agreement was subject to modifications by Law No. 7133 in 2001.\n\n264.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Argentine Republic is not alone in its interpretation of the content and scope of the FET standard, it is accompanied by other States, among which, as it is well known, NAFTA Members (Canada, USA, and Mexico) stand out. Article 1105 (1) of the NAFTA provides for that Contracting Parties shall afford protected foreign investors treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment. Besides, this provision has been subject to a mandatory interpretation by the NAFTA \"Free Trade Commission\" which, *inter alia* states as follows:\n\n\"Article 1105 (1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" *do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.* A Determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been breach of Article 1105 (1)\" (Respondent's CM, paragraph 561.) (Emphasis added)\n\n265.\n\nOther States also participate of this same approach as the following paragraph of the Commentary to Article 1 of the 1967 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property shows:\n\n\"The phrase 'fair and equitable treatment', customary in relevant bilateral agreements, indicates the standard set by international law for the treatment due by each State with regard to the property of foreign nationals. The standard requires that \u2013 subject to essential security interests (See Article 6(i) \u2013 protection afforded under the Convention shall be that generally accorded by the Party concerned to its own nationals but, being set by international law, the standard may be more exacting where rules of national law or nationals administrative practices fall short of the requirements of international law. The standard required conforms in effect to the 'minimum standard' which forms part of customary international law\" (Respondent's CM, paragraph 560)\n\n266.\n\nFor Respondent, the applicable FET standard is part of general international law and its nature is customary given that it corresponds to the aforementioned \"international minimum standard\" due by States with regard to the persons or property of foreign nationals. It is this threshold which makes it possible to appreciate whether treatment afforded in a concrete case to a foreign person or their property (thus, to their investments) by a certain State is or not in accordance with the provisions set forth by international law. Respondent quotes with approval the \"international minimum standard\" classical formula of the USA-Mexico Claims Commission in *Neer* (1926) the applicability of which has continued being recognized in this century by investment arbitral tribunals such as, the *Glamis v. USA* arbitral tribunal (2009). Respondent -despite admitting that at the present moment the \"international minimum standard\" reflects more recent evolutions - underscores that the threshold to determine the violation of the standard is still high (\"grossly unfair or arbitrary\") as recognized by several arbitral tribunals, such as: *Thunderbird, Lauder, S.D. Myers, Genin, etc.* The *Waste Management v. Mexico* tribunal defines a conduct in breach of the FET standard in the following terms:\n\n\"\u2026 the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant...\" (Award of 30 April 2004, para. 98.)\n\n267.\n\nDetermination of whether a conduct is in breach or not of the FET standard threshold depends, to a great extent, on its factual context, *i.e.*, the prevailing factual circumstances, as pointed out, among many others, by the *Noble Ventures v. Romania* tribunal (Award of 12 October 2005, para. 181). In general, the parties to international investment arbitration proceedings also admit that it is not possible to determine *in abstracto* whether there has been a violation of the FET standard and that the question shall be solved in light of the specific or particular circumstances of the case at issue. In the instant case, one of the most significant circumstances is undoubtedly that the measure disputed between the Parties, namely, the revocation of the License ENJASA held, is a \"sanction\" imposed by the competent body, ENREJA, to the company sanctioned for violations or breaches of its obligations as Licensee.\n\n268.\n\nThe BIT formulas laying down the FET standard are not uniform, and they can even lead to misunderstanding. But this is not the case of the Argentina-Austria BIT, Article 2 (1) of which simply provides that each Contracting Party shall, to the extent possible, promote in its territory investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, *admit such investments in accordance with its legislation, and accord them at all times fair and equitable treatment.* The obligation to accord investments made by investors of the Other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment is thus, beyond all questions, evident, as it is also the fact that the investments protected by the FET standard of the BIT are only those admitted in the territory of the host State in accordance with its laws.\n\n269.\n\nIn the instant case, Claimants' investment was admitted on the occasion of the privatization of ENJASA, an Argentine company priorly created in the Province of Salta, holder of an exclusive license for the operation of games of chance in the provincial territory pursuant to provincial Law No. 7020 and subject in its business activity to the regulatory framework of said law and the company corresponding License Agreement. Potential violations or breaches by Licensee of legal or contractual obligations thereof was subject to sanctions by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020. This \"business risk\" was known and undertaken by Claimants when they participated in the *UTE* that acquired ENJASA shares and when they afterwards acquired the majority of said *UTE* shares and, thereafter, controlled, managed, ran, and administered ENJASA. Claimants' investment was, with no doubt whatsoever, duly admitted in Respondent's territory on the occasion of the privatization according to certain laws of the Argentine Province of Salta and it was, protected as such by the FET standard of the Argentina-Austria BIT but, provided that the company did not violate those laws and/or the License Agreement, in which case it could be sanctioned by the ENREJA, even, as it occurred, through the revocation of the License. Therefore, Claimants are not alien to the conduct adopted by ENJASA which determined the revocation sanction of the license the company held since, at the time of occurrence of the violations or breaches the revocation was grounded on, they had been controlling, managing, running, and administering ENJASA for years, what has been evidenced, beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever, by Claimants' behavior following the adoption by ENREJA of Resolution No. 240/13.\n\n270.\n\nIn their PHB, Respondent alleges that, in the circumstances of the instant case, the Arbitral Tribunal should essentially decide two questions regarding the applicable FET standard. The first one is determining whether due process and the right of defense were respected on occasion of the revocation of the license ENJASA held and, the second one, whether revocation of ENJASA's license was a reasonable measure.\n\n**(iii) The Content and Scope of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard Invoked by Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nNevertheless, Claimants disagree with Respondent's opinion on the applicable FET standard. For Claimants, the standard at issue would not be basically defined by the customary international law \"international minimum standard,\" but for one called \"autonomous treaty standard.\" Not only would this treaty standard be different, but it would also operate independently (autonomous) from the customary international law \"international minimum standard,\" and it would comprise a certain number of components or elements that would have been identified in recent decades by investment arbitral tribunals established under inter-State treaties, such as BITs. This would be the FET standard to which \u2013 according to Claimants \u2013 Article 2 (1) of the Argentina -Austria BIT would refer*.* The expression \"autonomous treaty standard\" has been already used by some arbitral tribunals, such as *Lemire v. Ukraine* (Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability of 14 January 2010, para. 284) but its concept and doctrine are far from clear, besides raising legal conundrums which, in the instant case, require certain elaborations and comments.\n\n272.\n\nFirst, in the case at issue the \"law applicable\" to the resolution of this dispute does not relieve the Parties or one of the Parties. It has been defined by Argentina and Austria under Article 8 (6) of the BIT they concluded in 1992 which, as already mentioned herein, does not exclude customary international law, quite the contrary. Secondly, the expression \"treaty standard\" used in this context by Claimants is particularly misleading since we are in no way whatsoever before a \"treaty standard\", i.e., before a standard defined in a written instrument concluded between subjects of international law and governed by said law, as per the definition of \"treaty\" in Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties. Besides, the practice of ad hoc international investment arbitral tribunals regarding the FET standard has multiple versions, it is frequently contradictory, and it should not be categorized in any way whatsoever as jurisprudence in the sense such term has in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ. Thirdly, Claimants' \"treaty standard\" lacks the fixity and objectivity any standard purported to be of regulatory nature shall have since the content and scope thereof are presented as a kind of a la carte menu that each litigator can shape to their liking, dismissing what makes them uncomfortable.\n\n273.\n\nThis legal uncertainty inherent in Claimants' \"treaty standard\" disqualifies it as a standard of regulatory nature of mandatory compliance by this Arbitral Tribunal. In any event, it does not fit in any of the three sources of \"law applicable\" to this dispute laid down in the aforementioned Article 8 (6) of the applicable BIT. Nor is it admissible that through the alleged and requested FET standard Claimants attempt to displace customary international law rules of unquestionable relevance for this dispute resolution. This question is not petty, since as it has been correctly pointed out by some investment arbitral tribunal, e.g., the Mondev v. USA tribunal, the fair and equitable treatment standard shall be determined \"by reference to international law, i.e., by reference to the normal sources of international law determining the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors\" (Award of 11 October 2002, para. 120).\n\n274.\n\nClaimants qualify their alleged standard as \"autonomous\" possibly for the purpose of setting it completely free from customary international law just as other claimant investors resort to the term *lex specialis* to the same end, when not even the so called self-contained regimes are such with respect to general customary international law as explained by the 2006 International Law Commission (ILC) study on the fragmentation of international law recently quoted by the *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas (and others) v. Venezuela* tribunal (Award on Jurisdiction of 13 December 2019, paras. 702 and 703) which, following up the assertions by the ILC on such study, concludes with the following paragraph, applicable *mutatis mutandis* to the instant case:\n\n\"It shall also be borne in mind that the relationship between *lex specialis* and self-contained regimes, on the one hand, and international law, on the other, is not subject to any concrete act of 'incorporation' whatsoever. Unless expressly repealed, principles imported from the general international custom apply. In other words, investment international arbitration is not a sphere entirely divorced from general international law. And this is particularly true when, like in the instant case, it is the Treaty between Spain and Venezuela itself, in Article XI (4) (b) which requires the Tribunal to apply the *\"rules and principles of International Law\"*\" (*Ibid.* para. 704 of the aforementioned Award.) [Translated by me]\n\n275.\n\nPursuant to Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, this Arbitral Tribunal shall adjudicate this dispute on the basis of, *inter alia,* \"the applicable principles of international law.\" This reference confirms the full applicability of customary international law to this dispute, as described at the paragraph quoted hereinabove. It is, thus, confirmed that not having been expressly set aside from the Argentina-Austria BIT, customary international law, its relevant principles and rules are fully applicable, when appropriate, to this dispute. The ILC's conclusions in its aforementioned 2006 study, are in line with the ICJ jurisprudence in the matter in the *ELSI* (1989) case, also mentioned *supra* herein. Besides, as provided for by the international law treaty rule of Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, Respondent's law shall also apply.\n\n276.\n\nAs expressly recognized by their allegations, Claimants have elaborated the so called \"autonomous treaty standard\" on the basis of citations of international investment arbitral tribunals' awards and decisions that have followed a trend more or less similar to that they advocate for in this arbitration and, particularly, of the statements by the *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal with respect to the question of whether the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaty extends or not beyond the customary international law minimum standard (Partial Final Award of 6 May 2016). The *Murphy* tribunal, which repeatedly quotes awards such as *Tecmed, Duke Energy* and *Azurix,* begins its considerations on the issue raised pointing out as follows:\n\n\"The international minimum standard and the **treaty standard** continue to influence each other, and, in the view of the Tribunal, these standards are increasingly aligned. This view is reflected in the *jurisprudence constante* not only of NAFTA case law, as discussed above, but also in the **arbitral case law associated with bilateral investment treaties.** Some tribunals have gone so far as to say that the standards are essentially the same. The Tribunal finds that there is no material difference between the customary international law standard and the FET standard **under the present BIT.** Certainly, the FET standard of the BIT is not lower than the international minimum standard. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine for the purposes of the present case whether the FET standard **reflects an autonomous standard** above the customary international law standard\" (para. 208 of the Award) (Emphasis added.)\n\n277.\n\nThis citation from *Murphy* on the FET standard of the BIT applicable to said case begins by drawing a distinction between the customary international law \"international minimum standard\" and what it calls the \"treaty standard\", that is to say, *in casu* the USA-Ecuador BIT, but it concludes refraining from deciding on the essential question of whether or not the latter standard was \"an autonomous standard\" with respect to the customary international law standard and \"above\" thereof. In these arbitral proceedings, Claimants go a long way beyond the position in *Murphy* since for them it is only relevant the \"treaty standard\", *i.e.*, in the instant case the standard of the 1992 Argentina-Austria BIT, which, as already asserted, does not define the FET standard. Consequently, the \"treaty standard\" is no other than the *a la carte* menu mentioned hereinabove.\n\n278.\n\nBesides, according to Claimants, their treaty standard would be \"autonomous\" with respect to the customary international law standard. The underlying intention to all this approach seems apparent. Claimants attempt to close at all costs the door not only, as we have already seen in another context, to Respondent's law, but also, in this context, to any application to the instant case of the customary international law FET standard which is sought to be displaced through a requested, subjective and extreme definition devised by themselves which is neither in line with the considerations of the *Murphy* tribunal they quote nor with the \"law applicable\" to the present dispute as defined by the Argentina-Austria BIT which incorporates among its sources customary international law.\n\n279.\n\nLastly, the support Claimants look for their own position in the award of the *Murphy* tribunal falls apart with no alleviation if one compares the relevant provisions of the USA-Ecuador BIT with those pertaining to the Argentina-Austria BIT. Article II (3) (a) of the USA-Ecuador BIT is not limited to laying down the duty to accord FET to investments made by nationals of the other Contracting Parties, but it adds the following phrase: *\"*and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law*\".* Facing this text, the *Murphy* tribunal is right when drawing a distinction between the customary international law standard the text guarantees and the higher standard that may be accorded which it calls \"treaty standard.\" In addition, the USA-Ecuador BIT is based upon a BIT model much different from that of the Argentina-Austria BIT given that: (i) it addresses the prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures in a sub-article separated from that concerning the FET (Article II (3) (b); (ii) it has a broader definition of the term \"investment\" (Article I); and (iii) Article VI on investor-host State dispute resolution lacks a sub-article on the \"applicable law.\"\n\n280.\n\nThe Argentina-Austria BIT is limited to stating, in Article 2 (1) thereof, the Contracting Parties' duty to accord investments made by nationals of the other Party \"at all times fair and equitable treatment,\" without adding to the text any material appurtenant, condition or clause or any other indication enabling the interpreter to conclude or presume that for the Argentina-Austria BIT there are (i) two FET standards: a \"customary international law standard\" and a \"BIT standard\" or (ii) only a \"BIT standard\" or one of a potentially applicable multilateral treaty. There is no FET treaty standard in the \"law applicable\" to this dispute, there is only, in the applicable BIT, a reference to \"fair and equitable treatment\" to be accorded at all times and this treatment cannot be other than that provided for by the \"customary international law standard\" fully applicable to this dispute under the provisions of both Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT as well as the ICJ case law in *ELSI*. It is nonsensical that Claimants invoke a so called \"autonomous treaty standard\" without the slightest piece of evidence or sign of the instrument where this alleged standard is found and failing to demonstrate that application of any such alleged standard by the Arbitral Tribunal is allowed by the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n281.\n\nAs already explained herein, in order to exclude a principle or rule of customary international law it is necessary to make it clear in the relevant treaty instrument as stated by the ICJ, not the other way around as some investment arbitral tribunals mentioned by Claimants seem to have done. In order to exclude a principle or rule of customary international law it is necessary to \"contract it out\" not to \"contract it in.\" It is as easy as that and the recurrence of the mistake by *ad hoc* arbitral tribunals reveals systemic deficiencies of understanding in the application of public international law by those tribunals.\n\n282.\n\nIn these arbitral proceedings, the so called \"autonomous treaty standard\" of the FET is a construction by Claimants that lacks virtuality to be able to displace application of the customary international law FET standard. There is no piece of evidence on the record prior, contemporary or subsequent to the 1992 BIT, that makes it possible to conclude that when Argentina and Austria adopted the reference to the FET in Article 2 (1) of the BIT, they had the intention to define the investment protection standard on the basis of the conclusions reached years later by other investment arbitral tribunals pursuant to bilateral treaties concluded between other States that might have agreed there between to go beyond the customary international law minimum standard. A different question would be to wonder whether after 1992 the international custom FET standard has developed its level of protection upwardly and, also, whether Argentina and Austria had the common intention in 1992 to ascribe (in Article 2 (1) of their BIT) an evolutive or dynamic sense to the expression \"fair and equitable treatment.\" In this arbitration, Claimants have failed to allege or attempt to show neither.\n\n283.\n\nLastly, Claimants seem to imply that the particular content they ascribe to the FET mentioned in Article 2 (1) of the BIT would be of mandatory compliance by the members of this Arbitral Tribunal. Should this pretense be confirmed, I can only reject it since the requested \"autonomous treaty standard\" is a self-construction with no regulatory effect whatsoever for this Arbitral Tribunal on the basis of none of the three sources of \"law applicable\" to this dispute laid down in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n**(iv) Applicability of Customary International Law to the Determination of the Content and Scope of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nClaimants' attempt to exclude the customary international law \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard contradicts, as already explained *supra,* the ICJ case law in *ELSI* since the Argentina-Austria BIT has not expressly rejected any such standard, and the ICJ case law specifically states that an \"important principle of customary international law should (not) be held to have been tacitly dispensed with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so\". *(**ELSI, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1989*, p. 42, para. 50.)\n\n285.\n\nApplication of the customary international law FET standard - as it occurs with the customary rule that a State is not bound to compensate an alien for the adverse effects arising from the normal exercise by its agencies of the State's regulatory and police powers - has not been expressly dispensed with by the Argentina-Austria BIT and, therefore, any such standard is also fully applicable in this ICSID arbitration to the resolution of Claimants' third claim. Article 8 (6) of said BIT so confirms it when ordering to apply, *inter alia,* \"applicable principles of international law,\" as well as Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention with its reference to \"such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" In that regard, it shall be borne in mind that a distinction shall be drawn between citations from awards or decisions by *ad hoc* international investment arbitral tribunals that confirm or explain a certain international law principle or rule (such as the *Sicula* award) and those which are mere declarations by the arbitral tribunal laying them down and which, as such, are not of mandatory compliance by other *ad hoc* international arbitral tribunals.\n\n286.\n\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that Claimants assert Respondent has violated the \"fair and equitable treatment,\" but they do not assert so upon the basis that Respondent has violated the customary international law objective standard in the matter, but upon the basis of an alleged self-devised FET standard qualified as \"autonomous treaty standard,\" (which, by the way, *has not been violated by Respondent either*) and failing to prove the mandatory nature thereof either for Respondent or for this Arbitral Tribunal. In any event, with the invocation of its so called \"autonomous treaty standard,\" Claimants place themselves outside the \"law applicable\" by this Arbitral Tribunal defined in Article 8(6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, since the source of this alleged standard is not the Respondent's law, or the Argentina-Austria BIT provisions, or the applicable principles of international law.\n\n**(v) Claimants' Assertion that Respondent Has Violated its Self-Defined \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard is Wrong**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nIn view of their position of principle on the content and scope of the autonomous treaty FET standard invoked as applicable to the present dispute, it is striking that Claimants have made no efforts in order to explain the regulatory and mandatory nature of such standard. They have merely cited a given number of passages from awards rendered or decisions issued by *ad hoc* arbitral tribunals concerning disputes between foreign investors and host States, which are certainly part of a diverse practice (case law), but, as stated *supra*, do not constitute as such a jurisprudence that works as a subsidiary means for the determination of rules of international law within the meaning of Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ. ICSID *ad hoc* arbitrations do not entail judicial decisions issued by a permanent tribunal such as the ICJ, and the ICSID Convention is not like the Statute of the ICJ, which is an integral part of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n288.\n\nHowever, it is on the weak basis offered by a most diverse practice that Claimants find support so as to conclude in their PHB, that Respondent allegedly violated the following components or constituent elements of their so-called \"autonomous treaty standard\" of FET that they claim to apply: (1) protection of legitimate expectations and obligation to act in good faith; (2) duty to act transparently*;* (3) protection from arbitrary state conduct*;* (4) due process; and (5) fair and equitable treatment, and the principle of estoppel and acquiescence.\n\n289.\n\nThese components of Claimants' FET standard do not even correspond to all the components of such standard invoked by claimants in *Murphy v. Ecuador* from which they claim to be their source inspiration. The Murphy's claimants asserted that the FET standard required a host State to: (1) protect and observe an investor's legitimate expectations; (2) ensure the stability and predictability of the legal and business framework; (3) act consistently and transparently towards the investor and its investment; and (4) act in good faith and treat the investor and its investment free from coercion and harassment (para. 196 of the Partial Final Award of 6 May 2016). A simple *prima facie* comparison ratifies that, for this trend, which is shared by Claimants, the content and scope of the FET standard would be some kind of *a la carte* menu in permanent expansion designed by the foreign investor according to its needs or whims in any given case. Anyways, all the components of Claimants' FET standard in the instant case, like those of claimants' FET standard in *Murphy*, are significantly higher in number than those identified in 2013 by the IIL in its Tokyo resolution*,* namely: (1) due process; (2) non-discrimination and non-arbitrariness; (3) due diligence; and (4) observance of legitimate expectations (see *supra* paragraph 253 of this Opinion).\n\n290.\n\nIn their arguments, Claimants apply the \"autonomous treaty\" standard of FET designed thereby to what they call an \"analysis of the facts\" of this case. Such analysis is, rather, a neat narration of their narrative on Respondent's purported violation of the standard defined by Claimants, which, on the other hand, is unsupported by vital evidence of the facts under study, but does not prevent them from concluding in their PHB that: (i) ENREJA failed to meet essential elements of the fair and equitable treatment standard, such as the obligation to act in good faith, transparently and in accordance with the legitimate expectations of the investor; (ii) ENREJA's conduct was allegedly arbitrary and failed to comply with basic notions of due process; and (iii) the revocation of the License was purportedly arbitrary. These conclusions are based on \"allegedly analyzed facts\" which are neither supported by the relevant evidence nor shown to have been admitted by Respondent.\n\n291.\n\nNevertheless, my considerations and conclusions on the regularity of the \"administrative proceedings\" pursued by ENREJA, whereupon ENJASA's License was revoked, on account of proved, serious and repeated violations or breaches by the company of its legal and contractual obligations, disprove all Claimants' conclusions mentioned *supra* to which I refer as far as Claimants' third claim is concerned. Such proceedings pursued by ENREJA which were concluded by Resolution No. 240/13 fully complied with due process requirements, ENJASA was ensured its right of defense before, during and after such Resolution, and the revocation of the License was a sanction provided for by Law No. 7020, which was known to and accepted by Claimants when, as members of the *UTE* in question, they participated and prevailed in the administrative proceedings pursued on the occasion of the privatization of ENJASA, which would have been impossible if they had not assumed at the time any and all ENJASA's obligations as Licensee stated in such Law, as well as in the company's License Agreement. Otherwise, the Transfer Agreement for ENJASA's Class \"A\" Shares between the said *UTE* and the Province of Salta would not have been concluded, and, thus, Claimants would not have invested in the exploitation of games of chance in the Province of Salta.\n\n292.\n\nENREJA imposed on ENJASA the sanction of revoking the company's License in the regular exercise of its duties and functions as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 due to Licensee's repeated and serious violations or breaches of the legal obligations stated in Article 5 thereof concerning, *inter alia*, the prevention of money laundering. Moreover, those serious and repeated violations or breaches occurred after ENREJA had expressly warned the company, more than once, that such conduct was inconsistent with the public purpose of preventing and prosecuting money laundering, and that its persistence could give rise to the revocation of the License, as was finally the case.\n\n293.\n\nThere is no contemporary information on record on complaints by privatized ENJASA about the regularity of the administrative proceedings pursued against it, whereupon ENREJA imposed the sanction of revoking its License, or on other complaints, which are worth mentioning, that the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority had violated due process and/or its right of defense to the detriment of the company in the course of such administrative proceedings. When ENREJA adopted the revocation sanction, it did nothing but meet its obligation to protect an evident public interest and it did so pursuant to the laws in force and effect, as well as ENJASA's License Agreement, in strict compliance with due process and the right of defense. All this is duly documented and proved on record.\n\n294.\n\nIn their arguments, Claimants often adopt the position of being, allegedly, the party aggrieved by ENREJA's revocation of the License when it was a measure adopted by the Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 as a sanction imposed on account of ENJASA's conduct of repeatedly violating or breaching its obligations as Licensee. The revocation was not the outcome of an undue initiative by ENREJA, but rather a measure adopted thereby *in response* to a repeated illegal conduct by ENJASA, which, when most of the relevant facts occurred, was controlled, managed, run and administered by Claimants, who now seek compensation for the adverse effects of ENREJA's sanction on their investment. In other words, Claimants are requesting this Arbitral Tribunal to award them compensation for the adverse consequences thereto of the sanction imposed by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 due to an illegal conduct by ENJASA, which was controlled thereby! In these circumstances, Claimants' frequent direct or indirect references in their arguments to Respondent's bad faith or arbitrariness do not make much sense and are groundless.\n\n295.\n\nLastly, the \"legitimate expectations\" of a foreign investor such as Claimants cannot consist, by definition, i.e., for being \"legitimate,\" in that the host State tolerates in its territory that the national company in which they have made the investment violates or breaches its legal and/or contractual obligations as Licensee. That is why, in the case at issue, Claimants' allegation of violation of their \"legitimate expectations\" has no *raison d'\u00eatre*, unless it is admitted that a foreign investor enjoys the privilege of total immunity from the adverse effects of the wrongful acts that the company in question has committed or may commit *when the investor manages and runs the ordinary course of business of the company in question, as in this case,* which, anyway, has not been contended by Claimants.\n\n296.\n\nIn addition, that does not seem to have been the intention of Argentina and Austria when they concluded their BIT in 1992, because (i) the definition of the term \"investment\" refers to any kind of asset invested \"*provided the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made*\" (Article 1 (1)); (ii) the contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made (Article 1, *in fine)*; (iii) the article on the \"promotion and protection of investments\" provides, *inter alia,* that each Contracting Party shall accord, in its territory, fair and equitable treatment to the investments admitted \"*in accordance with its legislation*\" (Article 2 (1)); and (iv) the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute are, *inter alia,* proper law applicable in order to settle investment disputes (Article 8 (6)).\n\n297.\n\nLastly, in international investment arbitration between investors and host States of the investment, there have been several cases related to the revocation, cancellation or denial of licenses, concessions or permits, some of which have been cited or mentioned by one or both of the Parties in these arbitration proceedings, but the circumstances or the facts and the law of none of which appear to be similar to those of the present dispute, where the injury alleged by the investor stems from a final legitimate sanction imposed by the host State's competent regulatory agency and enforcement authority on account of legal violations or breaches by the company in which the investor was not only the indirect majority shareholder when most of such violations or breaches were committed, but also controlled, managed, ran and administered the company on which the sanction was imposed.\n\n**(vi) Claimants' Allegations on Arbitrariness, Due Process and the Right of Defense, Denial of Justice and Legitimate Expectations Have Not Been Proved**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nSince their first allegations, Claimants have asserted that Respondent violated the FET standard for having: (i) arbitrarily revoked ENJASA's License; (ii) breached due process when revoking such License, as well as specific commitments that the Province of Salta had purportedly assumed in relation to their investment in ENJASA; and (iii) used ENREJA's supervisory function to harass ENJASA (para. 430 of the Memorial). But, of course, one thing is the narrative on account of these general assertions, and another one is proving what is stated. And, in the instant case, Claimants have not submitted the relevant evidence to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n299.\n\nAs regards the assertion that the revocation of ENJASA's License was arbitrary, Claimants have submitted no evidence whatsoever that ENREJA's actions in the administrative proceedings against ENJASA due to violations or breaches of the obligations mentioned in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 as Licensee were contrary to the \"rule of law,\" which is what must be proved so as to adduce the existence of arbitrariness under international law. As the ICJ stated in *ELSI*:\n\n\"Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law. This idea was expressed by the Court in the *Asylum* case, when it spoke of 'arbitrary action' being 'substituted for the rule of law'. It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\" (ICJ Reports 1989*,* p. 76, para. 128).\n\n300.\n\nThe treatment accorded in the Province of Salta to Argentine company ENJASA was, in each and every successive stage of its creation, privatization and performance of its duties, consistent with the procedural and substantive law in force and effect in the Province on the exploitation of games of chance, a well-known right of ENJASA as Licensee and of Claimants as shareholders of the company through their participation in the *UTE* that was the successful bidder. There was no arbitrariness at any level and at any time, but quite the opposite. The \"rule of law\" governed all the relevant actions taken by the provincial authorities. Nor was a new law applied on the occasion of the revocation of ENJASA's License that could have had a surprise effect on the company or its shareholders. What is apparent from those actions is precisely the complete lack of arbitrariness in the conduct of the competent provincial authorities and their tolerance towards a company which, between 2005 and 2013, gave reasons for the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 to institute more than 21 formal administrative proceedings for having violated or breached its obligations as Licensee, which ended with the imposition of sanctions, generally in the form of fines, which were paid with no objection from the company in almost all cases.\n\n301.\n\nThe revocation of the License was not an arbitrary or a capricious measure, but a sanction prescribed and necessary so as to reestablish the integrity of the obligations assumed by the company when it was granted the License. Claimants were cognizant of these obligations when they invested in the company upon its privatization, and later, even after its License was revoked under ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13. That explains the reason why Claimants have been unable to prove in this arbitration that ENJASA was treated, at some point, not just in connection with the revocation of the License, with \"arbitrariness,\" let alone, of course, that Claimants who were shareholders were subject to \"manifest arbitrariness\" as serious as that required by international law in order to prevail, as an exception, on the customary rule concerning the regular exercise by the competent body of the State's regulatory and supervisory or police powers invoked by Respondent.\n\n302.\n\nAs to \"due process\" and the right of defense, Professor Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e8s, Claimants' legal expert, described in his fourth report (para. 125) the constituent elements of the right to be heard and admitted at the hearing, without reservations, that ENJASA had had the opportunity to exercise its right of defense by answering charges, having access to and taking copies of files, and submitting evidence in its defense. Furthermore, (i) ENJASA obtained a well-founded resolution revoking the License as a sanction for the violations or breaches of its obligations as Licensee; (ii) next, the company was able to request and was granted interim relief, whereupon the application of the revocation decision was suspended while the recourse for reconsideration submitted by ENJASA was pending; (iii) the company was entitled to file a recourse against the revocation decision by means of such recourse for reconsideration or the appeal that it failed to choose; (iv) the company obtained a resolution dismissing the recourse for reconsideration, which specified in detail the reasons of fact and of law behind the resolution revoking the License, including the procedural question whereby no new evidence could be submitted during the recourse for reconsideration; (v) the company went on to exercise its right to resort to courts of justice by instituting contentious-administrative proceedings before the competent court for the Province of Salta, requesting the annulment of ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315; and (vi) the company withdrew from such contentious-administrative proceedings in Salta due to the fact that it had instituted these ICSID arbitration proceedings upon Claimants' request, not having thus exhausted the local court remedies available in the Province of Salta or, eventually, in the Argentine Republic. All these actions, proceedings and enquiries developed in the Province of Salta as usual from a legal and administrative standpoint, i.e., without incidents and in an absolutely peaceful and orderly manner. There is no evidence to the contrary in the documents submitted to this Arbitral Tribunal by both Parties.\n\n303.\n\nIn view of the non-exhaustive list of the foregoing paragraph, I wonder how can Claimants allege that ENJASA suffered a denial of \"due process\" and/or an attempt against its \"right of defense\" in Salta? And how can Claimants contend that that could happen without having exhausted the local court remedies available in the Province of Salta and, eventually, in the Argentine Republic? The subject-matter of this phase of the arbitration is not the issue of Respondent's consent to the ICSID arbitration governed by Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, but the Parties' rights and obligations in connection with the claims on the merits raised by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration and Respondent's rejection thereof. Therefore, the rule of previous exhaustion of local remedies \u2013 described by the case-law of the ICJ as an important principle of customary international law (ICJ Reports 1989, p. 42, para. 50) \u2013 is fully applicable, as it has not been expressly ruled out by Article 8 (6) or any other provision of the Argentina-Austria BIT. It is as applicable as it was in *ELSI* when the Chamber of the Court rejected the objection filed by the US to the application of the principle of previous exhaustion of local remedies invoked by Italy. That explains the reason why I believe not only that Claimants have failed to prove the allegation that there was a denial of \"due process\" or an attempt against ENJASA's \"right of defense,\" but also that such allegation by Claimants is inadmissible, because they have not exhausted Respondent's local court remedies.\n\n304.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the documents submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal by the Parties show that \"due process\" and ENJASA's \"right of defense\" were observed and applied by the competent bodies of the Province of Salta at every phase and moment in accordance with the \"Regulatory Framework of Games of Chance\" under Law No. 7020 and its regulations, ENREJA's regulatory operative rules, and the provincial Law of administrative procedure of the Province of Salta. Furthermore, as I have been expounding in this Opinion, there is no evidence of animosity towards ENJASA, as contended by Claimants. The company was heard by ENREJA at all times. In the exchanges subsequent to Resolution No. 240, as well-known witnesses for Claimants informed, the company was offered Casinos Salta and Boulevard. Even after the recourse for reconsideration of the revocation was dismissed by ENREJA's Resolution No. 315, the company was invited to participate in the Transition Plan in order to obtain a new license, which ENJASA refused, an attitude which, by the way, for the purpose of a potential reparation, appears to have contributed to the injury that it claims to have suffered (Article 39 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts).\n\n305.\n\nIn addition - and notwithstanding what has been stated about the non-exhaustion of Respondent's local remedies - Claimants' arguments on the merits on Respondent's violation of \"due process\" and ENJASA's \"right of defense\" vanish when reading the company's License Agreement. This Agreement expressly authorized the Provincial Executive Branch to declare ENJASA's License extinct or cancelled by operation of law in the event of violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020. Nonetheless, Salta did not choose the executive avenue, which was also legitimate, but the avenue of the guarantees of \"due process\" and \"right of defense\" of the administrative proceedings pursued by ENREJA as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 and its regulations, which offer the twofold possibility of filing administrative recourses, and resorting to the competent courts in contentious-administrative matters for the Province of Salta and instituting court proceedings against ENREJA's decisions.\n\n306.\n\nThe non-exhaustion of Respondent's local court remedies readily dispels other express or implied allegations by Claimants, such as those of \"manifest arbitrariness,\" \"evident inequality,\" or \"denial of justice.\" As recalled by the tribunal in *Toto Costruzione v. Lebanon,* citing Paulsson (*Denial of justice in international law,* 2005, p. 306):\n\n\"[\u2026] National responsibility for denial of justice occurs only when the system as a whole has been tested and the initial delict has remained uncorrected\u2026 The very definition of denial of justice encompasses the notion of exhaustion of local remedies. There can be no denial of justice before exhaustion\" (Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 September 2009, para. 164).\n\nOn other issues frequently raised in connection with the FET standard, such as \"due diligence,\" Claimants made virtually no allegations in this arbitration, and the \"discrimination\" contention was ruled out by the Arbitral Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n307.\n\nThe requirement of a transparent and consistent conduct on the part of the State is fully met in the present case. The regulatory legal framework of games of chance of the Province of Salta and ENJASA's License Agreement are known to the public and did not suffer unforeseeable alterations after Claimants' investment in the company, given that, as stated *supra*, the criteria for determination of the license fee were modified in 2008 by means of a Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN) in which ENJASA participated. Consequently, they complied with the requirement of a predictable and transparent legal framework.\n\n308.\n\nWith regard to Claimants' \"legitimate expectations,\" I have already stated the reason why, in the instant case, it is an allegation that does not go a long way, since the relevant expectations must be \"legitimate\" by definition. In this arbitration, Claimants are not in a position that allows them to contend that, when they invested in ENJASA, they had the protected expectation that the potential violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by Licensee (which are also expressly stated in the \"License Agreement\") would not be sanctioned with the revocation of the License held by the company in which they invested in full cognizance of the situation. What is more, had they been \"protected legitimate expectations,\" Claimants would not have been able to be disappointed at the actions of the provincial authorities of Salta, due to the fact that they never adopted an opaque or inconsistent conduct in relation to the legal and contractual obligations as Licensee of the company in which Claimants decided to invest through an *UTE*, nor at the scope of ENREJA's sanctioning powers in response to Licensee's violations or breaches of its obligations. In any case, Claimants have failed to furnish any evidence that, at the time of their investment, they were given any kind of unimaginable guarantee that allowed them to expect that ENREJA could refrain from or tone down the exercise of its sanctioning powers were that to have adverse effects on Claimants' investment.\n\n309.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and even though \"legitimate expectations\" *per se* may undoubtedly be protected by the applicable FET standard, except, pursuant to the ILL Tokyo Resolution, in the event of \"mere expectations of profit, in the absence of specific engagements undertaken towards (the investors) by competent State organs,\" of which there is no evidence in this case; and in spite of the fact, as stated *supra*, that:\n\n\"\u2026 [t]he obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly\" (*MTD Equity v. Chile, ad hoc* Committee, Decision on Annulment, para. 67).\n\n310.\n\nLastly, there is no doubt that the general principle of law of good faith also informs the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard, but it is shocking that Claimants, as direct majority shareholders in L&E and indirect majority shareholders in ENJASA, at the time when the events giving rise to the revocation of the License occurred, invoke good faith against Respondent, making inapposite references to estoppel and acquiescence, when it was under their very control and management that ENJASA committed the serious and repeated violations or breaches by Licensee of the obligations set out in both paragraphs of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, which led ENREJA to revoke the License as a sanction for such serious and repeated violations or breaches.\n\n311.\n\nThe rhetoric of notions or epithets in international arbitral proceedings does not take the proponent too far if the narrative is not supported by the relevant evidence in each of the claims made. Furthermore, in the instant case, in their Reply Claimants had acknowledged that the fair and equitable treatment standard does not abolish the State's right to adopt regulatory measures affecting investors' interests (para. 469 of the Reply), provided that measures are adopted in good faith, pursue a legitimate purpose, and are not unreasonable in the specific circumstances of the case. Claimants have failed to prove that the relevant actions taken by the authorities of the Province of Salta were governed by bad faith or pursued an illegitimate purpose nor that, in the specific circumstances of the case, the revocation of ENJASA's License was an unreasonable measure.\n\n312.\n\nIn addition, it should be recalled that, in the face of Respondent's defense on the merits, it does not suffice for Claimants to prove that there was a mere *quad non* violation by ENREJA of a given element or aspect of the FET standard under international law in order to prevail over Respondent's defense, such as a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law,\" or a \"complete lack of due process,\" or a \"denial of justice,\" etc. In other words, they must demonstrate that Respondent committed a most serious flagrant and manifest violation of customary international law. Claimants have not even attempted to prove anything remotely similar.\n\n**(vii) The Underlying Reasonableness of the Sanction Revoking the License**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nENJASA's obligations as Licensee of the exploitation of games of chance in the Province of Salta were perfectly clear and known to both Parties, as evidenced by the documents submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal. Such obligations cannot and should not be ignored as the majority Award attempts to do so as to prove the thesis that there was an abuse or unreasonableness on the part of Salta's authorities at the time of revoking ENJASA's License.\n\n314.\n\nThe same can be said about the truth of the violations or breaches by ENJASA that gave rise to a series of sanctions imposed by ENREJA since 2005, which were not at all challenged at the time by the management of ENJASA (which had been in Claimants' hands at least since 2007), which, as a general rule, tried to evade responsibility for such violations or breaches by the company without denying the facts as such, which were deemed to be accepted by the company, since ENJASA complied with the sanctions imposed without objecting thereto. It was after the revocation of the License that some of those facts were questioned by ENJASA and/or by Claimants, which was rather late to prevent the effects of their admissions on the administration of evidence. It is also worth recalling that ENREJA weighed at all times the more or less serious nature of the violation or breach in question before imposing the relevant sanction, as reflected in the statement of reasons of the resolutions. See, for example, Resolutions Nos. 32/008 (C-151), 39/2010 (C-164), 104/2010 (C-152), 128/2010(C-158), 129/2010 (C-159), 130/2010 (C-160), 151/2010 (C-161), 152/2010 (C-162), 153/2010 (C-163), 200/2010 (C-165), and 178/2012 (C-166).\n\n315.\n\nIn addition, ENJASA was a Licensee that repeated its violations or breaches, in particular, in connection with obligations relevant to the prevention of money laundering, such as those stated in *Article 5 of Law No. 7020*, which, eventually, led to the revocation of the License determined by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority by means of Resolution No. 240/13, pursuant to Article 13 of such Law, after the \"due process\" in which ENJASA's right of defense was fully *observed*. It is worth highlighting that Article 4 of the License confirmed, *inter alia*, that *Licensee* had an obligation to comply in its exercise of the License with all the provisions set forth in Law No. 7020 and the regulatory decree, as well as with all the rules issued by the Regulatory Agency within the framework of its competence.\n\n316.\n\nArticle 5 of Law No. 7020 - the relevance of which to the prevention of money laundering at casinos and gaming houses is evident - plays a vital role within the \"regulatory framework\" of games of chance in the Province of Salta, as expressly reflected in Article 6 of ENJASA's License Agreement which prescribed that failure to comply with the obligations imposed by *Article 5 of Law No. 7020* shall be grounds for extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the License by operation of law. Therefore, it is perfectly understandable that the violations or breaches of the provisions of such Article 5 raised the alarm and caused the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority to impose more severe sanctions as the violations or breaches became more recurrent until the License was eventually revoked by ENREJA in the course of administrative proceedings where \"due process\" and ENJASA's \"right of defense\" were fully observed, as explained *supra*.\n\n317.\n\nBesides, the repeated disregard for or failure to obtain the authorizations, carry out the controls or keep the records provided for in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 not only contravened public interest in the prevention of money laundering, but also influenced the determination of the amount of the yearly license fee to be paid by ENJASA, given that, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN) of 2008, the license fee scheme originally stipulated was replaced by a new calculation system based on a percentage of *ENJASA's duly recorded income* for the immediately preceding year, as a result of which it was absolutely necessary in order to comply with the new license fee to keep a strict control of ENJASA's real income, as it was on the basis of such income that the yearly percentages that ultimately determined the amount of the yearly licensee fee to be paid by the company to the Province of Salta were calculated.\n\n318.\n\nSurprisingly, the Parties have not said much about the adverse effects of the violations of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 on the calculation of the annual amount of the new fee and therefore on public financing of the Province of Salta. An online system was created but only to control income and prizes from slot machines, rather than income from table games at casinos. The concern about a proper estimate of the new fee also explains the issuance of Decree dated 26 November 2008, in which the Governor of the Province of Salta provided that ENREJA would be in charge of \"controlling, supervising, auditing and taking any necessary action in order to follow up and collect the fee payable by ENJASA to the Provincial State for the license to operate games of chance on an exclusive basis\" (Official Gazette of the Province of Salta, Decree No. 5313/08) [Translated by me]. This Decree answers Claimants' complaint about being unduly harassed by ENREJA in the years before revocation of the license. In other words, the violations or breaches of Licensee's obligations listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 have not only weakened the struggle against money laundering, but also had a negative impact on the Province's financing.\n\n319.\n\nIn analyzing the reasonableness of ENREJA's decision to revoke the license held by ENJASA, consideration should be given not only to the cultural, social and geographical context of the Province of Salta where the facts took place, but also to the legal context of the revocation after ENJASA was sanctioned for breach and violation of Law No. 7020 more than twenty times and warned by ENREJA that such a repeat behavior on the part of Licensee could lead to revocation of the License, as set forth in Article 13 of said Law. The purpose and appropriateness of ENREJA's decision were also endorsed by the increasing concern in the States and the international community about preventing money laundering, a crime considerably developed in the decade when the disputed facts took place, adopting new measures, laws and agreements at both levels in order to prevent it as part of the struggle against drug trafficking, smuggling and terrorism.\n\n320.\n\nENREJA's responsibility and duty of involvement in such struggle, within the scope of its jurisdiction, are unquestionable and understandable for two reasons: first, the power to regulate and control games of chance is constitutionally vested in the Province of Salta and, second, casinos and the sector of games of chance are generally vulnerable to money laundering and the border geographical location of the Province makes it particularly exposed to criminal activities of money laundering, which requires a very strict control and severe regulations as explained in detail by Mr. Biagosh, expert for Respondent, in his expert reports and at the hearing. That clearly explains the pioneering nature of the laws of the Province of Salta on this matter. Recently, the Financial Information Unit (UIF, for its Spanish acronym), the body in charge of following up and monitoring compliance with the FATF recommendations at the national level in Argentina, has imposed the maximum fine upon ENJASA and its officers, including Mr. Tucek, for violation of rules and recommendations against money laundering. Seemingly, this case is currently on appeal, but it can nevertheless be stated that such decision from the UIF confirms the general conclusion that ENJASA violated or breached its obligations as Licensee, which was also why ENREJA sanctioned it with revocation of the License (now apparently in appeals proceedings).\n\n321.\n\nMoreover, it should be recalled that the obligation to obtain prior authorization from ENREJA to hire third-party operators (the violation of such obligation was one of the grounds for revocation of the license), undertaken by ENJASA both under Article 5 (first paragraph) of Law No. 7020, matches the recommendation 28 (a) of the FATF (FATF, 40 Recommendations, February 2012) which reads as follows:\n\n\"Casinos should be subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime that ensures that they have effectively implemented the necessary AML/CFT measures. At a minimum:\n\n- Casinos should be licensed;\n\n- competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminal**s** or their associates from holding or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, holding a management function in, or being an operator of, a casino; and\n\n- competent authorities should ensure that casinos are effectively supervised for compliance with AML/CFT requirements.\"\n\nIt is thus confirmed, by a particularly competent third party, that, in order to prevent money laundering, knowing the identity of the owners, operators, managers, employees and other members of the personnel of casinos and gaming halls facilitates the States' follow-up of the activities conducted by said individuals, so that they are not directly or indirectly involved in customers' money laundering practices.\n\n322.\n\nThe same applies to the obligations of identification and registration of gamblers and their operations, as well as the methods of payment of prizes exceeding ARS 10,000, as provided in Article 5 (second paragraph) of Law No. 7020, which was the second ground for revocation of ENJASA's License. I have already explained *supra* in this Opinion that the manner of paying and recording those prizes, as required by ENREJA under applicable laws, had already been accepted in 2005 by ENJASA (letter from Mr. Petersen, attorney-in-fact for ENJASA, to the President of ENREJA, dated 30 August 2005, RA-193). It is not reasonable that Claimants, on the one hand, maintain ENJASA's continuity and, on the other, dispute the effects of said acknowledgment by the company once they became majority shareholders of Leisure & Entertainment S.A.(L&E). Additionally, there is no doubt in that regard since ENJASA's License Agreement listed\u2014among the obligations of Licensee\u2014the obligation to \"enable and provide for the measures, proceedings, control and surveillance that ENREJA shall apply on a periodic basis\" (Article 4.1.7 of ENJASA's License).\n\n323.\n\nContrary to what is often the case in international arbitration of investment disputes, in this case there was also no relevant statutory or contractual modification after privatization of ENJASA likely to affect Claimants' potential legitimate expectations, since the fee was modified by means of the Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN) executed between the Province and the company when Claimants were already majority shareholders of the company through L&E. Hence, there is no reason to refer to \"Claimants' expectations frustrated\" by statutory amendments or reviews of ENJASA's license agreement. Moreover, as explained in my Statement annexed to the Arbitral Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, I disagree with the opinion that the \"legitimate expectations\" protected by Argentina-Austria BIT could be deemed subjective expectations of investors with no basis on the License Agreement, Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta or, eventually, specific agreements between ENJASA and/or its shareholders and the Province of Salta, whose existence has not been established on the record of these proceedings.\n\n324.\n\nThus, for example, the allegation by a claimant who, upon investing in ENJASA, had believed that the exclusive license was irrevocable during its 30-year effective term could not be deemed a \"legitimate expectation\", since the relevant provisions of Law No. 7020 and the License Agreement provide for the possibility, in specific cases, to revoke the license at any time as a sanction for Licensee's violation or breach of Article 5 of said Law, by decision of the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority upon completion of the relevant administrative proceedings, and that the License Agreement itself may be declared terminated and/or expired automatically and by operation of law by the Provincial Executive prior to the License's expiration date for any of the grounds listed in the agreement.\n\n325.\n\nWhen a foreign investor claims having had a \"legitimate expectation\" frustrated by an action of the State in whose territory they made an investment, they must be as accurate as possible in identifying the allegedly frustrated \"legitimate expectation\". It is not good enough to simply repeat general statements that their expectations have been frustrated. The investor must specify which expectation has been frustrated and the reasons of the purported frustration, as well as when and how. For example, in the instant case, when Claimants' counsel time and again referred to their clients' \"legitimate expectations\", they did so without further detail. Thus, there is no way to know, for example, if they had those expectations when they owned 5% of the shares of L&E, when they became majority shareholders with 60%, or when, after revocation of ENJASA's license, they acquired approximately the remaining 40%, or if they had \"legitimate expectations\" at all times since they were, by nature, independent from their shareholdings.\n\n326.\n\nIn the course of their latest allegations and at the hearings, Claimants and some of their experts attempted to spread the idea that somehow the amendments of Law No. 7020/99 by Law No. 7133 of 2001 had adverse effects on ENREJA's measures to ENJASA's license. Such conclusion is inapposite. As already explained in this Opinion, this dispute should not be decided on the basis of the provisions on additional competencies and sanctions vested in ENREJA by Law No. 7133/01 as regards the exercise of police power against natural and legal persons that incur administrative infractions in relation to games of chance in the Province, but rather on the basis of the provisions of Law No. 7020 on the obligations of licensees as such in their dealings with the Province of Salta, like those listed in Article 5 of the Law, and the applicable sanctions to such licensees for violation or breach of such obligations are those set forth in Article 13 of the Law. The majority Award incurs a manifest error in assuming, in whole or in part, such Claimants' arguments in that regard.\n\n327.\n\nENREJA Resolution No. 240 already rejected ENJASA's attempt to qualify the violations by ENJASA of the obligations listed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 as \"administrative infractions\" in order to describe the fact that ENREJA punished it with one of the sanctions listed in Article 13 of the Law (*i.e.*, \"revocation of the license\") as an abuse. Since Claimants have attempted to do something similar in these proceedings, it should be recalled that ENREJA has at all times underscored that the powers to fulfill its purpose, under Article 33 of Law No. 7020, include *two different situations*. For example, Resolutions Nos. 030/10 and 128/10 of March and May 2010, respectively, state as follows:\n\n\"\u2026Law No. 7020 as amended () conferred (upon the Agency) jurisdictional and disciplinary powers (Article 33) and, as regards the latter, a distinction should be drawn between two situations: the breaches or violations of the law, its regulations, license agreements and rules issued by the Agency, which shall be sanctioned by Warning, Fine, Disqualification, Suspension of the License and Revocation of the License (Article 13); and administrative infractions subject to, either singly or in combination, Fine. Disqualification, Seizure or Closure (Article 41). Additionally, in terms of sanctions, Article 5 of Decree No. 3616/99 provides for six events of extinction and/or cancellation of the license\" (first page of both Resolutions). [Translated by me]\n\n328.\n\nOnce again, the underlying consistency and reasonableness of the decision to revoke the license are confirmed. Respondent's legal expert, Professor Marcer, is right in his report when he distinguishes, within the provincial \"regulatory framework\" of games of chance of Law No. 7020, the provisions applicable to a licensee, like ENJASA, in its dealings as such with the Province of Salta, including the sanctions listed in Article 13 thereof for *\"[f]ailure to comply with the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Law No. 7020\"*, from the provisions of the Law on *\"[a]dministrative infractions applicable to natural or artificial persons\"*, added by Law No. 7133/01.\n\n**(viii) Assessment and Extent of the Sanction and the Alleged Proportionality Criterion**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe \"proportionality\" criterion as such is neither a constituent element of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard, nor does it directly control the application of such standard unlike, for example, good faith. However, the \"proportionality\" criterion might be an integral part of a rule or principle or affect the extent of the seriousness of a violation. This is the case here since, under Article 8 (6) of Argentina-Austria BIT, Argentine law is \"applicable law\" in the settlement of this dispute, and both Article 13 of Law No. 7020 and Article 5 of ENJASA's License Agreement expressly refer to the existence of \"proportionality\" between the sanction and the seriousness of the committed infraction.\n\n330.\n\nIndeed, as mentioned *supra* herein, Article 13 of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta provides *in fine* that, in adopting sanctions under said Article, ENREJA shall take into account \"the seriousness of the violation or breach, notwithstanding any criminal liability or liability for contraventions.\" In turn, Article 5(1) and (2) of ENJASA's License Agreement stipulated that \"[e]ach of the violations or breaches on the part of the licensee to Law No. 7020, its regulation provisions and the regulations issued by ENREJA shall be punished with the sanctions and graduation established in Law No. 7020 and its implementing regulation\" and that \"[c]onsideration, application and grading of the sanction shall be analyzed by ENREJA and sanctions should be proportional to the seriousness of the committed infraction.\"\n\n331.\n\nTherefore, undoubtedly, ENREJA must take into account the due proportionality between \"the seriousness of the committed infraction\" and the \"sanction\", regardless of the administrative and/or judicial recourses available to the sanctioned Licensee. As stated *supra* in this Opinion, Article 5(3) of the License Agreement sets forth how ENREJA should proceed in considering *in concreto* the application of a sanction, namely, weighing the seriousness of the infraction, the extent to which the rule of law, morality and good customs are impaired, the damages it causes to the provincial State and/or private persons, the social commotion it may produce and the licensee\u00b4s record of recidivism.\n\n332.\n\nThe system does not allow ENREJA acting without taking into account the due \"proportionality\", as appropriate. But that is no impediment to wonder whether ENREJA, upon deciding to revoke ENJASA's license, duly assessed such proportionality under Argentine applicable law and, if not, whether it could be concluded that its actions violated the FET standard of Article 2(1) of Argentina-Austria BIT. Nonetheless, in my opinion, the issue was settled when, in response to the question about how the term \"proportionality\" should be defined under Argentine law, Claimants' legal expert, Professor Bianchi, replied at the hearing that:\n\n\"Well, in reference to the principle of proportionality, to put it in a nutshell, proportionality is reasonableness. If there's something that is proportional, that means it is reasonable. And what does \"proportional\" mean in Argentinian law? It means that means is adequate to the end. That is the principle of proportionality, sir, and the principle of reasonableness.\" (Hearing on the Merits, Day 5, 121:8-15)\n\n333.\n\nThis answer by Professor Bianchi was disputed by neither Party. Thus, under Argentine law, the revocation of ENJASA's license was proportional since it was a reasonable measure adopted for the legitimate purpose of preventing money laundering in an activity as prone to the commission of such crimes as the operation and management of games of chance, conducted in a Province particularly exposed to those crimes due to its border geographical location. However, money laundering practices might also have an adverse impact on the determination of the fee stipulated under the Memorandum of Understanding. Accordingly, the sanction to revoke ENJASA's license met the aforementioned proportionality criterion, as it was a reasonable measure, on account of its appropriateness and consistency with its purpose, adopted to eradicate from the Province of Salta the said practices which ENJASA could not or refused to accept despite the sanctions applied and the warnings given before revocation of the license by ENREJA Resolution No. 240/13.\n\n334.\n\nThe documentation submitted by Respondent to the Arbitral Tribunal confirms that ENJASA repeatedly violated its obligations as Licensee and that these breaches ensued on a continuous basis without the company denying them, but merely alleging that they were unintentional, insignificant, or just mistakes by ill-informed employees. In any case, ENJASA paid the fines or complied with the sanctions applied by ENREJA during the period from 2005 to August 2013, without filing any administrative appeal against those sanctions or resorting to the competent courts for the Province of Salta. These acknowledgements confirm that ENJASA repeatedly acted in violation or breach of its obligations as Licensee, even with respect to money laundering prevention, which ultimately led ENREJA to decide to revoke the License held by the company.\n\n335.\n\nThis revocation sanction could not surprise either ENJASA or Claimants, as there is documentary evidence that it had been preceded by more than one warning from ENREJA. Additionally, the sanction was applied by ENREJA in strict compliance with the applicable legal provisions of Law No. 7020, previously accepted and acknowledged by ENJASA and well known by Claimants as both shareholders and executive directors of the company, which provisions were also incorporated into Licensee's License. The reference made in the recitals of Resolution No. 240/13 to the 21 preceding Resolutions in which the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under Law No. 7020 had to formally sanction ENJASA, evidence the repeated nature of the anomalies identified in Licensee's behavior and the need to protect the integrity of the \"regulatory framework\" of games of chance in the Province of Salta of Law No. 7020 and the License Agreement, comply with the calculation of the statutory annual fee payable by ENJASA under the Memorandum of Understanding, and restore the very authority of the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority under such Law. The grace period that lasted a few years ended in August 2013 when ENREJA adopted\u2014in accordance with the principle of legality and the proportionality criterion under Argentine law\u2014Resolution No. 240, without prejudice to the internal administrative and judicial recourses available to Claimants, which ENJASA had access to at all times until Claimants filed these proceedings with the ICSID before exhausting the aforementioned local recourses.\n\n336.\n\nThere is no other proportionality criterion applicable to this dispute under the BIT, non-existing investment agreements, or the FET standard of customary international law applied to this dispute. Also, the \"proportionality\" is not a part of the rule of customary international law relied upon by Respondent in its merits defense. Moreover, there is no room within the definition of \"applicable law\" under Article 8(6) of the BIT to refer to guidelines, methods or estimates of proportionality not regulated under \"applicable law\", which might distort or violate said \"applicable law\" agreed upon under the BIT between Argentina and Austria, such as the proposal to artificially introduce in the decision-making process of the Arbitral Tribunal an abstract weighting of the \"rights of the investor\" against the \"host State action\" by means of the so-called \"proportionality *stricto sensu\"*, mentioned but not elaborated on by Claimants.\n\n337.\n\nIn any event, restricting the assessment to the \"rights of the investor\", on the one hand, and the \"host State action\", on the other, means requesting or conditioning the answer. Indeed, both the \"rights and obligations of the foreign investor\" and the \"rights and obligations of the host State\" should be weighed, if appropriate. Otherwise, the aforementioned method is inadmissible under the system of public international law in which States are the primary subjects. For example, in a case like this, the revocation of the license is not a mere \"State action\" but a legitimate sanction applied by the competent State authority against the previous violation by Licensee of the rights of the \"provincial State\" that owned and granted the License.\n\n338.\n\nIt is not uncommon that these academic legal exercises are, deliberately or inadvertently, focused on limiting the rights of the host State in the interest of private foreign investors by using *prima facie* equitable terms or concepts, and even intending to do so when the compensation requested by the investor is not only legally groundless but also evidently disproportionate to the capital invested by the investor as in the instant case, based on the evidence on record. I say evidence because I am yet to receive from Claimants a clear answer to the question posed to their first witness during the jurisdictional phase, and asked again at the hearing on the merits, on the total amount of their capital contribution as investors in ENJASA.\n\n339.\n\nHaving been submitted by the Parties, both the improved economic bit of the *UTE* (CAIH, Boldt S.A. and Iberlux Int. S.A.) and the agreement between said *UTE*\u2014 successful bidder\u2014and the Province of Salta, that is, the so-called \"Transfer Agreement\" of ENJASA, annexed to Decree No. 419 dated 15 February 2000, are known to the Arbitral Tribunal. The *UTE*'s improved economic bid consisted of an annual fee of USD 2,500,000 for the first three years, an annual fee of USD 4,100,000 for the 27 subsequent years, and a total investment based on the \"Tourism Development Investment Plan\" of USD 20,770,000 (paragraphs 7 and 9 of the recitals of Decree No. 419 of 15 February 2000.) In turn, Article 3.1 of said Agreement for the Transfer of Shares to the *UTE Leisure & Entertainment (L&E)*, titled \"Sale of Class 'A' Shares\", sets forth: \"The Seller agrees to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Seller ten thousand eight hundred (10,800) registered, non-endorsable, common Class A shares representing NINETY PERCENT (90%) of the capital stock of ENJASA, with a face value of ONE PESO (ARS 1) each.\" Moreover, the *UTE*'s shareholding upon purchase of said Class \"A\" shares of ENJASA was as follows: CAIH 5%, Boldt 5%, and Iberlux 90%.\n\n340.\n\nIn light of this information, the cost of 5% of the \"Class A\" shares for CAIH was likely more than 5% of the ARS 10,800 paid by the UTE for all the shares purchased, which means that the cost of its first shares in ENJASA for CAIH was about ARS 1,000. As for the second aspect of the privatization transaction, more specifically the purchaser's obligation to comply in due time and manner with the Tourism Development Investment Plan, the Parties agree that the Hotel Sheraton Salta was built and that the construction was performed by *Complejo Monumento G\u00fcemes* (CMG). Moreover, Respondent has explained how the Hotel was built, submitting the \"Notes to the Statement of Financial Position\" of CMG of 31 May 2002 (note 2, at CEMA 27), then the examination of witness Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez by Mrs. Etchegorry (Day 3 of the Hearing, 78:4-79:9) and, finally in a summary at paragraph 266 of the Post-Hearing Brief (PHB) which reads:\n\n\"With respect to the ownership and operation of Hotel Sheraton Salta, the revocation of the License did not affect its ownership and operation. In effect, ENJASA continued to be the owner of this hotel and obtained considerable economic benefits derived from it. Furthermore, *it has been established that the hotel was built with tax allowances and benefits and subsequently sold at market price*. *For this sale transaction, ENJASA yielded a considerable accounting reference.\"* [Source: ENJASA's Financial Statements as of 31 December 2017, Notes 3, 15, 19 and 20 (Exhibit C-299). According to Note 3.15, the profit obtained from the sale was ARS 20,590,902.]\n\n341.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal knows that: (i) Hotel Sheraton Salta was effectively built within the scope of the Tourism Development Investment Plan; (ii) the revocation of the License did not affect ENJASA's ownership or operation of the Hotel; (iii) the Province of Salta contributed to the construction of the Hotel with tax allowances and benefits; and (iv) after revocation of its License, ENJASA yielded an accounting profit in the order of ARS 20,590,902 from the sale of the Hotel to Inversiones Hoteleras Salta S.A. on 1 March 2017. It is still unclear whether there was any connection between the tax allowances and benefits granted by the Province during the construction of the Hotel and compliance by the *UTE* with its improved economic bid of making an aggregate investment under the Tourism Development Investment Plan of approximately USD 20,770,000, and whether there would possibly be a relationship, based on how that aid is quantified, with regard to the commitment included in the *UTE*'s improved economic bid.\n\n342.\n\nIn any case, the Province of Salta contributed to the construction of the Hotel without claiming any participation in either ownership or operation of the Hotel. In other words, it was a non-refundable aid from the Province to the company. Other capital contributions made by Claimants were necessarily in the two transactions that increased their shareholding, that is, in 2007, when they increased their interest in L&E from the initial 5% to 60% and, in November 2013, a few days following ENREJA Resolution No. 315/13, when they increased said interest from 60% (in 2007) to almost 100%.\n\n343.\n\nClaimants have not been so accurate about the price paid for the new shares in L&E. As for the increased interest in 2007, the offer to purchase presented to Iberlux was for USD 23,000,000 (Exhibits C-076, C-0077 and C-078), but other testimonies mention that the disbursement was of about USD 17.4 million plus an additional capital investment of USD 6.6 million (Day 8 of the Hearing, page 4 *in fine* of the English transcript). As regards the 2013 increase in shareholding after revocation of the License in September 2013 (purchase from Iberlux of 40% of L&E's shares), Mr. Tucek merely indicated at the hearing that the disbursement was relatively small compared to the amount invested by Casinos in Argentina ever since 2000 (Day 2 of the Hearing, pages 246/247 of the English transcript). However, in that regard, the First CEMA Report explains that Casinos Austria paid USD 2.82 million to Iberlux for such interest and the promise of an additional payment of USD 1 million if the Province restored ENJASA's License, which did not occur (paragraph 184 of said Report). As represented in the statement by Claimants' expert, Mr. Rosen, ENJASA \"was very profitable\" (Day 8 of the Hearing, page 6 of the English transcript) the capital invested by Claimants in the stock purchase was relatively small and as such bears no proportion to the compensation requested by them in their Post-Hearing Brief, based on the reports and the statements made by their expert, Mr. Rosen.\n\n344.\n\nUndoubtedly, for that reason, the compensation requested by Claimants has been calculated in terms of \"loss of profits\", rather than the amount of capital invested in ENJASA through L&E. Indeed, \"loss profits\" may be included in \"compensation\" for the damage concerned where it is the result of an \"internationally wrongful act\" not existing in the instant case, provided such loss of profits has been duly established (Article 36(2) of the ILC's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts). It is therefore undisputed that speculative elements are taken into account to determine such loss of profits, as Mr. Rosen did who, in assessing \"loss of profits\", considered the fact that Claimants alleged having suffered from termination of the existing agreement between ENJASA and Video Dromo, an event which has not been established on the record.\n\n345.\n\nThe capital *contribution* made by Claimants in ENJASA was relatively modest, as confirmed by the fact that their request for compensation in this arbitration is not based on the depreciation of that contribution as a consequence of the revocation of the license held by the company, but on Claimants' loss of profits or benefits (dividends) as ENJASA's shareholders through L&E. Therefore, Claimants are seeking a higher compensation than they should have been entitled to, if appropriate, on account of the depreciation of the capital invested. In any case, the conclusions in the reports and statement of Mr. Rosen are clearly speculative and disproportionate. They do not match the factual and legal elements of this dispute because the expert adopts *\"(the) value of what was taken\"* in Salta as the baseline of his analysis (Day 8 of the Hearing, page 37). Nothing has been taken from anyone in this dispute. Rather, Respondent's competent body has revoked a license as a sanction for ENJASA's violation of its obligations as Licensee, taking into account *inter alia* the proportionality criterion under Argentine law which is the \"applicable law\" in this treaty claim*.*\n\n346.\n\nIn response to such a distortion of the factual and legal reality of this case, that is, the transformation of a \"revocation\" into an alleged \"confiscation\", the well-known phrase of the tribunal in Azinian that *\"labelling... is no substitute for analysis\"* would suffice. The reports and statements of Respondent's expert, Mr. Dapena, explain, in a convincing manner, the speculative and disproportionate nature of the findings of Mr. Rosen as regards the compensation sought by Claimants. In addition to these findings from Mr. Dapena, it should be noted, in this context, that Claimants are seeking compensation without previously establishing that the revocation of ENJASA's License was an \"internationally wrongful act\" which Respondent should remedy, as demonstrated in this Opinion.\n\n347.\n\nIt should be noted that, having requested compensation on the basis of ENJASA's lost profits leading to revocation of the company's 30-year exclusive License, Claimants have added another reason to those mentioned *supra*, which confirms Respondent's allegation that no compensation is owed to Claimants (PHB, paragraphs 270 to 356). Why has this happened? Because international law on the promotion and protection of foreign investments distributes risk factors between the host State and the foreign investor concerned, allocating some of those factors to the State and others to the foreign investor. For example, under such law, the State assumes liability for the adverse effects of any modification of the agreement, the laws or the treaty that affects the legitimate expectations of the investor, whereas the investor bears the risk of any adverse effects of management, direction or administration of the company (or business or economic activity) in which it has invested, that is, the \"business risk\". In the instant case, when the violations or breaches that caused revocation of the license were committed, Claimants were not only shareholders of the company but also entrepreneurs that managed, ran and administered it, and therefore, as investors, they had to cope with the adverse effects of the \"business risk\" inherent in the license of the company in which they freely invested, as such license was revocable in nature\u2014and was indeed revoked\u2014pursuant to the Applicable Law and the License Agreement, at any time within its 30-year term of duration. Thus, in this case, the adverse effects of revocation of the license shall be borne by Claimants in their dual capacity as investor and entrepreneur.\n\n348.\n\nTo sum up, ENREJA duly applied the \"proportionality criterion\" of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta and ENJASA's License Agreement, and it is not for this Tribunal to substitute said criterion *for mere authors' criteria or a proportionality* stricto sensu *imported from sources outside this investment dispute*, since (i) the decision to revoke the license has become final; (ii) the proceedings in the Province of Salta are outside the scope of this dispute, but shall be applicable law in this dispute according to the Argentina-Austria BIT, and (iii) Claimants do not apply a proportionality *stricto sensu* between their investment and the compensation in determining the amount requested, as evidenced in their reports and the statement of Respondent's expert, Mr. Dapena, on Day 8 of the Hearing.\n\n**(ix) On the Political Conspiracy Alleged by Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe references in Claimants' allegations to terms or expressions such as lack of transparency, concealed purposes, bad faith, xenophobia, or the like, by the authorities of the Province of Salta, in relation to events prior to, contemporary with or subsequent to revocation of ENJASA's License, are part of their statements on the existence of political conspiracy by said authorities, repeatedly mentioned though never established, aimed at excluding them from the sector of games of chance within the jurisdiction of the Province. Though the political conspiracy argument has been losing weight throughout these arbitral proceedings, several paragraphs of Claimants' PHB deal with it, which compels me to express my view on this unfounded allegation.\n\n350.\n\nThe theory of conspiracy was, at the beginning of this arbitration, a merely argumentative construction of a strategic nature, unrelated to Claimants' current situation in the Province of Salta. This theory might have been developed in order to create the image of a presumption of liability on the part of the host State, as generally reflected in the practice of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, established by the Algiers Declaration as a result of the international crisis of hostages, which presumption operates as a backdrop for the case-law of said Tribunal on indirect expropriation.\n\n351.\n\nBut this Arbitral Tribunal is not the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, the Argentina-Austria BIT is not comparable to the Algiers Declaration, and the revocation of ENJASA's License is not related to or based on any revolutionary act but aimed at restoring the legality violated by Licensee's improper behavior. It was a peaceful act adopted upon completion of a perfectly organized and arranged procedure, in accordance with previous laws and regulations, known to and accepted by said Licensee and Claimants in this arbitration, and applied to ENJASA by the competent provincial Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority within the framework of the constitutional and democratic principles of the rule of law of the Argentine Republic and its Province of Salta. A presumption as that of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal is therefore absolutely alien to this arbitration, because the situation in the Province of Salta of the Argentine Republic before, during and after the aforementioned revocation was completely normal, and the stages of the procedures followed were in accordance with the principles of legality, due process and guarantee of the right of defense of a Licensee which also violated both the Law 7020 and the License Agreement.\n\n352.\n\nThe revocation was decided by the competent body in the regular exercise of its duties as a sanction upon ENJASA for having repeatedly violated and breached its obligations as Licensee. As we have seen, such revocation was not contrary to Respondent's duty to afford Claimants' investment a fair and equitable treatment under customary international law. Respondent did not violate the FET standard and hence ENREJA committed no internationally wrongful act in sanctioning the serious and repeated violations of ENJASA's obligations as Licensee under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 on money laundering prevention at casinos and gaming halls. Such decision by ENREJA, attributed to Respondent, did not violate any legal system included within the \"applicable law\" of this dispute, listed in Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT and, in the absence of this objective element of international responsibility of a State, there is no internationally wrongful act.\n\n353.\n\nAt the beginning of this arbitration, Claimants alleged political conspiracy against them in order to facilitate, in addition to insisting on the non-strict application of applicable law, a certain tolerance from the Tribunal towards Claimants' nonfulfillment of the conditions that Respondent's consent to arbitration is subject to under Article 8 of the Argentina-Austria BIT. Having accomplished this purpose, at this phase on the merits, Claimants have made no evidentiary effort to establish the existence of said conspiracy, though they continued recalling it from time to time, without further detail and insistence. The statement by Mr. Tucek at the hearing, in the course of his examination as a witness, put an end to any eventual remaining credibility of this allegation when he recognized that the proposition to \"oust the Austrians\" was reduced to a mere saying of a third party (an *\"oui-dire\")*, unknown to this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n354.\n\nThe truth is that, in the course of these arbitral proceedings, Claimants' allegation on conspiracy has never been accompanied with objective probative elements that establish its veracity. The allegation has always lacked credibility. At the hearings, when Mr. Tucek was asked about the existence of a political purpose goal concealed behind revocation of ENJASA's license, he was unable of showing that CAI was being pursued. He acknowledged having signed a letter that evidenced his good relationship with the president of ENREJA and he further explained that he had no personal knowledge of the alleged harassment suffered by ENJASA at the hands of ENREJA but instead actually heard it from a colleague at the office. In view of this statement by the most senior witness of all witnesses appearing for Claimants, there is nothing from the allegation on political conspiracy submitted at the beginning of this arbitration.\n\n355.\n\nBut nostalgia for Claimant's allegation on political conspiracy has caused the majority of this Tribunal to make inappropriate suggestions in the Award as regards a letter following Resolution No. 315/13, sent by an operator called \"Video Drome\" to ENREJA on 25 November 2012, and other irrelevant events to adjudicate the merits of this dispute. There *is* evidence that the revocation of ENJASA's license was not secretly aimed at excluding Claimants from the games of chance industry in the Province of Salta. As acknowledged by Mr. Tucek himself and other witnesses for Claimants, during the discussions between Claimants and authorities of the Province of Salta and the exchanges immediately following the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13, their spokespersons in the Province of Salta suggested him that CAI agreed to remain in possession of Salta and Boulevard Casinos.\n\n356.\n\nThis proposal was not temporary, as demonstrated by the proven fact, already mentioned in this Opinion, that Claimants had the chance to take part in the \"transition plan\" of the Province of Salta but decided not to do it thus contributing to the damage that they now allege before this Arbitral Tribunal. Indeed, on 2 September 2013, ENREJA initiated an internal procedure to prepare such plan, which ended up with the issuance of Resolution No. 324/13 of 20 November 2013, whereby ENREJA submitted the \"transition plan\" to the Provincial Executive and ENJASA's shareholders\u2014*i.e.*, Claimants\u2014were allowed to request to participate in the new license system on equal footing with the other \"managers\" or \"administrators\" involved in said plan, in the following terms: \"\u2026, the cases of Cachi Valle Aventura S.A. and Casinos Austria [SIC] Casino Austria GmbH., especially the latter, recognized internationally as an Operator of Gaming and Tourism, should be left pending until further judgment elements be gathered.\" (C-219) This contrasts with the fact that Mr. Collorichio, who had worked with ENJASA and violated the anti-money laundering regulations, was not allowed to participate in the distribution of the new licenses, whereas Casinos Austria and CAIH\u2014 indirect shareholders of the sanctioned ENJASA\u2014could have requested so, which confirms the non-existence of hostility against Claimants.\n\n357.\n\nThis evidence of non-existence of the alleged conspiracy to exclude Claimants from the operation of games of chance in the Province of Salta is irrefutable and has not been refuted. Also, the measures adopted by the Provincial Executive and ENREJA in the stages of development of the \"transition plan\" during the period from ENREJA's rejection of the request for reconsideration in November 2013 to completion of said plan with the distribution of the new licenses on 29 May 2014, evidenced no sign of hostility against Claimants or undue struggle or hustle, or had no adverse effects on ENJASA's equity. There was also cooperation or mutually beneficial understandings among the new operators as regards relocation of most of ENJASA's old staff, without any charge for the company, and one or two arrangements or agreements between ENJASA and new licensees in order to facilitate the transition, such as in the case of Casino Golden Dream's. Throughout this transition period and afterwards, Claimants continued controlling the Hotel and other property owned by ENJASA. It has been established that in 2017 the balance of ENJASA's financing was not negative.\n\n358.\n\nLastly, \"the theory of conspiracy\" failed to explain the need for the authorities of the Province of Salta to resort to it, as if they had had the intent that Claimants allege they had, they could have merely applied Article 6 of the License Agreement executed by ENJASA, which, as mentioned *supra* herein, provides that \"the following shall be grounds for extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the license by operation of law:\" failure to comply with the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Law No. 7020, operation of any games of chance without the previous consent of ENREJA, total or partial assignment or transfer of the powers granted under this license without previous consent of the Provincial Executive Branch, among others.\n\n359.\n\nRather than the alleged political conspiracy, the chronology of events evinces that the sanctions applied by ENREJA for the violations or breaches incurred by ENJASA have increased since two events that took place almost simultaneously in 2007/2008, which entices us to consider Claimants' majority interest in L&E and ENJASA, and the change of approach to calculate the fee payable under the Memorandum of Understanding. However, the Parties said little about the potential effects of these events on the creation of this dispute. In addition to these two events, shortly before revocation of ENJASA's license, Claimants had fled Chile and, accordingly, their refusal to participate in the \"transition plan\" of the Province of Salta put an end to their business operations in the Southern Cone of Latin America.\n\n**(c) Conclusion on Claimants' Third Claim**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nIn light of the facts established or acknowledged and the applicable law as defined in Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT, I reject the third claim submitted by Claimants and thus the responsibility of the Argentine Republic for the alleged violation of the standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\" that should have been accorded to Claimants under customary international law. Neither upon revocation of ENJASA's License as such, nor during the administrative proceedings followed by ENREJA in that regard, nor upon rejection by ENREJA of the request for reconsideration, nor later upon application of the \"transition plan\" by ENREJA and the Provincial Executive, have any measures been adopted which are attributable to Respondent which meant a violation by the Argentine Republic of the FET standard applicable to Claimants' indirect investment in ENJASA, as provided by Article 2(1) of the aforementioned BIT.\n\n361.\n\nThe adverse effects of the revocation of ENJASA's old license for Claimants were not the result of an arbitrary measure or political conspiracy. There was no such dramatism or the slightest lack of transparency. What happened was merely that a national company to which an exclusive 30-year License had been granted for the operation of games of chance within a provincial jurisdiction repeatedly violated or breached its obligations as Licensee to prevent money laundering, and *in response* to said violations or breaches, after warning ENJASA of the risk of revocation upon failure to remedy such conduct, ENREJA revoked the License pursuant to applicable laws. Adopted at the provincial level in the regular exercise of the regulatory and police powers of the Argentine Republic as a sovereign State, said revocation has not violated the FET standard under international law and thus there is no right to compensation whatsoever, let alone a violation to an extent or level that prevails over the rule of customary international law relied upon by Respondent as a defense on the merits.\n\n362.\n\nAlso, international law on the promotion and protection of foreign investment provides as a general rule that the \"business risk\" shall be borne by the entrepreneur in question (rather than the host State where the investment is made) and, by the time of the disputed facts, Claimants, as stated *supra,* were not only indirect shareholders of ENJASA, but also controlled, managed, ran, and administered the company just like any businessperson.\n\n**PART III: GENERAL CONCLUSION**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. General Conclusion on the Basis of \"Applicable Law\" as Provided in Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nHaving, on the one hand, acknowledged as a defense on the merits the rule of customary international law relied upon by Respondent and, on the other hand, rejected the first and third claims submitted by Claimants for fundamental reasons and having declared their second claim inadmissible, I conclude on the basis of both considerations as follows:\n\n1. To accept the defense alleged by Respondent that revocation of ENJASA's License was a sanction for prior violations and breaches by the company of its obligations as Licensee, imposed by the competent body of the Province of Salta in the regular exercise of its duties, which reveals the regulatory and police powers of the Argentine Republic.\n\n2. To reject the first and third claims submitted by Claimants about \"indirect expropriation\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\", respectively, for failing to establish in the context of either of them that Respondent violated an international obligation towards Claimants, that is, in the absence of the key objective element of the existence of an internationally wrongful act committed by the Argentine Republic against Claimants.\n\n3. To dismiss Claimants' second claim as inadmissible, which deals with \"direct expropriation\" pursuant to Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in relation to the interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages.\n\n4. In view of the conclusions 1, 2 and 3 *supra*, Respondent has not incurred any international responsibility towards Claimants.\n\n5. Therefore, the compensation sought by Claimants is not sustained.\n\n**B. Rejection of the Conclusions of the Majority Award for Disregarding the \"Applicable Law\" as Defined in the Argentina-Austria BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nI reject the conclusion of the majority Award that Respondent has incurred \"indirect expropriation\" with the resulting international responsibility towards Claimants for the adverse effects of the revocation of ENJASA's License by ENREJA as a legal sanction for major and repeated violations or breaches by Licensee of its obligations set forth in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta, for the purposes of preventing money laundering, pursued by both the Argentine Republic and the other States in their fight against nowadays culprits such as capital flight, drug trafficking and terrorism. Respondent has not violated any international obligation towards Claimants; therefore, it has not committed any internationally wrongful act with the ensuing international responsibility towards them and owes them no reparation whatsoever, either by way of compensation or any other form of reparation under international law. This conclusion is based on the \"applicable law\" of this dispute relating to investments, as defined in Article 8(6) of Argentina-Austria BIT and Article 42 (1) (second phrase) of the ICSID Convention, as well as the evidence of the relevant facts produced by the Parties and their respective acknowledgements.\n\n365.\n\nTo conclude that there was \"indirect expropriation\" subject to compensation, the majority Award, rhetoric aside, had to act like an *appellate court*, assuming roles it was not entitled to and replacing the \"applicable law\" of the dispute with a so-called *\"Applicable Legal Standard\"*, created by the majority itself. This standard, qualified as \"applicable\" by the majority, is nothing but an extreme expression of the \"sole effects doctrine\"*,* today overcome and, in any event, inapplicable on account of its absurd and unreasonable results where the disputed measure is a legal sanction to revoke a license or concession in response to prior violations or breaches by the licensee or concessionaire of its legal and/or contractual duties. It is common sense that where the measure is *a sanction for violations or breaches by the Licensee* of its obligations, examining only the adverse effects of the measure on the protected investor, as the majority Award did, is inadmissible because the purpose of any sanction is\u2014by definition\u2014to impose a penalty on the sanctioned party for its breaches or violations. An arbitrator who, in the circumstances of this case, only considers the adverse effects of the sanction on the investor, ignores the right of every State to apply in those cases the sanctions set forth in their local laws to a company in breach of its obligations, which the majority's rhetoric denies being their opinion, though the recitals and conclusions of their Award say quite the opposite.\n\n366.\n\nIn any case, if we admit any evidence that the States have the power to sanction any violation or breach by Licensees of their legal and/or contractual obligations under both local and international law, we should also accept that the so-called *sole effects* doctrine of the majority Award is perfectly inapplicable herein as absurd, and it is upon this absurdity that the conclusions of the Award are based. When the disputed measure is a *sanction revoking a license*, there is no doubt that it is common sense that an arbitral tribunal must also consider other elements and not merely the adverse effects of the sanction on the shareholder-investor, as correctly stated by arbitral tribunals and publicists, under penalty of necessarily incurring an oxymoron. In order to avoid such a logical contradiction and incurring an arbitral error, there is no remedy other than also considering other elements such as, in the first place, *the cause of the measure, the nature of the rights of the sanctioned company, and the contents and scope of the rights of the shareholder-investor.*\n\n367.\n\nTherefore, we reject as contrary to both the applicable law and the statement of the majority Award that the first issue to be discussed is: \"whether the termination of ENJASA's license has reached the threshold of a substantial and permanent deprivation of Claimants' shareholdings\" (paragraph 352 of the majority Award). We reject it both as requested and in view of the petition that said issue be examined by the Arbitral Tribunal prior to deciding whether the revocation of ENJASA's license was a measure adopted by ENREJA in the regular exercise of the regulatory and police powers of the Argentine Republic as a sovereign State, as submitted by Respondent in this arbitration as a defense on the merits, since in every international arbitral or court proceedings Respondent's objections must be logically examined prior to Claimants' claims. This simple procedural matter further evidences the clear *infra petita* treatment of Respondent's defense on the merits in the majority Award.\n\n368.\n\nThe regular exercise by the competent body, ENREJA, of Respondent's powers to sanction the violations or breaches by ENJASA of its legal or contractual obligations as Licensee, is by no means limited by an obligation under the customary international law of Argentina-Austria BIT. The threshold set in that regard in the majority Award does not exist under the \"applicable law\" of this dispute as defined in such BIT. It has been imported from other cases involving different measures and a different applicable law, which the majority has included in their self-defined \"Applicable Legal Standard\". Such importation is inapposite in this arbitration. In these proceedings, the exercise of disciplinary power by ENREJA was in no way bound by an international obligation of the Argentine Republic that imposed upon such power the limitation that the sanction applied by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority upon ENJASA could not ultimately have the adverse effect of substantially and permanently causing the shares acquired by Claimants in the company to lose value, without creating international responsibility and/or a duty to compensate the Respondent, which was not the case here.\n\n369.\n\nThe applicable BIT in this case provides no guarantee to the protected investor that the eventuality described above would not occur or that Respondent should compensate the investor upon such a loss of value. The Argentina-Austria BIT is not an agreement on guarantees, nor does it include any specific provision to such effect in relation to the investment. As regards customary international law, it is for the investor to run the \"business risk\" entailed by the company's activities, with the host State assuming other types of risks. This distribution of risks explains why the \"business risk\" is one of the elements that differentiates \"an investment\" from other economic transactions at the international level. Moreover, as in this case, by the time of most violations or breaches by ENJASA, sanctioned by ENREJA with revocation of the license, Claimants were not only majority indirect shareholders of ENJASA through L&E but also controlled, managed, ran and administered the company, on a daily basis, as any businessperson does. It would have been more prudent if the majority Award had not referred to the principle of good faith in relation to Respondent, as good faith is not a principle sufficiently evidenced by Claimants' fable on \"political conspiracy\", discussed but ultimately dismissed as untenable in the majority Award.\n\n370.\n\nAs stated, in an arbitration like this, consideration must be given not only to the adverse effects of the sanction on the investor's investment but also to specific elements such as the cause of the measure, the nature of the rights of the sanctioned company, and the contents and scope of the rights of the shareholder-investor. The cause of the measure is undeniable: the revocation of ENJASA's License was the sanction that had to be applied by ENREJA, as it was obliged to, for the serious and repeated violations by ENJASA of the obligations of the Licensees listed in both paragraphs of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta, in relation to money laundering prevention. It was not a consequence of \"political conspiracy\" against Claimants. Also, it was not the result of mere \"administrative infractions\" by ENJASA, as suggested by Claimants and included, to the astonishment of those acquainted with the record of these proceedings, in the majority Award. Law No. 7020 provides that games of chance in the provincial jurisdiction shall be operated through licenses granted by the Provincial Executive, and that ENREJA shall be vested under the terms of said law with \"the necessary and sufficient powers to regulate Games of Chance in all their forms\", such as the issuance of regulatory and disciplinary operating rules. In the 2005 -August 2013 period, ENREJA punished each violation or breach by ENJASA, regardless of their seriousness, pursuant to Article 5 of Law No. 7020, with the sanctions specified for those offenses in Article 13 of said law, which have nothing to do with the sanctions for mere \"administrative infractions\" of Article 41 of Law No. 7020. In support of its conclusions in that regard, the majority Award completes its analysis by mixing, as suggested by Claimants, the sanctions applicable to the cases described in Article 5 with those of Article 41 of Law No. 7020, thereby creating a new, even more incomprehensible *totum revolutum* than in the majority Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n371.\n\nThe majority Award recalls on many occasions that ENJASA's License wan an exclusive license granted for thirty years and that it was revoked seventeen years prior to its expiration date. This is perfectly true but the inference from this circumstance contained in the majority Award is a genuine fallacy as it was not accompanied with the slightest analysis of the nature of the rights and obligations of ENJASA as Licensee under Law No. 7020, as well as the License Agreement which the majority Award completely dispenses with, despite it is an instrument of utmost significance to know the nature of those rights and obligations of ENJASA, and despite said Agreement is part of the \"Privatization Agreement\" of ENJASA, that is, the series of documents that made up the litigation proceedings pursued upon the privatization of ENJASA won by the *UTE* L&E, in which Claimants had an interest since its creation. In light of all these instruments, it is undisputed that ENJASA's License was for thirty years though subject to revocation *at any time in case of violation of the obligations imposed in Article 5 of Law No. 7020, pursuant to Article 13 of said Law and Article 5 of the License Agreement* by resolution of ENREJA, as was the case on 13 August 2013, and also the License could, for the same reason, be declared extinct and/or automatically cancelled by operation of law by the Provincial Executive in accordance with Article 6.1 of the License Agreement in the following terms:\n\n\"Notwithstanding the grounds set forth in the share transfer agreement which shall result in the termination of the bidding process established under Article 7 of Decree No. 2126/98, the following shall be grounds for extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the license by operation of law: ...Failure to comply with the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Law No. 7020.\"\n\n372.\n\nThe revocable nature of ENJASA's License, regardless of its effective term of thirty years, is undeniable, admitted and perfectly known by Claimants when they invested in ENJASA through L&E. Another relevant feature of the license to sustain the claim on \"indirect expropriation\" submitted by Claimants is that the company did not own the License. Its license was certainly not an asset of the company or the like for the purposes of expropriation. The License belonged to the grantor, that is, the Executive of the Province of Salta which, as set forth in Article 4 of Law No. 7020, shall not only grant the license but also determine \"its terms and conditions\". Also, the License was not an asset which, by its nature, was subject to expropriation or a similar measure under the domestic laws of Respondent, as further evidenced by the fact that ENJASA did not file any proceedings with the courts of justice for Salta alleging having been subject to unfair expropriation. Moreover, there is nothing in the record of these proceedings that allows inferring that under the Argentine Republic's domestic law the revocation of an administrative license may qualify or be deemed comparable to indirect expropriation. In any case, it would have been certainly unreasonable that the Province of Salta had been indirectly expropriated itself, when it could have merely declared ENJASA's License extinguished or cancelled by operation of law for violation of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, and also revoked\u2014as it did\u2014the License by decision of ENREJA. The License was not an asset which, by its nature, could have been subject to expropriation by the authorities of the Province of Salta, let alone before this Arbitral Tribunal since \"for there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return [...] the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them\", that is, in this case, the laws of the Argentine Republic (Award of the tribunal in *Encana v. Ecuador* of 2006, para. 184).\n\n373.\n\nThe Argentina-Austria BIT expressly confirms beyond reasonable doubt that is also the case in this arbitration. Why is this so? Because of two legal reasons. The first reason is because the definition of the term \"investment\" of Article 1(1) of the above-mentioned BIT provides *in fine* as follows:\n\n\"The content and scope of rights for the various categories of assets, shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located.\"\n\nTherefore, the content and scope of the category of asset of Article 1 (1) (b) of the BIT invoked by Claimants when instituting the instant case before the ICSID, namely \"shares and any other form of participation in companies,\" shall be determined in this arbitration by the laws and regulations of Respondent's domestic law by mandate of the Argentina-Austria BIT. And what do any such laws and regulation state? That ENJASA's License, as we just pointed out in the preceding paragraph, is not a company asset capable of being subject to direct or indirect expropriation in the domestic forum. The majority Award ignores it, incurring in a serious breach of the BIT, since it constructs its decision on Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim ignoring the non-expropriatory nature of the License in Respondent's domestic law.\n\n374.\n\nThe second reason is because, as we have been pointing out throughout this Opinion, the Argentina-Austria BIT provides, also expressly, in Article 8 (6) regarding investment dispute resolution, that the arbitral body shall decide the dispute, *inter alia,* \"in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute,\" *i.e.*, in the instant case, on the basis of *inter alia* the Argentine Republic's national or domestic law. Nevertheless, the majority Award, in its considerations and conclusion on Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim radically excludes Respondent's domestic law as the law applicable to this dispute resolution. It is a second and inexcusable challenge to what the Argentina-Austria BIT mandates.\n\n375.\n\nIn point of fact, the majority Award radically adopts in its analysis the so called \"*sole effects*\" doctrine (applied under different circumstances, by some international investment arbitral tribunals) and completely excludes the determinants of the \"indirect expropriation\" claim originating in the Argentine Republic domestic law applicable to these arbitration proceedings, limiting such determinants to the above-mentioned doctrine sole criterion, which I deem inapplicable to the instant case due to its being utterly incompatible with the \"applicable law\" as defined in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. According to paragraph 353 of the Award the only issue raised would be determining whether: \"the revocation of ENJASA's license (\u2026) permanently and substantially deprived Claimants of their indirect investment in ENJASA and their direct investment in L&E.\" The Award concludes that has actually been the case and, with no further consideration whatsoever the majority concludes at paragraph 356 of the Award that the revocation of the license constituted a permanent and substantial deprivation of Claimants' indirect investment in ENJASA and of their direct investment in L&E. According to the majority, that is the only issue that calls for analysis. Next, the Award proceeds to consider the use by ENREJA of its regulatory powers.\n\n376.\n\nI have already contested this conclusion by the majority *supra* in my analysis of Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim, notwithstanding my main conclusion that Respondent did not incur in any international responsibility *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants when ENREJA, having acted in the regular exercise of the Argentine Republic's regulatory and police powers as a sovereign State, revoked ENJASA's license and, consequently, the adverse effect of a regular exercise of such powers by the Argentine State's competent body does not constitute an internationally wrongful act and, it is thus, non-compensable. With respect to the issue mentioned in the preceding paragraph regarding \"indirect expropriation,\" my rejection of the majority Award's conclusion is premised on a number of apparent considerations duly documented on the record such as: (i) that the purchase and sale related to ENJASA's privatization was a single legal business consisting of two components, the purchase of the company shares and an economic contribution to the provincial tourism development plan consisting, mainly albeit not solely, in the construction of the Golden Dreams Hotel in Salta. All relevant documentation confirms it, beginning with the revised proposal with which the UTE L&E won the tender bid and ending with the Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREM) of May 2008 (C-131); (ii) that in that legal business the price paid by the UTE for ENJASA's shares was merely formal (one Argentine peso per share), while the actual economic consideration of the UTE was the economic promise of investing an amount of several million dollars in the tourism development plan; (iii) that the revocation of the license did not affect the ownership and exploitation of the Hotel or any other ENJASA asset, nor did it dissolve or nationalize the company; (iv) that the adverse effects for Claimants are not total but partial and are to be borne by the company since they result from a legal sanction as a consequence of having previously violated ENJASA's obligations laid down under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 imposed by both such Law and the License Agreement; (v) that the rejection by ENJASA (under Claimants' control, direction, management and administration) of the invitation to participate in the new distribution of licenses has contributed to the fact that the partial adverse effects of the revocation for Claimants have been greater than they could have been following ENJASA's refusal to participate in any such distribution. Contrary to what the majority Award avers, this latter consideration is by no means an issue only related to the determination of the amount of a potential compensation.\n\n377.\n\nI firmly believe that investment ICSID arbitrations are \"arbitrations of law\" and that, consequently, arbitrators are called upon to interpret and apply pre-set legal rules to the particular facts and circumstances of the case taking into account the evidence advanced by the parties or in the public domain, as well as said parties' respective admissions In other words, I reject arbitrators undertaking functions of legislative nature not pertaining thereto or which they deem to be authorized by nobody knows who to solve an investment dispute on the basis of the arbitrator's sole discretion instead of doing so through the application of the \"applicable law\" preset by the parties to the dispute and, otherwise, by the BIT, that in this arbitration is the BIT Argentina and Austria concluded in 1992. Unfortunately, the majority of this Arbitral Tribunal has a different view since it repeats the approach I condemned in the jurisdiction phase. In that phase the victims were the sub-articles of Article 8 of the BIT regarding the pre-conditions accompanying arbitration offer by Argentina and Austria and in this stage on the merits the victims are the BIT provisions regarding the definition of \"investment\" (Article 1(1)) and the \"law applicable\" to the dispute resolution (Article 8 (6)) and the provisions on expropriation (Article 4 (1) and (2)). This ascertainment leads me to quote here, because of its relevance, an excerpt by Professor James Crawford, current Member of the ICJ and former Special Rapporteur of the ILC on the field of International Responsibility of States, of the conclusion of his well-known article entitled *\"Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration\" -* an excerpt applicable *mutatis mutandis* to an \"indirect expropriation\" claim - which states as follows:\n\n\"What a BIT does is to provide an additional layer of protection for the one transaction: the investment is protected by the BIT, but the BIT should not be used as a vehicle to rewrite the investments arrangements ...At the level of the merits it must be borne in mind that the investment contract is itself an allocation of risks and opportunities, and that allocation is relevant in determining, in particular, whether there has been fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. In particular, the doctrine of legitimate expectations should not be used as a substitute for the actual arrangements agreed between the parties, or as a supervening and overriding source of the applicable law\" (http://www.kluwerarbitration.com/print.aspx?ids=ipn30591, p. 25.)\n\n378.\n\nThe majority Award is premised on an initial misunderstanding which needs to be clarified. This misunderstanding consists in using the *dictum* of the ICJ judgment in *ELSI* quoted at paragraph 341 of the majority Award to justify the unusual conclusion of excluding Respondent's domestic law from the law applicable to this dispute in full and conscious contradiction with the provisions set forth in this regard in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT. The ICJ *dictum* is absolutely correct, but what the majority seeks to infer therefrom in its Award is a fallacy. It is apparent that an act's conformance with a State's national or domestic law and conformance thereof with an international treaty provisions are different issues but that does not imply that both legal systems are hermetic compartments with no correlation between themselves. International law rules can take part in a domestic law dispute resolution and domestic law rules can apply to an international dispute resolution. It is perfectly normal and frequent in both directions by reception methods and proceedings well known by jurists. In the instant case, the Arbitral Tribunal is authorized to apply Respondent's domestic law and it also has the obligation to do so by mandate of the provision in Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, and also in Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention. The majority Award fails to comply with this obligation.\n\n379.\n\nIt is evident that any such mandate does not mean that Respondent's domestic law is to be applied when it is not relevant, as it equally happens with the BIT provisions and the rules and principles of international law that also constitute the \"law applicable\" to this treaty claim. But the Arbitral Tribunal is bound to apply Respondent's domestic law, as well as the other regulations of the \"applicable law\", provided that they are relevant for the dispute resolution as it occurs for a considerable number of legal issues raised in this arbitration. This relevance is absolutely normal given that the beginning of this litigation was the revocation sanction by ENREJA of a license granted to ENJASA in accordance with the legal and contractual provisions of the Argentine Republic's domestic law. The best evidence thereof are the Parties' written arguments, the witnesses and experts they presented, the majority Decision on Jurisdiction and this majority Award itself with its references to Law No. 7020 of the Argentine Province of Salta and ENREJA's resolutions, currently final, regarding the aforementioned sanction, *i.e.*, Resolution No. 240 adopting any such sanction and Resolution No. 315 confirming the revocation. Additionally, the exclusion by the majority of Respondent's domestic law as law applicable to this treaty claim resolution is legally aberrant and erroneous. It is also a violation of the Argentina-Austria BIT's mandate on the \"law applicable\" to investment dispute resolution.\n\n380.\n\nExclusions by the majority of the Argentine Republic's domestic law and the provisions on \"applicable law\" of the Argentina-Austria BIT in breach of this latter's mandate do not put an end to such exclusions. International law is also a victim of that. As we have already referred to in the Introduction hereof, the ICJ in *ELSI* stated that \"the Chamber finds itself unable to accept that an important principle of customary international law should be held to have been tacitly dispense with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so\" (*ICJ Reports 1989, Judgment*, p. 42, para. 50.) Neither the Argentina-Austria BIT nor the Parties hereto have dispensed with those customary principles or rules of international law in the resolution hereof. Therefore, all those customary principles or rules are potentially applicable to the extent they are relevant for this dispute resolution. Among such principles and rules we find, for instance, the following:\n\n1. The rule setting out that a State is not bound to compensate an alien for the adverse effects arising from the regular exercise by its competent agencies of the State's regulatory and police powers inherent to its sovereignty (invoked by Respondent.)\n\n2. The rule setting out prior exhaustion of local remedies when primary rules of international law are subject to any such condition (Article 44 of the ILC Articles on International Responsibility of States.)\n\n3. The rule setting out that for an internationally wrongful act to exist, it is essential, *inter alia,* that a conduct of the State, consisting of an action or omission constitutes a breach of a prevailing international obligation of the State (Arts. 2 and 13 of the ILC Articles.)\n\n4. The rule setting out that the international responsibility of the State results or arises from an international wrongful act (Art. 28 of the ILC Articles.)\n\n5. The rule setting out that the obligation to make full reparation exclusively concerns the injury caused by the relevant internationally wrongful act (Art. 31 of the ILC Articles.)\n\n6. The rule setting out that in the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought (Art. 39 of the ILC Articles.)\n\n7. The rule setting out that international tribunals do not have the power to substitute their own interpretation of a State's domestic law for that given by the competent authorities of the relevant State.\n\n381.\n\nThe majority Award also excludes or sets aside all those customary rules or other rules of international law that may be relevant in this ICSID arbitration. It is thus confirmed that in this dispute resolution not only does any such Award dispose of the Argentine Republic's domestic law and the relevant provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT, but it also disposes of customary international law, *i.e.*, all the \"applicable law\" as defined in Article 8 (6) of said BIT. The objective criterion of \"applicable law\" of the aforementioned BIT provision is substituted in the Award by the so called \"Applicable Legal Standard\" mentioned *supra*, which is a subjective standard premised at will by the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal and without any previous communication to the Parties of this significant change for adjudication of the dispute. As the Award expressly admits, the majority of the Tribunal \"considers it appropriate to focus on the manifest character of errors as an indicator of the lack of good faith and arbitrariness\" of Respondent (paragraph 350 of the majority Award.) This unprecedented and outrageous speculative prejudice, alleged with no supporting evidence whatsoever instead of the \"applicable law\" of the BIT, discredits itself on its own and prevents, in my opinion, that this majority Award be qualified as a \"*de jure* award\" in accordance with the 1965 ICSID Convention.\n\n382.\n\nThe majority Award's conclusion that Respondent, because of the revocation of the License by ENREJA incurred in international responsibility towards Claimants by an \"indirect expropriation\" that would violate Article 4 (1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT and that, accordingly, it has the duty to make reparation for the adverse effect of the revocation for Claimants through compensation, is developed at paragraphs 352-429 of the majority Award. The Award begins with the consideration of ENREJA's Use of its Regulatory Powers, and it concludes with the Respect of Due Process*.* Between these two subjects the majority Award considers the following issues: (a) Plan to Oust ENJASA from operating in the Gaming Sector*;* (b) ENREJA's Power to Revoke the License under Article 13*;* (c) ENREJA's Determinations of ENJASA's Breaches of the Regulatory Framework*;* and (d) Proportionality of Resolution N\u00ba 240/13*.* Following consideration of those subjects and issues, the majority Award concludes, at paragraphs 427-429, as follows:\n\n1. That the Tribunal has not found a breach of due process, its findings on arbitrariness and the lack of proportionality are sufficient to conclude that ENREJA did not properly use its regulatory and supervisory powers when it decided to revoke ENJASA's exclusive license.\n\n2. That such revocation destroyed ENJASA's game operation business and Claimants' investment in ENJASA.\n\n3. That the revocation and subsequent transfer of game operation to third party operators cannot be considered as a regular exercise by ENREJA of its regulatory and supervisory powers.\n\n4. That, consequently, the revocation constituted an indirect expropriation (sic?) of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and an its indirect shareholding in ENJASA.\n\n5. That this indirect expropriation was unlawful as it has not been implemented for a public purpose and was not accompanied by compensation as required under Article 4(2) of the BIT; and that\n\n6. Respondent therefore is liable for breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n383.\n\nThese are the conclusions of the majority Award following application to the facts related to Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim of its \"Applicable Legal Standard\" not the \"applicable law\" defined by the Argentina-Austria BIT in Article 8 (6). My rejection of those conclusions adopted failing to apply to the facts the BIT's mandate on the \"law applicable\" to the dispute resolution is because they are absolutely erroneous in light of the applicable law, to a large extent speculative, and they disregard the evidence produced by Respondent, including that provided for by Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta and Resolution No. 240/13 itself. It is so established by this Opinion relevant considerations and conclusions *supra* at the Introduction (paragraphs 1-40), Part I dealing with the customary rule of international law concerning the regular exercise by the competent bodies of the State's regulatory and police powers inherent to its sovereignty invoked by Respondent (paragraphs 41-100) and Part II (Section A) related to Claimants' first claim concerning \"indirect expropriation\" for violations of Article 4 (1) and (2) of the BIT (paragraphs 101-236). Consequently, it is not necessary to reiterate such considerations and conclusions in this General Conclusion. I shall thus finish this General Conclusion commenting the insufficiencies, contradictions, and silences of the Award in light of the inappropriate standard constructed and applied by the majority instead of the \"applicable law\" defined by the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n384.\n\nThe first ascertainment is that the majority Award excludes from its analysis the customary rule invoked by Respondent as defense on the merits against Claimants' claims, a rule of systemic nature in the international legal order. How does it do it? Departing from the wrong premise that application to this dispute of the customary rule at issue - of high-rank and ancestry in public international law because of its being inherent to the State's sovereignty - is limited or subordinated, both as regards its considerations and conclusions reached, by the *\"sole effects\"* doctrine promoted in the context of investment litigation by an outdated trend and, besides, that said limitation or subordination is of such scope that the aforementioned customary rule can be dispensed with, absent prior examination, when an \"indirect expropriation\" claim is admitted. Any such proposition is in most cases nonsense and with regard to a case like this one dealing with a sanction of revoking a license adopted by the Regulatory Agency and competent authority in response to serious and repeated violations by Licensee of its \"licensee's obligations\" is an utter oxymoron. On ENJASA's breaches described by ENREJA as \"serious\" and \"very serious\" see paragraph 22 of Respondent's PHB.\n\n385.\n\nAnother insufficiency of the Award is that in order to reach its conclusion on Claimants' \"indirect expropriation\" claim, the majority has had nothing less than disregard the Arbitral Tribunal's competence and ascribe thereto the role of a *court of appeals* of the decisions made in the Province of Salta by the ENREJA, in its capacity as Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020. And how has it been able to do so? By disregarding the fact that Respondent's domestic law is the law applicable to this dispute resolution. That is to say, violating the Argentina-Austria BIT's mandate in the matter, given that ENREJA's Resolutions No. 240 and No. 315 are final resolutions in Respondent's domestic law and, accordingly, they are also final in this arbitration as it is so provided for in Article 8 (6) of the BIT. That is why this Opinion quotes what was decided in those Resolutions and it abides by their conclusions and decisions since I am not responsible for participating in the *ultra vires* revision the majority Award makes of the considerations, conclusions, and decisions of ENREJA's Resolutions No. 240 and No. 215 with respect to fact-finding Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12 and 384/12 object thereof. What I am responsible for is recalling that Resolutions Nos. 240 and 315 have become final due to the withdrawal by ENJASA (under Claimants' control, management, direction, and administration) of the contentious-administrative proceedings that it had instituted with the competent court for the Province of Salta due to the incompatibility set out by the BIT between international arbitration and ongoing domestic court proceedings. And it is also worth recalling that the Arbitral Tribunal's decision ordering the withdrawal lacked my support. As pointed out in a Dissenting Declaration, I proposed that these arbitration proceedings before the ICSID be stayed while the court proceedings instituted by the company in the Province of Salta were pending.\n\n386.\n\nA third insufficiency of the majority Award is that it absolutely disregards the nature and purpose of the disputed measure. In the instant case, the measure is not a mere administrative measure adopted at the initiative of the Administration as it occurs in most investment disputes related to licenses, concessions or permits. The measure is a *sanction* by the Administration of prior serious and repeated violations by Licensee of legal and contractual obligations important for the Legislator. The competent administrative body adopted the sanction in compliance with its supervisory and sanctioning duties and it did so after ENJASA had been sanctioned several times for violation of those obligations and after it had been warned that, should it not change its behavior, its license was at risk of being revoked, all of which Claimants were perfectly aware. But the behavior of ENJASA (under Claimants' control, management, direction, and administration) did not change, as evidenced by ENREJA's fact-finding Resolutions mentioned at the preceding paragraph. Footnote 23 to paragraph 23 of Respondent's PHB identifies four ENREJA's Resolutions warning ENJASA of the consequences the breaches by Licensee could entail in connection with its License, even specifically clarifying that they could warrant revocation of the License. They are Resolutions Nos. 39/10 (C-164), 104/10 (C-152), 128/10 (C-158) and 161/10 (C-157).\n\n387.\n\nThis also raises a bad faith issue by Claimants that the majority Award completely ignores and which, in contrast, reproaches, as we have already seen *supra* to Respondent in a \"doble standard\" exercise uncommon in international arbitration proceedings. The revocation actually put an end to ENJASA's business and indirectly affected Claimants regarding the company's lost profits (not the capital invested by Claimants or the company's equity assets.) It is the consequence of a sanction measure applied to an ENJASA under Claimants' direction and control, and which after having been warned, continued adopting a behavior contrary to the \"licensee's obligations\" laid down under Article 5 of Law No. 7020.\n\n388.\n\nThe possibility of a sanction like the one imposed to the company by the ENREJA was assumed by Claimants when they invested in ENJASA as evinced by the documentation related to the company privatization and, particularly, because of the License Agreement accuracy in terms of sanctions, ignored by the majority Award probably because of its clarity on the \"obligations by a licensee.\" Public administrations' sanctions are not a whim but a need both in the Argentine Republic as well as in the Republic of Austria and their purpose in both Republics is by definition to inflict a sanction to the party being sanctioned as a result of which the *\"sole effects\"* doctrine is absolutely inappropriate and not applicable when the disputed measures are sanctions, as is the case in this arbitration, and, consequently, all the arbitral awards cited in the majority Award which apply such doctrine to measures that are not of a sanctioning nature are perfectly irrelevant for these arbitration proceedings. An adverse effect for the party being sanctioned by a sanction is a natural effect. There is nothing extraordinary therein. What is unprecedented is expecting that the party being sanctioned by the violation or breach of the obligations that gave rise to the sanction be rewarded by the sanctioning party with compensation. This is indeed nonsensical. Lastly, one shall obviously bear in mind that, in transactions related to protected investment, the risk of sanctions is a \"business risk\" ascribed as such to the investor/businessperson, except otherwise provided for in the BIT or in possible specific agreements and, in the instant case, when the violations or breaches of Law No. 7020 that were sanctioned with revocation of the License, Claimants were not only shareholders of the company, but they also controlled, managed, ran and administered ENJASA as an a businessperson, thus they are by no means a third party with respect to such violations or breaches [Translated by me.] On all these considerations the majority Award has nothing to say except that ENREJA acted in bad faith!\n\n389.\n\nThe Award fails to explain the reason why the majority considers the revocation of ENJASA's license cannot be deemed a regular exercise by the ENREJA of its regulatory and supervisory or police powers. I have explained in detail herein the reasons why I consider such conclusion by the majority is contrary to the law applicable to this dispute. But in this context, the question to be analyzed is the reason why the majority considers the revocation of the license was not a regular exercise by the ENREJA of the above-mentioned powers. Apparently, in light of the conclusion at paragraphs 395 and 427 of the majority Award, the revocation decision would have been arbitrary and lacking proportion. The first question this conclusion poses is with respect to what is there arbitrariness and lack of proportionality for the majority? This Opinion has shown that ENREJA's revocation decision was neither arbitrary nor lacking proportionality in light of Argentine domestic law, which ENREJA had the obligation to apply, and which it did apply in the Province of Salta. But as the majority Award does not apply Argentine domestic law as the law applicable to this dispute, I assume that the arbitrariness and lack of proportionality of the majority Award conclusion refer to the \"Applicable Legal Standard\" constructed by the majority and that, according to said majority, this standard would be a standard of international law that would incorporate the conditions of arbitrariness and lack of proportionality (without defining them) as a limitation to the application of the customary rule of international law that recognizes and respects the State's regulatory and police or supervisory powers invoked by Respondent.\n\n390.\n\nHowever, the position adopted by the majority Award encounters insurmountable legal obstacles under public international law that converge in this arbitration, which is why there is no alternative but to reject it. First, the inevitable question is: how can an arbitral award find that the Argentine Republic violated the alleged international standards of non-existence of arbitrariness and lack of proportionality at the time ENREJA decided to revoke the License when neither ENJASA nor Claimants previously exhausted Respondent's domestic remedies? The conclusion reached by the majority Award cannot stand if it is not proved that such domestic remedies were previously exhausted, since, failing that, ENREJA's revocation of the License may not entail an internationally wrongful act under international law giving rise to international responsibility to an arbitral tribunal applying international law. And there can be no internationally wrongful act, as the primary rules of international law on the treatment of foreign persons and property are rules of international law *subject* to the previous exhaustion of such remedies before a party can allege that they have been violated. Such remedies not having been exhausted, it cannot be found that there was a violation of such international primary rules, and, thus, the secondary rules of international Responsibility of the State do not admit an international claim based on a violation of such primary rules, since there has been no violation thereof provided that any local remedy has not been exhausted (Article 44 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts).\n\n391.\n\nIn the instant case, evidence of non-exhaustion is clear, because ENJASA, which was controlled, managed and run by Claimants, withdrew from the court proceedings that it had instituted in the Province of Salta, as stated *supra* in paragraph 385. Moreover, and this is the second obstacle, for the arbitrariness and lack of proportionality found in the majority Award to constitute an exception under international law to the customary rule invoked by Respondent, the previous exhaustion of domestic remedies is not the only requirement. The arbitrariness or lack of proportionality must be extremely serious, i.e., reach such a high threshold of seriousness as to entail, for example, a \"denial of justice,\" as pointed out in Part I of this Opinion. Nor does the majority Award show that Claimants have established that they had met this fundamental requirement in the case at issue. Consequently, it is now worth examining the alleged \"arbitrariness\" and the alleged \"lack of proportionality\" in turn.\n\n392.\n\nThe majority Award concludes that the decision to revoke the License was an arbitrary act on the part of ENREJA but fails to elaborate on the content and scope of the notion of \"arbitrariness\" under international law. Customary international law actually recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a manifestly serious arbitrariness can entail a limit on the application of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent, which, in any case, international tribunals apply with remarkable caution and deference that are missing in the majority Award. The reason is self-evident: such limit affects the State's exercise of its sovereignty, and, under international law, limits on the State's sovereignty are not presumed. In addition, as I have just stated, not any arbitrariness can exceptionally limit the rule invoked by Respondent. It must be an extremely serious arbitrariness, and, of course, no matter how serious the arbitrariness in question is, the customary rule of international law that protects the State's regulatory and supervisory or police powers is not repealed.\n\n393.\n\nI completely agree with Claimants that the formula adopted by the case-law of the ICJ in *ELSI* strengthens what is now to be understood as the content and scope of an international arbitrariness that may limit the application of the rule invoked by Respondent. In accordance with such formula: \"Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law\" (ICJ Reports 1989, Judgment, p. 76, para.128). In the present dispute, the international law arbitrariness of Claimants' \"Applicable Legal Standard\" must be an arbitrariness that is contrary to the \"rule of law.\" Therefore, only a serious arbitrariness contrary to the \"rule of law\" would hinder the application of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent. None of the conclusions reached by the majority Award on its \"arbitrariness\" is objectively as serious. This is confirmed by another conclusion in paragraph 426 of the majority Award whereby \"it is unable to find a violation of any international due process rights, as claimed by Claimants.\" If there has been no violation of \"due process rights,\" there could not have been, and has not been, an arbitrariness contrary to the \"rule of law.\"\n\n394.\n\nThe majority Award also finds that ENREJA's revocation of the License was a disproportionate decision in paragraph 417 whereby, \"even if the allegations underlying Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12 y 284/12 had been true, and their legal evaluation under domestic law accurate, a revocation of ENJASA's license would not have been proportionate under international law and would not have constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers [\u2026].\" This conclusion mixes two issues. The first is a question of Argentine domestic law that has been thoroughly examined and rejected in this Opinion in relation to both Claimants' first claim (indirect expropriation) and third claim (fair and equitable treatment). I refer to the foregoing examination in this context. Hence, the same considerations and conclusions on arbitrariness apply to the \"lack of proportion\" under Argentine domestic law of ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13 declared in the majority Award, namely: (i) the final nature of ENREJA's Resolution No. 240; (ii) the non-existence of an internationally wrongful act for failure to exhaust the Argentine Republic's local remedies in accordance with the primary rules of international law on the matter; and (iii) the lack of international responsibility without violation of an international rule, the existence of attribution not being sufficient.\n\n395.\n\nBut, as we say, the above-mentioned conclusion of the majority, also concerns a question of international law when it states that ENREJA's revocation decision \"would not have constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA regulatory powers.\" Nevertheless, paragraphs 397 to 416 of the majority Award preceding the conclusion regarding *\"*Proportionality of Resolution No. 240/13*\"* do not mention any single rule or instrument of public international law warranting or supporting the conclusion discussed. To know what the majority relies on so as to state in the Award that the decision to revoke the License was not a regular exercise by ENREJA of its regulatory powers, it is necessary to refer to subsequent parts of the majority Award where it is explained that it is not a rule of international law, but the \"Autonomous Treaty Standard\" elaborated by Claimants. The majority Award fails therefore to judge ENREJA's decision on the basis of international law. A reading of the above-mentioned paragraphs also confirm that the \"Applicable Legal Standard\" of the majority Award is nothing but a reformulation of Claimants' \"Autonomous Treaty Standard\" and thus, it lacks, like the original, normativity in public international law as evidenced herein.\n\n396.\n\nIn other words, the standard applied by the majority is not part of the \"law applicable\" to this dispute resolution as defined by Argentina and Austria in Article 8(6) of the BIT. It is composed, with no further analysis, of an amalgam of citations of statements taken from the practice by some *ad hoc* arbitral tribunals of a certain scholarly trend failing to take into account the distinctive features of the instant case. Oddly enough, this is the so called \"standard\" upon which the majority of the Tribunal relies to assert that Resolution No. 240/13 was not the result of the regular exercise by ENREJA of its regulatory powers and not, as mandated by the BIT, on the basis of \"the applicable principles of international law.\" For \"the principles of international law\" the lack of proportionality of the majority Award is irrelevant because as a result of its lack of normativity it has no ability to limit, in any way whatsoever, the scope of the customary rule invoked by Respondent, and that is so whichever the degree of seriousness of the lack of proportionality alleged. In other words, some publicists' \"proportionality *strictu sensu\"* is not a legal rule or a condition of a legal rule limiting the customary rule regarding the regular exercise by the competent bodies of the State's regulatory, supervisory or police powers invoked by Respondent.\n\n397.\n\nWhat happens with proportionality both in domestic laws as well as in international law is that there are particular legal rules that incorporate it as, for instance, Article 13 of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta and Article 5 of ENJASA's License Agreement do at the domestic level or, for example, the rules codified in Articles 35 (Restitution), 37 (Satisfaction) and 51 (Countermeasures) of ILC Articles on International Responsibility of States do at the international level. As far as this arbitration is concerned, proportionality does not limit the scope of application of the customary rule invoked by Respondent, neither is the proportionality criterion integrated in any other relevant rule of international law. Nor should the \"proportionality\" of a rule or a legal decision be identified with the \"reasonableness\" thereof. In any case, the Argentina-Austria BIT does not set out any transversal criteria of proportionality in relation to the legal rules it defines as the \"law applicable\" to investment disputes like the one at issue, although it does not exclude proportionality as long as the criterion is incorporated in a rule of domestic law or international law which is applicable and relevant.\n\n398.\n\nIn general international law, proportionality does not operate in an autonomous fashion as, for example, good faith does, since it is not a \"general principle of law.\" In the instant case, the only rules of the \"applicable law\" defined by the BIT that incorporate the reciprocity criterion are the rules of Respondent's domestic law laid down in Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta and in ENJASA's License Agreement with which ENREJA's decision to revoke the License fully complied. The majority Award is thus declaring the Argentine Republic's international responsibility for \"lack of proportionality\" at the international level failing to specify what international law obligation Respondent has violated in that regard in its relationship with Claimants.\n\n399.\n\nBut the \"deficiencies,\" to use a soft term, of the majority Award mentioned so far are not the only ones, since even though the Award: (i) disregards the \"applicable law\" defined by the BIT; (ii) substitutes Resolution No. 240/13 for the majority's ruling in the Award retried what ENREJA had judged in Salta which is a final Resolution; and (iii) reduces to the *minimum minimorum* the number of violations by ENJASA of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 confirmed by ENREJA, all that did not suffice to be able to justify the Award conclusions, due to ENJASA's recidivist condition. This recidivism took place during the 2005-August 2013 period and, in particular from 2007/2008 when Claimants acquired the majority shares and controlled and ran the company, an event that is almost coincident with the modification of the method to calculate the yearly license fee by the Memorandum of Understanding (UNIREN). Prior to Resolution No. 240/13, ENJASA was actually sanctioned twenty times for violation of the above-mentioned Article 5 of Law No. 7020, six of which were for violations similar to those sanctioned by Resolution No. 240/13. This situation could not be concealed. Additionally, Resolution No. 240/13 itself expressly mentions the four criteria ENREJA took into account when adopting the sanction to revoke the License, the first of those enumerated being \"ENJASA's background\" (see paragraph 226 *supra*.) In turn, ENJASA's License Agreement also mentioned in Article 5 \"recidivism\" as one of the elements for grading the sanctions.\n\n400.\n\nFacing this situation, how does the majority Award proceed in its treatment of the fact that ENJASA was a recidivous Licensee? Well, denying the greatest, *i.e.*, what the text of Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta reads: How does it do that? By means of two moves. The first, mixing up the essential distinction drawn by Law No. 7020 between \"particular obligations of a licensee\" which are exclusive obligations by licensees (Article 5 of Law No. 7020 begins with the words: \"The licensee shall act in accordance with...) and \"general obligations\" that the Law calls \"administrative infractions\" (Article 40 of Law No. 7020 begins as follows \"Any natural and/or legal persons who, with or without authorization and with not-for-profit purposes or otherwise, carry out any of the activities defined in Article 2...\".) And the second move consists in disregarding that, as stated by the Law, sanctions for violations and breaches of licensees' specific obligations set out in Article 5 are laid down in Article 13, whereas sanctions for infractions of the general administrative obligations set out in Article 40 of Law No. 7020 are laid down in Article 41. That is why Article 13 mentions the suspension and revocation of the license since it exclusively punishes conducts contrary to the obligations by licensee, whereas Article 41 does not mention the license at all because the obligor of the administrative obligations violated by the infractions is any natural and/or legal person. The present dispute exclusively concerns the violation by ENJASA of the obligations it had *in its capacity as, or condition of licensee* by virtue of the obligations set out in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 which ENJASA violated or breached under Claimants' control and direction, giving rise to ENREJA, in the regular exercise of its functions and powers, sanctioning it as recidivist, prior warning, with the revocation of the License.\n\n401.\n\nAll this is perfectly clear in Law No. 7020, that is why a simple reading of the Law suffices to apply it correctly. It is true that, lacking arguments, Claimants, with some of their experts' help tried to create confusion on the respective application scopes of Article 5 and Article 40 of Law No. 7020. But an arbitrator shall see things as they are, not as the parties at stake say they are. I say this as a matter of principle because this Opinion has already shown that ENREJA properly exercised its sanctioning power in accordance with Law No. 7020 and its regulatory provisions. What is being analyzed in this context is what the majority says in its Award about Law No. 7020, *i.e.*, why has the majority tried to rewrite Law No. 7020 instead of applying it? Why does it attempt to transform violations by ENJASA of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 in administrative infractions of Article 40? The most credible explanation is that with any such transformation the majority has attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by ENJASA's *recidivism* in the violation of the above-mentioned Article 5 so as to be able to hold that ENREJA applied an excessive sanction, although it also fails in doing so.\n\n402.\n\nThe majority Award concludes that ENJASA only incurred two violations or breaches of the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Law and no violation or breach of the first paragraph of said article. Departing therefrom, the majority presupposes that \"the fewer the number of violations\" or \"violations they consider of minor importance\" it is possible to reclassify the violations of Article 5 by ENJASA that the majority recognizes as \"administrative infractions.\" And what happens if the Law does not allow it? Well, the Law is rewritten, which would allow us to introduce in addition in the consideration of this dispute as the majority Award does all articles from Article 40 to 51 of Chapter IV (Administrative Infractions) of Title II of Law No. 7020. What happens is that not only does Law No. 7020 not admit the reading the majority makes thereof, but it excludes it with no remedy whatsoever, given that for Law No. 7020 any violation or breach of Article 5 obligations (whichever the number or seriousness thereof) is a violation or breach by Licensee of its *obligations as licensee laid down in said article and, accordingly, it is subject to the sanctions of Article 13 of the Law and to be weighted within the framework of said article, taking into the account, as appropriate, its recidivist condition in the violation of obligations by a Licensee as was ENJASA.* In other words, according to Law No. 7020, violations of the obligations contained in Article 5 of the Law by the Licensee bound to comply therewith do not become \"administrative infractions\" in no case whatsoever, regardless of the number or degree of seriousness thereof, contrary to the conclusions of the majority Award. The revocation of the License was not a sanction for having violated the general administrative obligations laid down in Article 40 of Law No. 7020, but ENJASA was sanctioned for having violated the particular obligations of Licensee set out in Article 5 of that Law. That is the reason why ENJASA could file, and did file, a recourse for \"reconsideration\" against Resolution No. 240/13 since for \"administrative infractions\" Article 50 of Law No. 7020 only admits motions for clarification and/or an appeal for review.\n\n403.\n\nIn order to endorse the misguided reading of Law No. 7020, the majority Award invokes an excerpt of the ICJ case law in *Diallo,* which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Court does not, in principle, have the power to substitute its own interpretation for that of the national authorities, especially when that interpretation is given by the highest national courts (see, for this latter case, *Serbian Loan, Judgment N\u00ba 14, 1929, P.C.I.J., Series A, N\u00ba 20, p.46* and *Brazilian Loans, Judgment N\u00ba 15, 1929, P.C.I.J., Series A, N\u00ba 21, p. 124*). Exceptionally, where a State puts forward a manifestly incorrect interpretation of its domestic law, particularly for the purpose of gaining an advantage in a pending case, it is for the Court to adopt what it finds to be the proper interpretation\" *(**ICJ Reports 2010 (II), Judgment*, p.665, para. *(in fine)).*\n\nFollowing this quote, the ICJ states, in the following paragraph, that there was no room for a different interpretation to that given by the State authorities in question with these words:\n\n\"although it would be possible in theory to discuss de validity of that interpretation, it is certainly not for the Court to adopt a different interpretation of Congolese domestic law for the purpose of the decision of the case.\" This statement shows all the deference of the International Court of Justice, main organ of the United Nations, towards the interpretation by a State of its own national or domestic law, which, unfortunately the majority of this ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal lets itself reject entirely in this majority Award. I reject this Arbitral Tribunal's complete lack of deference toward Respondent regarding the interpretations of Argentine law by the Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of Law No. 7020 appointed by the Law itself, i.e., the ENREJA. The ENREJA sanctioned the Argentine company ENJASA for violating its legal obligations as Licensee in the territory of the Republic, a company that Claimants in this arbitration - which had made an investment therein - controlled and ran at the time the greatest number of violations and breaches that determined the above-mentioned sanction occurred. A situation this that a majority Award so concerned about Respondent's good faith should have weighed with respect to Claimants' good faith, instead of keeping a secretive silence in that regard.\n\n404.\n\nAs regards international law in this matter, the ICJ in the excerpt quoted *supra*, confirms the effectiveness of the principle that international tribunals, including the ICJ itself, do not have the power to substitute their own interpretation of a State's domestic law for that given by the competent authorities of the relevant State. This principle of international law, that is \"law applicable\" to this dispute resolution, has been absolutely violated by the majority Award with respect to both the final ENREJA Resolution No. 240/13 and Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta. As regards the exception related to State interpretations that are \"manifestly incorrect\" of the quote, it is not relevant in the case of revision by Respondent of such Resolution and such Law, because the majority Award does not \"interpret\" but \"revises\" both instruments of Argentine domestic law. As per confirmation by the *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola de la Lengua* for which: (i) the verb \"interpret\" means \"to state or explain the meaning of something and mainly of the text lacking clarity\"; and (ii) the verb \"revise\" means \"to submit something to a new examination so as to correct it, amend it or repair it\" The pertinence of the reference in the majority Award to the exception on the interpretation of the quote of the ICJ commented hereinabove is, thus, inapposite in this context.\n\n405.\n\nAt the end of its reasons section, the majority Award concludes, with no greater developments, that Respondent has breached Article 4 (1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT incurring thereby in international responsibility towards Claimants for \"indirect expropriation\" of their investment in ENJASA because there was no public purpose for the revocation of the license and because there was no compensation for such alleged expropriation. Neither of those two reasons are true. As regards the first, the lack of \"public purpose\" assertion, one may, at least, wonder how can the majority assert any such thing when the sanction consisting in the revocation of the License was adopted by the ENREJA in response to the violation by the company of its legal obligations as Licensee and in order to reestablish thereby the integrity of the breached Article 5 of Law No. 7020? It makes no sense to assert there is no public purpose. But if, in addition, one verifies the nature of the obligations breached and their purpose of preventing money laundering in the national and international struggle against capital flight, drug trafficking and terrorism, as well as the fact that money laundering also affected the finances of the Province for its bearish incidence in the determination of the amount of the company's yearly license fee, the majority's assertion is astonishing. It is difficult to find so much \"public interest\" in the grounds for an administrative sanction.\n\n406.\n\nAs for the second reason, the lack of compensation, court and arbitral decisions and the doctrine have for long been explaining that lack of compensation does not in itself render the expropriation unlawful*,* in particular, when there is, like in the instant case, a dispute regarding the existence of the alleged expropriation or when the question is *sub judice.* In addition, in this case, Article 4 of Argentina-Austria BIT does not reproduce the \"Hull formula\" of the 1920s. We shall quote here, because of their authority, the statements in such regard by the *Venezuela Holdings (and others) v. Venezuela* ICSID tribunal (Guillaume, Kaufman-Kohler, El-Kosheri) in their award of 9 October 2014: \"the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful\" (para. 301 of the Award).\n\n407.\n\nIn sum, I reject this majority Award as it is a decision that fails to apply to this dispute resolution the \"applicable law\" defined by the Argentina-Austria BIT in Article 8 (6). What the majority Award does is substituting the \"law applicable\" to the dispute resolution for a so called \"Applicable Legal Standard\" devised by the majority. In particular:\n\n1. The majority Award fails to apply Law No. 7020 of the Province of Salta or the final ENREJA Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 that are Respondent's domestic law and, as such, \"law applicable\" to this dispute resolution as provided for by the Argentina-Austria BIT, nor does it take into account that ENJASA having withdrawn from the contentious-administrative proceedings before the competent court for the Province of Salta requesting annulment of such Resolutions, the two aforementioned Resolutions are final decisions;\n\n2. It fails to apply the provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT regarding (i) the definition of the content and scope of \"shares and any other form of participation in companies\" (Article 1(b)) and (ii) the applicable law (Article 8 (6)); and it improperly applies (iii) the provisions of expropriation (Article 4 (1) and (2));\n\n3. It fails to apply the customary rule of international law that the adverse effects to third parties of the regular exercise by the competent bodies of a State's regulatory, supervisory or police powers are not a ground for such State's international responsibility and, accordingly, they are non-compensable, the Award incurring *infra petita* with respect to any such defense invoked by Respondent;\n\n4. It subjects consideration of said customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent as defense on the merits, to prior ascertainment that there is no \"indirect expropriation\" when any such subordination is alien to international law, also violating the procedural rule applied by international tribunals which sets forth that consideration of objections precedes that of claims;\n\n5. It errs when considering that the mere ascertainment of an \"indirect expropriation\" has the effect of excluding consideration of the customary rule of international law invoked by Respondent on grounds such as \"arbitrariness\" admitted by international law, when any such exception to the application of the aforementioned customary rule shall be of such a degree or level that it is tantamount to denying the rule of law;\n\n6. It errs when considering that the \"lack of proportionality\" of the self-proclaimed \"Legal Standard\" the majority applies *in lieu of* the \"applicable law\" defined by the Argentina-Austria BIT is as such one of the grounds of high degree or level that by way of exception international law admits to eventually exclude application of the customary rule invoked by Respondent which has satisfied the proportionality condition of Argentine law that is the \"law applicable\" to this dispute resolution;\n\n7. With reference to ENREJA Resolution No. 240/13 revoking ENJASA's license, it states that the Argentine Republic has acted arbitrarily and lacking proportionality with the Claimants not having exhausted Respondent's local remedies as required in this matter by both the relevant primary rule of international law as well as the secondary rule of the same law which proclaims that the responsibility of a State may not be invoked when the claim is one to which the primary rule of exhaustion of the aforementioned local remedies applies (Article 44 of the ILC Articles on International Responsibility of States);\n\n8. It states that Respondent has incurred international responsibility, with the Argentine Republic not having breached any international obligation in its relationships with Claimants since the \"indirect expropriation\" it ascertains under Respondent's responsibility based on the self-proclaimed \"Legal Standard\" mentioned above does not breach the provisions for \"direct expropriations\" set forth by Article 4 (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n9. It disregards the customary rule regarding investments that sets forth the allocation of risks between the investor and the host State when failing to assign Claimants, that controlled, managed, ran and administered the company the \"business risk\" of the revocation of the License for breaches by ENJASA of its legal obligations, without the Argentina-Austria BIT as well as non-existing particular agreements between the Parties having repealed in the instant case the risk allocation of the aforementioned customary rule;\n\n10. It errs when, Claimants having failed to demonstrate it, the majority Award questions with appalling lightness in some excerpts thereof the good faith of the Authorities of the Province and that of the ENREJA itself regarding the revocation of the license (and even the \"transition plan\") when the revocation was adopted at the conclusion of a \"due process\" and in full observance of ENJASA's right of defense and, alternatively, such Authorities could have declared the extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the License by operation of law in application of Article 6 of the License Agreement. By contrast, the majority Award does not show the same interest in analyzing, in no context whatsoever, the good faith of Claimants, that controlled, managed, ran and administered ENJASA when the company repeatedly breached Article 5 of Law No. 7020. Treatment in the majority Award of the good faith principle is utterly uneven.\n\n11. It substitutes its alleged interpretation of Law No. 7020 and Resolution No. 240/13 of Argentine domestic law for the interpretation of such Law and such Resolution by the Argentine Republic's competent bodies in contradiction with the principle of international law stated by the ICJ in *Diallo* that international tribunals do not have the power to substitute their own interpretation of a State's domestic law for that given by the competent authorities of such State.\n\n**PART IV: THE COMPENSATION AWARDED TO CLAIMANTS BY THE MAJORITY AWARD**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nAs we have already pointed out in paragraph 26 of the Introduction hereto, the resolution of the present dispute does not raise any question on the assessment of injuries or adverse effects, as Respondent has not engaged in any conduct in violation of the Argentina-Austria BIT. The majority, however, has erroneously concluded that Respondent has incurred international responsibility towards Claimants for breach of Article 4 (1) and (2) of such BIT (indirect expropriation) and, accordingly, that Claimants have suffered, as they allege, an *injury* that shall be compensated by Respondent. The grounds of the Award try to justify the reasons why the majority awards compensation to Claimants, the quantum of which amounts to USD 21,160,000 plus compound interest (sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 610) of the majority Award Decision).\n\n409.\n\nAs already explained herein, Respondent: (i) has exercised, as a sovereign State, the regulatory, and supervision or police powers in its territory when sanctioning ENJASA, an Argentine company, with the revocation of the Licensee it held for the exploitation of games of chance in the Province of Salta for breaching the obligations by Licensee laid out in Article 5 of Provincial Law No. 7020; and (ii) in the exercise of such sovereign powers Respondent has not violated any of the provisions of the Argentina-Austria BIT invoked by Claimants with respect to any of their three claims. Therefore, in this part of the Opinion, I shall confine myself to make some critical observations and comments of legal nature which in the present context also evidence that the majority has failed to properly apply the \"law applicable\" to this dispute as defined by Article 8 (6) of the above-mentioned BIT.\n\n410.\n\nMy first observation on this part of the majority Award devoted to compensation is the following: the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal erroneously assumes that Respondent has incurred international responsibility towards Claimants for \"indirect expropriation\" and that such \"indirect expropriation\" is a *necessary* and *sufficient* condition for the Arbitral Tribunal to award, without further ado, compensation to Claimants and determine its quantum. Nothing is more erroneous, because even though any such conclusion is a certainly *necessary* condition, it is not, by contrast, a *sufficient* condition. For a *sufficient* condition to exist, Claimants should have proved, in accordance with the general principle on evidence production (*actori incumbit probatio*) the injury they allege to have suffered as a result of the \"indirect expropriation\" Respondent would have incurred for the breach of Article 4 (1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT according to the majority Award.\n\n411.\n\nIn my opinion, Claimants have failed to produce any such evidence, which is confirmed by the Award when awarding them compensation in an amount considerably lower than the minimum figure requested. Neither have they proved having suffered an *injury* in the quantum granted thereto by the majority Award. The majority has helped Claimants when awarding them the aforementioned amount. But this has a cost: it worsens the dysfunctions in the application of the \"applicable law\" that characterize the majority decision in this Award.\n\n412.\n\nThe jurisprudence of the ICJ is crystal clear in such regard: in order to award compensation by way of reparation for the commission of an internationally wrongful act, it is claimant (and not the tribunal itself, or respondent) that shall demonstrate having suffered an *injury* as a direct consequence of any such wrongful act and its extent, as well as the fact that the injury at issue can be subject to financial assessment. According to the ICJ, in order to award compensation it shall be clearly ascertained, first *whether damage has been proved* and then, whether the damage proved has a sufficiently direct nexus with the wrongful act that caused any such damage. In the matter *Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area* the Judgment of the Court on compensation of 2 February 2018 reads as follows:\n\n\"In order to award compensation, the Court will ascertain whether, and to what extent, each of the various heads of damage claimed by the Applicant can be established and whether they are the consequence of wrongful conduct by the Respondent, by determining whether there is a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act and the injury suffered by the Applicant\" (ICJ Reports 2018, p. 15, para. 32.)\n\n413.\n\nIn international arbitration practice in investment matters it is also necessary that a sufficient nexus between the wrongful act and the alleged *injury* exist and, in addition, there is emphasis on the fact that it is claimant that bears the burden to prove the existence and extent not only of the internationally wrongful act it has been subject to but also of the *injury* the wrongful act at issue has allegedly caused thereto. There are numerous awards that expressly state that for compensation to exist claimant shall have met the burden to prove the *injury* suffered. For instance:\n\n\"the burden is on (the Claimant) to prove the quantum of the losses in respect of which it put forward its claims; compensation is payable only in respect of harm that is proved to have a sufficient causal link with the specific NAFTA provision that has been breached\" (*S.D. Myers v. Canada*, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, para. 316;)\n\n\"a claimant has the burden of proving both the breach and the claimed loss or damage\" (*Grand River v. United States, Award,* 12 January 2011, para. 237;)\n\n\"It is clear that it is the Claimant that bears the burden of proof in respect to the fact and the amount of loss\" (*Crystallex v. Venezuela*, Award, 4 April 2016, para. 864;)\n\n\"It is a basic tenet of investment arbitration that a claimant must prove its pleaded loss. must show, in other words, what alleged injury or damage was caused by the breach of its legal rights\" (*Pey Casado v. Chile (II)*, Award, 13 September 2016, paras. 205-206;)\n\n\"(the) Tribunal considers that the burden of proving the existence of loss or damage suffered by Claimants lies with them\" (*Valores Mundiales v. Venezuela,* Award, 25 July 2017, para. 695;)\n\n\"The Claimant bears the legal burden of proving its case on compensation. This general principle is well established under international law: *onus probandi actori incumbit.* If and to the extent that the Claimant does not prove its case on the assessment of compensation, it follows that its claim for compensation must be dismissed by the Tribunal\" (*9Ren Holding v. Spain,* Award, 31 May 2019. para. 405.)\n\n414.\n\nThe doctrine confirms it is the investor that has the burden to prove it has suffered a damage caused by the violation ascribed to the host State and that failing to meet any such burden of proof prevents its being awarded compensation. See, *e.g.*, Meg Kinnear, *Damages in International Investment Arbitration*, at Katia Yannaca-Small, Arbitration under Investment Agreements, 2010, p. 556. Also, *inter alia*, in the same line: Craig Miles and David Weiss, *Overview of Principles Reducing Damages,* at John A. Trenor, The Guide to Damages in International Arbitration, 2017, p. 78.\n\n415.\n\nTherefore, in the present arbitration it is for Claimants to prove the *injury* they have allegedly suffered for the revocation of the License ENJASA held, as well as the quantum of compensation they claim by way of reparation of any such *injury*. In principle, there is thus no room for compensation should Claimants fail to satisfy both proofs. In their Post Hearing Brief (PHB) Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal to award them compensation in *no less than USD 51,919,998* (items 4 and 5 of their final conclusions) but they have not been able to prove it. In fact, both for the majority Award as well as for the drafter of this Opinion, Claimants have failed to prove that the *injury* they allege the aforementioned revocation have caused them is of a quantum tantamount to or in excess of the *51,919,998 dollars* mentioned hereinabove. The majority Award actually provides at sub-paragraph (3) of its decision (paragraph 610 of the Award) that Respondent pay compensation to Claimants in the amount of USD 21,160,000 plus interest, that is to say, an amount significantly lower than the compensation requested by Claimants.\n\n416.\n\nThis corroborates the disproportion of the compensation requested by Claimants, not only for the figure significantly *lower* than the amount requested thereby, but also, especially, if it is borne in mind that the majority decides the amount of 21,160,000 dollars by way of compensation at the conclusion of a reasoning in which the majority adapts *in toto* or in its key aspects, the valuation model, the pertinent cash flow and the discount or update rate proposed by Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen. It is with respect to the exchange rate between pesos and dollars and in connection to the claim by Claimants of expenses allegedly incurred after the revocation of ENJASA's License that the majority adopts the proposal by Respondent and its expert, Mr. Dapena.\n\n417.\n\nBesides, the difference between the amount requested by Claimants and that awarded by the majority in their Award is not ascribable to the fact that Claimants had requested an amount no less than USD 51,919,998 for the alleged breach of the BIT by Respondent for three reasons: (i) breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) (indirect expropriation); (ii) breach of Article 4(3) (direct expropriation) and (iii) breach of Article 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), whereas the Award states, at sub-paragraph (1) of the Decision, that Respondent has breached Article 4(1) and 4 (2) of the BIT (indirect expropriation) and, at its subparagraph (2), it fails to rule on the other two reasons alleged by Claimants through the following formula: \"The Tribunal makes no findings as to the claimed breaches by Respondent of Arts. 4(3) and 2(1), *as any such breaches would be consumed by the finding under (1).*\"(Emphasis added.) My general conclusion, as already mentioned in paragraph 363, is that Respondent has not breached the BIT on account of any of the three reasons alleged by Claimants.\n\n418.\n\nIt is thus confirmed that the compensation requested by Claimants is doubly disproportionate, which suggests that the implied acknowledgment that Mr. Dapena's expert assessment on whose expert report Respondent has relied on to allege that for the *qua non* purposes of a potential reparation the amount was not in excess of USD 13 million was, all in all, more accurate than that endorsed by Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen on the question of *determining the amount of compensation claimed by Claimants.* In fact, the compensation awarded by the majority Award is much closer to the *no more than 13 million* of Respondent and its expert than to the *no less than 51 million* of Claimants and their expert. And it should be even closer to the 13 million if the majority of this Arbitral Tribunal had adjusted more its valuation to the provisions set forth by the applicable rules of public international law on *injury* assessment*,* as well as to the higher relative evidentiary value of the evidence produced in such regard by Respondent and its expert, than to the elements produced on the matter by Claimants and their expert.\n\n419.\n\nThe legally more relevant questions for determining the alleged adverse effect (lost profits) suffered by Claimants' investment following revocation are considered by the majority Award in paragraphs 530 to 543under the title \"The Relevant Cash Flow.\" The assessment of such effect or injury through the \"discounted cash flow\" (DCF) method, implies the weighting of different risk and probability elements and thus requires accuracy in its application.\n\n420.\n\nThe majority adopts as the basis of its own analysis conclusions of Mr. Rosen's expert report which lack accuracy because of its use as evidence (of several decisive questions) mere requested instructions given to the expert by Claimants for the purposes of the instant case, or non-corroborated spreadsheets of an ENJASA run by Claimants. The majority fails to take into account objective evidence, that being duly audited financial statements or balance sheets, used by Mr. Dapena, the latest of which pertains to the year 2012, or the logical considerations based on historical information provided to the Arbitral Tribunal by the addition of those financial statements or balance sheets with respect to the profits obtained during thirteen years by Claimants, for their investment in ENJASA through L&E.\n\n421.\n\nThe analysis the majority Award makes at the paragraphs mentioned hereinabove assumes Claimants' unproven overstatements on their \"lost profits\" - by intermediation of Mr. Rosen's expert report - for the purpose of reaching the amount of USD 21,160,000 awarded thereto as compensation by any such Award, with Claimants having failed to prove that ENJASA's cash flows on the valuation date, *i.e*., 13 August 2013, warrant any such amount. Just one example of this behavior by the majority suffices to illustrate what we say. Paragraph 534 of the majority Award that qualifies \"The real difference between the cash flow analysis of both experts starts in the year 2014\" with respect to income originating in slot machines managed by Video Drome within the framework of its Joint Venture decides, in paragraph 535, the question with these words: \"For this reason, the Tribunal is not convinced that the basis for Mr. Rosen's projections for the year 2013 is defective and would lead to inappropriate results.\" It is with this statement that the majority Award dismisses Mr. Dapena's accurate criticism that Mr. Rosen's projections at issue were unacceptable because, on the valuation date, cash flows originating in the aforementioned slot machines were ENJASA's \"uncertain\" flows, given that on the valuation date they were Video Drome's cash flows and the relevant agreement of that company with ENJASA was still in force on such date.\n\n422.\n\nIn any event, the decision to include or exclude the aforementioned cash flows is an issue of legal nature and Messrs. Dapena and Rosen did not testify as legal experts. It shall, thus, be resolved in accordance with the applicable relevant provisions of international law that reject with no palliative whatsoever, as contrary to international law, that a claimant can use uncertain, speculative, or remote arguments or elements as Claimants and their expert Mr. Rosen have done in this arbitration and which has been endorsed by the majority Award. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal unequivocally stated in 1987 that \"(o)ne of the best settled rules of the law of international responsibility of States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damages can be awarded\" (*Amoco International v. Iran,* Partial Award, 14 July 1987, para. 238.) It is on the basis of the provisions set forth by the applicable international law that I reject the majority Award decisions of adding to ENJASA's relevant cash flows: (i) the above-mentioned Video Drome's cash flows for being speculative and uncertain on the valuation date; and (ii) Cachi Valle's cash flows, added as well, for being remote with respect to the sanction revoking ENJASA's License.\n\n423.\n\nArbitration Tribunals in investment matters share the tenet stated by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal quoted *supra*, since they have themselves stated in many instances, in their awards, the same principle, as evidenced by the following quotes:\n\n\"Under international law and the BITs, the Claimants bear the overall burden of proving the loss founding their claims for compensation. If that loss is found to be too uncertain or speculative or otherwise unproven, the Tribunal must reject these claims, even if liability is established against the Respondent\" (*Gemplus v. Mexico,* Award 16 June 2010, para. 12.56;)\n\n\"damages cannot be speculative or uncertain\" (*Khan Resources v. Mongolia,* Award, 2 March 2015, para. 375;)\n\n\"(w)hat must be proven is both the existence of an injury to the claimant and that particular injury is the sufficiently proximate consequence of the specific breach\" (*Pey Casado v. Chile (II),* Award, 13 September 2016, para. 2118.)\n\n424.\n\nENJASA's earnings projection for the purpose of determining the quantum of lost profits Claimants allege to have suffered through the aforementioned discounted cash flow method have also been unduly increased by the majority Award - in contradiction with the applicable rules of international law - for the legal effect of the two following factors: (i) an unreasonable definition of the \"discount rate used,\"; and (ii) the silence on \"Claimants' contribution to the injury\" they allege to have suffered due to the revocation of the License. This last factor is considered *infra* in paragraphs 439 to 446 , but the first is to be examined in this context. It is worth pointing out that to the extent the Parties and their experts have failed to pronounce themselves, in whole or in part on such factors, I consider them under the *jura novit curia* defined by the PCIJ in the *Lotus* case as follows:\n\n\"The *jura novit curia* principle means that, in order to decide that the parties' conclusions are founded on law, the Court shall not solely rely on the parties' allegations regarding the applicable law\" (*PCIJ, Series A, No. 10,* p. 31) (Translation of the French original by me).\n\n425.\n\nFor consideration of the first of those factors it is convenient to bear in mind that, in accordance with international law, when the financial assessment of the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act consists in \"lost profits\", as in the instant case, any such assessment can be actually made on the basis of such profit, but only *insofar as it is established* (Article 36, paragraph 2, of the ILC). An international tribunal shall thus confirm to what extent there has been \"lost profits\" before determining the quantum of the corresponding compensation. Besides, when the subsequent financial assessment of the \"lost profits established\" is conducted through a method that implies different elements of risk and probability, as the \"discounted cash flow\" used by the majority Award, the tribunal shall exercise extreme caution, since, as the ILC warns in paragraph 26 of the commentary to Article 36:\n\n\"Difficulties can arise in the application of the DCF method to establish capital value in the compensation context. The method analyses a wide range of inherently speculative elements, some of which have a significant impact upon the outcome (*e.g.* discount rates, currency fluctuations, inflation figures, commodity prices, interest rates and other commercial risks). This has led tribunals to adopt a cautious approach to the use of the method. Hence, although income-based methods have been accepted in principle, there has been a decided preference for asset-based methods.\"\n\n426.\n\nThe majority has failed to act with sufficient caution since the Award uses an inappropriate update or discount rate. Any such rate reflects that when ENJASA's License was revoked there were still seventeen years of effectiveness of the License. This temporary element is correct, but it is not the only factor that shall be taken into consideration with respect to the fixing of any such rate. There was also the possibility to terminate the License at any time, before expiration, by way of revocation decided by ENREJA pursuant to Provincial Law No. 7020 or by extinction and/or automatic cancellation of the License by operation of law on the grounds laid down in Article 6 of the License Agreement. Accordingly, it is not correct to use in the calculation of any such rate only the temporary element of the aforementioned seventeen years of effectiveness the License still had. In any such calculation, besides the company's debts, the risk that the License fail to reach its term as a result of early revocation, cancellation or extinction shall also be taken into account.\n\n427.\n\nIn other words, to the projection of ENJASA's profit or income probabilities during the aforementioned seventeen years, the debt and also the projection of losses resulting from the quantification of the above-mentioned early revocation, cancellation or extinction risk shall be subtracted, what the majority Award has failed to do. It is not acceptable to project possible income and exclude possible losses. The future income projection of an entitlement of revocable nature or subject to the possibility of cancellation or extinction before expiration of its effectiveness, as it occurred with ENJASA's License, cannot be the same as that of an entitlement which is not subject to any such conditions.\n\n428.\n\nThe ILC in its commentary to Article 36 (Compensation) distinguishes \"three categories of loss of profits.\" The third category precisely relates to claims for loss of profits in the context of concessions and other contractually protected interests, highlighting the incidence in the matter of contractual provisions and of other pertinent limitations:\n\n\"31) ... Again, in such cases, lost future income has sometimes been awarded. In the case of contracts, it is the future income stream which is compensated, up to the time when the legal recognition of entitlement ends. In some contracts this is immediate, e.g. where the contract is determinable at the instance of the State, or where some other basis for contractual termination exists. Or it may arise from some future date dictated by the terms of the contract itself.\n\n32) In other cases, lost profits have been excluded on the basis that they were not sufficiently established as a legally protected interest... Claims for lost profits are also subject to the usual range of limitations on the recovery of damages, such as causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected (income) figures.\"\n\n429.\n\nApart from the compensation of USD 21,160,000 as principal sum mentioned *supra*, the majority Award adds at paragraph 610 (3) that Respondent \"(is liable) [to pay] interest at a rate of 4 % per annum compounded annually from 13 August 2013 until full payment thereof\" on such amount of USD 21,160,000. At paragraphs 36 to 39 of this Opinion, I have already explained that the rule of customary international law on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts dealing with \"interest\" awards is codified in Article 38 of the ILC Articles.\n\n430.\n\nArticle 38 provides that interest shall be payable only \"when necessary in order to ensure full reparation\" of the injury, since international law on reparation of the injury makes a clear distinction between the \"principal sum\" of compensation and the \"interest\" award admitted. Thus, the first thing to be done by an international arbitral tribunal in order to award interest is to verify whether it is necessary to ensure full reparation of the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act in question and, if so, duly state the reasons in the award. The payment of interest may not be presumed, which is why awarding interest must be reasoned, because, should there be no need to pay interest in order to ensure full reparation of the injury, an international arbitral tribunal is not empowered to make such an award. As the ILC relevantly states at paragraph (1) of its commentary to Article 38, \"[i]nterest is not an autonomous form of reparation\" and \"nor is it a necessary part of compensation in every case.\" Consequently, it is neither compensatory nor, of course, punitive interest. Nor is it a way of using the power to award interest as permitted by Article 38 as a disguised means of awarding an additional \"principal sum\" not proved by claimant.\n\n431.\n\nThe reasons stated in the majority Award do not provide a satisfactory explanation of why, *in casu*, interest should be added to the compensation awarded for full reparation of the injury proved to be ensured. In other words, the reasons do not clearly explain why it is necessary to award high interest. Moreover, when the principal sum awarded to Claimants has been calculated in view of their \"loss of profits\" as investors, it is essential to clarify (as stated at paragraph 32 of the ILC commentary to Article 36 on Compensation) whether compensation for loss of profits and the interest award do not give rise to double recovery, given that, as per the commentary, the profit-earning capital cannot be simultaneously earning interest and generating profits.\n\n432.\n\nWhat is absolutely impossible to explain in light of the \"applicable law\" is that the interest awarded by the majority Award is \"compound interest,\" since, under international law, such interest is inadmissible, as confirmed by international tribunals' refusal to award that kind of interest. This is also confirmed by paragraph (8) of the ILC commentary to Article 38 (Interest) whereby \"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals\" has been against the award of \"compound interest.\" Judicial and arbitral institutions, such as the PCIJ, the ICJ or the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, have consistently denied claims for \"compound interest.\"\n\n433.\n\nIn such regard, it is worth recalling once again that, as mandated by the Argentina-Austria BIT, this Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to apply to reparation of the injury (wrongly verified by the majority) the relevant rules of public international law in force and effect, which are the codified customary rules on \"compensation\" (Article 36) and \"interest\" (Article 38) adopted by the ILC in 2001. At paragraph (9) of the commentary to Article 38, the ILC states that, \"given the present state of international law, it cannot be said that an injured State has any entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation.\" If an injured State does not have such entitlement under customary international law, and the Argentina-Austria BIT contains no provision repealing that customary rule in favor of its respective national private investors, nor can these investors have an entitlement to \"compound interest\" being awarded by this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n434.\n\nIn ICSID arbitration practice, tribunals have sometimes chosen to award \"simple interest\" (for example, in *CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentina,* 2005), while, in other cases, they have opted to award \"compound interest\" (for example, in *MTD Equity v. Chile,* 2004). I ignore the reasons why \"compound interest\" was awarded in these latter cases, and I do not know why the \"compound interest\" awarded in such cases was based on a rule of law that tribunals were bound to apply or whether such interest was awarded at the tribunals' discretion. In any case, the award of \"compound interest\" by ICSID tribunals has not been accompanied, in general, by the proper reasoning that would be expected, given the denial of that kind of interest under general international law.\n\n435.\n\nThe citation in the majority Award of the tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico* is one of the few that explain the award of \"compound interest,\" but, of course, has no authority to modify the international law codified by the ILC in Article 38. As to the content of the passage cited, I opine that the citation cannot be more wrong when referring to the \"practice\" of international investment tribunals as \"jurisprudence\" and attributing this so-called \"jurisprudence\" the power to repeal the international law in force that this Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to apply to the assessment of the \"interest\" that it is entitled to award pursuant to Article 8 (6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT.\n\n436.\n\nIn the present case, there is absolutely no doubt that the Parties totally disagree on the issue of \"compound interest.\" Claimants requested it, but Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal that, \"[i]nterest, if any, should be calculated as simple interest and at a short-term, risk-free rate\" (paragraphs 350-356 of its PHB). Nor do the Parties agree on the dispute liable to disregard the rule of general international law denying \"compound interest.\" Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal's decision to award \"compound interest\" is supported neither by applicable international law, nor by the Argentina-Austria BIT or the disputing Parties' agreement. Nor are we facing one of those \"special circumstances\" which, according to the ILC, \"*justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation*\" (paragraph (9) of the ILC commentary to Article 38).\n\n437.\n\nThe \"compound interest\" awarded by the majority Award applies to the period both pre- and post-Award and accrues as from the date on which Resolution No. 240/13 revoking the License was adopted, i.e., 13 August 2013. Such date ignores the fact that, between that date and the date on which Resolution No. 315/13 was adopted, ENJASA continued exploiting games of chance in the Province of Salta as usual, and, thus, the profits made by controlling Claimants during the period elapsed between the dates of both Resolutions do not seem to have been affected, subject to evidence to the contrary. This anomaly may give rise to double recovery. In addition, the interest rate of 4% and the \"annual computation\" of the compound interest awarded by the majority Award are excessive in order to ensure full reparation in this case. It is wrong to use an interest rate that includes a risk premium so as to discount the amount awarded to Claimants by the majority Award, because the amount awarded as compensation for the injury is a certain and specific sum of money, a risk-free asset, and, thus, should be discounted by means of a short-term, risk-free rate that only makes up for the *time value of money,* which, as usual, is done through the rate of return of one-year U.S. Treasury bonds. What the majority Award does is to apply not only the \"expected inflation premium,\" but also a \"risk premium,\" to a \"risk-free asset.\" This decision adopted by the majority Award distorts the limited function of interest awards that is to ensure full reparation under the international law on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts.\n\n438.\n\nIn sum, neither \"compound interest\" nor its application in the majority Award are based on applicable international law. Therefore, it is neither lawful nor fair for the majority Award to order Respondent to pay that kind of interest, or for both pre- and post-Award interest to accrue as from 13 August 2013. In relation to the former, before awarding interest of any kind, it is also vital to determine whether they are warranted in light of certain considerations of fairness, as well as the following established facts: (i) Claimants had failed to exhaust Respondent's local court remedies in connection with the decision to revoke the License when instituting this ICSID arbitration; (ii) ENJASA continued pursuing its business activities as usual under Claimants' control until Resolution No. 315/13 was adopted; (iii) Respondent is not responsible for the time elapsed in the arbitral proceeding between Claimants' submission of their Request for Arbitration before ICSID and both Parties' submission of their Post-Hearing Briefs (24 January 2020), as the proceeding was conducted as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal subject to the agreement of the Parties and/or prior consultation with them; and (iv) Respondent is not at all responsible for the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal has needed around a year and a half as from the date of submission of Post-Hearing Briefs to prepare the Award.\n\n**PART V: THE SILENCE IN THE MAJORITY AWARD ON CLAIMANTS' CONTRIBUTION TO THE INJURY ALLEGED THEREBY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Award incurs yet another unacceptable subjectivity as to the determination of *quantum*. Once again, the victim is \"applicable law.\" I refer to the silence in the majority Award on Claimants' contribution to the injury that they allege to have suffered as a consequence of the revocation of ENJASA's License.\n\n440.\n\nIt is inadmissible to invoke or apply the principle of the duty to make full reparation for the injury caused by the commission of an internationally wrongful act (laid down by the PCIJ in the case concerning the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*) without taking into consideration the claimant's prospective contribution to the injury, since the respondent liable for the internationally wrongful act in question only has a duty to make reparation for the injuries actually caused thereby. The case-law of the ICJ so confirmed both before the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of 2001 (for example, in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*) and afterwards (for example, in the case *concerning Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area with Costa Rica.*)\n\n441.\n\nThe text of Article 39 (Contribution to the injury) of the ILC Articles cannot be clearer:\n\n\"*In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken* of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State *or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought*.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe commentary to Article 39 specifies, *inter alia,* in relation to such provision, that: (i) its focus is on situations which in national law systems are referred to as \"contributory negligence\", \"comparative fault\", \"*faute de la victime*\", etc. (paragraph 1); (ii) this is consonant with the principle that full reparation is due for the injury\u2014but nothing more\u2014arising in consequence of the internationally wrongful act, as well as consistent with fairness (paragraph 2); (iii) only those actions or omissions which can be considered as willful or negligent are taken into account, even though the willful or negligent action or omission has not reached the level of being serious or gross (paragraph 5); (iv) the relevance of any negligence to reparation will depend upon the degree to which it has contributed to the damage as well as the other circumstances of the case (*ibid*)*;* and (v) the phrase \"account shall be taken\" under Article 38 indicates that the article deals with factors that are capable of affecting the form or reducing the amount of reparation. *.*\n\n442.\n\nOnce the said Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts were adopted by the ILC in 2001 and endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in the same year, international investment arbitration tribunals have stated that the provision of Article 39 is declaratory of customary international law, and that, in determining reparation, they have reduced the amount of compensation by applying a percentage calculated on the basis of the role played by the claimant investor in the generation of the damage or injury alleged thereby. The awards cited as examples include, *inter alia*, the following:\n\n\"BITs are not an insurance against business risks and the Tribunal considers that Claimants should bear the consequences of their own actions as experienced businessmen\" (*MTD Equity v. Chile,* Award, 23 May 2004, para. 178);\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees that an award of damages may be reduced if the claiming party also committed a fault which contributed to the prejudice it suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its discretion, considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility\" (*Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador*, Award, 5 October 2012, para. 678);\n\n\"Art. 39 ILC requires that the Claimants' conduct be taken into account in determining compensation. Indeed, in investment cases, Tribunals have reduced damages by a percentage reflecting the investor's role in the events leading to a loss\" (*Anatoli Stati v. Kazakhstan,* Award, 19 December 2013, para. 1331);\n\n\"(A)n award of damages may be reduced if the victim of the wrongful act of the respective State also committed a fault which contributed to the prejudice it suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its discretion, considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility ... Having considered and weighed all the arguments which the Parties have presented ...the Tribunal ... finds that, as a result of the material and significant misconduct by Claimants and by Yukos (which they controlled), Claimants have contributed to ... the prejudice which they suffered as a result of Respondent's destruction of Yukos\" (*Yukos v. Russia,* Award, 18 July 2014, paras. 1633 and 1637);\n\n\"(T)he general approach taken in all the decisions, whether treated as causation, contributory fault (based on wilful willful or negligent act or omission) or unclear hands, is materially the same, deriving from a consistent line of international legal materials. The Tribunal decides to apply that general approach in this case. As further explained below, it decides that the Claimant's injury was caused both by the Respondent's unlawful expropriation and also by the Claimant's own contributory negligent acts and omissions and unclear hands. Given that the Tribunal draws no distinction between these different concepts for this case, it prefers to refer only to Article 39 of the ILC Articles\" (*Copper Mesa v. Ecuador,* Award, 15 March 2016, para. 6.97).\n\n443.\n\nReductions in the amount of compensation evidently depend on the higher or lower impact that the claimant investor's willful or negligent actions or omissions have had on the injury caused in any given case, reaching the point of being incredibly significant. For example, in *MTD Equity v. Chile*, the reduction in the amount of compensation on account of the investor's contribution to the injury was approximately 50% and, in *Yukos v. Russia*, around 25%.\n\n444.\n\nGiven that the majority Award calculates the value of the injury suffered by 60% of Claimants' shares in L&E as a consequence of the revocation of ENJASA's License in an aggregate amount of USD 21,660,000 (paragraph 565 of the Award), CAI's and CAIH's contribution to the injury assessed by an expert appointed by the Arbitral Tribunal must be subtracted from such figure so as to adjust the majority's conclusion to the provision of Article 39 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n445.\n\nIn the present case, there is absolutely no doubt that, by means of their willful or negligent actions or omissions, Claimants contributed to the injury alleged thereby. They controlled, managed, ran and administered ENJASA when ENREJA imposed most of the sanctions in response to the company's serious and repeated violations or breaches of its obligations as Licensee under Article 5 of Provincial Law No. 7020. The 21 sanctioning Resolutions prior to ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13 have been established, and ENJASA, which was controlled by Claimants (except apparently in one of those cases), admitted to the commission of such violations or breaches, as it failed to object thereto, either before administrative tribunals or courts of justice. Despite ENREJA's warnings, the violations or breaches continued, which led ENREJA to revoke the License as a sanction.\n\n446.\n\nClaimants are responsible for such \"inveterate recidivism,\" because, as ENJASA's managers, controllers, and administrators, they contributed to the injury allegedly caused thereto by the revocation of the License. Furthermore, Claimants also contributed to increasing the injury that they allege to have suffered thanks to the conduct they assumed after Resolution No. 240/13. In accordance with the witness statements of Messrs. Tucek and Schreiner, in the conversations held during the weeks following the revocation of ENJASA's License, provincial authorities orally suggested that they keep Salta and Boulevard Casinos, but they rejected the proposal. Once Resolution No. 315/13 dismissed the recourse for reconsideration of the revocation sanction, Claimants, as proved by documentary evidence, had the administrative opportunity to participate in the \"transition plan,\" which would have enabled them to obtain the exploitation of one or more new licenses, but declined the invitation and, thus, the mitigation of the injury alleged in this ICSID arbitration. In my opinion, the expert assessment of Claimants' contribution to the injury that they allege to have suffered should include their willful or negligent actions or omissions both before (as relevant) and after Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13.\n\n**PART VI: THE DECISION IN THE MAJORITY AWARD ON THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nI reject the majority decision on costs which, in the case-specific circumstances, deems inappropriate and contrary to elementary considerations of fairness. I consider that each Party should bear its own expenses and that common expenses be equally shared between both Parties. With regard to the addition of \"interest\" on arbitration costs, as the formula adopted by the majority does, I think it is outrageous and completely inapposite, as well as contrary to international law. Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention, which is cited, makes no reference whatsoever to interest awards. As far as I am concerned, no one has even mentioned or proposed the award of interest in the decision on how and by whom expenses shall be paid in any of the ICSID and PCA investment arbitrations in which I have participated as an arbitrator.\n\n448.\n\nIn my view, this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal has the power to award simple interest on \"any principal amount due\" in order to ensure full reparation of the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, pursuant to ILC Article 38. But it does not have the power to award interest, of whichever kind and method of calculation, on the amount(s) determined in \"the decision on how and by whom [arbitration] expenses shall be paid,\" as the majority does at paragraph (4) of this Award in its paragraph 607. This interest is not related to the \"principal amount due\" by Respondent, but to the enforcement of this Award, which is an issue subject to the national system of the country where the Arbitral Tribunal is sitting.\n\n449.\n\nBoth the Decision on Jurisdiction and this Award on the merits are based on majority decisions which ignore the \"law applicable\" to the present dispute, as defined in the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The criterion of \"prevalence\" of one party over the other does not apply in light of the principle of procedural good faith governing international arbitration. Such Decision and this Award are not based on rules of law of any of the three systems that form the law applicable to the present dispute, namely: (i) Argentine law; (ii) the Argentina-Austria BIT; and (iii) public international law. Applicable law is replaced by mere extreme and subjective interpretations of academic criteria lacking normativity, such as those of \"sole effect\" and \"*strictu sensu* proportionality\", which are not even mentioned in the relevant BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\n450.\n\nThis majority Award is a novelty among the countless investment awards cited by Claimants in their written and oral arguments, none of which resemble the circumstances of fact and of law of the instant case. And it is a negative novelty so as to maintain minimum legal certainty in the relationships between foreign investors and host States of investments. The fact that an ICSID arbitral tribunal assumes the role of a court of appeals and modifies a final administrative decision, adopted by the competent Regulatory Agency and Enforcement Authority of the host State, when the domestic law of such State is the law applicable to the settlement of the present dispute as mandated by the BIT itself, is undoubtedly an unacceptable attempt against the fundamental legal certainty that is to govern the relationships between foreign private investors and host States.\n\n451.\n\nThe decision on costs in the majority Award aggravates that effect by allowing a foreign investor controlling a company on which a sanction was imposed for failing to comply with its obligations as Licensee on the prevention of money laundering to obtain a declaration of unlawfulness of the relevant sanction and compensation for the adverse effects of the sanction on the investment made by such investor, by resorting to an ICSID arbitration, bearing no arbitration costs whatsoever, i.e., free of charge.\n\n452.\n\nThe message sent by this majority Award to those foreign investors cannot be more disrupting: (i) do not worry about the privatized company in which you have invested repeatedly violating its legal and/or contractual obligations as licensee or concessionaire; (ii) an international investment tribunal will compensate you generously for the adverse effects that the sanctions imposed on the company on account of its breaches may have on your investment; (iii) moreover, it will do so regardless of the provisions of the BIT on the law applicable to the settlement of disputes between investors and host States; (iv) nor will it take into account the fact that you controlled, managed, ran and administered the company when it violated the rules giving rise to the sanction; and (v) or the fact that, under international investment law, the business risk is to be borne by the investor/businessperson.\n\n**PART VII: THE REFERENCES OF THE MAJORITY AWARD TO THE PRESENT DISSENTING OPINION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nThe majority Award refers in some of its footnotes to specific issues addressed in this Dissenting Opinion. Fourteen of those footnotes refer to issues relating to liability for indirect expropriation, one to liability for direct expropriation, five to compensation, and one to arbitration costs. The majority of those references are accompanied by comments or innuendo that I reject in their entirety for being all of them contrary to the \"applicable law\" to the present dispute defined in Article 8(6) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, as has already been set out in detail, in each relevant context, throughout the present Opinion. Therefore, I do not consider it necessary to add anything to what has already been said in response to the comments or innuendo of the majority in the referred footnotes."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**L****ist of abbreviations**\n-----------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ARS** | Argentine Peso |\n| **Bianchi IV** | Fourth Expert Report of Alberto B.

(\"**ENJASA**\") for the operation of gaming facilities and lottery activities in the Argentine Province of Salta. ENJASA had been established by the Government of the Province of Salta as part of the process of privatizing the Province\u2019s gaming and lottery sector and developing tourism in the region. Following a public tender and various changes in the ownership structure, ENJASA became majority owned and controlled by Claimants, Casinos Austria International GmbH (\"**CAI**\"), a limited liability company established under the laws of Austria, and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft (\"**CASAG**\"), a share-company established under the laws of Austria (jointly \"**Casinos**\" or \"**Claimants**\"). Claimants are operators of casinos and games of chance in a number of jurisdictions all over the world. CAI is a subsidiary of CASAG and its international arm of gaming operations.1 Claimants held majority ownership and exercised control of ENJASA through Leisure & Entertainment S.A. (\"**L&E**\"), a stock corporation under Argentine law, in which Claimants were majority shareholders.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 3.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants contend that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, followed by the transfer of its gaming and lottery operations and personnel to a number of new gaming operators, was an arbitrary exercise of power of the Ente Regulador del Juego de Azar (\"**ENREJA**\"), the Province\u2019s regulatory authority for the gaming sector, was politically motivated in order to benefit local gaming operators and to increase the Province\u2019s revenue from gaming, and effectively destroyed Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina. Claimants invoke the violation of their rights as foreign investors under the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"**BIT**\"), which was signed on 7 August 1992 and entered into force on 1 January 1995,2 in particular their right not to be expropriated without compensation, to receive fair and equitable treatment, and to enjoy national treatment. They seek, as a result of this conduct, damages from the Argentine Republic (\"**Argentina**\" or \"**Respondent**\") in an amount exceeding USD 50 million.\n\nExhibit C-002.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent, by contrast, claims that the revocation of ENJASA's license was a legitimate sanction that was provided for by the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta, was imposed by ENREJA in observance of administrative due process, and was motivated by both ENJASA's repeated and prolonged non-compliance with rules to prevent money laundering in the gaming sector and the involvement by ENJASA of other operators of gaming activities in the Province without ENREJA's authorization. ENJASA's conduct, Respondent claims, constituted grave and repeated violations of the regulatory framework in place, which justified the revocation of its exclusive operating license. Respondent therefore rejects any claim for breach of the BIT.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing objections by Respondent to the Centre's jurisdictions and to the Tribunal's competence, the Tribunal determined, in its Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 June 2018, that the Centre had jurisdiction, and the Tribunal competence, under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in connection with the BIT over Claimants' claims for breach of Article 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment) and Article 4(1)-(3) (rules on expropriation) of the BIT, but that it would not entertain claims for breach of Article 3(1) (national treatment) of the BIT. The Tribunal found in particular that Claimants had made, in the form of their indirect participation through L&E in ENJASA, an investment in Argentina in the sense of both the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that the Parties had validly consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre under the BIT. By the present Award, the Tribunal decides on Claimants' claims on the merits, as far as the Tribunal has found them to be under its competence.\n\n**II.** **P****rocedural history**\n----------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 4 December 2014, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") received a request for arbitration from Casinos Austria International GmbH and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft against the Argentine Republic (the \"Request\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nBy correspondence of 3 December 2014, 29 December 2014, 13 January 2015, and 15 January 2015, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be comprised of three arbitrators; one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 13 January 2015, Claimants appointed Prof. Dr. Stephan Schill, a national of Germany, as an arbitrator in this case. Prof. Schill accepted his appointment on 26 January 2015.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 13 February 2015, Respondent appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, a national of Spain, as arbitrator in this case. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez accepted his appointment on 23 February 2015.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, Claimants informed the Secretary-General that the Parties had reached an agreement to appoint Prof. Dr. Hans van Houtte, a national of Belgium, as President of the Tribunal. Respondent confirmed the agreement on the same date. Prof. van Houtte accepted his appointment on 3 April 2015.\n\n11.\n\nOn 6 April 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Giuliana Cane, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Following Ms. Cane\u2019s departure from the Centre, on 15 January 2016, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the Secretary-General appointed Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 13(1) and 20(1), the Tribunal held a first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties on 5 June 2015 by teleconference.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 23 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreements of the Parties and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the schedule of the proceedings included as Annex A to that order.\n\n14.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n15.\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on document production.\n\n16.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, Respondent submitted her Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits. It included a request to treat the objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and/or the competence of the Tribunal as a preliminary matter.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 April 2016, Claimants presented observations in opposition to Respondent's request to bifurcate the proceeding.\n\n18.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' observations, on 25 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ruling that Respondent's objections would be heard as a preliminary question.\n\n19.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n20.\n\nOn 11 October 2016, Respondent filed her Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nOn 23 December 2016, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n23.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held in Paris, France, from 23 to 25 March 2017.\n\n24.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, the Parties submitted simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on jurisdiction.\n\n25.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction. The operative part of the Decision provides as follows:\n\n341. On the basis of the reasoning above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1) that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute insofar as Claimants' claims for breach of Articles 2(1) and 4(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Austria BIT are concerned;\n\n2) that it has no jurisdiction over the present dispute insofar as claims for breach of Article3(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT are concerned;\n\n3) that both Parties will within two months as from the issuance of this Decision take all required measures to withdraw the domestic proceedings relating to the present dispute and inform the Tribunal of their actions;\n\n4) that a decision on costs is reserved for subsequent determination.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction forms part of the Award and is attached hereto. A more detailed procedural history of the jurisdictional phase can be found in the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal's order in its Decision on Jurisdiction to take all required measures to withdraw the domestic proceedings relating to the present dispute, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had filed their respective withdrawals.\n\n28.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Parties, an amended procedural calendar, including the hearing weeks, was approved by the Tribunal on 30 October 2018.\n\n29.\n\nIn accordance with the amended procedural calendar, Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits on 3 December 2018.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing a newly amended procedural calendar, on 27 May 2019, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n31.\n\nOn 9 July 2019, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to submit a timetable for the notification of the witnesses and experts to be examined at the hearing, the Parties' agreements on the organization of the hearing, the last opportunity to request leave to submit new documents for the purpose of direct or cross-examination, the submission of skeleton arguments and of a joint electronic hearing bundle, and the pre-hearing conference call.\n\n32.\n\nOn 11 July 2019, the Parties notified the Tribunal of their agreed schedule regarding the steps prior to the hearing, and on 19 July 2019, the Parties submitted their respective lists of witnesses and experts called to testify at the hearing.\n\n33.\n\nOn 5 August 2019, unable to reach an agreement regarding the agenda for the hearing on the merits, each Party sent their respective proposals.\n\n34.\n\nOn 12 August 2019, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of new documents.\n\n35.\n\nOn 13 August 2019, the President held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference. The following persons participated in the call:\n\nTribunal:\n\nProf. Dr. Hans van Houtte President\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nOn behalf of Claimants:\n\nMr. Florian Haugeneder Knoetzl Haugeneder Netal Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH  \nMr. Emmanuel Kaufman Knoetzl Haugeneder Netal Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH  \nMrs. Selma Tiric Knoetzl Haugeneder Netal Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH  \nMr. Nicol\u00e1s Caffo Knoetzl Haugeneder Netal Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH\n\nOn behalf of Respondent:\n\nMs. Mar\u00eda Teresa Gianelli Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n  \nMs. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n  \nMs. Valeria Etchegorry Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n  \nMs. Soledad Romero Caporale Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n  \nMr. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Ryb Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\n36.\n\nOn 16 August 2019, the Parties respectively filed their observations on the other Party's request to admit new documents.\n\n37.\n\nOn 23 August 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 outlining the organization of the hearing on the merits, including a request for the Parties to indicate the reasons why Mr. Petersen (for Claimants) and Messrs. Marteau and Mata (for Respondent) would not be available to attend the hearing or otherwise provide oral testimony, and a request for Claimants to submit a document indicating the amounts of the fines paid compared to the results of each operational unit. The Tribunal also took note of the Parties' agreement not to submit skeleton arguments.\n\n38.\n\nBy email of 27 August 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision regarding the admissibility of new documents.\n\n39.\n\nOn 27 August 2019, each Party informed the Tribunal of the reasons why Mr. Petersen (for Claimants) and Messrs. Marteau and Mata (for Respondent) would not be able to attend the hearing. On the same date, the Parties also submitted their joint schedule for the hearing and estimated witness and expert examination time.\n\n40.\n\nOn 28 August 2019, as requested in Procedural Order No. 5, Claimants submitted a table indicating the amounts of the fines imposed on ENJASA compared to the results of ENJASA's operational units.\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 August 2019, Claimants requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision of 27 August 2019 to reject the evidence relating to Mr. Benvenuto's written statement. Respondent submitted a reply to Claimants\u2019 letter on the same date. The Tribunal addressed this request during the hearing on the merits.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal held a hearing on the merits from 2 to 13 September 2019 in Paris.

Respondent argued that Exhibit C-299 included new calculations and should therefore not be admitted at such a late stage in the proceeding. In the event that it was admitted, Respondent requested the opportunity to make substantial observations, including new calculations by Professor Dapena, after the filing of the Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n47.\n\nOn 20 January 2020, Claimants submitted a response to Respondent's observations of 10 January 2020. According to Claimants, there were no new calculations in the new version of C-299, and no new data or new assumptions in the additional worksheet. Therefore, they submit, there was no basis for the argument that a substantive review would be required in the event of their admission into the record.\n\n48.\n\nOn 22 January 2020, Respondent requested the opportunity to respond to Claimants' letter of 20 January 2020. The Tribunal granted Respondent's request for leave to respond by 30 January 2020, and reassured the Parties that, should Claimants be allowed to submit an updated version of Exhibit C-299 and the corresponding control sheet, as requested on 27 December 2019, the Parties would be afforded a procedural opportunity to submit comments on the newly admitted materials after the Post-Hearing Briefs. Since the Parties submitted their comments on the new materials *de bene esse,* there was no need for the Tribunal to afford a further opportunity to submit comments once the new materials (and the comments) were admitted into the record (see *infra* para. 55).\n\n49.\n\nThe Parties filed their Post-Hearing Briefs on 24 January 2020.\n\n50.\n\nOn 30 January 2020, Respondent submitted its response to Claimants\u2019 communication of 20 January 2020. Respondent indicated that it followed from the preliminary review conducted by Professor Dapena that the new spreadsheet was not a mere updated version of Exhibit C-299. Additionally, Respondent noted that in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants had included the title \"1.9. Update of Exhibit C-299\", and cited materials not included in the record. Respondent reiterated its objection to the late presentation of a new spreadsheet as well as its request for a substantive review in the event of its admission into the record. Respondent further requested the exclusion from Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief of section IV.1.9 and paragraph 484 together with its footnotes 604 and 605 because section IV.1.9 referred to the new spreadsheet on which admissibility the Tribunal had not yet ruled, and because paragraph 484 and footnotes 604 and 605 referred to pages of a document that were not on the record. On 31 January 2020, Claimants requested an opportunity to respond, by 4 February 2020, to Respondent\u2019s observations. The Tribunal granted Claimants\u2019 request, and on 4 February 2020, Claimants filed a letter in response to Respondent\u2019s letter of 30 January 2020. Claimants requested that the Tribunal authorize the submission of \"the updated version of C-299\" and reject the request relating to the deletion of paragraph 484 of its Post-Hearing Brief. According to Claimants, \"the wording of paragraph 484 represents Mr. Rosen\u2019s explanations in his reports as well as during the Hearing of the Merits. As a result, there is no basis to delete the full paragraph.\" Claimants acknowledged that there was a clerical mistake in footnotes 604 and 605 in that they contained references to CL-036 that had been \"inadvertently not deleted\" and were not part of the record. Claimants stated that they would submit a corrected version of the footnotes.\n\n51.\n\nBy email of 17 March 2020, the Tribunal notified its decision to the Parties, as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal refers to (i) the Claimants\u2019 communications of December 27, 2019, January 20 and February 4, 2020, and to (ii) the Respondent\u2019s communications of January 10 and 29, 2020.\n\nIn their communications, the Claimants request that they be allowed to submit *\"an updated version of Exhibit C-299 with one additional worksheet, i.e. the \"Control Sheet\",* and indicate that they would have no objection to the Respondent producing a similar worksheet. According to the Claimants, the Control Sheet would allow the Tribunal \"*to calculate the impact on Mr Howard Rosen's DCF Model when selecting different approaches to specific parameters of the calculation.\"* The Claimants contend that that there are no new calculations in the new version of C-299, and no new data, assumptions, calculations or valuation model in the Control Sheet, which only function is *\"to allow the Tribunal to toggle between the different views of the experts on specific parameters discussed by them.\"* The Claimants further contend that all the parameters considered have already been discussed among the experts. As a consequence, should the Control Sheet be admitted, \"*the Argentine Republic should not use such opportunity to re-open the discussion about Mr Rosen's expert reports\"*. Finally, the Claimants request that the Respondent's application to exclude certain portions of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief be rejected.\n\nIn its communications, the Respondent contends that the President's questions at the hearing do not enable the Claimants to submit a new spreadsheet at this stage of the proceeding, that the Control Sheet is not merely an updated version of C-299 given that it includes new calculations not previously submitted and that, should the new spreadsheet be admitted into the record, the Respondent should be given the opportunity to make substantial observations - including Professor Dapena's own calculations. The Respondent further requests the exclusion of section IV.1.9, as well as paragraph 484 together with its footnotes 604 and 605, from the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, should it become relevant to its decision on the merits, it could be useful to be able to consult a document that enables it to choose between the different opinions of the damages experts on the various parameters discussed. In the absence of a joint document of the Parties, the Tribunal would admit separate documents - or one document supplemented by both Parties' comments thereon. In order to make this decision:\n\n1. On March 24, 2020, the Claimants shall submit the updated version of Exhibit C-299 as well as the Control Sheet (\"CCS\").\n\n2. On April 21, 2020, the Respondent shall submit its responsive document on CCS as well as, if so wish, its own version of a control sheet (\"RCS\").\n\n3. On May 5, 2020, the Claimants shall submit a reply to the Respondent's comments on the CCS as well as any comments on admissibility they may have on the RCS, if submitted.\n\n4. On May 19, 2020, the Respondent shall provide a reply to the Claimants' comments on the RCS.\n\nAll the above submissions shall be considered to have been filed *de bene esse*. For the time being, the Tribunal confirms that these documents are not admitted into the record. The Tribunal reserves in full its powers to decide upon their admission or non-admission following consideration of the Parties' complete briefing on this issue.\n\nRegarding the portions of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief which exclusion has been requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal understands that the admissibility of section IV.1.9 will follow the admissibility of the updated version of Exhibit C-299 and of the Control Sheet. Regarding paragraph 484 and footnotes 604-605, the Tribunal is satisfied with the Claimants\u2019 explanations and requests that the referred paragraph be corrected. The Tribunal requests that the Claimants submit the amended pages of the Post-Hearing Brief in both languages, without changing the paragraph numbers of the non-amended paragraphs, once the Tribunal has decided on the admissibility of the updated version of Exhibit C-299 and of the Control Sheet. Should the Respondent maintain an objection to paragraph 484 and footnotes 604-605, it shall indicate so within seven days from receipt of the amended pages of the Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n52.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Claimants filed an updated version of Exhibit C-299, including the control sheet.\n\n53.\n\nOn 21 April 2020, Respondent submitted its responsive document on Claimants\u2019 control sheet as well as its own version of a control sheet.\n\n54.\n\nOn 1 May 2020, Respondent submitted a request for an extension to file the last round of comments on Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s control sheets. Claimants submitted a response on 4 May 2020. On the same day, the Tribunal decided to grant a short extension for the Parties to file their respective presentations. Claimants\u2019 deadline was extended from 5 May to 12 May 2020, and Respondent\u2019s deadline was extended from 19 May to 29 May 2020. Both Parties complied and filed their respective submissions in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions.\n\n55.\n\nOn 30 July 2020, the Tribunal notified its decision to the Parties, as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its communication of March 17, 2020 requesting that the Parties make the following submissions *de bene esse*, which the Parties did on March 24, April 21, May 12 and May 29, 2020, respectively:\n\n1. The Claimants were requested to submit the updated version of Exhibit C-299 as well as the Control Sheet (\"CCS\").\n\n2. The Respondent was requested to submit its responsive document on CCS as well as, if so wished, its own version of a control sheet (\"RCS\").\n\n3. The Claimants were requested to submit a reply to the Respondent\u2019s comments on the CCS as well as any comments on admissibility they might have on the RCS, if submitted.\n\n4. The Respondent was requested to submit a reply to the Claimants\u2019 comments on the RCS.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided to accept these submissions into the record. As a consequence, the Tribunal also confirms the admissibility of section IV.1.9 of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief. The Tribunal clarifies that its decision on admissibility is without prejudice to the Tribunal's decision on the probative value of any of these documents.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal reminds the Claimants of its decision regarding paragraph 484 and footnotes 604-605 of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, and requests that the Claimants submit the amended pages of the Post-Hearing Brief in both languages, without changing the paragraph numbers of the non-amended paragraphs, by Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Should the Respondent maintain an objection to paragraph 484 and footnotes 604-605, it shall indicate so within seven days from receipt of the amended pages of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n56.\n\nClaimants wrote to the Tribunal on 4 August 2020 indicating they had already submitted an amended version of their Post-Hearing Brief containing the requested corrections to paragraph 484 and footnotes 604-605 on 20 February 2020, and noted that Respondent had not objected to the submission of these amendments.\n\n57.\n\nOn 11 August 2020, Respondent submitted a word document with corrections to paragraph 484 and footnotes 604 and 605 of Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief. The Tribunal notes that these corrections reflected, apart from minor, but immaterial differences, the corrections Claimants had submitted on 4 August 2020.\n\n58.\n\nOn 30 June 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal regarding the contents of their respective costs statements, which the Parties did on 7 July 2021.\n\n59.\n\nThe Parties submitted their respective costs' statements on 30 July 2021. Following the Tribunal's invitation, on 17 August 2021, Respondent filed comments on Claimants' costs statement, and Claimants filed comments on Respondent's comments on 24 August 2021. On the same day, and also pursuant to the Tribunal's invitation, Respondent filed a clarification of its communication of 17 August 2021.\n\n60.\n\nThe proceeding was declared closed on 5 October 2021.\n\n**III.** **R****equests for** **R****elief**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*Claimants' Requests for Relief*\n--------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal render an award, stating that:\n\n1. The Argentine Republic has breached Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating Claimants' investment.\n\n2. The Argentine Republic has breached Article 4(3) of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the license and the gaming operations of Claimants\u2019 subsidiary ENJASA.\n\n3. The Argentine Republic has breached Article 2(1) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment.\n\n4. The Argentine Republic is liable to pay damages for the breach of the Articles 2(1), 4(1), 4(2) and 4(3) of the BIT.\n\n5. The Argentine Republic shall pay not less than USD 51,919,998 to Claimants.\n\n6. The Argentine Republic is ordered to pay to the Claimants interest at a rate of 6% compounded annually from 13 August 2013 until full payment.\n\n7. The Argentine Republic shall pay to Claimants all costs, expenses and fees (including internal costs) relating to this arbitration and appropriate interest thereon.3\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 584.\n\n*Respondent's Requests for Relief*\n----------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to\n\n(a) reject each and every one of the claims put forward by Claimants;\n\n(b) order Claimants to pay for all costs and expenses arising from these arbitration proceedings, and\n\n(c) grant the Argentine Republic such further relief as the Tribunal may deem fit.4\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 358.\n\n**IV.** **F****actual** **B****ackground of the** **D****ispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nMost of the facts underlying the present dispute are uncontested between the Parties. This is due not least to the fact that gaming in the Province of Salta is a highly regulated and formalized sector of the economy, with the different administrative proceedings affecting ENJASA being documented in detail, as the large record submitted in the proceedings attests. What the Parties differ on are certain undocumented facts, which principally concern the motive for ENREJA revoking ENJASA\u2019s license, and their legal assessment of the revocation. The present section provides a summary of those largely uncontested facts.\n\n**A. The Privatization of the Gaming Sector in the Province of Salta**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn accordance with Articles 75 and 99 of the National Constitution of Argentina, the regulation of games of chance falls outside the scope of competence of the Federal Government. Such regulation is thus the competence of the respective Provinces.5\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\n65.\n\nSince the 1970s, gaming facilities and lottery activities in the Province of Salta, which is located in the Northwestern part of Argentina, were operated directly by, or under the control of, Banco de Pr\u00e9stamos y Asistencia Social (\"**BPAS**\"), an autonomous entity fully owned by the Province of Salta.6 When it was in charge of the gaming sector in Salta, BPAS had issued a number of licenses for the operation of slot machine halls to individuals and companies.7\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 10-14; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 134-135.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras 84-86; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 135.\n\n66.\n\nIn December 1995, the Province of Salta passed the \"Principles for the Restructuring of BPAS\" as part of its Law No. 6836. This Law foresaw the restructuring of BPAS, including the possible privatization of BPAS\u2019 gaming and lottery operations, which was necessary to attract substantial private investments.8\n\nExhibit C-045.\n\n67.\n\nOn 7 September 1998, the Executive of the Province of Salta passed Decree No. 2126/98. It addressed the necessity of constant investments for the continuous development of the gaming sector and also created ENJASA, a company with limited liability under Argentine law in order to manage, commercialize, and exploit games of chance in the Province of Salta.9 ENJASA was to have a duration of 30 years.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 19-24; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 137-139.\n\n68.\n\nLaw No. 7020 of the Province of Salta, which entered into force on 30 December 1998, provides the principal regulatory framework for the gaming and lottery sector in the Province.10 The Law created ENREJA as the regulatory agency to oversee the gaming and lottery sector within the Province (Art. 31). ENREJA was to issue operating rules and oversee compliance with the applicable laws and regulations (Arts. 3, 32, and 33). The regulatory framework, inter alia, prohibited the hiring of operators without the authorization of ENREJA and required the appointment in each gaming facility of a person responsible for overseeing and implementing anti-money laundering measures (Art. 5). ENREJA also disposed of disciplinary and sanctioning powers, which included the issuance of warnings, the imposition of fines, disqualification, and the suspension and revocation of operating licenses (Art. 13).11 Operating licenses, however, were not issued by ENREJA, but by the Government of the Province of Salta (Art. 4).\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 25-27; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 140-147. For the text of Law No 7020, see Exhibit C-048.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, whether Article 13 of Law No. 7020 continued to stay in force when Law No. 7020 was amended in May 2001. For details, see *infra* paras. 176-177, 254-255.\n\n69.\n\nOn 1 September 1999, the Executive of the Province of Salta conferred an exclusive license to ENJASA for the operation of games of chance by Decree No. 3616/99.12 The terms of this License, which was granted for a term of 30 years, provided that any breach of the conditions of the License, of Law No. 7020, and of any regulation issued by ENREJA were to be sanctioned pursuant to Law No. 7020 (see Art. 5.1 of the License). The License furthermore specified that it would be extinct or forfeited, inter alia, in case of non-payment of the license fee, non-compliance with the obligations imposed under Article 5 of Law No. 7020, exploitation of any games of chance without prior authorization by ENREJA, (full or partial) cession or transfer of the operations covered by the License without prior authorization of the Executive, and bankruptcy of the licensee (Art. 6). The impact the grant of an exclusive operating license to ENJASA had on licenses issued previously by BPAS to slot machines operators is a matter of controversy between the Parties.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 28-30; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 148-157. For the text of Decree No. 3616/99 containing the License, see Exhibit C-049.\n\n70.\n\nEqually on 1 September 1999, the Ministry of Production and Employment of the Province of Salta approved the Call for a National and International Public Tender to offer 90% of ENJASA\u2019s shares (the so-called \"Class A-shares\") for sale.13 Participants in the tender needed to have at least ten years of experience in the operation of casinos and games of chance. Moreover, they had to submit an investment plan that included the number of employees to be hired, a tourism development program, and the amount of investments to be made, and stipulate a yearly license fee to be paid to the Province for the term of the License. The remaining 10% of ENJASA\u2019s shares (the so-called \"Class B-shares\") continued to be held by the Province of Salta under a joint ownership participation program for former BPAS employees.\n\nResolution No. 411/99; Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 31-34; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 158-162.\n\n71.\n\nThe only participant in the public tender was the Uni\u00f3n Transitoria de Empresas (\"**UTE\"**), a joint venture under Argentine law, consisting of Casinos Austria International Holding GmbH (\"**CAIH**\") (5%), Boldt S.A. (\"**Boldt**\") (5%) and Iberlux International S.A. (\"**Iberlux**\") (90%). The UTE\u2019s bid included the offer to pay an annual license fee for the 30-year period (consisting initially of payments of USD 2,200,000 for the first three years and USD 3,500,000 for the following 27 years) and a commitment to invest USD 20,770,000 into tourism development in the Province of Salta, namely into the construction of a five-star hotel and the establishment of hoteling and gastronomy schools as well as of a fund for the promotion of tourism and culture. Following a request by the Ministry of Production and Employment of the Province, the bid was revised, resulting in an offer with higher annual payments for the License of USD 2,500,000 per year for the first three years, and USD 4,100,000 per year for the following 27 years.14\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 35-38; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 163-167.\n\n72.\n\nOn 31 January 2000, the tender was awarded to the UTE by Resolution No. 20/00. On 15 February 2000, by Decree No. 419/00, the Executive of the Province of Salta15 approved the Transfer Agreement which transferred the tendered shares in ENJASA to the UTE. The Transfer Agreement also extended the sanctions of Law No. 7020 to the buyer\u2019s breaches of the Transfer Agreement, the bid, or any other documentation that formed part of the tender.16\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 40; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 169-175.\n\nTransfer Agreement, Art. 7.1.2 (Exhibit ARA-11).\n\n**B. Development of Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe UTE shortly thereafter requested ENREJA to authorize the transfer of its shares in ENJASA to L&E, a stock corporation under Argentine law, which was formed by the members of the UTE in accordance with their respective participation in the UTE (i.e., CAIH with 5%, Boldt with 5%, and Iberlux with 90%). ENREJA authorized this transfer, and consequently L&E was registered as the owner of the Class A-shares of ENJASA in the company register.17\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 50; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 176.\n\n74.\n\nThe ownership structure of the shareholding in L&E changed over the course of the years.18 In 2001, Iberlux purchased the shares in L&E held by Boldt, thus increasing its participation to 95%. In February 2007, CAIH, which initially held 5% of the shares in L&E, increased its participation to 60% as a result of purchasing 55% of L&E shares from Iberlux. On 26 March 2010, pursuant to an internal structuring, CAIH transferred its (then) 60% of L&E shares to CAI.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 50-56.\n\n75.\n\nAlso the shareholdership in respect of ENJASA changed over the years. On 19 October 2009, most of the beneficiaries of the joint ownership participation program authorized the Government of Salta to sell their parts in the Class B-shares in ENJASA. On 4 November 2009, L&E purchased almost all of these shares in ENJASA with the exception of a minor participation that remained with the Province of Salta because some of the former employees of BPAS had not agreed to the sale of their shares in ENJASA to L&E.19\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 57-62; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 177. Of the aggregate shares of ENJASA, 90.56% were Class A-shares, which all were acquired by L&E. 9.44% of the aggregate shares were Class B-shares, of which L&E acquired 98,80%. In their submissions and expert reports, the Parties made abstraction of the 0.12% of ENJASA's shares that L&E did not own and assumed a 100% shareholding of L&E in ENJASA. Following the Parties' position, the Tribunal likewise makes the same assumption.\n\n76.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Complejo Monumento G\u00fcemes S.A. (\"**CMG**\"), a stock corporation under Argentine law, which was jointly owned by L&E (94.79%) and ENJASA (5.21%), received a minor participation in ENJASA in exchange for transferring to ENJASA the good will *('fondo de commercio')* in the five-star hotel in the City of Salta that had been built by CMG in fulfilment of the UTE\u2019s investment obligations under the Transfer Agreement.20\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 60, footnote 85; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\n77.\n\nMoreover, L&E established Cachi Valle Aventuras S.A. (\"**Cachi Valle**\"), a stock corporation under Argentine law, in order to develop and administer real estate projects and to promote tourism in Salta. L&E held 99% of the shares of Cachi Valle, while ENJASA held the remaining 1% of the shares.21 Cachi Valle was the owner of the building in which the five-star hotel, as well as one casino, Casino Salta, were located.22 Cachi Valle made those premises available for the operation of Casino Salta under a joint venture agreement in which ENJASA had a 70% and Cachi Valle a 30% participation.23\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 12-13.\n\nRosen I, footnote 122.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 101-103.\n\n78.\n\nAs a result of the above transactions, and taking into account a capital increase that had taken place in the meantime, the ownership structure in ENJASA therefore looked as follows as of 13 August 2013, when ENJASA's operating license for games of chance was revoked:24\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13 (reproducing a graph from Rosen I, p. 16 (Exhibit C-26)).\n\n79.\n\nThe shareholder structure underwent further changes after August 2013. On 15 November 2013, CAI purchased the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E from Iberlux and became the 100% shareholder of L&E. It then transferred 2% of the shares in L&E to CAIH, whose sole shareholder is CASAG. Thus, at present, CAI directly holds 98% of L&E. CASAG in turn indirectly holds 2% of L&E through its participation in CAIH and the remaining 98% through its participation in CAI. Consequently, CASAG indirectly controls 100% of L&E. Through L&E, CAI and CASAG in turn indirectly hold 99.94% of ENJASA's shares. The resulting ownership structure in ENJASA looks as follows:25\n\nExhibit C-017.\n\n80.\n\nThe above group of companies further developed the gaming, lottery, and tourism sector in the Province of Salta. In August 2013, when its operating license was revoked, ENJASA had become one of the most significant employers in the Province. It operated four casinos, 15 slot machine halls, 14 lottery games, 1,376 slot machines, and 46 live games tables; it employed around 750 employees and had a network of 700 lottery agencies and 11 local lottery branches.26\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58.\n\n81.\n\nENJASA had also invested more than USD 20,000,000 into the construction of the Sheraton Hotel Salta, the first five-star hotel in the region, which opened in August 2005.27 The construction of the hotel was part of the investment program that was promised as part of the privatization process. In addition, ENJASA sponsored two schools, one for hotel trade and one for gastronomy, and created the \"ENJASA Foundation\" for the promotion and research of cultural, tourist, hotel and gourmet activities in the Province of Salta, in fulfilment of the promises made in the course of the privatization of ENJASA.28 Respondent agrees that all obligations to invest in tourism undertaken under the Transfer Agreement by the UTE have been fulfilled.29\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 124-125.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 121-133.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 182.\n\n**C. Development of Regulatory Framework and License Fee in the Province of Salta**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe regulatory framework under which ENJASA operated games of chance in the Province of Salta consisted of a combination of different legal instruments. These included the License itself, which had been granted to ENJASA by the Province of Salta, the statutory framework established under Law No. 7020, and regulations to implement that Law, which were passed by ENREJA.\n\n83.\n\nENJASA's exclusive license provided, in its Article 5, that any breach of Law No. 7020 or of regulations issued by ENREJA were to be sanctioned with the penalties and sentencing provided for in Law No. 7020. The License also provided that the determination of any penalty was subject to\n\nthe gravity of the offense, the damage caused upon the legal certainty, the morality and good customs, the consequences suffered by the Provincial Government and/or individuals, the social upheaval caused and the infringer's records of relapses.30\n\nExhibit C-049.\n\n84.\n\nLaw No. 7020, inter alia, contained a prohibition for license holders for games of chance to engage \"operators\" without ENREJA's authorization and imposed duties in respect of anti-money laundering (Art. 5). It further laid down the extent of ENREJA's sanctioning powers (Arts. 13 and 41) and contained provisions on the determination of sanctions (Arts. 42, 43, 45, 48), as well as a statute of limitations (Art. 49). The relevant provisions of Law No. 7020 are as follows:\n\n**Article 5**\n\nThe licensee's business shall be subject to this law. The licensee shall be responsible for the selection and employment of the methods for the exploitation and maintenance to secure compliance with the provisions set forth hereunder, and in no event it shall be authorized to engage operators without the authorization by [ENREJA], which shall establish the requirements and conditions to be complied with by each operator.\n\nThe licensee shall appoint an individual who shall be in charge of the anti-money laundering tasks and who shall be responsible for:\n\na) Centralizing all the information concerning customers, transactions known, suspected or having reasons to suspect.\n\nb) Reporting any transaction where the individual\u2019s transaction has no reasonable relationship with the development of business activities likely to be declared.\n\nc) Identifying through the Identity Document or Passport all those customers to which a check is drawn or a transfer is made to offshore accounts for amounts in excess of ten thousand pesos ($10,000.00).\n\n**Article 13**\n\nThe violations or breaches to this law, its regulations, to the license agreement and to all the regulations enacted by [ENREJA], shall be punished by [ENREJA] with:\n\na) Warning\n\nb) Fine\n\nc) Inability to operate\n\nd) Suspension of the License\n\ne) License Revocation.\n\nThe penalties above shall be applied taking into consideration due proportionality between the penalties and the violation, notwithstanding the criminal liability and misdemeanor liability.31\n\n**Article 40**\n\nIndividuals and/or legal persons that with or without authorization, for profit or not carry out [games of chance] in violation of one or more rules hereof, its regulatory decree and [ENREJA\u2019s] resolutions, shall be liable to administrative penalties, without prejudice to the misdemeanor and criminal penalties and the civil liability that may be applicable.\n\n**Article 41**\n\n[ENREJA] may impose jointly or indistinctly the penalties of fine, inability to operate and closure.\n\n**Article 42**\n\nThe fine shall consist in payment of a sum of money from one hundred pesos ($ 100) to one hundred thousand pesos ($ 100,000).\n\n**Article 43**\n\nThe inability to operate games of chance by an individual or legal person may not exceed the term of one year.\n\n**Article 45**\n\nWhenever the violation is committed by reason of the exploitation of an agency, premises or business location, closure thereof may be ordered which may not exceed thirty (30) days.\n\nTemporary closure may be ordered for a maximum term of ten (10) days extendable by another term, whenever it is deemed advisable by reason of the gravity of the factual events.\n\n**Article 48**\n\nFor purposes of the graduation of the penalties, [ENREJA] shall bear in mind the gravity of the offense, the damage caused upon the legal certainty, the morality and good customs, the consequences suffered by the Provincial Government and/or individuals, the social upheaval caused and the infringer's records of relapses.\n\n**Article 49**\n\nStatutes of limitation applicable to the actions and penalties shall be of one year. Actions shall be barred by the statutes of limitation as from the date of the event and penalties as from execution of the resolution that imposes such penalty. Statutes of limitation shall be interrupted with the commencement of the summary investigation proceeding or the reiteration of the violation, and the amounts of penalties shall be cumulative.32\n\nIn addition to the sanctions laid down in Article 13 of Law No. 7020, non-compliance with the obligations under Article 5 of the Law No. 7020 could lead to extinction and forfeiture of the License under the terms of the License. See License, Articles 5.1 and 6 (Exhibit C-049). However, such \"extinction\" and \"forfeiture\" could only be decided by the Executive, not by ENREJA. See Resolution No. 240/13, p. 33 (Exhibit C-031).\n\nExhibit C-048.\n\n85.\n\nArticles 40-49 reproduced above were not yet part of Law No. 7020 when it was adopted in 1998. These provisions were introduced by Law No. 7133 of 9 May 2001 as amendments to Law No. 7020.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition to Law No. 7020, ENJASA's gaming activities were governed by administrative regulations enacted by ENREJA in the form of resolutions. Of particular importance for the present proceeding was ENREJA's Resolution No. 26/00, which was published in Salta's Official Bulletin on 8 June 2000.33 It provided for details in respect of the rules on anti-money laundering laid down in Article 5 of Law No. 7020. Resolution No. 26/00 required that operators of games of chance had to keep a so-called \"Anti-Money Laundering Book\" (Art. 1), which had to be made available to ENREJA for inspection (Art. 2), and in which information on relevant transactions had to be recorded, including in particular the identity of involved players (Art. 3). Relevant transactions included payments made by check or money transfer exceeding the amount of Argentine Pesos (ARS) 10,000, as laid down in Art. 5 c) of Law 7020 (Art. 3), as well as any other suspicious payment or transfer independently of the amount in question and the means of payment (Art. 6).\n\nExhibit C-180.\n\n87.\n\nAs of 1 May 2012, Resolution No. 26/00 was replaced by Resolution No. 90/12.34 This Resolution laid down expressly as an instrument of combatting money laundering that any prize above ARS 10,000 had to be paid by check or wire transfer. Resolution No. 90/12 provides in relevant part:\n\n**Article 1**\n\nWith the purpose of complying with the anti-money rules, set forth in Law No. 7020 as amended, the games of chance licensees and concessionaires shall:\n\n1) Pay through check or wire transfers to accounts in foreign countries all prizes for amounts exceeding ARS 10,000. ...\n\nExhibit C-181.\n\n88.\n\nNot only the regulatory framework, but also the calculation of the operating fee that ENJASA had to pay to ENREJA changed over time.35 Initially, the fee consisted of fixed annual amounts (see *supra* para. 71). This changed, however, when the operating fee was renegotiated as part of a broader effort of the new Governor, Mr. Juan Manuel Urtubey, who took office in December 2007, to renegotiate contracts concluded by the predecessor government of Mr. Juan Carlos Romero in order to maintain the financial benefits derived from those contracts for the Province, considering in particular the inflation and depreciation of the Argentina currency following the pesification of US dollar-denominated debt in the context of the country's economic and financial crisis in 2001/2002.36\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 134, 175-179; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 51-53; Resolution No. 42/09, p.1 (Exhibit ARA-024).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 94-95; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 39.\n\n89.\n\nThus, in 2008, the license fee was renegotiated at the request of the Province of Salta through an agency created specifically for the review and renegotiation of public contracts and licenses, the so-called Unidad de Revisi\u00f3n y Renegociaci\u00f3n de Contratos y Licencias otorgadas por la Administraci\u00f3n (\"**UNIREN**\"). The change in conditions of ENJASA's gaming license was formalized in the so-called \"Acta Acuerdo\", an agreement concluded on 7 May 2008 between ENJASA and UNIREN and ratified by the Government of Salta on 11 August 2008 through Decree No. 3428/08.37 The Acta Acuerdo changed the operating fee from a fixed to a dynamic fee, which was calculated henceforth as a percentage of ENJASA's annual net income and which rose over the years in steps to 15% for lottery games and to 16% for live games and slot machines.38\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 175-186; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 178-184.\n\nMemorandum of Agreement of 7 May 2008 (Exhibit C-131); Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 181.\n\n90.\n\nThe Acta Acuerdo also stated (i) that ENJASA and its controlling shareholder, L&E, had complied with their obligations to increase ENJASA's capital and invest in the tourism sector, (ii) that there had been no breaches of the Transfer Agreement, and (iii) that \"in connection with the joint venture agreements ... entered into by and between EN.J.A.S.A and Video Drome S.A. and Cachi Valle Aventura S.A. ... no breach of the license terms has been incurred by the Licensee.\"39\n\nExhibit C-131\\_ENG. For the Tribunal's majority, the text of the Acta Acuerdo of 7 May 2008, which is incorporated in Decree No. 3428/08 of the Province of Salta, clearly confirm items (ii) and (iii). The Tribunal's majority does not accept, as the dissenting arbitrator does (Dissent, para. 184), that ENREJA, an administrative agency, can undo this confirmation in 2013 by Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13.\n\n91.\n\nFollowing the change in the way the annual fee was calculated, ENREJA introduced a new control system for ENJASA's gaming operations, which required all slot machines to be linked to a real-time online system that could be controlled by ENREJA. To this end, ENREJA introduced certain changes for the operation of slot machines, including in particular new technical requirements that the machines had to fulfil, and required the replacement of slot machines that did not comply with the new regulations.40\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 192-194; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 204-213; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 181-184, 232-235; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 51-71, 104-107.\n\n**D. Investigations and Sanctions Prior to the Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nCompliance of ENJASA with the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta was ensured through the exercise of supervisory powers of ENREJA as laid down in Law No. 7020. To this end, ENREJA regularly made inquiries and conducted investigations into ENJASA's compliance with the regulatory framework in place. In a number of cases, ENREJA also imposed sanctions against ENJASA for breaches of the regulatory framework.\n\n93.\n\nBefore the conclusion of the Acta Acuerdo, ENJASA was sanctioned for breaching the regulatory framework on two occasions. In 2005, ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 20,000 for implementing unauthorized restrictions on bets in a lottery game.41 In 2007, ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 10,000 for operating a slot machine without authorization.42\n\nExhibit C-239; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 258-260; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 126-134; Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 193-196.\n\nExhibit C-240; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 261-264; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 135-139.\n\n94.\n\nIn the years between the conclusion of the Acta Acuerdo and the time when ENJASA\u2019s license was revoked, the number of administrative sanctions increased. Between 2007 and August 2013, ENREJA conducted several administrative inquiries into ENJASA\u2019s compliance with the regulatory framework in place and imposed several sanctions. Sanctions involved the following incidents.\n\n- In Resolution No. 31/08 (dated 10 March 2008), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 5,000 for issuing a check that did not contain the words \"no a la orden\", which makes the check non-transferable, as required by Resolution No. 26/00.43\n\n- In Resolution No. 32/08 (dated 10 March 2008), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 10,000 for the loss of the anti-money laundering book, for irregularities in recording payments, and for issuing transferable instead of non-transferable checks for paying out prizes.44\n\n- In Resolution No. 232/08 (dated 18 November 2008), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 62,000 because the payment of certain prizes of over ARS 10,000 at Casinos Golden Dream had not been made by check.45\n\n- In Resolution No. 244/08 (dated 25 November 2008), ENREJA issued a warning against ENJASA because of the unauthorized removal of gaming devices from Casino Salta and Casino Rosario de la Frontera, and for irregularities in the results of poker tournaments.46\n\n- In Resolution No. 286/09 (dated 16 December 2009), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 15,000 for amending betting limits in Casino Golden Dreams without prior authorization.47\n\n- In Resolution No. 39/10 (dated 9 March 2010), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 100,000 for holding a poker tournament at Casino Golden Dreams without authorization.48\n\n- In Resolution No. 46/10 (dated 16 March 2010), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 20,000 because a payment of over ARS 10,000 had not been made by check.49 This Resolution was confirmed by Resolution No. 106/10 (dated 3 May 2010), which was issued to decide on a recourse for reconsideration that ENJASA had interposed against Resolution No. 46/10.50\n\n- In Resolution No. 104/10 (dated 3 May 2010), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 100,000 for paying a slot machine prize won on 13 December 2009 in Casinos Golden Dream in cash, rather than by check or wire transfer, and without properly recording it. In addition, ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 200,000 for paying a slot machine prize won on 4 January 2010 in Casinos Golden Dream in cash, rather than by check or wire transfer, and without properly recording it. ENREJA also formally warned ENJASA that violations of anti-money laundering rules could lead to an extinction or revocation of ENJASA's license.51\n\n- In Resolutions Nos. 128/10, 129/10, and 130/10 (all dated 18 May 2010), as well as Resolutions Nos. 151/10, 152/10, and 153/10 (all dated 7 June 2010), ENREJA temporarily suspended the operation of certain gaming halls for periods between 7 and 13 days because of irregularities in the operation of slot machines.52\n\n- In Resolution No. 161/10 (dated 15 June 2010), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 172,000 for paying prizes exceeding ARS 10,000 in cash, rather than by check or wire transfer, and for failing to properly record the identities of certain winners of prizes.53\n\n- In Resolution No. 200/10 (dated 27 July 2010), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 200,000 for operating a slot machine hall in the town of Metan without the necessary authorization.54\n\n- In Resolution No. 178/12 (dated 10 July 2012), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 550,000 for irregularities in lottery drawings, which included the use of too many balls for a drawing, an incorrect publication of the winning ticket in another drawing, and other irregularities in further drawings.55\n\n- In Resolution No. 161/13 (dated 28 May 2013), ENREJA fined ENJASA in the amount of ARS 200,000 for modifying prize limits without authorization in poker games at Casino Golden Dreams, and in the amount of ARS 500,000 for operating unauthorized jackpots in poker games at Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta.56\n\nResolution No. 31/08 (Exhibit C-150).\n\nResolution No. 32/08, Exhibit C-151).\n\nResolution No. 232/08 (Exhibit C-155); Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, footnote 238; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, footnote 702; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 121.\n\nExhibit ARA-45; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 281-285; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 178-184.\n\nResolution No. 286/09 (Exhibit C-153).

ENREJA\u2019s Investigations Leading up to the Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nOn 11 December 2012, ENREJA opened three separate investigations into breaches by ENJASA of the regulations governing games of chance in the Province of Salta.57 One investigation principally concerned charges for breach of the anti-money laundering rules in the administration of a lottery game by ENJASA (Resolution No. 380/12);58 one concerned charges for breach of anti-money laundering rules in the operation of one of ENJASA\u2019s casinos (Resolution No. 381/12);59 and one concerned charges for breach of the prohibition to hire operators without ENREJA\u2019s authorization (Resolution No. 384/12).60\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 228-236; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 382-448.\n\nExhibit C-172.\n\nExhibit C-173.\n\nExhibit C-174.\n\n**1. Resolution No. 380/12**\n----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nResolution No. 380/12, which was notified to ENJASA on 11 December 2012, charged ENJASA with the following breaches of Article 5 c) of Law No. 7020 as well as of Resolutions Nos. 26/00 and 90/12:\n\n- Late registration and payment of an expired prize of ARS 11,080 won on 4 December 2011 in the lottery game *\"T\u00f3mbola\";*\n\n- Failure properly to register in the anti-money laundering book the payment of a prize of ARS 12,000 won on 30 January 2012 and of a prize of ARS 15,000 won on 2 March 2012 in the lottery game *\"T\u00f3mbola\";* and\n\n- Failure properly to identify the personal data of the winner of a prize of ARS 11,480 won on a slot machine on 14 May 2012.61\n\nExhibit C-172.\n\n97.\n\nENJASA responded to this investigation on 2 January 2013.62 It challenged ENREJA\u2019s allegations both on factual and legal grounds, and presented explanations to ENREJA for the conduct in question.\n\nENJASA's Answer to Charges of 2 January 2013 (Exhibit C-182).\n\n98.\n\nIn respect of the prize won on 4 December 2011, ENJASA claimed that that prize, contrary to ENREJA\u2019s allegations, had not expired. While the payment of the prize had only been made and registered on 19 January 2012, i.e., more than one month after the prize was won, the winning lottery ticket, ENJASA claimed, had been submitted for payment two days after the lottery draw had taken place and, therefore, within the ten days period foreseen by the rules of the lottery game *\"T\u00f3mbola\"*.63 The delay in payment, ENJASA explained, had been due to a misunderstanding of the owner of the lottery agency, who happened to be the winner of the prize, but who mistakenly believed that the prize was going to be credited to the checking account of the lottery agency. After the winner complained to ENJASA that the amount had not been credited, the required information was submitted to ENJASA\u2019s local branch and sent to ENJASA\u2019s headquarters for registration in the anti-money laundering book. ENJASA therefore was of the view that the prize was paid in accordance with Article 3 of ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 26/00 and registered correctly in the anti-money laundering book after the check had been issued.64\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 245; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 309.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 246-248; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 310-311.\n\n99.\n\nIn respect of the prize won on 30 January 2012, ENJASA submitted that its payment was not formally registered in the anti-money laundering book due to an administrative oversight, although all information required to make the registration had been collected, as ENREJA itself confirmed, in the course of an inspection conducted on 24 April 2012. ENJASA therefore considered that it had taken all necessary steps to fulfil the requirements for registration set up by ENREJA's Resolution No. 26/00.65\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 251-254; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 316-318; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 161-163.\n\n100.\n\nIn respect of the prize won on 2 March 2012, ENJASA submitted that that prize had expired because it had not been submitted for payment within the ten days foreseen by the rules of the lottery game \"*T\u00f3mbola*\". As the prize had expired, no payment occurred. Consequently, no payment had to be registered in the anti-money laundering book. ENJASA further explained that ENREJA's allegation was triggered by a wrong entry in the accounts of ENJASA, which was caused by a bug in the electronic online registration system for lottery prizes and an error of ENJASA's staff, which was manually correcting ENJASA's accounting books. The error was corrected after ENREJA had issued Resolution No. 380/12.66\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 255-262; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 319-323.\n\n101.\n\nIn respect of the payment of the prize of ARS 11,480 won on a slot machine on 14 May 2012, ENJASA submitted that that prize had been duly registered in the anti-money laundering book. ENJASA admitted that the information was incomplete when ENREJA reviewed the book on 16 May 2012. ENJASA submitted, however, that the missing information was completed on 17 May 2012; the check making the payment of the prize, in turn, was only issued after the missing information had been entered in the anti-money laundering book.67 ENJASA therefore submitted that no breach of anti-money laundering rules had occurred.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 263-266; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 324-326; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 167-168; WS I Frade, para. 92 (Exhibit C-019).\n\n**2. Resolution No. 381/12**\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nResolution No. 381/12, which was notified to ENJASA on 11 December 2012, charged ENJASA with the following breaches of Article 5 of the Law No. 7020 as well as of Resolutions Nos. 26/00 and 90/12:\n\n- Making payments between August and September 2011 in Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta in excess of ARS 10,000 in cash rather than by check; and\n\n- Making cash payments in September 2011 to two customers in Casino Salta that had not been registered in the anti-money laundering book and that differed from the amounts reported in the Casino's internal reports.68\n\nExhibit C-173.\n\n103.\n\nENJASA responded to this investigation on 2 January 2013.69 It challenged ENREJA's allegations both on factual and legal grounds, and presented explanations to ENREJA for the conduct in question.\n\nENJASA's Answer to Charges of 2 January 2013 (Exhibit C-183).\n\n104.\n\nIn respect of the cash payments made in Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta, ENJASA submitted that, at the relevant time in August and September 2011, no obligation existed to pay prizes above ARS 10,000 by check or international wire transfer and hence no registration of such payments was necessary in the anti-money laundering book. The requirement to pay amounts above ARS 10,000 by check or international wire transfer, ENJASA noted, was only introduced by Resolution No. 90/12, which entered into force on 1 May 2012, adding that ENREJA was not permitted to apply Resolution No. 90/12 retroactively.70\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 271-272; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 332-334.\n\n105.\n\nMoreover, even if a legal obligation to make payments of prizes by check had existed, ENJASA submitted that ENREJA's actions were time-barred pursuant to the one-year statute of limitations contained in Article 49 of Law No. 7020 because ENREJA had started the administrative inquiry more than one year after the alleged breaches.71 This time-bar, ENJASA submitted, could only be interrupted by the initiation of an administrative inquiry or by the repetition of the breach in question, neither of which had in fact, nor was alleged to have, occurred.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 273-276; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 335.\n\n106.\n\nFinally, ENJASA submitted that there was no factual basis to conclude that the payments made above ARS 10,000 actually concerned prizes won by casino customers. The information on which ENREJA's charges had been based - namely so-called *\"Daily Reports\", \"Rating Card Forms\",* and *\"internal checks\"* - provided no details of the prizes actually won by individual customers. The Daily Reports and the Rating Card Forms, on which ENREJA relied, only provided general estimates of the amounts won on each live game table. Internal checks were obtained against money deposited by customers in the casino's treasury. Although internal checks could be exchanged for chips at the gaming tables, there was not necessarily a correlation between the amount of the internal checks and the chips a client subsequently cashed.72 Moreover, no regulations in the Province of Salta forbade to use internal checks in casinos.73\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 277-282; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 336-337.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 283-286; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 338-339.\n\n107.\n\nIn respect of the cash payments made to two unregistered customers, ENJASA submitted that it was unclear to it what legal rule had supposedly been breached. ENJASA pointed out that it did not have any obligation to pay an amount above ARS 10,000 by check at the time and that it was impossible to determine whether the amounts paid involved money won during live games or money that had been brought into the casino by the customer. As for money that had been shared between the two individuals, ENJASA observed that it was not uncommon for two individuals to pool their money for playing and at the end of the day distribute it again amongst them.74\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 283-286; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 338-339.\n\n**3. Resolution No. 384/12**\n----------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn Resolution No. 384/12, ENREJA charged ENJASA with having breached Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by sub-licensing the operations of several slot machine halls in different locations to third operators without ENREJA's approval.75 The charges involved ENJASA having allowed:\n\n(1) Emsenor S.R.L. (\"**Emsenor**\") to operate a slot machine hall in the city of Salvador Mazza;\n\n(2) Mr. Navarrete to operate two slot machine halls in the cities of Tartagal and Salvador Mazza;\n\n(3) Mr. Colloricchio to operate two slot machine halls in the cities of General G\u00fcemes and Rosario de la Frontera;\n\n(4) Video Drome S.A. (\"**Video Drome**\") to operate slot machines at Casino Golden Dreams in the City of Salta (in a joint venture with ENJASA) and at five rented gaming halls in the cities of San Ram\u00f3n de la Nueva Or\u00e1n, Tartagal, Met\u00e1n, J.V. Gonz\u00e1lez, and Rosario de la Frontera;\n\n(5) Prodec S.A. (\"**Prodec**\") and its predecessor, Dek S.A. (\"**DEK**\"), to participate in the management of, and share profits from, tables for Caribbean poker at Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta; and\n\n(6) New Star S.R.L. (\"**New Star**\") to operate slot machines in the cities of San Ram\u00f3n de la Nueva Or\u00e1n, Met\u00e1n, Rosario de la Frontera, General G\u00fcemes, and Embarcaci\u00f3n.76\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 236; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 253.\n\nExhibit C-174.\n\n109.\n\nResolution No. 384/12 was notified to ENJASA on 7 June 2013.77 ENJASA\u2019s response to the investigation under Resolution No. 384/12 followed on 28 June 20 1 3.78 ENJASA contended that the seven companies and individuals identified in Resolution No. 384/12 were either operators of slot machine halls that had received authorizations to operate by BPAS before ENJASA had been granted its exclusive license for games of chance or were not operators of games of chance at all, but merely providers of slot machines, premises for the operation of games of chance, or other hardware and software for games of chance that ENJASA operated. Specifically, ENJASA submitted the following:\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 242; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 144.\n\nENJASA's Answer to Charges of 28 June 2013 (Exhibit C-184); Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 288-317.\n\n110.\n\nEmsenor was not operating the slot machine hall in Salvador Mazza City; it merely had leased the premises in which the slot machine hall operated to ENJASA; the hall itself, however, was operated solely by ENJASA\u2019s personnel without any involvement of Emsenor. The fact that the monthly rent consisted of a payment of 10% of the income generated by the slot machines did not make Emsenor a partner or operator of the business, but reflected a common practice in lease agreements in Argentina to protect lessors against inflation.79 Moreover, ENREJA had been notified of the lease agreement in 2004 and had approved the conditions. Emsenor\u2019s financial statements and bylaws further confirmed that Emsenor was not a gaming operator.80\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 291-296; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 342, 345-350.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 175-181.\n\n111.\n\nMr. Navarrete had been authorized to operate slot machine halls in Tartagal and Salvador Mazza by BPAS. ENREJA was fully aware that he continued to operate these slot machine halls: ENREJA was provided with a copy of the contract with ENJASA, which required Mr. Navarrete to obtain ENREJA\u2019s approval for new slot machines;81 and ENREJA regularly was informed of the payment of Mr. Navarrete's share in the license fee, and had received the full roster of slot machines he operated.82\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 297-299; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 342, 357-360.\n\nLetter of 21 April 2014, p. 8 (Exhibit ARA-104); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 191-193.\n\n112.\n\nMr. Colloricchio operated two slot machine halls on the basis of permits granted by BPAS to his predecessors from whom he had taken over their businesses on 17 September 2008 and 24 February 2009 respectively. On 19 March and 24 April 2009, ENJASA had duly informed ENREJA of these transfers and had received no objection. ENREJA had also been provided with a copy of the contract between Mr. Colloricchio and ENJASA, regularly had been informed of Mr. Colloricchio's share in the license fee, and also had received the full roster of slot machines operated by Mr. Colloricchio.83\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 300-304; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 342, 351-356. Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 186-190.\n\n113.\n\nVideo Drome was only a provider of slot machines operated by ENJASA outside the City of Salta, but did not operate slot machine halls itself. The five contracts for the lease of slot machines with Video Drome, which had been submitted to ENREJA, stated that the halls were operated by ENJASA's employees and that Video Drome did not participate in the costs of the operation. The rent for the slot machines was between 30 and 35% of the gross income generated by the slot machines, i.e., the difference between the bets and the prizes paid.84\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 305-308; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 342, 361-363.

As regards the slot machine hall in Embarcaci\u00f3n, New Star was merely leasing the premises to an operator who had been previously authorized by BPAS.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 312-314; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 342, 367-369.\n\n**F. Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License and Subsequent Events**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nOn 13 August 2013, ENREJA proceeded to issue and notify ENJASA of Resolution No. 240/13 in which it made a joint determination on the three investigations initiated by Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12.87 In respect of all three investigations, ENREJA concluded that the charges brought against ENJASA were well-founded and that ENJASA hence had violated its obligations under the regulatory framework. Finding that ENJASA had violated anti-money laundering provisions and had breached the obligation not to hire operators without ENREJA's authorization, ENREJA concluded that the appropriate sanction was the revocation of ENJASA's license.\n\nExhibit C-031. See Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 31.\n\n117.\n\nOn 13 August 2013, within 40 minutes after ENREJA had notified ENJASA of the revocation of its license, the President of ENREJA, Mr. Sergio Mendoza, and the Minister of Economy, Infrastructure, and Public Services of the Province of Salta, Mr. Carlos Parodi, held a joint press conference to inform the public about the revocation of ENJASA's license.88 During the press conference, Mr. Mendoza stated, inter alia, that \"ENJASA had an irresponsible attitude in the compliance with anti-money laundering provisions, breaching them in a systematic manner.\"89\n\nExhibit C-169.\n\nIbid, p. 1 (English translation).\n\n118.\n\nEqually on 13 August 2013, by Decree No. 2348/13, the Governor of Salta ordered ENREJA to prepare a transition plan to transfer ENJASA's operations, including its employees, to new operators.90\n\nExhibit C-222. See Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 318-319; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 478-480.\n\n119.\n\nOn 28 August 2013, ENJASA filed a Recourse for Reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13.91 In this Recourse, ENJASA argued that Resolution No. 240/13 was unlawful and should be revoked. It claimed, inter alia, that several of the investigated instances, which were found to be in breach of the regulatory framework, had prescribed under the statute of limitations; that ENREJA had disregarded evidence submitted by ENJASA showing that ENJASA had not breached any anti-money laundering rules; and that ENJASA had not hired \"operators\" in the meaning of Law No. 7020, but merely contracted out certain services to third parties, or had engaged persons that were allowed to operate games of chance under pre-existing authorizations issued by BPAS. ENJASA further claimed that Resolution No. 240/13 was issued in breach of its right to be heard and its right to offer and produce evidence, was issued without warning, that the Resolution\u2019s motivation was insufficient, was based on the retroactive application of certain regulatory rules, was arbitrary, and constituted a disproportionate reaction to minor breaches or mere human errors.\n\nExhibit C-213. See Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 329-330; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 466-470.\n\n120.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, ENJASA requested the First Instance Court of Salta, to suspend the implementation of Resolution No. 240/13 pending its Recourse for Reconsideration.92 This request for interim relief was granted on 4 October 2013.93\n\nExhibit C-214; Exhibit ARA-77.

See Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 358; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 497.\n\n130.\n\nOn 5 February 2014, ENJASA initiated proceedings before the First Instance Court of Salta against Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13 for the annulment of the revocation of its operating license.104 It not only claimed that the revocation was contrary to domestic law, but also that it breached the BIT.105\n\nExhibit C-221.

The present section summarizes the Parties' arguments in this respect. These summaries are not intended to be a comprehensive survey of all the points made by the Parties, but rather identify the Parties' principal positions. However, in reaching its conclusions, the Tribunal has taken into consideration the full range of arguments advanced by the Parties both in their written and oral submissions.\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Arguments on the Facts**\n----------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nClaimants contend that the revocation of ENJASA's gaming license has to be assessed not as an isolated exercise of ENREJA's supervisory powers, but as part of a larger plot through which ENREJA and the Government of the Province of Salta aimed at ousting ENJASA, and by prolongation L&E and its shareholders, from the remainder of their 30-year monopoly in Salta's gaming sector. This was motivated, Claimants claim, by an interest on the side of the Province to redistribute ENJASA's business to domestic operators of games of chance at conditions that were economically more favorable to the Province than the fees paid by ENJASA.110 Claimants claim that, already for years, ENREJA had developed a pattern of harassment and heavy-handed controls of ENJASA in order to fabricate and collect violations of gaming regulations allegedly committed by ENJASA. Towards the end of 2012, the authorities in the Province of Salta then devised a concrete plan to oust ENJASA of its monopoly. This plan, Claimants contend, culminated in the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s exclusive license through Resolution No. 240/13, which ENREJA based on fabricated systematic and serious breaches of anti-money laundering rules, and the subsequent distribution of ENJASA\u2019s business to new operators. The revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, Claimants claim, was arbitrary and unlawful and lacked any justification, as ENJASA in fact had not committed serious breaches of the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta.111\n\nClaimants' Request for Arbitration, paras. 9-10; Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 320 and 322; Claimants' Reply, para. 115.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 327; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 214-267.\n\n**1. Plan to Oust ENJASA from Salta\u2019s Gaming Sector**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a) Mounting Interferences with ENJASA\u2019s Operations Starting in 2007***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nIn making their claim that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was part of a larger, politically motivated plan to redistribute ENJASA\u2019s business in the gaming sector to local operators, Claimants draw on a large amount of circumstantial evidence. They claim that already in 2007, after Mr. Juan Manuel Urtubey took office as the new Governor of the Province of Salta, replacing his political rival, former Governor Mr. Juan Carlos Romero, there were indications that the Province wanted to get rid of \"the Austrians.\"112\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 115; WS II Anselmi, para. 47 (Exhibit C-292); Transcript, Day 2, p. 207 (Tucek).\n\n137.\n\nStarting in December 2007, following the takeover of Mr. Urtubey as new governor, Claimants claim, representatives of the Province of Salta and ENREJA began exerting pressure on ENJASA\u2019s operations. To start with, the Province of Salta insisted on renegotiating the conditions of ENJASA\u2019s gaming license, threatening to terminate ENJASA\u2019s license if ENJASA did not accept the modification of the license fee by paying a dynamic canon fee, instead of the previous fixed-fee arrangement. Claimants consider that ENJASA had no choice but to accept the new license fee in the Acta Acuerdo, which was concluded between ENJASA and UNIREN on 7 May 2008 and ratified by the Government of Salta on 11 August 2008.113\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 157-180; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 112-128.\n\n138.\n\nClaimants further submit that, following the conclusion of the Acta Acuerdo, ENREJA multiplied administrative inquiries against ENJASA relating to minor issues. These inquiries, in Claimants' view, were visibly aimed at finding minor formalistic mistakes made by ENJASA. ENREJA allegedly also imposed fines for circumstances discovered during its inspections that had occurred years before the conclusion of the Acta Acuerdo. Claimants consider that the sole purpose of these inspections and fines issued by ENREJA was to harass and exert pressure on ENJASA.114\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 189; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 140-153.\n\n139.\n\nClaimants also submit that ENREJA started interfering increasingly with ENJASA's conduct of lottery and slot machine operations. In respect of ENJASA's lottery operations, Claimants contend, ENREJA insisted on (i) the installation of a new CCTV system; (ii) replacing newly purchased equipment with equipment that was leased from the Province of Salta; and (iii) imposing disproportionate sanctions for old allegations and minor isolated incidents that were diligently addressed by ENJASA.115 In connection with the operation of slot machines, Claimants contend, ENREJA started requiring an unrealistic and unreasonable minimum number of employees and technicians for their operation. ENREJA also required ENJASA to change a large number of slot machines by imposing new technical requirements. Moreover, Claimants point out, ENREJA increased the administrative formalities for the approval of new slot machines, while systematically delaying the approval of these slot machines.116 Finally, Claimants claim, ENREJA introduced senseless administrative burdens on ENJASA with the purpose of causing minor clerical errors for which ENREJA could then impose harsh sanctions.117\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 192-194; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 204-213.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 195-206; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 154-203.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 200-203.\n\n140.\n\nAs a consequence of the increasing controls and other conduct of ENREJA, Claimants submit, ENJASA had to make additional investments and ENJASA's management and personnel had to spend a substantial amount of their time in responding to ENREJA's harassment.118\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 152-206; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 140-213, 558.\n\n***b) Administrative Inquiries and Sanctions from 2008 to May 2013***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nClaimants also submit that ENREJA increasing the number of investigations and sanctions for alleged breaches by ENJASA of the regulatory framework reflected the harassing attitude taken towards ENJASA and was part of a broader plan to oust it from the Province. Claimants specifically present arguments on the following sanctions that ENREJA imposed on ENJASA between March 2008 and May 2013:\n\n- ENREJA's Resolution No. 31/08 (dated 10 March 2008) imposed a fine of ARS 5,000 because a check issued by ENJASA did not contain the addition \"no a la orden\" 30 months after this error was discovered during an inspection of the anti-money laundering book for lottery games on 13 July 2005.119 Issuing a sanction after such a long time, Claimants point out, contravened Article 22 of ENREJA's internal rules, which required a decision within 15 days after initiating an administrative investigation. Moreover, Claimants submit, ENREJA disregarded that, while the words \"no a la orden\" were missing, the check had been \"crossed\", which had the exact same legal consequences, that is, to make the check non-transferable, as the wording that was required by Resolution No. 26/00.120\n\n- ENREJA's Resolution No. 32/08 (dated 10 March 2008) fined ENJASA ARS 10,000 for the alleged loss of the anti-money laundering book, for alleged irregularities in recording payments, and for the alleged irregular issuance of checks for the payment of prizes.121 ENJASA challenged the timeliness of the fine with respect to the issuance of checks. With respect to the loss of the anti-money laundering book, Claimants note, ENJASA's management diligently informed ENREJA as soon as it had learned about the loss and dismissed the individual responsible for the loss; in any event, no information had been lost as all entries to be made since the loss of the book had been kept by the individual in question in a separate excel sheet and were later copied into the new anti-money laundering book.122\n\n- ENREJA's Resolution No. 232/08 (dated 18 November 2008) imposed fines in the amount of ARS 62,000 on ENJASA because a payment of over ARS 10,000 was not made by check, although at the time, Claimants contend, payment by check was not required.123\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 286/09 (dated 16 December 2009), which fined ENJASA ARS 15,000 for amending betting limits in Casino Golden Dreams without prior authorization, concerned minor formalistic errors which had not caused any prejudice to customers.124\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 39/10 (dated 9 March 2010), which fined ENJASA ARS 100,000 for holding an irregular poker tournament in one of its casinos, was issued 17 months after the tournament had taken place; moreover, the irregularity related to the fact that the poker tournament had been held on both a Tuesday and a Thursday, instead of only on a Thursday, as originally approved by ENREJA.125\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 46/10 (dated 16 March 2010), which was confirmed by Resolution No. 106/10 (dated 3 May 2010), imposed a fine of ARS 20,000 on ENJASA because a payment of over ARS 10,000 had not been made by check, although at the time, Claimants contend, payment by check was not required.126 In addition, ENREJA imposed the fine almost two years after the event had taken place and therefore contrary to the one-year time limit that Article 49 of Law No. 7020 established.127\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 104/10 (dated 3 May 2010) fined ENJASA ARS 100,000 for making payments of prizes in cash, even though, Claimants contend, no obligation to do so existed at the time.128\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolutions Nos. 128/10, 129/10, and 130/10 (all dated 18 May 2010), as well as Resolutions Nos. 151/10, 152/10, and 153/10 (all dated 7 June 2010) temporarily suspended the operation of specific gambling halls for short periods between 7 and 13 days because of clerical errors in the slot machine rosters submitted to ENREJA.129\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 161/10 (dated 15 June 2010) imposed a fine of ARS 172,000 on ENJASA for not making payments by check when, Claimants contend, there was no obligation to do so, and for three cases in which ENJASA had not requested an identification of the winners of prizes. In addition, the fine was imposed three years after the payments in questions had been made, thus violating Article 21(2) of ENREJA\u2019s internal rules.130\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 200/10 (dated 27 July 2010) imposed a fine of ARS 200,000 on ENJASA for opening a slot machine hall in the town of Metan without authorization, even though the hall had been opened in 2004 and had been audited regularly by ENREJA.131\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 178/12 (dated 10 July 2012) imposed a fine of ARS 550,000 for three minor and isolated incidents in lottery draws, namely the use of too many balls for a drawing, an incorrect publication of the winning ticket in another drawing, and other minor irregularities in further drawings, that were all immediately rectified by ENJASA and did not harm any customers.132\n\n- ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 161/13 (dated 28 May 2013), which imposed on ENJASA the maximum fine of ARS 200,000 for modifying prize limits without authorization in poker games, as well as the maximum fine of ARS 500,000 for organizing an unauthorized jackpot, involved merely minor formalistic errors and did not cause any prejudice to ENJASA\u2019s customers.133\n\nResolution No. 31/08 (Exhibit C-150).\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 143-145.\n\nResolution No. 32/08 (Exhibit C-151).\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 146, 205-208.\n\nResolution No. 232/08 (Exhibit C-155).

Furthermore, many of the sanctions, in Claimants\u2019 view, lacked a legal basis. Others related to what Claimants describe as obviously minor, formal errors that did not affect the integrity of ENJASA\u2019s conduct and administration of games of chance and did not cause any prejudice to ENJASA\u2019s customers. Furthermore, the amounts of the fines imposed on ENJASA, Claimants contend, showed no relation to the facts they were allegedly based upon and increased without explanation from ARS 5,000 in 2008 to ARS 500,000 in May 2013.134 In any event, these prior incidents, Claimants contend, could not give rise to the conclusion that ENJASA had a history of disregarding the regulatory framework in place for operating games of chance, including in particular in respect of anti-money laundering. Rather, the fines imposed by ENREJA formed part of a pattern of harassing conduct that ENREJA had started after Mr. Urtubey had assumed office as Governor of the Province of Salta in 2007.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 191; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 120.\n\n***c) Role of Video Drome***\n----------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAs further support for their argument that the revocation of ENJASA's license was part of a plan to redistribute ENJASA's business among domestic operators, Claimants also draw attention to a letter of 23 November 2012, which was sent to ENREJA by Video Drome.135 Claimants contend that Video Drome had suggested to ENREJA in that letter that it could operate gaming facilities in Salta at more favorable conditions than those in place with ENJASA. In Claimants' view, Video Drome's letter to ENREJA triggered the concrete decision to oust ENJASA from its position in the gaming sector in the Province of Salta by means of revoking ENJASA's license through Resolution No. 240/13.136 This is supported, Claimants submit, by the fact that Video Drome was one of the companies to whom ENJASA's business was transferred after the revocation of the License. In addition, Claimants point out, the canon fee of 20%, which the Province ultimately obtained from all new operators, was in line with the proposal Video Drome made in its letter.137\n\nLetter of 23 November 2012 (Exhibit C-171).\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 225-227.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 347-350; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 275-282, 392-430.\n\n144.\n\nIn this context, Claimants also point out that ENJASA and Video Drome had been in a joint venture relating to slot machines installed in Casinos Golden Dreams and had concluded agreements for the lease of slot machines in other locations. The relationship, however, had turned sour due to various disputes concerning, inter alia, ENJASA's request to Video Drome to participate in the payment of the dynamic license fee negotiated in the Acta Acuerdo and to replace older with new slot machines, which would comply with ENREJA's new technical requirements. Since Video Drome had refused these requests, Claimants submit, ENJASA wanted to discontinue the joint venture and lease agreements which were due to expire by 31 December 20 1 2.138 It is against this background, Claimants contend, that Video Drome sent the letter of 23 November 2012 to ENREJA.\n\nSee Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 122-128.\n\n***d) Political Motivation of the Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nClaimants further submit that political rivalries in the Province of Salta, which already explained the renegotiation of ENJASA\u2019s operating fee in 2008, also played a role in the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license. To this end, Claimants claim that, during a meeting with representatives of the Government of the Province of Salta on 27 August 2013, they were informed that the real reason behind the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was the participation in L&E of Iberlux, which was allegedly held by a strawman of Mr. Romero, the former Governor of the Province of Salta and political rival of Mr. Urtubey.139 It was following this meeting that Claimants purchased, on 15 November 2013, the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E from Iberlux.140\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 334-336; Transcript, Day 2, p. 227 (Tucek).\n\nSee *supra* para. 79.\n\n146.\n\nAs further indication that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was politically motivated, Claimants point to the close coordination between ENREJA and the Government of the Province of Salta in relation to the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license. In particular, Claimants note that, on 13 August 2013, within 40 minutes after ENJASA had learned that the License had been revoked, the President of ENREJA, Mr. Sergio Mendoza, and the Minister of Economy, Infrastructure, and Public Services of the Province of Salta, Mr. Carlos Parodi, held a joint press conference, in which they claimed that ENJASA had systematically breached the anti-money laundering regulations in place. In Claimants\u2019 view, the two officials made clear that ENJASA was no longer relevant in the Province of Salta, stating that ENJASA \"disappears from this story.\"141 The two officials also suggested, Claimants submit, that any recourse by ENJASA against Resolution No. 240/13 would be futile.142\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 265-274; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 146.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 274.\n\n147.\n\nClaimants further contend that it was on the same day that the Governor of the Province of Salta instructed ENREJA to prepare a transition plan to appoint new operators.143 One day after the revocation, on 14 August 2013, Claimants submit, the Governor publicly endorsed the revocation of ENJASA's license at a press conference.144\n\nResolution No. 2348/13 of 13 August 2013 (Exhibit C-222).\n\nInterview of Mr. J.M. Urtubey, 14 August 2013, p. 1 (Exhibit C-212); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 148.\n\n148.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants consider that the incredibly quick implementation of the transition plan immediately following the issuance of Resolution No. 315/13 is illustrative of the intention of the Government of Salta to remove ENJASA from the local gaming market and to replace it with national operators.145 In this context, Claimants point out, it was only one day after ENJASA's Request for Reconsideration had been dismissed, when, on 20 November 2013, the Government of Salta approved the transition plan for the exploitation of gaming in the Province and authorized 11 individuals and companies to take over the operation of casinos, slot machines, and lotteries.146 Claimants also note that four of these entities, including Video Drome, were prior suppliers of equipment, and seven were pre-existing operators, including New Star and Mr. Navarrete. Between 20 and 29 November 2013, the Province of Salta then granted licenses to new operators for ENJASA's four casinos, 15 slot machine halls, and four lottery operations and definitely excluded ENJASA from these operations.147\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 424-428.\n\nDecree No. 3330/13, Art. 1-2 (Exhibit C- 032).\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 347-350; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 420-425.\n\n149.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants point out that even though ENJASA had initiated, on 5 February 2014, proceedings in the domestic courts and requested the annulment of the revocation of ENJASA's license and the appointment of new operators, on 29 May 2014, the Government of Salta granted the new operators ten-year licenses in Decree No. 1502/14, without conducting a public tender.148 This confirms, in Claimants' view, that the sole purpose of the revocation of ENJASA's license, and the transfer of its business and staff to the new operators, was an orchestrated action aimed at ousting ENJASA from Salta's gaming and lottery operations in order for the Province to benefit from more lucrative fees under newly issued licenses with operators other than ENJASA.149\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 360-362; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 431-442.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 360; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 431-442.\n\n150.\n\nClaimants also submit that they and ENJASA had undertaken all measures available to them to remedy the situation. In the weeks following the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13, CAI's representatives Mr. Tucek and Mr. Schreiner attended several meetings with representatives of the Province of Salta and of ENREJA. During these meetings, Claimants contend, ENJASA\u2019s alleged non-compliance with the applicable gaming regulations was not even raised once. The only topic that the Provincial Government and ENREJA were arguably focusing on was the alleged involvement in ENJASA, through the shareholding of Iberlux in L&E, of Mr Carlos Juan Garramon, a supporter of the political rival of Governor Urtubey. It is also for this reason, Claimant submit, that CAI had purchased, on 15 November 2013, the remaining 40% of the shares in L&E from Iberlux as a sign of good will and of CAI\u2019s strong interest and commitment to continue ENJASA\u2019s operations in the Province of Salta.150\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 401-402.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants further point out that a few weeks after the revocation, in November 2013, Mr. Tucek and Mr. Schreiner of Casinos met with representatives of ENREJA and the Province of Salta to discuss the modalities of transition of ENJASA\u2019s operations to new operators. During that meeting, Claimants allege, they were offered the possibility to continue operating two casinos, namely Casino Salta and Casino Boulevard, provided they waived all claims against the Province, an offer they, however, declined.151\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 356-357.\n\n152.\n\nThe proposal to continue operations on a reduced scale was unacceptable to Claimants. Casino Salta merely represented 2% of ENJASA\u2019s total revenues and Casino Boulevard even less. Moreover, Claimants note, they could only acquire new licenses for the two casinos in question if they forfeited, in return, all claims against ENREJA and the Province.152 In Claimants\u2019 view, the fact that the Province and ENREJA offered them to continue operations on a reduced scale confirms that there was no genuine concern about ENJASA\u2019s alleged breaches of the applicable regulatory framework.\n\nWS III Tucek, para. 598 (Exhibit C-290).\n\n153.\n\nAll of the above, in Claimants\u2019 view, support their submission that the revocation of the License was part of a politically motivated plan to oust ENJASA from its monopoly in the gaming sector in the Province of Salta and to redistribute its business under conditions that were more favorable for the Province than the conditions ENJASA was operating under.\n\n**2. The Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe politically motivated plan to oust ENJASA from the gaming sector in Salta also becomes apparent, Claimants argue, when considering the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license. Claimants submit that there was neither a legal nor a factual basis for the underlying administrative inquiries and the breaches ENREJA found ENJASA had committed. In Claimants' view, the revocation of ENJASA's license was arbitrary, disproportionate, and politically orchestrated. In addition, Claimants' submit, due process was violated in the administrative proceedings leading to the revocation of ENJASA's license.\n\n***a) Charges Underlying Resolution No. 240/13***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nClaimants submit that there were no grounds for ENREJA to conclude that ENJASA had systematically breached the anti-money laundering regulations of the Province of Salta or hired third operators without ENREJA's authorization. Instead, the charges against ENJASA were fabricated and based on incidents that were either non-existent, consisted of minor errors, partly dated from years before the revocation of the License, or involved arbitrary interpretations or applications of the regulatory framework in place. Claimants concretize their submission in respect of the charges brought forward by ENREJA in the three investigations that Resolution No. 240/13 took as a basis for the revocation of ENJASA's license as laid down in the following sections.\n\n**(1) Allegations in Resolution No. 380/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 380/12, in which ENREJA had charged ENJASA with having breached anti-money laundering rules in its lottery operations and by making a payment in respect of a prize won in a slot machine game, Claimants reiterate the same arguments that ENJASA had already made in answering to ENREJA's charges (see *supra* paras. 97-101). They therefore claim that no breach of anti-money laundering rules had occurred. At the most, minor administrative mistakes may have occurred in some of the instances investigated by ENREJA in Resolution No. 380/12.153 To the extent ENREJA based the revocation of ENJASA's license on these instances, ENREJA had relied on an incorrect factual basis and had not taken into account the explanations ENJASA had furnished in response to ENREJA's investigation under Resolution No. 380/12. Claimants also point out that they submitted the winning ticket for the prize of ARS 11,080 in the present proceeding to prove that the prize indeed existed.154 In addition, the minor errors that had occurred could not be qualified as serious breaches of the regulatory framework in place.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 233; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 250.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para, 315. For the ticket in question, see Exhibit C-393.\n\n**(2) Allegations in Resolution No. 381/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 381/12, which concerned alleged breaches of anti-money laundering rules in live games, Claimants reiterate the same arguments that ENJASA had already made in answering to ENREJA\u2019s charges (see *supra* paras. 103-107).\n\n158.\n\nAs for the charges relating to cash payments made to customers in August and September 2011, Claimants submit that, at the relevant time, no obligation had existed to pay prizes above ARS 10,000 by check or international wire transfer and to register the payments in the anti-money laundering book.155 Consequently, ENREJA\u2019s conclusion that ENJASA had acted in breach of anti-money laundering rules by making cash payments was an arbitrary exercise of its supervisory powers.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 271-272; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 332-334.\n\n159.\n\nIn this context, Claimants observe that Law No. 7020 only required registering the identity of the recipient in case amounts above ARS 10,000 were paid by check, but did not oblige ENJASA to make all payments above ARS 10,000 by check. Similarly, Resolution No. 26/00 of 10 April 2000, which ENJASA also had to comply with, did not require payments of amounts above ARS 10,000 to be made by check. This only changed, Claimants point out, as from 1 May 2012, when Resolution No. 90/12 replaced Resolution No. 26/00.156\n\nResolution No. 90/12, Art. 1.1 (Exhibit C-181).\n\n160.\n\nIn Resolution No. 90/12, ENREJA introduced the obligation for ENJASA to pay prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 by check or via international wire transfer. The checks had to mention the beneficiary and, if the amount payable by check was in excess of ARS 50,000, the check was to be made non-transferable. Thus, Claimants submit, before the introduction of Resolution No. 90/12, no use of checks and identification of beneficiaries were required for payments above ARS 10,000.157\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 236-248.\n\n161.\n\nClaimants further observe that, at the relevant times, no federal law in Argentina required payments above ARS 10,000 to be made by check. Resolution No. 151/98 of the Federal Tax Authority and National Law No. 25,345 only refused tax deductions when certain means of payment (such as non-transferrable checks) were not used.158 To confirm that ENJASA had not breached anti-money laundering regulations, Claimants also refer to the fact that inspectors of Argentina's federal agency for the prevention of money laundering in 2013 did not find reasons to further investigate ENJASA for breaches of anti-money laundering laws.159\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 45.\n\nClaimant Memorial, para. 241.\n\n162.\n\nNevertheless, and in spite of the clear regulations, Claimants submit, ENREJA stated in Resolution No. 381/12 that even before 1 May 2012 ENJASA had to make payments over ARS 10,000 by non-transferrable check and register the beneficiary in the anti-money laundering book. ENREJA's position, Claimants contend, could only be based upon a retroactive - and hence unlawful - application of Resolution No. 90/12 to facts that had occurred before 1 May 2012.160\n\nSee Resolutions Nos. 232/08, 46/10, 106/10, and 161/10.\n\n163.\n\nMoreover, Claimants submit that even if a legal obligation to make payments of prizes by check had existed in August and September 2011, ENREJA's investigation under Resolution No. 381/12 against ENJASA was time-barred. Claimants contend that pursuant to Article 49 of Law No. 7020, actions related to administrative infringements were time-barred after one year from the date of the event in question; the statute of limitations could be interrupted only by the initiation of an administrative inquiry or by the repetition of the breach in question, both of which neither had in fact, nor was alleged to have, occurred. Instead, ENREJA had started the administrative inquiry in question more than one year after the alleged breaches.161\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 273-276; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 335.\n\n164.\n\nIn this context, Claimants also submit that the five-year statute of limitations foreseen in Argentina's Federal Criminal Code was not applicable. This would entail a mistaken reliance on the ruling in *Filcrosa,* where the Argentine Supreme Court had decided that a longer statute of limitations established under local laws was inapplicable. *Filcrosa* did not, however, allow applying a longer statute of limitations under federal law, when local legislation imposed a shorter statute of limitations, as in the present case. Moreover, Claimants add, a five-year statute of limitations for criminal offences would also not apply, as none of the alleged regulatory breaches constituted crimes in the sense of Argentina's Criminal Code.162\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 371-375.\n\n165.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that there was no factual basis to conclude that the payments ENJASA had made above ARS 10,000 actually concerned prizes won by casino customers. The information on which ENREJA\u2019s charges were based - namely so-called \"Daily Reports\", \"Rating Card Forms\", and \"internal checks\" from August and September 2011 - provided no details on prizes actually won by individual customers. The Daily Reports and the Rating Card Forms only provided general estimates of the amounts won on each live game table. Internal checks were received against money deposited by customers in the casino\u2019s treasury. Although internal checks could be exchanged for chips at the gaming tables, there was not necessarily a correlation between the amount of the internal checks and the chips a client subsequently cashed.163 Moreover, no regulation in the Province of Salta forbade the use of internal checks in164 casinos.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 277-282; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 336-337.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 283-286; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 338-339.\n\n166.\n\nIn respect of ENREJA\u2019s charge relating to cash payments made in September 2011 to two customers in Casino Salta, Claimants reiterate that it was not clear what legal rule ENJASA\u2019s conduct violated. Claimants stress that ENJASA did not have any obligation at the time to make payments above ARS 10,000 by check.\n\n167.\n\nClaimants also point out that it is impossible to determine whether the amounts paid involved money won during live games or money that had been brought into the casino by the customer. Furthermore, it was not uncommon for two individuals to pool their money for playing and, at the end of the day, distribute what was left over or obtained at the gaming table. In any event, Claimants submit, there was no basis for holding ENJASA responsible for their clients\u2019 behaviour.165\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 283-286; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 338-339.\n\n168.\n\nClaimants concede that ENREJA had already sanctioned ENJASA for having paid prizes above ARS 10,000 in cash instead of by check before Resolution No. 90/12 had entered into force, that is, when Resolution No. 26/00 still applied. However, Claimants point out, ENJASA had in fact challenged ENREJA\u2019s interpretation of Resolution No. 26/00 as requiring the making of payments above ARS 10,000 by check or international wire transfer several times.166 ENJASA had only accepted to pay the fines in earlier administrative proceedings in order not to damage the relationship with ENREJA.\n\nENREJA's Answer of 28 October 2008, p. 1 (Exhibit ARA-212); Recourse for Revocation of 30 November 2009, p. 3 (Exhibit ARA-237); ENJASA's Answer to Charges re Resolution No. 381/12, p. 4 (Exhibit C-183); ENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration, pp. 49 *et seq.* (Exhibit C-213); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 118.\n\n169.\n\nClaimants therefore conclude that the charges in Resolution No. 381/12 were based on either an incorrect interpretation of the regulatory framework in place at the time (Law No. 7020 and Resolution No. 26/00) or a retroactive application of Resolution No. 90/12, disregarded the statute of limitations in Article 49 of Law No. 7020, and involved mistakes in the investigations of the facts. The conduct targeted in Resolution No. 381/12 could therefore, Claimants contend, not serve as a basis for the finding of serious breaches of the applicable regulatory framework, which could justify the revocation of ENJASA's license.\n\n**(3) Allegations in Resolution No. 384/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 384/12, which charged ENJASA with having breached Article 5 of the Law No. 7020 by sub-licensing the operations of several slot machine halls in different locations to third operators without requesting ENREJA's approval, and involving third operators in certain live games, Claimants equally reiterate the arguments that ENJASA had already made in answering to ENREJA's charges (see *supra* paras.109-115), namely that some of the individuals and companies in question were operating slot machine halls under permits granted by the BPAS (Mr. Navarrete, Mr. Colloricchio, and New Star), while others were not operators of games of chance at all (Emsenor, Video Drome, Prodec, and DEK). Claimants moreover observe that ENREJA could see from the investment plans Mr. Navarrete and New Star had submitted to ENREJA after the revocation of ENJASA's license that both had been appointed as operators of slot machine halls by BPAS.167\n\nLetter of 21 April 2014, p. 8 (Exhibit ARA-104); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 191-193.\n\n171.\n\nClaimants further submit that ENJASA, although it had been granted an exclusive license, had accepted, at the request of both the Province of Salta and ENREJA, who otherwise feared social and political problems, that operators authorized by BPAS could continue operating and that their status would not be altered due to the exclusivity of the license granted to ENJASA.168 Moreover, Claimants point out, ENREJA was aware of all contractual arrangements ENJASA had with these pre-existing operators concerning the operation of slot machines and had accepted that the fees from these operators would be paid to ENREJA through ENJASA. Claimants also maintain that ENREJA had, at all times, meticulously audited ENJASA\u2019s operations of slot machine halls and therefore had known about these arrangements all along.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 65.\n\n172.\n\nClaimants also point out that Article 5 of Law No. 7020 forbids the licensee to appoint operators without ENREJA\u2019s authorisation, but does not provide a definition of what an \"operator\" is. Claimants argue that ENREJA made an unjustifiably broad interpretation of the term \"operator\" in Article 5 of Law No. 7020 if it included companies under that definition that merely rented property to ENJASA for the operation of a slot machine hall (Emsenor), that supplied hardware and software for games of chance to ENJASA (Prodec and DEK), or leased slot machines to ENJASA (Video Drome). In this context, Claimants further argue that one does not become an \"operator\" by the mere fact of sharing revenues and profits from gaming operations.\n\n173.\n\nClaimants further point out that the Acta Acuerdo confirms that there had been no breaches of the applicable regulatory framework by ENJASA with respect to engaging some of those alleged operators.169 Indeed, one of the parameters that was considered during the negotiations with UNIREN at the time was the level of regulatory compliance of ENJASA. Thus, Claimants note, Decree No. 3428/08, which approved the Acta Acuerdo, confirmed that ENJASA\u2019s compliance was examined.170 Moreover, the Acta Acuerdo contained specific assurances about ENJASA\u2019s regulatory compliance, namely that (i) ENJASA had complied with the payment of the license fee; (ii) ENJASA had complied with its investment plan in the area of tourism and the increase of capital of ENJASA; (iii) there were no factual or legal circumstances that could constitute a breach of the terms of the public tender and transfer agreement through which ENJASA obtained the gaming license; and (iv) the joint ventures of ENJASA, inter alia with Video Drome, were not contrary to the terms of the License, but complied with Article 5 of Law No. 7020.171\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 180-181; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 129-139.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 130-132; Decree No. 3428/08 of the Province of Salta, Recitals 8 and 14 (Exhibit C-090).\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 181; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 133-139.\n\n174.\n\nClaimants finally observe that, as part of the transition plan, ENREJA had transferred 600 of ENJASA\u2019s employees to the companies that took over four casinos, 15 slot machine halls, and four lottery operations from ENJASA. The large number of employees transferred, Claimants submit, indicates that no third parties had been operating ENJASA's sites. Claimants also note that ENREJA granted permits to the very same companies, namely Video Drome and New Star, and one individual, Mr. Navarrete, that had participated in what ENREJA claimed had been \"serious breaches\", namely the involvement of operators of games of chance without ENREJA's authorization.172 All in all, the allegation that ENJASA had illegally appointed third party operators was thus, Claimants submit, merely a pretext to revoke ENJASA's license.173\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 350; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 425-427.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 358-360; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 429-430.\n\n***b) The Revocation of the License Was Arbitrary and Disproportionate***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nClaimants conclude from the above that there was no legal justification to revoke ENJASA's license. ENREJA simply accepted the findings of the administrative inquiries described in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12, without addressing any of ENJASA's explanations and arguments. Resolution No. 240/13, through which ENJASA license was revoked, retroactively applied Resolution No. 90/12 to facts that had occurred before its entry into force and misrepresented the facts underlying each allegation. Claimants insist that ENJASA complied with the applicable anti-money laundering regulations and did not illegally transfer its gaming license to unauthorized operators. As a result, Claimants conclude, ENREJA's revocation of ENJASA's gaming license was arbitrary.174\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 266, 305-382.\n\n176.\n\nClaimants also cast into doubt the legal basis on which ENJASA's license was terminated. Whereas ENREJA relied on Article 13 of Law No. 7020 to revoke ENJASA's license for breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, the allegations made in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12, which Resolution No. 240/13 confirmed, concerned, Claimants submit, administrative infringements that could only be sanctioned pursuant to Article 41 of Law No. 7020 with fines, a closure of at most 30 days, or an inability to operate of at most one year. However, the revocation of the operating license was not a sanction foreseen in Article 41. Claimants therefore conclude that ENREJA's allegations, even if they had been true, could not lead to a revocation of ENJASA's license.175\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 385-386.\n\n177.\n\nClaimants further contend that ENREJA could not have applied Article 13 of Law No. 7020, which provided for the revocation of the License as the most severe sanction, to sanction administrative infringements. Moreover, Article 13 had been repealed by Law No. 7133, which amended Law No. 7020.176 This, Claimants submit, is a further reason for why ENREJA could not have revoked the License on the basis of Article 13 of Law No. 7020.177\n\nLaw No. 7133 of 19 April 2001 (Exhibit ARA-006); Transcript, Day 5, p. 18 (Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s).\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 300-304.\n\n178.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that irrespective of the question as to whether or not the breaches had occurred, the revocation of the License was in all events excessive. In this context, Claimants point to Article 48 of Law No. 7020, which establishes the principle of proportionality and lists the criteria for the graduation of sanctions (see *supra* para.84). In Claimants' view, ENREJA did not take into account the proportionality required by the provincial regulations, nor did it take into account, or demonstrate the seriousness of, infringements ENJASA had allegedly committed. ENREJA did not consider how these infringements affected or may have affected the \"legal certainty, the morality and good customs\" mentioned in Article 48 of Law No 7020. To support their argument, Claimants refer to decisions from Argentina's federal agency in charge of anti-money laundering in cases that involved much more serious allegations, but limited the sanctions imposed to fines. This indicates, Claimants conclude, that the revocation of ENJASA's license was a disproportionate sanction.178\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 384-391.\n\n179.\n\nFinally, Claimants reject the argument that ENJASA's previous infringements justified the revocation of the License as a sanction under Article 48 of Law No. 7020, which allows imposing heavier sanctions in light of the licensee's \"record of relapses.\"\n\n***c) Violation of ENJASA's Due Process Rights***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nClaimants further submit that the revocation of ENJASA's license, and the procedure leading up to it, violated elementary due process rights. In addition to the lack of any proportionality in, and the arbitrariness of, the decision ultimately made, ENREJA's conduct breached elementary due process guarantees by (i) not warning ENJASA about the possible consequences of the administrative inquiries; (ii) completely disregarding the facts underlying the allegations; (iii) failing to respect ENJASA's right to be heard by not addressing any of the factual explanations and legal arguments made by ENJASA in response to ENREJA\u2019s investigations; (iv) depriving ENJASA of a fair opportunity to present its defence, because the company was unable to review the complete file relating to the allegations made by ENREJA and was not given adequate time to respond to the administrative inquiries; and (v) revoking the License without adequate reasoning.179\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 328; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 283, 293-299.\n\n181.\n\nClaimants submit in particular that ENREJA was obliged to alert ENJASA of the possible consequences of the administrative inquiries initiated by Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12. ENREJA did not do so, however. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, Resolutions Nos. 39/10, 104/10, and 161/10 did not contain sufficient warnings about a possible revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license arising out of the conduct investigated under Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12. Moreover, by August 2013, when Resolution No. 240/13 was handed down, these earlier resolutions were three years old and were not mentioned or referenced in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12.180\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 256-264.\n\n182.\n\nClaimants further point out that ENJASA submitted, on 28 August 2013, an extensive Recourse for Reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13, which contained detailed arguments of fact and law.181 In this Recourse, ENJASA observed, for instance, that ENREJA had misinterpreted the involvement of the third operators and requested ENREJA to produce the permits of the BPAS authorizing these operators. Moreover, ENJASA submitted that Video Drome, Prodec, and DEK were not operating the games in question, but had only rented out slot machines or supplied hardware and software that ENJASA used to operate games of chance. Furthermore, ENJASA submitted that ENREJA had either misinterpreted Law No. 7020 and Resolution No. 26/00 by requesting that all payments above ARS 10,000 had to be made by check, or was retroactively applying Resolution No. 96/12 to conduct that had taken place before that Resolution entered into force.\n\nENJASA's Recourse for Reconsideration (Exhibit C-213).\n\n183.\n\nOn 19 November 2013, ENREJA denied ENJASA\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13 and confirmed the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license by Resolution No. 315/13. In Claimants\u2019 view, Resolution No. 315/13 merely rubberstamped Resolution No. 240/13 and sweepingly disregarded or misrepresented ENJASA\u2019s arguments, considering its Request for Reconsideration a mere \"dilatory activity.\"182 Claimants further point out that, for the first time in Resolution No. 315/13, ENREJA denied that Mr. Navarrete, Mr. Colloricchio, and New Star had been authorized to operate slot machine halls by BPAS.183 ENREJA also pretended, Claimants contend, that, in accordance with Article 2 b) of UIF Resolution No. 199/11, any payment made to a gambler in a casino, must be considered a \"prize\", although this provision clearly distinguished between the payment of \"prizes\" and of other amounts.184 All of this, Claimants submit, are further indications that due process was not respected, as ENJASA was, for the first time in Resolution No. 315/13, confronted with additional legal and factual arguments and allegations and could not respond to ENREJA.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 342-346; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 393, 405-419, Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 204.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 412.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 416.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Analysis of the Law**\n-------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nIn Claimants' view, the plan to oust ENJASA of its business in the gaming sector, which culminated in the revocation of its exclusive license, followed by the transfer of its operations and employees to new operators, destroyed Claimants' investment in the Argentine Republic, with no compensation being paid. This, Claimants argue, constitutes an unlawful expropriation in the sense of Article 4 of the BIT and breaches the obligation of the host State to provide fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the same treaty, as a result of which Claimants are entitled to damages. The Argentine Republic, Claimants add, is responsible for the actions of the authorities of the Province of Salta, which are attributable to her under international law, as already held by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction.185\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 462-464; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 462-464 (referring to the Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 288).\n\n**1. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n185.\n\nGiven that their action involves a claim for breach of the international law standards set forth in the BIT, Claimants contend that \"[w]hen it comes to an issue of liability for a claim founded upon an investment treaty obligation, the applicable law is the investment treaty as supplemented by general international law.\"186\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 449.\n\n186.\n\nClaimants stress that Respondent may not rely on her domestic legislation \"as a justification for acts that are in violation of its treaty and other international law obligations.\"187 This, Claimants argue, is confirmed by Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), by Articles 3 and 32 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Articles**\"), as well as by \"abundant and consistent authority of ICSID tribunals,\" which confirms that domestic law cannot justify the failure to comply with international law.188\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 365.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 365-370; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 448-455; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 226-231.\n\n187.\n\nClaimants further contend that domestic law is only relevant in determining a State\u2019s international responsibility as part of the factual matrix of the dispute, not as part of the governing law, as confirmed by numerous international courts and tribunals.189 In this context, Claimants refer to several statements of the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") to this effect, inter alia in the *ELSI* case, where the Court said:\n\nCompliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.190\n\nReply on the Merits, paras. 456-458 (referring to *Alps Finance and Trade AG v.

See Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 455; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 235.\n\n188.\n\nFor Claimants, the above principle is not altered by the reference to the domestic law of the host State in Article 8(6) of the BIT, which states:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute with reference to the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute, including its private international law rules, the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.\n\n189.\n\nThis provision, Claimants argue, must be interpreted pursuant to the VCLT and has to be read together with Article 27 of the VCLT and customary international law, \"both of which prohibit a party to a treaty to invoke its national law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"191\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 459.\n\n190.\n\nClaimants further contest Respondent's assertion that, in order to be able to rely on Article 27 of the VCLT, Claimants must first establish a conflict between Argentine law and international law. According to Claimants, this assertion \"disregards the principle according to which domestic law is not governing the question of liability under international law.\"192\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 460; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 226-239.\n\n**2. Breach of Article 4 of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nClaimants point out that Article 4 of the BIT protects both against expropriation and measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation, and therefore encompasses both direct and indirect or *de facto* expropriation.193 According to Claimants, the revocation of ENJASA's license was an abuse of the regulatory powers of ENREJA and constituted an indirect expropriation of Claimants' investment in Argentina. Because of the revocation of ENJASA's license, Claimants claim to be entitled to damages because Respondent thereby permanently deprived them of their investment in Argentina without compensation in breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Claimants further claim to be entitled to damages pursuant to Article 4(3) of the BIT because the revocation of ENJASA's license qualifies as a direct taking of an asset (the License), which belongs to ENJASA, an Argentine company in which Claimants hold shares.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 392-397; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 465-466; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 241.\n\n***a) The Revocation of the License as an Abuse of Regulatory Powers***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nClaimants accept that customary international law recognizes a host State's \"right to regulate or take measures affecting foreign investors' property interests without a finding of compensable expropriation,\" as long as such measures pursue a legitimate purpose, are aimed at the general welfare, are not discriminatory, fall within the scope of the State's general regulatory or administrative powers, and are in accordance with due194 process.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 469; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 280-296.\n\n193.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent acknowledged that a State's regulatory measures must be \"reasonable and proportionate,\" and so have many investment tribunals. In order to satisfy the principle of proportionality, a measure must be: (a) one that is suitable to achieve a legitimate purpose; (b) necessary for achieving that purpose in that no less burdensome measures would suffice; and (c) not excessive in that its advantages are outweighed by its disadvantages.195 Claimants also stress that many commentators confirm that the principle of proportionality should be applied to determine whether an expropriation has taken place. Even a generally applicable regulation in the public interest may require compensation if it is obviously disproportionate.196\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 470-477; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 287-290.\n\nSee Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 471 (referring to *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability (3 October 2006) para. 195 (Exhibit CL-003) and *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republi*c, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (1 October 2011) para. 241 (Exhibit CL-016).\n\n194.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants argue that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was not a regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s supervisory powers under Law No. 7020, but instead was done \"in bad faith, with the specific purpose of transferring ENJASA\u2019s gaming operations to local Argentine companies by fabricating and exaggerating factually incorrect accusations of non-compliance with gaming regulations.\"197 In particular, Claimants contend that Resolution No. 240/13 was issued without any warning, specifically targeted Claimants\u2019 investment in Salta, and relied on breaches collected over a long period of time that, even if true, were marginal and without serious consequences.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 479; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 366-382.\n\n195.\n\nClaimants further consider the revocation of the License to have been politically orchestrated, unlawful, arbitrary, and in breach of due process. According to Claimants, ENREJA applied regulations that had not been in force at the relevant time, disregarded the statute of limitations, and rendered any potential legal recourses moot.198\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 480; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 366-382.\n\n196.\n\nMoreover, Claimants point out that despite the obvious lack of gravity of the alleged infringements of the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta, Resolution No. 240/13 imposed, without warning, the harshest and most severe sanction available. Given that ENREJA could have resorted to less burdensome measures, the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was excessive, in violation of due process, and its issuance an abuse of ENREJA\u2019s regulatory powers. Therefore, Claimants conclude, the measures taken by Respondent did not constitute a legitimate exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory powers and failed to comply with the principle of proportionality.199\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 481-483; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 383-393.\n\n***b) Substantial and Permanent Deprivation of Claimants' Investment***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nClaimants argue that a regulatory taking can be an indirect expropriation given that \"disproportionate general regulations can be considered as expropriatory if there is a sufficient interference with the investor\u2019s rights.\"200 Claimants identify two main criteria to determine whether a regulatory measure amounts to an indirect expropriation: the intensity of the effects of the measures on the investment and its duration.201\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 484-485 (relying inter alia on *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republi*c, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (1 October 2011) para. 243 (Exhibit CL-016); *AWG Group Ltd. v. Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) para. 132 (Exhibit CL-194)). See also Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 280-283.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 491, 496; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 244-245.\n\n198.\n\nRegarding intensity, Claimants explain that the host State\u2019s interference with the investment must be substantial. The expropriatory effect of a regulatory measure is a question of degree, with tribunals using language such as \"substantial deprivation\", rendering an investment \"useless\", \"effectively neutraliz[ing]\" the investment, removing the ability to make use of economic rights, depriving the investment of \"any real substance\", eroding the investor\u2019s rights \"to an extent that is violative\", or constituting a \"persistent or irreparable obstacle\" to the use, enjoyment, or disposal of the202 investment.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 486-492; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 247-249.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants point out that whether the investor retains control of the investment is not the most accurate criterion to determine whether an indirect expropriation has taken place. An indirect expropriation leaves the investor\u2019s title untouched, but deprives it of the possibility of using the investment in a meaningful way.203 Criteria such as whether the investor retains the investment\u2019s economic use or the benefit to be reasonably expected are more accurate. According to Claimants, the \"decisive point for an expropriation is the destruction of the capability to reasonably use the investment in an economic sense.\"204 In this case, Claimants contend that the Province\u2019s unlawful measures deprived Claimants of \"all of the economic benefits of their shareholding in L&E and ENJASA.\"205\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 486; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 250.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 493-495.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 503.\n\n200.\n\nClaimants further point out that the fact that they formally retained title to their shareholding in L&E and ENJASA fails to take into consideration the essence of an indirect expropriation and does not detract from the fact that the economic use of the investment has been eradicated.206 The same holds true, in Claimants' view, concerning the fact that ENJASA has not been deprived of the use of the five-star hotel, which was never profitable on a standalone basis, was constructed as a condition for Claimants' operations in the Province, and was not an asset having a significant independent commercial value after the revocation of the License. Finally, Claimants contend that Respondent's offer to continue operating two casinos was unrelated to the exclusive right to commercially exploit games of chance in the Province of Salta until 2029 under ENJASA's license. The offer to continue operating two casinos, in addition to never having been made in a formal fashion, only accounted for about 5% of ENJASA's revenues and was made subject to various unacceptable conditions, such as waiving any legal recourse against the revocation of ENJASA's license.207\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 251-263.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 497-501.\n\n201.\n\nRegarding duration, Claimants contend that, in addition to the intensity of the measure, tribunals have considered that the interference must not be merely transitional in order to amount to a compensable indirect expropriation.208 In the present case, Claimants point out that the deprivation of the economic benefits attached to the shareholdings in L&E and ENJASA was permanent, as ENJASA had to shut down operations, rendering the purpose of the entire investment to operate games of chance in Salta impossible. As for the remaining assets of ENJASA, Claimants contend that they were ancillary and lost the capacity to generate profits following the revocation of ENJASA license.209 In other words, the revocation of the License constituted \"a permanent obstacle to Claimants' use and enjoyment of their investment,\"210 thus constituting an expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in ENJASA that was contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. The transfer by ENREJA and the Province of Salta of ENJASA\u2019s gaming operations to local companies consolidated the expropriation.211\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 496.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 497.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 502.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 497, 502.\n\n***c) Expropriation of ENJASA's License Contrary to Article 4(3) of the BIT***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nClaimants further argue that, in addition to a claim for breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, they also have a claim under Article 4(3) of the BIT for damages because the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license and the forced transfer of its operations to local competitors constitute a direct taking of ENJASA\u2019s license that would entitle Claimants to damages.212\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 504; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 264-279.\n\n203.\n\nArticle 4(3) of the BIT, in the English translation offered by Claimants, provides:\n\nWhere a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 2 hereof, is deemed to be a company belonging to that Contracting Party, and in which the investor of the other Contracting Party has shares, the provisions set forth in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied by the former so as to guarantee the appropriate compensation of the investor.\n\n204.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Article 4(3) of the BIT, read in conjunction with the broad definition of investment in Article 1 of the BIT, reveals that the BIT not only protects the shares an investor has in a local company against direct and indirect expropriations without compensation; it also protects individual assets of local companies in which a foreign investor holds shares against expropriation.213 Claimants thus reject the interpretation of Article 4(3) of the BIT offered by Respondent, which is inspired by the limited protection customary international law offers to shareholders, as developed by the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction* and *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo;* such an interpretation, Claimants argue, has no place where a BIT expressly protects the individual assets of a company in which the investor holds shares, such as is the case with the BIT.214\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 506.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 506-508.\n\n205.\n\nClaimants further point out that provisions in other investment treaties that are similar to Article 4(3) of the BIT have been interpreted, in conjunction with the wide definition of investment included in those treaties, to the effect that \"[w]hen such companies suffer expropriation it is not the shares which constitute the 'investment\u2019 of the other contracting party but the assets of the local company which are expropriated.\"215 In such circumstances, the host State's obligation to compensate for the expropriation of the company's assets is owed to the investor in the local company, thus giving rise to claims by the shareholders, not by the local company.216\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 510.\n\nSee Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 509-513 (relying inter alia on *RosInvestCo UK v. Russian Federation*, SCC Arbitration No. V (079/2005), Final Award (12 September 2010) para. 607 (Exhibit CL-103)).\n\n206.\n\nClaimants also contend that the interpretative tools of the VCLT do not lend support to Respondent's argument that Article 4(3) of the BIT, by providing shareholders direct protection against expropriation of the assets of the company, exclude the shareholder from relying on other standards of protection, such as fair and equitable treatment.217 Neither the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 4(3) of the BIT, nor the BIT's obj ect and purpose, would support such an interpretation. It would go against the purpose of the BIT, Claimants contend, if the BIT was to protect assets of locally incorporated property only against expropriations, but denied protection granted to shareholders under other standards of treatment contained in the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 514.\n\n207.\n\nAs for the type of assets of a locally incorporated company that are protected against expropriations under Article 4(3) of the BIT, Claimants submit that Respondent's interpretation, which limits the protection of Article 4(3), based on the authentic version of the BIT in Spanish language, to \"financial assets\", contrary to the authentic version of the BIT in German language, which refers only to \"assets\", is not in conformity with Article 33 of the VCLT.218 In particular, Claimants rely on Article 33(1) and (3) of the VCLT to argue that, except otherwise provided, the text of a treaty is equally authoritative in each authentic language, so that one may assume that one text reflects the will of the parties as expressed in the other languages. Only if, Claimants point out, a difference in meaning persists in different authentic texts, the meaning which best reconciles the texts in light of the treaty's object and purpose should be preferred, as laid down in Article 33(3) of the VCLT.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 515-524; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 266-277.\n\n208.\n\nThus, Claimants conclude, absent a provision to the contrary, the Spanish and German versions of the BIT are equally authoritative. The relevant German term, *\"Vermogenswerte\",* is used consistently in the BIT. It means \"assets\" and is also translated as such in Spanish (\"*actzvos*\") everywhere else in the BIT except in Article 4(3). By contrast, the term *\"activos financieros\"* appears only in the Spanish version of Article 4(3) of the BIT, without any further definition or explanation. According to Claimants, an interpretation that limits the protection granted by Article 4(3) of the BIT to only one of the two authentic texts cannot be explained by the text or the object and purpose of the treaty. Instead, in light of the BIT\u2019s object and purpose, Article 4(3) of the BIT must be read as protecting \"all assets of a locally incorporated company against expropriation,\" including ENJASA\u2019s license.219 The term *\"activos fmancieros\"* is, Claimants conclude, in all likelihood a translation mistake.220\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 524.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 521-523.\n\n**3. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nClaimants further argue that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license results in a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard included in Article 2(1) of the BIT.221 Fair and equitable treatment, Claimants contend, is a standard with legal, not extra-legal, content the application of which depends on the facts of the case. Claimants explain how various tribunals have defined fair and equitable treatment and have given it specific meaning depending on the factual situations at hand.222\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 405 *et seq.*; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 525 *et seq.*; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 402 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 406-410.\n\n***a) The Scope of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nClaimants object to Respondent\u2019s understanding that the scope of fair and equitable treatment is contained in, and limited by, the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Moreover, the differences between how fair and equitable treatment is defined under the North-American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and the BIT make Respondent\u2019s reliance on NAFTA jurisprudence unavailing. Claimants contend that the reference to fair and equitable treatment in the BIT must be interpreted pursuant to the VCLT, and that \"the overwhelming weight of legal authority and tribunals supports that the FET standard should be understood as an autonomous standard, whose precise meaning must be established on a case-by-case basis.\"223\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 527-538 (quote at para. 533); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 403-409.\n\n***b) The Content of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nClaimants submit that, notwithstanding various nuances, there is a broadly shared understanding as to the elements that form part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, namely the protection of the investor's legitimate expectations, procedural propriety and due process, the prohibition of arbitrary conduct and the requirement of good faith, as well as freedom from coercion and harassment.224\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 411-422; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 539-541; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 404, 409, 410-428.\n\n212.\n\nClaimants also recall that the Tribunal observed in its Decision on Jurisdiction, that fair and equitable treatment\n\nhas been interpreted, inter alia, to protect covered investors and their investments against the arbitrary exercise of public powers, as well as against harassment by public authorities, to require public authorities to administer the applicable law in good faith, to entitle foreign investors and their investments to due process and to protect an investor's legitimate expectations.225\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 542 (quoting the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 242).\n\n213.\n\nClaimants further contend that the actions of the authorities in the Province of Salta have breached the above elements of fair and equitable treatment \"in multiple ways,\" including by (1) failing to afford due process and procedural propriety; (2) engaging in coercion and harassment; (3) acting arbitrarily and in bad faith; and (4) frustrating Claimants' legitimate expectations.226\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 423; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 525; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 429.\n\n**(1) Failure to Provide Due Process and Procedural Propriety**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nClaimants stress that several investment tribunals have interpreted fair and equitable treatment as requiring due process and procedural propriety in both administrative and judicial proceedings. To live up to administrative due process, \"the administrative bodies need to conform to generally accepted requirements such as access to a file, reasonable notices, a reasonable opportunity to present one's case by making factual and legal submissions and submitting evidence.\"227 Claimants contend that serious administrative negligence, inconsistencies, or idiosyncrasy can amount to a violation of fair and equitable treatment.228\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 547.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 544-547; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 422.\n\n215.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants argue that \"both the context of Resolution No. 240/13 and the actual conduct of the administrative procedure show that ENREJA violated elementary due process rights, thereby breaching the fair and equitable treatment standard.\"229 In particular, Claimants consider, due process would have required ENREJA to engage with and consider ENJASA\u2019s comments in the proceeding that led to the revocation of the License. However, ENJASA was prevented from addressing ENREJA\u2019s accusations in a meaningful way. In the administrative investigation relating to the alleged hiring of operators without ENREJA\u2019s authorization, ENJASA was notified of the charges only six months after the formal investigations had started and a few weeks before the License was actually revoked.230 Moreover, ENJASA did not get complete access to ENREJA\u2019s files.231 The evidence submitted by ENJASA was rejected without reason and submissions made by ENJASA were completely disregarded by ENREJA. Due process, Claimants note, not only requires giving a right to be heard, but also to consider submissions made in an administrative proceedings in a meaningful way.232 ENREJA, however, distorted the facts and misapplied the local law, including by disregarding the applicable statute of limitations and applying anti-money laundering rules retroactively.233 Besides, ENREJA failed to notify ENJASA in a timely manner of the risk of having its License revoked, thus depriving ENJASA of an opportunity to take measures to prevent such revocation.234\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 548; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 394-400, 420-422, 449-453.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 551.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 552; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 399.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 295, 550; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 400.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 425-427; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 548-554.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 215, 256-264, 480-481.\n\n216.\n\nIn sum, for Claimants, \"the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was, as the facts show, an arbitrary act with the purpose of transferring Claimants\u2019 business to local companies. Neither the Provincial Government nor ENREJA were actually concerned about compliance with regulations. The allegations of non-compliance were a facade for an outright taking.\"235\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 549.\n\n**(2) Coercion and Harassment**\n-------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nClaimants further point out that tribunals have recognized coercion and harassment as breaches of fair and equitable treatment.236 In the present case, Claimants contend, \"the revocation of the license was the culmination of a pattern of harassment\" that started after the change of government in Salta in December 2007, was conducted \"with the sole purpose of preparing the transfer of Claimants' investment to local companies,\" and manifested itself in \"heavy-handed and harassive controls of ENJASA\" that focussed on \"minimal formalistic human errors\" and included fines related to events that had occurred years before the fines were imposed.237 This, Claimants conclude, amounts to a violation of fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 555-556.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 557-559.\n\n**(3) Arbitrary Conduct and Conduct in Bad Faith**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nClaimants also argue that investment tribunals have acknowledged the obligation to refrain from arbitrary conduct as a necessary element of fair and equitable treatment.238 According to Claimants, a conduct is arbitrary \"when it is founded on prejudice or bias without a rational explanation or without serving a legitimate purpose.\"239\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 560-567; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 418-419.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 562.\n\n219.\n\nClaimants moreover contend that the principle of good faith is a general principle of law that plays a \"significant role in investment law,\" and that one \"obvious application of the notion of good faith is the duty to act for cause, and not for purely arbitrary reasons of domestic politics.\"240 Accordingly, bad faith would include\n\nthe use of legal instruments for purposes other than those for which they were created. It also includes a conspiracy by state organs to inflict damage upon or to defeat the investment, the termination of the investment for reasons other than the one put forth by the government, and expulsion of an investment based on local favouritism.241\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 563-564; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 413-416\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 565 (quoting *Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (12 November 2010) para. 300 (Exhibit CL-025)).\n\n220.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants contend that Respondent's \"overall practice\" that led to the revocation of ENJASA's license and to the transfer of its business to third operators was driven by \"opportunistic reasons and domestic politics,\" as ENREJA availed itself of minor infringements accumulated over years to construe a pretext to revoke ENJASA's license and transfer its business to local operators. According to Claimants, this conclusion is supported by the fact that sub-licensing to local companies was one of the reasons for the revocation, yet parts of ENJASA's business were ultimately transferred to the very same local companies. Similarly, although, according to ENREJA, ENJASA\u2019s \"lack of compliance\" with the regulatory framework justified the revocation of the License, Claimants were later offered to continue operating two of the casinos ENJASA had operated before.242\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 424, 431; Reply on the Merits, para. 566.\n\n**(4) Failure to Provide Stability and Protect Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nClaimants finally point out that the overwhelming majority of tribunals have held that the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations constitute a key element of fair and equitable treatment.243 The obligation to protect legitimate expectations does not stem from express language in the treaty, but \"from another tenet of the rule of law, namely that justified hopes i.e. legitimate expectations, should not be unreasonably disappointed.\"244 These expectations \"arise out of the legal framework of the host state at the time the investment was made considering also any undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host state.\"245\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, paras. 411-414; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 539-543, 568-579.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 573.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 568-574.\n\n222.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants submit, they relied, at the time of making their investment in Salta, upon \"the Province\u2019s invitation to develop the Province\u2019s gaming sector in line with international best practices and with the know-how of a renowned international gaming operator.\"246 Claimants contend that they had the legitimate expectation to exploit the License undisturbed and without harassment if they continued to operate in the same manner that had been confirmed to be lawful during the renegotiation of the license fee, as laid down in the Acta Acuerdo. This expectation, Claimants contend, was based on the issuance of an exclusive license for a period of 30 years until September 2029.247\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 575.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 575-577. See also Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 439-441.\n\n223.\n\nClaimants contend that the Province\u2019s undertakings and policies were \"completely reversed\" with the change of government in Salta in 2007. According to Claimants, there was no legitimate regulatory interest to justify the revocation of the License. On the contrary, the only interest was to transfer ENJASA\u2019s license to local operators based on fabricated circumstances serving as a justification. Accordingly, Claimants contend, the Province of Salta \"consciously and overtly breached Claimants' expectations,\" thus breaching the fair and equitable treatment standard laid down in the BIT.248\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 578.\n\n**C.** **Respondent\u2019s Analysis of the Facts**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimants' account of the reasons for, and the evaluation of, the revocation of ENJASA's license. Respondent submits that ENJASA had committed serious breaches of the anti-money laundering rules in the Province of Salta, which amply justified the revocation of ENJASA's license to operate games of chance. In Respondent's view, ENREJA's actions complied fully with the regulatory framework in place and thus constituted a lawful exercise of the host State's regulatory power that was in compliance with the provisions of the BIT.\n\n**1. Motives for Revoking ENJASA\u2019s Gaming License**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' theory that ENJASA's license was revoked to \"get rid of the Austrians\" who indirectly controlled ENJASA, and to eliminate the involvement of Mr. Garamon, a supporter of Governor Urtubey's political rival, who allegedly owned 40% of ENJASA through Iberlux, was plainly wrong. Respondent highlights that Claimants failed to provide evidence of any of these unfounded speculations. Respondent further points out that Claimants' witness Mr. Tucek, upon whose statement the underlying allegations were based, admitted at the hearing that he had no first-hand knowledge of the matter, but was just reproducing what he had been informed of by ENJASA's local staff.249\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 229; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 13-14.\n\n226.\n\nRespondent stresses instead that the motives for revoking ENJASA's license lay in the serious and frequent breaches of the applicable anti-money laundering regulations that ENJASA had committed. In this context, Respondent points to the necessity of anti-money laundering regulations and to the State's power to issue them. Furthermore, Respondent submits that Law No. 7020, which required approval of operators of games of chance and imposed on the licensee a certain number of duties, including the duty to exercise due diligence in relation to its customers and to record payments made in excess of ARS 10,000, was in full conformity with the recommendations made for casinos issued by the Financial Action Task Force (\"**FATF**\"), an inter-governmental body tasked to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. These recommendations insisted on the need for authorities to regulate and control casino activities, to regulate the admission of operators of games of chance, and to establish mechanisms to know and track the transactions of players.250\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 143-146; See 40 FATF Recommendations, Interpretative Note to Recommendations 5, 12 and 16 (20 June 2003) (Exhibit ARA-031) and Interpretative Note to Recommendations 22 and 23 (February 2012) (Exhibit JM-05).\n\n227.\n\nRespondent submits that the decision to revoke ENJASA\u2019s license was the result of the company\u2019s frequent breaches of the anti-money laundering regulations in place, which had been introduced in Argentina as one of the consequences of the country\u2019s financial crisis that had occurred at the turn of the millennium. Especially since that grave social, economic, and institutional crisis, financial concerns were important for Argentina. Moreover, the Province of Salta, which borders three different countries (Paraguay, Bolivia, and Chile), was a well-known risk-area, especially since games of chance were forbidden in Bolivia. Respondent therefore insists that the Province of Salta was entitled to introduce efficient anti-money laundering regulations and to vest ENREJA with powers to monitor compliance with them and sanction any breaches.251\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 213-243; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 72-119.\n\n228.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants\u2019 allegations that ENJASA had started to become a subject of harassments by the Province of Salta when Mr. Urtubey took office in December 2007. In this context, Respondent first points out that the country\u2019s precarious financial situation in 2001/2002 had led to the enactment of an Emergency Law in 2002, which required the renegotiation of public service agreements and licenses.252 It was in this context that the fee for ENJASA\u2019s license was renegotiated by the Province of Salta through UNIREN, an entity specifically created for this purpose. Respondent further stresses that the renegotiation of the license fee was a reasonable and legitimate measure in view of the economic situation of the country at the time.253\n\nLaw No. 25561 of 6 January 2002 (Exhibit ARA-17).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 178-180; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 36-40.\n\n229.\n\nRespondent points out that UNIREN and ENJASA agreed upon a new license fee in the Acta Acuerdo, which was based on a different fee structure. Whereas originally a fixed annual amount in USD had been agreed upon, this was changed into a percentage of ENJASA\u2019s net income, which rose over time to 15% for lottery games and 16% for casinos and slot machines.254 This change from a fixed fee to an income-based fee, Respondent submits, required stricter controls over ENJASA's earnings. It was to this end that ENREJA implemented an online information control system and introduced regulatory changes for the operation of slot machines.255\n\nMemorandum of Agreement of 7 May 2008 (Exhibit C-131); Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 181.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 181-184, 232-235; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 51-71, 104-107.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent also notes that two administrative inquiries that resulted in sanctions of ENJASA's business operation pre-dated the appointment of Governor Urtubey. Thus, ENREJA's Resolution No. 15/05 (dated 16 March 2005) fined ENJASA for imposing unauthorized restrictions on bets. In respect of this investigation, ENJASA went from first denying the events to then alleging that it had been a victim of persecution by ENREJA before ultimately acknowledging the breaches in a request for suspension of the sanction imposed.256 ENREJA's Resolution No. 104/07 (dated 11 September 2007), in turn, sanctioned ENJASA for operating a slot machine without authorization. In respect of this investigation, ENREJA considered that ENJASA's defence that the machine was running on a temporary trial basis could not justify ENJASA's failure to report the machine. ENJASA did not challenge the decision and paid the fine.257 These two investigations, in Respondent's view, confirm that ENREJA had carried out administrative investigations well before Governor Urtubey took office in December 2007, thus discrediting Claimants' theory about the existence of a political plan to oust ENJASA of its business in Salta.258\n\nExhibit C-239; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 258-260; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 126-134.\n\nExhibit C-240; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 261-264; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 135-139.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6.\n\n231.\n\nAs a further indication that there was no plan to oust ENJASA of its business, Respondent submits that, after ENJASA's license was revoked, gaming operators in the Province of Salta who complied with the legal and regulatory requirements were allowed to continue their activities by means of temporary non-exclusive permits. The interested parties had to demonstrate compliance with a series of requirements and submit their investment plans in order to obtain a final license to operate games of chance.259 Respondent submits that Claimants had an opportunity to participate in this process, but decided not to do so.260\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 478-505; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 379.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 380-382.\n\n232.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Claimants are distorting the facts, when they claim that ENREJA and the Province of Salta definitively transferred ENJASA\u2019s business to third-party operators in only ten days after the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license. New licenses were in fact only awarded on 29 May 2014. The verification procedure, the temporary plan, the assessment of compliance with the technical, contractual, and legal requirements for the operation of games of chance, the approval of the investment plans, and the award of the final licenses thus took at least some nine months of intense activity after the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13.261\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 383-402.\n\n233.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants\u2019 criticism that the new licenses were granted without a public bidding process. ENJASA\u2019s license had also been granted in a direct manner and, unlike the new licenses, it was an exclusive license. The legal requirements to grant the new licenses were therefore met.262\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 505.\n\n234.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 criticism that the new licenses were awarded to third parties that had been categorized by ENREJA as previously existing operators of games of chance under arrangements with ENJASA for which authorizations by ENREJA were missing and that therefore were themselves in breach of Law No. 7020. The process following the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license regularized these illegal operations of games of chance in the Province of Salta. Unlike in the past, ENREJA was now able to supervise the actual gaming operators. Respondent also offered Claimants the possibility to continue operating Casino Salta. However, Respondent points out, Claimants refused this proposal.263\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 406.\n\n235.\n\nIn sum, Respondent submits, that no reasons other than breaches of the anti-money laundering regulations led to the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license.\n\n**2. Administrative Inquiries and Sanctions between 2007 and May 2013**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nRespondent also submits that the administrative inquiries undertaken, and sanctions imposed, by ENREJA between 2007 and May 2013 prior to the investigations that resulted in the revocation of ENJASA's license had revealed serious and repeated breaches by ENJASA of anti-money laundering and gaming regulations and were all justified. During this period ENREJA had conducted a number of investigations, which had found, inter alia, that ENJASA (i) repeatedly had breached anti-money laundering rules; (ii) had imposed unauthorized restrictions on bets; (iii) had operated slot machines without authorization; (iv) had amended betting limits without authorization; (v) had opened casinos without authorization; (vi) had breached rules concerning lottery games; and (vii) had amended prize limits without authorization.264 In total, twenty-one sanctions had to be imposed on ENJASA for breaches of the regulatory framework in place prior to the revocation of the License.265\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 252-355; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 120-269.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\n237.\n\nRespondent addresses the following investigations in more detail as follows:\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolution No. 31/08 (dated 10 March 2008), which sanctioned ENJASA for issuing checks in breach of anti-money laundering rules, ENREJA rejected ENJASA's defence that the action was time-barred, considering that the initiation of an administrative inquiry in 2005 had stopped the statute of limitations and that the commission of the same breach, which was discovered in another inquiry, prevented the infringement from becoming time-barred; the fine ENREJA imposed also complied with the proportionality principle.266\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolution No. 32/08 (dated 10 March 2008), which sanctioned ENJASA for the loss of the anti-money laundering book, for irregularities in recording payments, and for the irregular issuance of checks for the payment of prizes, ENREJA considered that a severe sanction was in place, inter alia in view of the delayed communication by ENJASA that the anti-money laundering book had been lost and considering ENJASA's record of prior infractions.267\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolution No. 232/08 (dated 18 November 2008), which sanctioned ENJASA for making irregular payments of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 in cash rather than by check at Casino Golden Dreams, ENREJA rejected ENJASA's defence that the law did not impose such an obligation, pointing out that ENJASA\u2019s interpretation of the law was completely at odds with its own prior statements and with the intended purpose of the law. The fine that was imposed took account of ENJASA\u2019s record of recidivism.268\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 244/08 (dated 25 November 2008), which sanctioned ENJASA for the unauthorized removal of gaming devices from Casino Salta and Casino Rosario de la Frontera, and for irregularities in the results of poker tournaments, ENREJA considered mitigating factors and issued a warning rather than imposing a fine.269\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 286/09 (dated 16 December 2009), which sanctioned ENJASA for amending betting limits in Casino Golden Dreams without prior authorization, ENJASA did not deny the facts under investigation, but alleged that the resolution initiating the administrative inquiry was null and void because of certain formal errors; ENREJA rejected ENJASA\u2019s defence and imposed a reduced fine, taking into consideration inter alia that ENJASA had no previous record for this particular type of infraction.270\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 39/10 (dated 9 March 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for holding an unauthorized poker tournament, ENREJA rejected ENJASA\u2019s arguments that the breach was an excusable error that was unintentionally committed by an employee of the casino; for ENREJA, the breach was caused by a dysfunctional internal organization and it warned ENJASA that such breaches could give rise to the termination of the License; the fine ENREJA imposed on ENJASA took into consideration that ENJASA had no previous records of this particular type of breach.271\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 46/10 (dated 16 March 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for breaching anti-money laundering rules by making irregular payments in Casino Golden Dreams of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 in cash rather than by check, and which was confirmed by Resolution No. 106/10 (dated 3 May 2010), ENREJA rejected ENJASA\u2019s defence that the action was time- barred and that no obligation existed to pay prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 by check; ENREJA also took into consideration ENJASA's history of recidivism and imposed a fine.272\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolution No. 104/10 (dated 3 May 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for paying prizes in Casino Golden Dreams in excess of ARS 40,000 without properly recording them; ENJASA acknowledged the infringement, but invoked material errors of employees of the casino, who had not reported the matter to the authorities, as an excuse; for ENREJA, the responsibility for the breach rested solely with the operator and it imposed the maximum fine of ARS 300,000 (USD 77,160), taking into consideration the four prior administrative inquiries for similar breaches; ENREJA also warned ENJASA about \"the effects that new breaches could have on the legal framework of the license\" and admonished that, in case of new breaches, ENJASA could lose its License under Article 6 of Decree No. 3616/99.273\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 128/10,274 129/10,275 and 130/10276 (all dated 18 May 2010) and Resolutions Nos. 151/10,277 1 52/10,278 and 153/10279 (all dated 7 June 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for irregularities in the operation of slot machines, ENREJA discovered, following inspections carried out between 2009 and 2010, that ENJASA had operated unauthorized slot machines and machines with betting amounts and prizes that differed from the ones approved by ENREJA; ENREJA rejected ENJASA's excuse that these breaches merely consisted of minor clerical errors and sanctioned ENJASA with partial and temporary suspensions of the License.280\n\n- In ENREJA's Resolution No. 161/10 (dated 15 June 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for paying prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 in cash, and for failing to identify the winners of a poker tournament in Casino Salta, ENREJA imposed a fine, taking into consideration ENJASA\u2019s recidivism; ENREJA rejected ENJASA\u2019s request for reconsideration which alleged that too much time had lapsed between the breaches and the initiation of the administrative inquiry and that prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 did not have to be paid by check.281\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 200/10 (dated 27 July 2010), which sanctioned ENJASA for opening a casino in the town of Metan without authorization, ENREJA informed ENJASA that it could revoke its License, but, as it felt that ENJASA had not acted with malice or in bad faith, only a fine was imposed under the condition that ENJASA would cure the breaches within 60 days.282\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 178/12 (dated 10 July 2012), which sanctioned ENJASA for the use of the wrong number of balls in a lottery drawing, erroneous publications of results, and other irregularities in lottery games, ENREJA considered these breaches to be \"very serious\" as they would \"hinder and adversely affect the transparency that must be maintained at all times, especially when the operation was granted by means of a State permit;\"283 ENREJA considered that ENJASA, while in good faith, had acted carelessly, negligently, and imprudently, imposing, Respondent submits, an appropriate fine, considering the number of breaches and their seriousness.284\n\n- In ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 161/13 (dated 28 May 2013), which sanctioned ENJASA for modifying prize limits without requesting authorization and for operating unauthorized jackpots in Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta, ENREJA imposed the maximum fines of ARS 200,000 and 500,000, respectively, taking into consideration ENJASA\u2019s history of recidivism as demonstrated by similar breaches sanctioned in Resolutions Nos. 286/09, 128/09, 129/10, and 200/10.285\n\nExhibit C-150.

ENREJA acted within the scope of its powers, took action in due time, and imposed sanctions that were proportionate to the seriousness of the breach and that gradually increased in view of ENJASA's recidivism and lack of organization.291\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 273-274.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 363-375; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 169, 273-284.\n\n241.\n\nRespondent also stresses that, contrary to Claimants' arguments, the Acta Acuerdo did not acknowledge that ENJASA had not committed any breaches of the regulatory framework in place. The second paragraph of the Acta Acuerdo merely acknowledged that (i) ENJASA and its controlling shareholder, L&E, had performed the capital increase and their investment in tourism, and (ii) there had been no breaches of the terms of ENJASA\u2019s Stock Purchase Agreement.292 The terms of the Acta Acuerdo, Respondent submits, are clear and restrictive. It contained no statement on any other type of breaches, let alone breaches after the Acta Acuerdo had been signed on 20 April 2008.293\n\nMemorandum of Agreement between UNIREN and ENJASA (7 May 2008) Second Item (Exhibit C-131); Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 42.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 182, footnote 204; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 41-45.\n\n**3. The Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License Constituted a Regular Exercise of ENREJA\u2019s Powers**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nRespondent further submits that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license did not, as submitted by Claimants, constitute an abuse of ENREJA\u2019s supervisory powers. On the contrary, in Respondent\u2019s view, the revocation of the License had taken place as part of the regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s powers. The charges brought against ENJASA in the three investigations that lead to the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13 were all well-founded. The sanction imposed on ENJASA, that is, the revocation of its License, was justified and proportionate and did not violate any due process rights.\n\n***a) Charges Underlying Resolution No. 240/13***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nRespondent submits that ENREJA\u2019s conclusions in Resolution No. 240/13, which lead to the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, were derived from investigations into three sets of incidents that all qualified as serious breaches of the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta. In drawing its conclusions, ENREJA accurately had investigated the factual record and correctly had applied the regulatory framework in place. The serious breaches ENREJA found were an appropriate basis for revoking ENJASA\u2019s license.\n\n**(1) Allegations in Resolution No. 380/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 380/12, in which ENREJA had charged ENJASA with having breached anti-money laundering rules in its lottery operations and by making a payment in respect of a prize won in a slot machine game, Respondent observes that Claimants do not dispute the facts giving rise to the breaches identified by ENREJA in Resolution No. 380/12; they merely attempt to evade their consequences by alleging that the breaches were due to unintentional human errors by those in charge of the respective games of chance. Respondent submits that these excuses are inadmissible.294 A purported human error by the lottery agent would not justify the late registration and payment of an expired prize; nor would the submission of the winning ticket together with Claimants' Reply on the Merits in the present proceeding cure ENJASA's failure to submit the ticket to ENREJA at the time of the investigation.295\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 355-358.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 350-354.\n\n**(2) Allegations in Resolution No. 381/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 381/12, which concerned breaches of anti-money laundering rules in live games, Respondent observes that spread sheets and records that ENJASA kept internally to control payments to gamblers at gaming tables at Casino Salta and Casino Golden Dreams revealed that, in the audited period, not fewer than 52 payments exceeding ARS 10,000 had been made for prizes won at live gaming tables. These payments had been made in cash or by means of \"internal checks\"; in addition, the required identification of the winners in the anti-money laundering book was insufficient, even though ENJASA, Respondent argues, had specific and detailed knowledge of the players' winnings and of the amounts paid thanks to the internal records they kept. According to Respondent, Claimants' contention that these records were kept only for statistical purposes lacks credibility. In other words, ENJASA, which held the records, could easily have complied with the legal requirements to make the proper registrations of the payments and of the identity of the players in the anti-money laundering book. However, Respondent submits, ENJASA totally disregarded the anti-money laundering rules in the instances underlying the investigation.296 There was no excuse for ENJASA's failing to record payments in excess of ARS 10,000 in the anti-money laundering book.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 420-432; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 329-338; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 179.\n\n246.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants' interpretation of the regulatory framework in place. For Respondent, it is beyond question that, since 1 May 2012, prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 had to be paid by non-transferable check. At this point, Resolution No. 26/00 was superseded by ENREJA's Resolution No. 90/12, which made explicit the obligations under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 of the licensee to (i) pay all prizes exceeding ARS 10,000 by check or wire transfer to foreign accounts; (ii) keep records of such payments and any other relevant information about clients where grounds to suspect money laundering existed; and (iii) appoint a person who is responsible for the functions and obligations established by regulations for games of chance. In addition, Resolution No. 90/12 expanded the term for the obligation to keep and preserve documents from 2 to 10 years and set new requirements for the payment of prizes by check for amounts of up to ARS 50,000.297\n\nResolution 90/12 of 24 April 2012, applicable on 1 May 2012 (Art. 7); Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 237.\n\n247.\n\nHowever, Respondent submits that already before the enactment of Resolution No. 90/12, ENREJA considered that ENJASA had an obligation to pay all prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 by check or wire transfer and to identify the individuals to whom such prizes were paid. Although the legislative texts did not state so expressly, in Respondent\u2019s view, Article 5 of Law No. 7020 and ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 26/00 already required that prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 had to be paid by non-transferable check.298 Article 5 of Law No. 7020 imposed certain anti-money laundering measures on ENJASA whenever a quantitative, objective criterion - i.e., payment of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 - or a qualitative criterion - i.e., the existence of \"a suspicious transaction\" - existed. In the first case, the identity of the beneficiary had to be registered and the check had to be non-transferrable; in the second case, the transaction needed to be reported. For Respondent, a comprehensive and harmonious interpretation of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, which respects its goal and purpose, thus required the licensee to pay all prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 by check or wire transfer.299 Otherwise, it would simply be sufficient for the licensee to decide not to pay prizes by check or wire transfer to be exempt from the obligation to identify individuals, although such payment would be a suspicious transaction. Such an interpretation would, however, go against the very purpose of Law No. 7020.300\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 140.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 148-152.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 173-175, 206-208, 213.\n\n248.\n\nRespondent also points out that ENREJA had clarified this consequence of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 vis-\u00e0-vis ENJASA and had indicated to ENJASA, on different occasions, how payments to customers needed to be recorded.301 Thus, ENREJA had insisted, in several of its earlier resolutions addressed to ENJASA, that payments over ARS 10,000 had to be made by check and demanded compliance with this requirement.302 In addition, before Resolution No. 90/12 explicitly required to make payments of prizes above ARS 10,000 by check, ENJASA had expressly acknowledged that Article 5 of Law No. 7020 obliged it to do so.303 ENJASA has also never challenged ENREJA's point of view, nor questioned the fines imposed because of violations of that requirement.304\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 177, 279-280.\n\nFor example, Resolution No. 32/08 (11 March 2008) (Exhibit C-151); Resolution No. 232/08 (18 November 2008) (Exhibit C-155); Resolution No. 104/10 (3 May 2010) (Exhibit C-152); Resolution No. 106/10 (3 May 2010) (Exhibit C-156); Resolution No. 161/10 (15 June 2010) (Exhibit C-157).\n\nENJASA's letter of 30 August 2005 (Exhibit ARA-193); ENJASA's letter of 10 September 2005 (Exhibit ARA-195); Request for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 46/10 (Exhibit ARA-239); Request for Reconsideration against Resolution No. 104/10 (Exhibit ARA-165); Respondent Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 157-160; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 279.\n\nRespondent Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 161-164.\n\n249.\n\nIn respect of the cash payments made in September 2011 to two customers in Casino Salta, Respondent argues that such payments by ENJASA to customers, one of which had not even played, encouraged players to play with third-party funds and, by prolongation, gave rise to money laundering. Such payments did therefore not comply with the anti-money laundering regulations either.305\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 341-346.\n\n250.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants' argument that Article 49 of Law No. 7020 time-barred ENREJA's conduct because the administrative inquiry in question had started more than one year after the facts had occurred. Respondent submits that the one-year statute of limitations established by Article 49 of Law No. 7020 does not apply to breaches of Article 5. Instead, according to Respondent, the five-year time-bar in Articles 62 and 67 of the Criminal Code applied to sanctions taken on the basis of Article 13 of Law No. 7020. However, regardless of whether a one-year or a five-year statute of limitations applied, the repeated breaches by ENJASA of anti-money laundering rules, as found in ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 31/08, 46/10, and 161/10, prevented the statute of limitations from expiring.306 Due to ENJASA's successive failures to record prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 in violation of anti-money laundering rules, no statute of limitation would apply to the breaches identified by ENREJA in Resolution No. 381/12.\n\nRespondent' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 25, 188-194.\n\n**(3) Allegations in Resolution No. 384/12**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn respect of the charges in Resolution No. 384/12 that ENJASA had hired operators without ENREJA's authorization contrary to Article 5 of Law No. 7020, Respondent observes that Decree No. 2126/98 had granted ENJASA an exclusive license for the operation of games of chance in the Province of Salta. The only exceptions to this exclusivity were licenses granted by BPAS in 1999 to two other operators for Casino de las Nubes and Casino Central, which expired in 2003,307 and the possibility that non- profit organizations, authorized by ENREJA, could operate bingos and raffles.308 Claimants' allegation that some of the operators of games of chance had been authorized by BPAS before ENJASA acquired its License and were entitled to continue operating thereafter was therefore incorrect. Except for the two licenses explicitly maintained by BPAS for Casino de las Nubes and Casino Central, all licenses granted by BPAS before 1998 were terminated once ENJASA had been granted its exclusive license.309\n\nResolution No. 411/99 of 1 September 1999 (Exhibit RA-002).\n\nResolution No. 3616/99, Annex I, Art. 1.1.1. (Exhibit RA-010).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 308-309.\n\n252.\n\nRespondent further rebuts Claimants' allegation that ENREJA was fully aware of the existence of third-party operators of slot machines and had accepted their involvement. For instance, any payments of the canon fee for the operation of games of chance that were made by third parties were actually made on ENJASA's behalf and ENREJA was therefore unaware of the true origin of such payments.310\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 304-307.\n\n***b) The Revocation of ENJASA\u2019s License Was Justified and Proportionate***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nRespondent stresses that the revocation of ENJASA's license by Resolution No. 240/13 was fully justified. In terms of competence, ENREJA had the disciplinary power to issue the revocation on the basis of Article 13 of Law No. 7020. Article 13, Respondent submits, authorized ENREJA to sanction ENJASA for violations or breaches of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, Resolutions Nos. 26/00 and 90/12, and of the license agreement, which contained the obligation to comply with Law No. 7020.311 One of the sanctions mentioned expressly in that provision - although the most severe one - is the revocation of a license. Article 13 also requires that the sanction is proportionate to the violation committed. Respondent submits that, in the present instance, the revocation of the License was a just, fair, and proportionate sanction.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 288-295.\n\n254.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants incorrectly allege that Article 13 was superseded in 2001 by the enactment of Law No. 7133, which amended Law No. 7020 and introduced a new provision on sanctions into Law No. 7020, namely Article 41. It is true that Article 41 did not provide for the revocation of a license as a possible sanction, but only provided for fines, disqualification, seizure, and/or closure of gaming locations.312 Claimants, however, incorrectly submit, Respondent argues, that Article 13 was abolished and that ENREJA thus could only issue sanctions on the basis of Article 41 of Law No. 7020. ENREJA could, therefore, still revoke ENJASA\u2019s license on the basis of Article 13.313\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 15-16.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 288-295.\n\n255.\n\nRespondent submits that Law No. 7133 did not replace Article 13 with Article 41. Rather, Law No. 7020 now has two different provisions that allow for the imposition of sanctions: one for violations or breaches of gaming regulations and the license agreement, which are subject to the sanctions laid down in Article 13, and one for administrative infractions which can be sanctioned on the basis of Article 41. For Respondent, the fact that Article 13 of Law No. 7020 was reproduced in its entirety in the Official Bulletin of the Province of Salta when the full text of Law No. 7020, as amended by Law No. 7133, was published, confirms the continued validity of Article 13.314\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 28-30, 293; Respondent Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 41-46.\n\n256.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submits that Law No. 7020, including its Article 13, applies as a mandatory regulation of the gaming sector in the Province of Salta. Furthermore, ENJASA\u2019s license agreement also confirms that Law No. 7020, including its Article 13, apply in relation to ENJASA. Contrary to Claimants\u2019 argument, the license agreement does not exclude the application of Article 13; on the contrary, it confirms the validity of Article 13 and its application to the relationship between ENREJA and ENJASA.315\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 25-27, 290-292; Respondent Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 35-55.\n\n257.\n\nAs for the proportionality of the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, in Respondent\u2019s view, Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12 amply established ENJASA\u2019s manifold breaches of anti-money laundering regulations. Moreover, before 2012, ENJASA had committed many other serious breaches of anti-money laundering regulations. Thus, Respondent submits, these previous breaches could, and arguably had to, be taken into consideration in devising the appropriate sanction.\n\n258.\n\nRespondent further submits that anti-money laundering regulations concern the preservation of the social and financial order. A breach of these regulations, in its view, affects the public interest, which ENREJA had to protect. The importance of the regulations, coupled with the consideration that the sanctions previously imposed on ENJASA during the term of the License did not have a deterrent effect on ENJASA, made it impossible not to impose the revocation of the License as a sanction.316\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 3.\n\n259.\n\nRespondent also submits that, in the past, ENREJA had applied sanctions gradually and progressively from warnings, over fines, to temporarily suspending certain local operations. The following overview indicates this development:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 104/07 (C-240) | Irregularities in slot machines | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 031/08 (C-150) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 032/08 (C-151) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 232/08 (C-155) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 286/09 (C-153) | Unauthorized modification of betting chart | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 039/10 (C-164) | Unauthorized implementation of a Jackpot | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 106/10 (C-156) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 104/10 (C-152) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 161/10 (C-157) | Violation of anti-money laundering regulations | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 200/10 (C-165) | Unauthorized opening of a casino | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 178/12 (C-166) | *Tombola* lottery game irregularities | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 161/13 (C-154) | Modification of highest prize at poker tables and unauthorized implementation of a Jackpot | Fine |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 128/10 (C-158) | Irregularities in slot machines | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 129/10 (C-159) | Modification of the approved betting chart | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 130/10 (C-160) | Modification of the approved betting chart | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 151/10 (C-161) | Irregularities in slot machines | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 152/10 (C-162) | Irregularities in slot machines | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 153/10 (C-163) | Irregularities in slot machines | Suspension of the License |\n| ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13 (C-031) | Breach of anti-money laundering regulations as a consequence of failure to record lottery prize payments | Revocation of the License |\n\n260.\n\nRespondent also points out that, since 2010, ENREJA had substantially increased the amount of fines due to ENJASA's recidivism, as required by Article 46 of Law No. 7020.317 The amount of fines, as submitted by Respondent, developed as follows:\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\n261.\n\nThe increasing intensity of the sanctions notwithstanding, Respondent submits, ENJASA continued to breach the regulatory framework in place, as the breaches identified in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12 show. ENREJA had also repeatedly warned ENJASA that it had the power to revoke the License in the event of further breaches or violations of the gaming regulations in place.318 Under these circumstances, Respondent concludes, the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license to operate games of chance in Salta remained the only possible sanction for ENREJA.\n\nSee Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23 (referring to Resolution No. 39/10 (9 March 2010) (Exhibit C-164); Resolution No. 104/10 (30 May 2010) (Exhibit C-152); Resolution No. 107/10 (3 May 2010) (Exhibit ARA-231); Resolution No. 128/10 (20 April 2010) (Exhibit C-158; Resolution No. 161/10 (15 June 2010) (Exhibit C-157)).\n\n***c) Respect of ENJASA's Due Process Rights***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nRespondent also submits that ENJASA\u2019s due process rights and its right of defence were at all times respected. Respondent points out that ENREJA had repeatedly warned ENJASA that it had the power to revoke the License in the event of breach or violation of the anti-money laundering regulations.319 Resolution No. 240/13 also contained a detailed explanation of the reasons and grounds leading to the revocation of the License. Each administrative file referred to in Resolution No. 240/13 was processed separately and maintained its autonomy. Moreover, each of these files, individually considered, warranted the revocation of the License.320\n\nIbid. See also Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 457-460; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 367-368.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 455-456; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 365-366.\n\n263.\n\nRespondent further submits that, in all administrative inquiries, ENJASA was informed of the charges on which it was being investigated and the evidence relied upon. Furthermore, ENJASA was granted sufficient time to file a defence and to submit the appropriate evidence. It could also always access the files - which it did - without any restrictions from ENREJA.321\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 449-456, 461-465; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 359-364.\n\n264.\n\nFinally, Respondent points out, ENREJA considered the arguments raised in ENJASA\u2019s answers, but concluded that these answers did not affect the sanction imposed. ENJASA was entitled to challenge ENREJA\u2019s decisions with ample room for submitting arguments and evidence.\n\n265.\n\nRespondent also points out that ENJASA submitted a recourse for reconsideration of Resolution No. 240/13 on 28 August 2013. ENREJA addressed this Recourse and confirmed the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license through Resolution No. 315/13 on 19 November 2013. In this context, Respondent refers to her expert, Prof. Marcer, who confirmed that ENREJA \"analysed and addressed all the arguments stated in the appeal for review, and denied the appeal.\"322 ENJASA also filed a complaint with the Administrative Court of the Province of Salta on 2 February 2014,323 but failed to move the case forward until its complaint had to be withdrawn as a consequence of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction in the present proceeding. Consequently, ENJASA abandoned the claim and, with ENREJA's consent, withdrew the appeal.324\n\nMarcer I, para. 60.\n\nComplaint of 2 February 2014 (Exhibit C-221).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 466-477; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 369-378.\n\n266.\n\nAll of the above shows, Respondent submits, that due process and ENJASA's right of defence were at all times respected.\n\n**D. Respondent\u2019s Analysis of the Law**\n---------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the revocation of ENJASA's license, followed by the appointment of new operators and the transfer of ENJASA's operations and employees to new operators, was a lawful exercise of the host State's regulatory powers. It did not, Respondent submits, constitute a breach of either Articles 2(1) or 4 of the BIT.\n\n**1. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n268.\n\nRespondent contends that the law applicable to the dispute pursuant to the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is the law agreed by the Parties; such an agreement is contained in Article 8(6) of the BIT,325 which provides in the translation provided by Respondent:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute including its rules on conflict of laws, the provisions of this Agreement, and the terms of any specific agreement concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 506-508. Respondent's argument in her Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 411-412, is different, however. While in the Counter-Memorial, Respondent argues that Argentine law applies pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention as the law \"agreed by the parties\", in the Rejoinder Respondent suggests that Argentine law forms part of the applicable law as the law applicable \"in the absence of such agreement,\" which is consistent with the law applicable under the BIT. Both arguments lead to the inclusion of Argentine law as part of the applicable law, but the two approaches seem otherwise incompatible.\n\n269.\n\nAccording to this provision, Respondent submits, the applicable law in the present proceeding is (i) Argentine law; (ii) the BIT itself - which should not be interpreted in isolation from the remaining rules of international law;326 and (iii) the principles of international law on the subject.327\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 514\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 510; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 413.\n\n270.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 argument, Respondent submits that Argentine law is not merely part of the factual matrix of the dispute, but part of the applicable law.328 Amongst other things, Argentine law will \"determine the nature and scope of the investor\u2019s rights arising from its investment\"329 and \"is part of the law to be applied in order to determine whether or not the Treaty has been complied with.\"330 Argentine law would not be relied upon to justify a breach of international law, but has to be applied in accordance with the agreement of the Parties. In any event, in order to rely on Article 27 of the VCLT, Claimants would have to establish \"a clear and concrete conflict\" between Argentine law and international law, as they are both applicable to the dispute.331 In sum, Respondent submits, \"this Tribunal is required to harmoniously apply Argentine domestic law, the BIT and the relevant principles of international law, so that none of them precludes the application of the others.\"332\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 414-415.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 513; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 415-418, 420.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 517; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 419-420.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 511-512; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 419.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 515, 517; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 420.\n\n271.\n\nRespondent further points out that Claimants have accepted the regulatory authority of the Province of Salta over the gaming industry. In Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal has to consider whether the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s supervisory powers under Law No. 7020 or whether the revocation constituted an abuse of those powers.\n\n272.\n\nRespondent stresses that, as many arbitral tribunals have recognized, investment tribunals must exercise a large degree of deference vis-\u00e0-vis the determinations of local authorities. Respondent invokes, inter alia, the award in *Koch Minerals,* which stated that \"a tribunal cannot simply put itself in the position of the State and weigh the measure anew, particularly with hindsight.\"333 Similarly, the tribunal in *Crystallex* held that \"it is not for an investor-state tribunal to second-guess the substantive correctness of the reasons which an administration were to put forward in its decisions, or to question the importance assigned by the administration to certain policy objectives over others.\"334 For the tribunal in *SD Myers v Canada,* a \"tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision making,\"335 and the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v United States* did not consider it as its role \"to supplant its own judgment of underlying factual material and support for that of a qualified domestic agency.\"336\n\n*Koch Minerals S\u00e0rl and Koch Nitrogen International S\u00e0rl v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/19, Award (30 October 2017) para. 7.20 (Exhibit ALRA-305).\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v.

Breach of Article 4 of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nIn respect of Article 4 of the BIT, Respondent submits that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was a lawful exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory powers and therefore constituted neither an indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina, nor a direct expropriation of a relevant asset of ENJASA that would entitle Claimants to the payment of compensation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the BIT.\n\n***a) No Indirect Expropriation under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nAs for the claim for an indirect expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to show that the three cumulative requirements for an indirect expropriation have been met in this case, namely that (i) the contested measures interfere with the investor\u2019s property rights that qualify as investments; (ii) the interference be substantial; and (iii) the government measures that constitute the interference do not qualify as regulatory measures that have been adopted under the State\u2019s police power.340\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 522-523; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 430-431.\n\n277.\n\nRegarding the first two requirements, Respondent submits that Claimants\u2019 arguments to demonstrate substantial interference are \"false\".341 According to Respondent, no \"forced transfer\" of ENJASA\u2019s personnel, premises, or title to assets had occurred. Decree No. 3330/13 of 20 November 2013 did not transfer ENJASA\u2019s license to other operators, as the License had already been revoked by Resolution No. 240/13 of 13 August 2013. The Government of the Province of Salta only granted, at first, provisional permits for new operators342 and eventually issued new licenses to them in order to keep the gaming business going.343 For its part, Decree No. 3330/13 sought to preserve jobs by obliging the permit holders to absorb the employees leaving ENJASA or other operators that also stopped operating games of chance. There was no \"forced transfer\" of ENJASA\u2019s premises or assets. The Temporary Plan, which was approved by Decree No. 3330/13, required the new operators to prove that their facilities were authorized and that they had the devices to operate games of chance. Respondent points out that Claimants\u2019 own valuation experts confirmed that there was no \"forced transfer\" of ENJASA\u2019s premises or assets, but that some were sold voluntarily to the new operators and resulted in an economic benefit for ENJASA.344\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 432.\n\nDecree 3330/13 of 20 November 2013, Art. 2 (Exhibit C-033).\n\nDecree No. 1502/14 of 29 May 2014 (Exhibit C-176).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 539-545; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 433-437.\n\n278.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants do not contend that, after the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, they were prevented from participating in the process to obtain temporary operating permits and eventually licenses; Claimants recognize that they were offered to continue operating Casino Salta, but Claimants did not accept this offer.345\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 406.\n\n279.\n\nIn addition, after the revocation of the License, ENJASA continued operating the Sheraton Hotel in Salta until it was sold for a real estate value of USD 4.2 million; also, the goodwill of the hotel was sold later on.346 Respondent contends that the sale of the hotel \"proves that there was a purchaser interested in the operation of the hotel;\"347 also the hotel to this day continues operating. Respondent moreover stresses that Claimants have not submitted evidence to substantiate their allegation that the hotel only had limited value for them. The sale of the hotel and of its goodwill refutes this allegation.348\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 438; Dapena II, para. 14; Official Gazette of the Province of Salta of 5 December 2016, p. 16 (Exhibit ARA-060).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 438.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 524-528; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 438-440.\n\n280.\n\nAs for the third requirement for an indirect expropriation, Respondent contends that a distinction must be made between \"compensable expropriation\" and \"non-compensable regulation.\" In order to distinguish between the two, most tribunals take into account the purpose of the measure taken by the State, and recognize the State's power to restrict private property rights without compensation through regulatory measures that are adopted in good faith, in accordance with due process, and in pursuit of a legitimate purpose.349 Respondent notes that Claimants admit the existence of the concept of non-compensable regulation, although they incorrectly contend that that concept does not apply to the facts of this case because its requirements are not met.350\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 529-530.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 531-532.\n\n281.\n\nConcerning a State's regulatory powers, Respondent refers to awards that have found that it is not the function of an investment tribunal to second-guess the policies that a State may deem useful or necessary for the public good, and that \"the standard of review of a State's conduct to be undertaken by an international tribunal includes a significant measure of deference towards the State making the impugned measure.\"351 Respondent submits that the public purpose of ENREJA's measures to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering rules, which were themselves in line with international standards, cannot be denied.352\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 422-443.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 534-536; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 444.\n\n282.\n\nRespondent further contends that, far from abusing its powers, ENREJA had warned ENJASA in the past that it could lose its License if it continued breaking the rules.353 The revocation of ENJASA's license was a measure adopted within ENREJA's powers, it was reasonable and proportionate in view of ENJASA's serious and repeated breaches. It was adopted following a long list of lesser sanctions and warnings.354 Respondent also argues that due process was respected at all times, and ENJASA was granted extensions for consulting records, submitting answers, and offering evidence.355\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 538; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 448.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 533; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 447, 449.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 538.\n\n283.\n\nFinally, Respondent refers to the principle recognized in international law that no claim can be brought under international law where an agreement has been revoked according to its terms. Respondent contends that this was the case here, considering that ENJASA\u2019s license had been revoked in accordance with its express provisions and the applicable regulatory framework.356\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 546.\n\n***b) No Direct Expropriation under Article 4(3) of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimants are not entitled to compensation or damages under Article 4(3) of the BIT. In this context, Respondent contends that Article 4(3) of the BIT does not protect ENJASA\u2019s license. Respondent invokes two reasons for this. First, the License does not qualify as a \"financial asset\" *(\"activos fmancieros\"),* which is the term used by the authentic Spanish version of Article 4(3) of the BIT. This term is more restrictive than the term used by the German version of the same provision *(\"Vermogenswerte\"),* which would translate as *\"activos\"* in Spanish or \"assets\" in English. According to Respondent, interpreting Article 4(3) of the BIT by reference to the Spanish version should be preferred over any broader interpretation based on the German version of the BIT because the Spanish version represents \"the minimum point of agreement between the Parties to the Treaty\"357 and therefore constitutes the meaning which best reconciles the two texts, as required by Article 33(4) VCLT. Second, Respondent submits, that even if Article 4(3) of the BIT were interpreted to apply to \"assets\" in general, and not just to \"financial assets\", its scope of protection would remain limited to the assets of L&E, the company Claimants are immediate shareholders of; it could not extend to the assets of ENJASA in which Claimants are only indirect shareholders.358\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 427.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 424-429.\n\n**3. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nIn respect of Article 2(1) of the BIT, Respondent submits that the revocation of ENJASA's license was lawful under domestic law and did not breach any of the rights Claimants could derive from the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n***a) The Scope of Fair and Equitable Treatment under the BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nRespondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard referred to in Article 2(1) of the BIT forms part of customary international law; its content therefore will be determined by its customary law origin.359 By being included in an investment treaty without further specification, fair and equitable treatment does not become an autonomous standard, but continues to reflect the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.

United States.**362* According to Respondent, \"[e]ven though that standard reflects the evolution of customary international law, the threshold for finding a violation of the standard still remains high,\"363 and the acts which have been described as amounting to a violation of the standard include \"willful neglect of duty,\" \"subjective bad faith,\" \"manifest failure of natural justice in juridical proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process,\" and \"gross denial of justice or manifest arbitrariness.\"364\n\n*LFH Neer and Pauline Neer (USA) v United Mexican States*, Decision (15 October 1926) IV UNRIAA 60 *et seq.* (Exhibit ALRA-112), referred to in Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 557.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

In *Genin v Estonia,* for instance, it was decided that \"[a]cts that would violate this minimum standard would include acts showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith*.*\"372\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 565 (quoting *Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award (25 June 2001) para. 367 (Exhibit ALRA-114)).\n\n292.\n\nFor Respondent, the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in the BIT is not aimed at providing a general and absolute guarantee of legal stability or an insurance policy that would preclude the revocation of ENJASA's license when the conditions for this License have not been respected.373\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 568.\n\n293.\n\nFor Respondent, the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in the BIT also does not protect the expectations of investors. The award in *Tecmed v Mexico,* which relied on the expectations of the investor as the source of the obligations incumbent upon the host State, was much criticized, Respondent argues.374 At the very least, as was elaborated in *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* a balance would need to be struck between the expectations of foreign investors and the legitimate right of the host State to regulate matters in the public interest.375\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 570-571 (referring to *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

In particular, Respondent contends that (i) the revocation of ENJASA's license was not arbitrary; (ii) due process was observed in the proceeding that led to the revocation; (iii) there was no breach of legitimate expectations; and (iv) there was no harassment or coercion.379\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 557; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 452-453, 465.\n\n296.\n\nRegarding the allegation that the License was revoked in an arbitrary manner, Respondent submits that the revocation was lawful and reasonable, was decided by ENREJA within its powers as granted by law, following investigations and inquiries already in progress in relation to previous breaches or infractions, and was based on three serious breaches, namely the irregular hiring of other gaming operators, the lack of identification of customers of live games and the payment of prizes in cash, and the failure to identify players of the lottery and to register prices. Given the seriousness and repeated nature of the breaches, and having already imposed numerous, progressively increasing sanctions for previous breaches, \"the only valid solution,\" Respondent submits, was the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license.380\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 577-579; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 476-485.\n\n297.\n\nRespondent also submits that the fact that the government subsequently granted a license to the local business partners with whom ENJASA had subcontracted without proper authorization or knowledge by ENREJA was irrelevant for determining whether ENREJA had breached the regulatory framework by revoking ENJASA\u2019s license.381\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 580-582.\n\n298.\n\nRegarding the allegation of a lack of due process in the proceedings leading to the revocation, Respondent contends that ENJASA\u2019s arguments are contradictory and untrue. According to Respondent, due process and ENJASA\u2019s right of defense were observed both during the revocation proceeding as well as in the administrative inquiries filed prior to the revocation of the License. Also, sanctions were applied gradually, reasonably, and proportionately, considering both the seriousness and the frequency of the breaches. In particular, the revocation of the License followed several breaches by ENJASA that were recorded in resolutions and notified to Claimants, and it was based on substantial grounds. ENJASA was notified of the charges against it through Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12. It was given an opportunity to respond and submit evidence, and had deadlines extended for this purpose on many occasions. ENJASA also had access to the relevant files at all times. Despite numerous opportunities, the breaches by ENJASA continued and became increasingly serious and frequent. ENREJA had also warned ENJASA of the potential consequences, including in particular of the possibility that ENJASA might lose its License.382 ENJASA had therefore been able to exercise its right of defense in all phases of the administrative proceedings that concerned the revocation of its license.383\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 583-590; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 468-475.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 248.\n\n299.\n\nAs regards Claimants' expectations, Respondent reiterates that these are not protected under the BIT. However, even if the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT was to include the protection of legitimate expectations, it would still not cover Claimants' particular expectations, which were not legitimate.384 Respondent contends that, when Claimants acquired their indirect shareholding in ENJASA, they had been (or should have been) aware of the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta and had themselves accepted the different arrangements contained in the License. ENREJA had the authority to impose a range of sanctions, including the revocation of the License, in case of breach of Law No. 7020, of the License Agreement, or of other applicable regulations. ENJASA could not expect that ENREJA would not use its regulatory and sanctioning powers when monitoring whether games of chance operated in full compliance with the law.385 ENJASA could also not expect to keep the License despite breaches of the legal framework that applied to the License, particularly after having been sanctioned and warned that further breaches could lead to the loss of the License.386\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 492.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 591-597; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 493-496.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 491.\n\n300.\n\nConcerning Claimants' allegation of harassment by ENREJA through its supervisory and monitoring activities, Respondent contends that ENREJA merely applied the law and the provisions of ENJASA's license, and that Claimants could not have expected otherwise. In particular, the online monitoring system implemented in 2008 improved the supervision of slot machines as well as of transmission systems and thus contributed towards transparency; it could therefore not be considered as harassing conduct.387\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 598-600; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 486-487.\n\n301.\n\nWith regard to the reasonableness and proportionality of the revocation of ENJASA's license, Respondent refers to the concept of proportionality as it exists in Argentine law, where \"a measure will be proportionate if it pursues a legitimate aim and is appropriate to that end.\"388 For Respondent, the prevention of money laundering is a legitimate aim and the revocation of ENJASA's license was appropriate to prevent money laundering practices.389 The regulatory requirements imposed were also reasonable. For instance, it was reasonable to require registration of payments above ARS 10,000 (an amount three times the minimum monthly wage and more than one average monthly wage in the private sector). After all, Respondent states, in the bigger slot machine halls, prices above ARS 10,000 were paid on average once or twice a week and in the smaller slot machine halls, on average once a month, while for lottery games, prizes over ARS 10,000 were only won two or three times a week.390\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 252.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 253 and 257.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 188 and Day 4, p. 82; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 259. The Tribunal notes, however, that the transcript does not exactly support these numbers. It states that, for slot machines, much depends on the frequency and that sometimes ten prizes above ARS 10,000 may be won on one day. Moreover, the evidence does not specify whether the prizes above ARS 10,000 were won per lottery game or for all lottery games together. Finally, no numbers were given for table games, where probably the highest prizes can be won.\n\n302.\n\nRespondent further submits that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license had no hidden purpose that could undermine its legitimacy.391 Respondent also observes that the revocation did not exclude Claimants from the gaming sector. In fact, after the revocation, Claimants were offered to continue operating games of chance in the Province of Salta, but refused to accept that offer.392\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 254.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 255-256.\n\n303.\n\nRespondent further observes that the revocation of the License was proportionate in view of ENJASA\u2019s recidivism and reluctance to comply with the regulatory framework in place in spite of sanctions imposed on prior occasions. Besides, no appropriate, but less intrusive sanctions were available to achieve the same purpose. A measure, such as a six-month or one-year suspension of ENJASA\u2019s license, would have affected other interests protected by Law No. 7020, which provides that \"in order to rank the sanction, [ENREJA] shall take into account ... the damage caused to the Provincial State and/or private persons.\"393 Suspending ENJASA\u2019s license for six months or a year would have left workers in the sector unemployed and would have deprived the Province of Salta of fiscal resources aimed at funding social and educational policies.394\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 210.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 260.\n\n304.\n\nRespondent finally observes with regard to proportionality, that the Province of Salta took Claimants\u2019 interests into consideration and revoked only ENJASA\u2019s exclusive license for the operation of games of chance, while offering Claimants to continue operating casinos and leaving the operation of the five-star hotel unaffected.395\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 261.\n\n**VI.** **T****he** **T****ribunal****\u2019****s** **A****nalysis of** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **L****iability**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nAs becomes clear from the Parties\u2019 arguments on the facts of the case and their legal assessment, the Tribunal is called to determine whether conduct of the authorities of the Province of Salta, which is attributable under international law to Respondent pursuant to Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles, resulted in a breach of the BIT, specifically its Articles 2(1) and 4. The measures Claimants alleged to breach the BIT consist of the administrative proceedings that resulted in the revocation of ENJASA's exclusive license through Resolution No. 240/13 and its confirmation in Resolution No. 315/13 and the subsequent transfer of ENJASA's operations to third operators. Prior conduct of the authorities in the Province of Salta is not claimed independently to have breached the BIT, but rather is invoked as background in support of Claimants' submission that there was a long-term plan to oust ENJASA of its operation in Salta's gaming sector.\n\n306.\n\nFunctionally, the Tribunal is therefore put by the Parties into a role akin to that of an administrative court which is asked by an affected private actor to review the legality of actions by the executive branch of government. However, as the Tribunal will specify in a first step, the legal standard to determine the legality of that conduct does not consist of domestic (administrative) law, but of the standards of treatment contained in the BIT. The Tribunal, therefore, is not asked by the Parties to make a binding determination under domestic law of the legality of the conduct of Respondent, respectively the authorities in the Province of Salta, as would be the case for a domestic court seized of the underlying dispute, but is limited to assessing the legality of that conduct under international law. The Tribunal, in other words, has to exercise a form of internationalized judicial review of administrative action.396\n\nTo clarify, the Tribunal is not called on to decide on any claim that ENJASA may have, or have had, vis-\u00e0-vis the authorities in the Province of Salta or the Argentine Republic, nor is it called on to decide on any claims between the Parties to the present proceeding that may arise out of the breach of legal obligations other than the BIT. In particular, the Tribunal does not decide on, or even \"resurrect\", any \"contract claims\" that may exist or have existed between Claimants and/or ENJASA and the authorities in the Province of Salta, as argued by the Dissent, paras. 3-5, 159.\n\n307..\n\nThis notwithstanding, in determining the legality of Respondent's conduct under international law, the Tribunal will have to address several questions of domestic law as incidental questions or preliminary matters. Article 8(6) of the BIT clarifies that the Tribunal is empowered to do so. However, rather than reviewing questions of domestic law *de novo,* as would presumably be the proper course for a court in the host State sought of the underlying dispute, and thereby replacing domestic courts in their exercise of domestic judicial review, the Tribunal will determine any such question of domestic law, as is appropriate for an international adjudicatory body in its position, by exercising a certain degree of deference. After all, the Tribunal\u2019s function in the present proceeding is not to replace domestic courts in exercising domestic judicial review, but to exercise a form of internationalized judicial review. However, exercising deference in the interpretation of domestic law and in the review of domestic legality of the host State\u2019s conduct, does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s task to assess the legality of that conduct under international law and determine whether it has given rise to breaches of the BIT.397\n\nFor the Dissent (i.a. paras. 91, 395), Article 8(6) of the BIT requires the Tribunal to apply Argentine law to the dispute and, under the laws of the Province of Salta, the revocation of the License was a lawful sanction, taken by ENREJA in the regular exercise of its regulatory and supervisory powers. The Tribunal does not deny that ENREJA was entitled to exercise these regulatory powers as a matter of international law, but found that, for the reasons explained in the Award, the revocation of ENJASA's license did not qualify as a regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal will then, in a second step, address the alleged breaches of the BIT. These encompass breach of the rules on expropriation contained in Article 4 of the BIT and of the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in Article 2(1) of the BIT. In interpreting the BIT, the Tribunal applies the rules on treaty interpretation laid down in the VCLT, which is binding upon both the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Austria.398 These rules - and the interpretive canons flowing from them - are well-known and do not need to be further expounded in the abstract. Specifically for investment treaties, they require that treaty interpretation is not to be guided by presumptions in favor of either investors and their home States or of host States, nor by teleological preferences about investor-State relations that are extrinsic to the treaty commitments made.\n\nExhibit CL-001.\n\n309.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that, in its analysis of the governing law, it is not limited to the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties, but is required, under the maxim *iura novit curia* or, better, *iura novit arbiter,* to apply the law on its own motion. This approach corresponds to the Tribunal\u2019s public function as an adjudicatory body that is part of the administration of international justice. It justifies reliance on arguments and authorities on the governing law not submitted by the Parties, provided the latter are given an opportunity to comment on arguments and legal theories that were either not addressed or could not reasonably be anticipated.399\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 172 (with further references).\n\n**A. Applicable Law and Causes of Action**\n------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe law applicable to the merits of the present proceeding is to be determined pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. According to this provision, an ICSID tribunal is, in the first place, called to \"decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\" In the present proceeding, on the basis of Respondent's offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 of the BIT, which Claimants have accepted, the Parties have agreed on Article 8(6) of the BIT, which provides in English translation as submitted by the Parties (with differences in translation noted), as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on conflict of laws [Respondent]/private international law rules [Claimants], the provisions of this Agreement, and the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to such an investment, if any, as well as the applicable principles of international law.400\n\nExhibits C-001 and ARA-001.\n\n311.\n\nPursuant to Article 8(6) of the BIT, the Tribunal is therefore empowered and required to apply Argentine law, the BIT itself, as well as other applicable principles of international law in resolving disputes between investors covered by the BIT and the other Contracting State, which are submitted to international arbitration on the basis of Article 8.\n\n312.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that the combination of domestic law, the BIT, and other principles of international law, which is laid down in Article 8(6) of the BIT applies necessarily to every claim or cause of action submitted by the parties, as part of their dispute, to an arbitral tribunal established under Article 8 of that BIT. Article 8(6) is a choice-of-law clause for the merits of the dispute on the basis of which a tribunal established under Article 8 of the BIT is to determine the law that applies to the causes of action before it. In providing that the applicable law encompasses the host State's domestic law, the provisions of the BIT, any specific agreements concerning the investment, and applicable principles of international law, Article 8(6) has to be seen in the context of the jurisdictional grant under Article 8(1), which allows an investor of one Contracting Party to bring \"[a]ny dispute with regard to investments ... concerning any subject matter governed by this Agreement\" to a treaty-based ICSID tribunal. This provision may be understood as a wide dispute settlement provision that extends jurisdiction to a variety of different causes of actions, including claims for breach of the BIT (i.e., treaty claims), claims for breach of investor-State contracts (i.e., contract claims), or claims for breach of domestic law, provided these claims all regard an investment the claimant investor has made in the host State and the dispute concerns a subject matter governed by the BIT, which would encompass any issue relating to the promotion and protection of investments that comes up in the relations between covered investors and host State. After all, as Article 7 of the BIT clarifies, contracts between covered investors and host State, as well as domestic law governing investor-State relations are covered by the term \"subject matter of this Agreement\" in the sense of Article 8(1) of the BIT.401\n\nArticle 7 of the BIT (with differences in translation between the Parties noted) provides:  \nArticle 7  \nOther Obligations  \n(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement contain provisions, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such provisions shall to the extent they are more favourable prevail over this Agreement.  \n(2) Each Contracting Party shall respect all contractual obligations it may have entered into in respect of [investments in its territory by] [Respondent] investors of the other Contracting Party [concerning investments admitted in its territory] [Claimants].\n\n313.\n\nEach of those types of claims, or causes of action, would be governed by its own applicable law, as determined pursuant to Article 8(6) of the BIT. A claim for breach of an investor-State contract would be governed by the law applicable to that contract (as determined either by the host State\u2019s conflict-of-law rules and/or a choice-of-law clause in that contract); a claim for breach of a host State\u2019s domestic statute would be governed by domestic law; and a claim for breach of the BIT would be governed by the BIT itself. In addition, Article 8(6) of the BIT ensures that applicable principles of international law would apply independently of any other law that may be applicable (whether domestic law or treaty law) in order to ensure that the host State\u2019s obligations under international law are always complied with. Article 8(6) of the BIT, therefore, does not substantially differ from the approach to the determination of applicable law contained in Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, where applicable rules of international law also apply as a corrective.\n\n314.\n\nIn sum, Article 8(6) of the BIT sets out the permissible range of causes of action that can come before an Article 8 tribunal, but it does not have the effect that any dispute submitted to an Article 8 tribunal, independently of the causes of action upon which the disputing parties rely, is always governed by a combination of domestic and international law. Above all, Article 8(6) does not provide, as seemingly suggested by Respondent, that Argentine law determines the scope of the investor's substantive rights under the BIT and whether or not Argentina has complied with the BIT. Whether the BIT and international law have been complied with can only be assessed on the basis of an autonomous interpretation and application of the rules and principles that form part of the international legal system. A treaty claim, in other words, remains governed by treaty law. As the ICJ has stated in the *ELSI* case, domestic law and international law, including the BIT, are separate regimes, so that\n\n[c]ompliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of a treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.402\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment (20 July 1989) [1989] ICJ Reports 15, 51, para. 73 (Exhibit ALRA-193); Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 455; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 235.\n\n315.\n\nTo the same effect, Article 3 of the ILC Articles provides:\n\nThe characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\n\n316.\n\nThat a treaty claim remains governed by treaty law does not mean, however, that domestic law is wholly irrelevant for the determination of compliance with, or liability under, a BIT, including the BIT governing the present dispute. Domestic law will remain relevant in governing a variety of incidental questions, or preliminary matters, including questions for the determination of which a BIT may expressly refer to domestic law (such as the determination of the nationality of an investor or compliance with domestic law under an in-accordance-with-host-State-law clause, as is the case under Article 1(1) and (2) of the BIT),403 or questions that must be assumed to be governed by domestic law for other reasons, for example because certain elements of a treaty can only be determined by recourse to domestic law (such as whether an investor has title to a certain asset or what the treatment afforded under domestic law is for purposes of assessing compliance with a national treatment provision).\n\nThe provision in Article 1(1) *in fine* of the BIT, which provides that \"[t]he contents and scope of the rights for the different categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made,\" clarifies that the domestic law of the host State determines the content and scope of the rights that attach to the assets that qualify as protected investments under the BIT. This provision does not, however, mean that the determination of whether host State measures that affect an investor or her investment in respect of rights granted under domestic law qualify as a breach of the substantive protection granted under the BIT becomes subject to domestic law, as suggested by the Dissent, paras. 12, 98, 126-129, 296, 373, 407(1) and (2). Article 1(1) *in fine* of the BIT merely clarifies that no investor can complain that the denial of a benefit to which the investor is not entitled under domestic law \u2013 for example the host State's refusal to make payments to an investor under an investor-State contract beyond what that investor is entitled to under the contract \u2013 could give rise without more to a claim for breach of the BIT, but it does not mean that any measure of the host State that complies with domestic law would in and of itself comply with the substantive standards of treatment laid down in the BIT.\n\n317.\n\nIn the present case, as their prayer for relief indicates, Claimants have brought claims for breach of specific provisions of the BIT, namely of Article 4 (addressing expropriation) and of Article 2(1) (addressing fair and equitable treatment). The law applicable to determining these claims is international law, more specifically the BIT itself, as well as other relevant rules of international law, including customary international law or general principles of international law, to the extent they are not supplanted by the BIT. Claimants have not brought claims before this Tribunal for breach of domestic law or breach of contract. While the assessment of ENREJA's conduct under domestic law, as specified further below, is a relevant factor in the application of the substantive standards of treatment under the BIT, the Tribunal is not called on deciding on a dispute between ENJASA and ENREJA about the legality of the revocation of ENJASA's license under domestic law. This dispute was before the courts in the Province of Salta and has become moot when the Parties withdrew it following the Tribunal's order to do so in its Decision in Jurisdiction.404\n\nThe withdrawal of the proceedings in Argentina's domestic courts concerning the dispute between ENJASA and the authorities in the Province of Salta does not, however, have the effect that the legality of the revocation of ENJASA's license under domestic law would become *res judicata* in the present proceeding and could not be revisited by the Tribunal as an incidental question in order to determine whether that revocation was lawful as a matter of international law, or that the legality of the revocation of the License would have to be qualified as a \"legal *event* under Respondent's domestic law\" that could not be revisited by the Tribunal, as suggested by the Dissent, paras. 3, 4, 91(iii), 100, 158-159, 206, 214, 233, 385, 390, 394, 407(1).\n\n**B. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal will first assess Claimants' claim for breach of the rules on expropriation in Article 4 of the BIT, which provides in English translation, with remaining differences between the Parties indicated, as follows:\n\n(1) The term \"expropriation\" includes both nationalization as well as any other measure having an equivalent effect.\n\n(2) The investments of investors of a Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law and against compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or the impending expropriation became public knowledge. Compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall bear interest until the date of payment, at the customary bank rate of the State in whose territory the investment has been made; shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Assessment and payment of compensation shall be adequately provided for no later than at the time of expropriation.\n\n(3) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the financial [Respondent] assets of a company that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 2 hereof, is deemed to be a company belonging to that Contracting Party, and in which the investor of the other Contracting Party owns [Respondent]/has [Claimants] shares, the provisions set forth in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied by the former so as to guarantee the appropriate compensation of the investor.\n\n319.\n\nAs forwarded by Claimants, the claim for breach of Article 4 of the BIT arises from the revocation of ENJASA' exclusive 30-year license and the subsequent transfer of ENJASA's operations to third operators. As compared to the claim for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(1) of the BIT, which arises out the same set of measures taken by the authorities in Salta, the claim for breach of Article 4 is the more specific one. Article 4 not only requires an interference with a protected investment that must meet a higher threshold and qualify as an \"expropriation,\" it also gives the host State a right to expropriate a covered investment under specific circumstances, namely if the expropriation serves a public purpose, is implemented in accordance with due process of law, and provides for compensation. For this reason, claims under Article 4 of the BIT have to be addressed before claims for breach of other provisions of the BIT, such as the one on fair and equitable treatment in Article 2(1) of the BIT,\n\n320.\n\nIn respect of Article 4 of the BIT, Claimants claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license and the subsequent transfer of its operations to third operators gives rise to two (in principle separate) causes of action. In the first place, and as their principal claim under Article 4 of the BIT,405 Claimants claim that the measures in question destroyed their indirect investment in ENJASA, through their shareholding in L&E, resulting in an indirect expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Only as an alternative claim do Claimants allege the measures in question to have resulted in an expropriation of ENJASA's assets contrary to Article 4(3) of the BIT, which would entitle Claimants, they claim, as indirect shareholders in ENJASA to compensation.\n\nOn the claim for breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT being Claimants' principal claim, see Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 644 (Request for Relief); Closing Statement, Transcript, Day 9, p. 64; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 456-459.\n\n321.\n\nRespondent, by contrast, claims that neither an indirect expropriation of Claimants' indirect investment in ENJASA that would violate Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT has occurred, nor that the revocation of ENJASA's license and the subsequent transfer of its operations to new operators has resulted in an expropriation of ENJASA contrary to Article 4(3) of the BIT. Instead, Respondent insists, as its principal argument on the merits, that the revocation of ENJASA's license had occurred in the lawful exercise of ENREJA's regulatory or police powers as provided for under the regulatory framework in place in the Province of Salta. Such exercise of a host State's regulatory and police powers is recognized as lawful under international law and would not, Respondent argues, qualify as an act of expropriation under Article 4 of the BIT. In addition, Respondent submits, the fact that ENJASA could continue operating the Sheraton Hotel in Salta and that Claimants had been offered to continue operating casinos in Salta militated against the existence of an expropriation. Furthermore, Respondent argues that Article 4(3) of the BIT limits the protection of shareholder-investors to claims for compensation arising out of expropriations of \"financial assets\" of a locally incorporated company, a condition ENJASA's license did not fulfil, thus barring recourse of Claimants as shareholder-investors under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n322.\n\nAgainst the background of the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal will, in the following, first set out the legal framework to be applied to claims under Article 4 of the BIT. It will start with Claimants' principal claim for indirect expropriation under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, before turning to Claimants' alternative claim for breach of Article 4(3) of the BIT. The key issue that emerges from the legal framework thus expounded is whether the revocation of ENJASA's license amounted to expropriatory conduct in the sense of Article 4(1) or whether it qualified as a regular exercise of the host State's regulatory or police power, that is, as a lawful administration of a sanction by ENREJA under Law No. 7020, which does not qualify as an expropriation and does not require the payment of compensation.\n\n**1. Breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***a) The Relevant Legal Principles***\n--------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nBefore assessing whether the facts in the present proceeding resulted in a breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, the Tribunal will clarify the relevant legal principles governing the interpretation of this provision of the BIT. In order to do so, the Tribunal will first clarify the qualification of Claimants' claim as a claim for indirect expropriation of their investment (see (1)). The Tribunal will then set out the legal test applicable under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT to determine whether Respondent's conduct qualified as an indirect expropriation and distinguish such conduct from the non-compensable exercise of the host State's regulatory and police powers (see (2)). Finally, the Tribunal will address in more detail what limits the exercise of the host State's police powers has to comply with in case of the enforcement of pre-existing limitations to the rights an investor enjoys under the host State's domestic law (see (3)).\n\n**(1) Qualification of Claimants\u2019 Claim as a Claim for Indirect Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT provides investments of investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party with protection against expropriations that have not been made for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, and against compensation.406 Expropriation, in this context, is defined in Article 4(1) of the BIT as encompassing both nationalization and other measures having an equivalent effect. Article 4 therefore protects not only against direct, but also indirect, *de facto,* or creeping expropriations of covered investments.\n\nThe Dissent (para. 406) posits that the lack of compensation does not in itself render an otherwise lawful expropriation, that is, one implemented for a public purpose and in accordance with due process, unlawful, especially when the issue of compensation is *sub judice*. The Parties' submissions in the present case, however, is not that the revocation of ENJASA's license constitutes an otherwise lawful expropriation that only lacks the payment of compensation. Instead, Claimants claim that the revocation of ENJASA's license constitutes an unlawful expropriation, which entitles them to the payment of damages under the principles on State responsibility. Respondent, in turn, does not argue that the revocation of ENJASA's license qualified as a lawful expropriation either; Respondent's argument is that no expropriation has occurred at all. The issue of compensation for a lawful expropriation, in other words, is not *sub judice* in the present proceeding, nor was it *sub judice* in any of the proceedings that had been pending in the courts of Salta.\n\n325.\n\nThe notion of \"investments\", which are protected against expropriation under Article 4 of the BIT, in turn, encompasses not only direct investments of an investor from the other Contracting Party, but also investments that are held through a holding company that was incorporated in the host State, as in the present case. Indeed, the Tribunal has already found in its Decision on Jurisdiction \"that both Claimants' direct shareholding in L&E and their indirect shareholding in ENJASA qualify as 'investments' under Article 1(1)(b) the BIT.\"407 Claimants as shareholder-investors are therefore protected against expropriations of their (direct and indirect) shareholdings in L&E and ENJASA under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 182. Since, for purposes of the analysis of whether Respondent's conduct complied with Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, the protected investment consists of Claimants' shareholdings in L&E and ENJASA, it is irrelevant that Claimants themselves were not the owners or beneficiaries of ENJASA's license. Similarly, for determining whether Claimants' shareholding was subject to an indirect expropriation, it is irrelevant whether the revocation of the License qualified, or not, as a direct expropriation of ENJASA. The question the Tribunal has to address under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT is not whether the License was directly expropriated, and whether the holder of that License, i.e., ENJASA, could claim for breach of Article 4 of the BIT, but whether the revocation of ENJASA's license constituted an indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholdings in L&E and ENJASA. *Contra* Dissent, paras. 91(vii), 109-111, 125-129.\n\n326.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal has found that ENJASA's assets themselves, including in particular its exclusive operating license, do not qualify under Article 1(1) of the BIT as Claimants' investments.408 This notwithstanding, Article 4(3) of the BIT provides shareholder-investors in a company that has been established in the host State with a cause of action in case of expropriations of assets/financial assets of the locally incorporated company in which the investor holds shares.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 184.\n\n327.\n\nIn respect of the relationship between claims of shareholder-investors under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT, on the one hand, and Article 4(3), on the other hand, the Tribunal reiterates what it has explained in its Decision on Jurisdiction, namely that nothing in the text of Article 4(3) of the BIT supports an argument to the effect that this provision would exclude the protection of shareholder-investors under other standards of protection in instances where assets/financial assets of a locally incorporated company have been expropriated. Rather, as the Tribunal explained:\n\n240. ... the formulation of Article 4(3) of the BIT suggests that that provision was intended to grant shareholder-investors an additional cause of action when a local company, in which a covered investor holds shares, is expropriated.\n\n241. This additional cause of action differs from a claim of shareholder-investors under Article 4(2) of the BIT for an (indirect) expropriation of their shareholding. Under Article 4(3) of the BIT, a claimant would only have to show that assets/financial assets of the company were subject to an expropriation, without the need to demonstrate any detrimental effect on the value of the shareholding. By contrast, for a claim under Article 4(2) of the BIT, the shareholder-investor would need to show that the interference of the host State with assets of the company had an effect on the shareholding that was so severe that it qualifies as a \"measure having an equivalent effect\" on that shareholding.409\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 240-241.\n\n328.\n\nWhereas direct expropriations require the taking and transfer of title to the covered investment from the investor to the host State or a third party, indirect or *de facto* expropriations cover measures that have an equivalent effect to a direct expropriation, but leave the title to the investment unaffected.410\n\nFor authority on the distinction between direct and indirect expropriation, see e.g. *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award (30 August 2000) para. 103 (Exhibit CL-011); *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (3 September 2001) para. 200 (Exhibit ALRA-113); *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003) paras. 113-114 (Exhibit CL-008); *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v.

As the Tribunal equally already has stated in its Decision on Jurisdiction, it is clear that the revocation of ENJASA's license and subsequent events do not constitute a direct expropriation of Claimants' investment, as it is undisputed that Claimants continue to own title to their shares in L&E and ENJASA. The issue is rather whether the revocation of ENJASA's license and the subsequent transfer of its business to new operators constitute an indirect expropriation of Claimants' investment in L&E and/or ENJASA.411\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 228 (stating that \"[i]n the jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals, it has been held that such indirect expropriations can occur, inter alia, when host State measures, which directly affect assets of the company, substantially and permanently deprive the shareholder-investor of her investment in the shareholding in the company and effectively destroy the value of those shares. In such cases, shareholders can bring claims based on (indirect) expropriation of their shareholding in the host State\" and providing further references to the case law invoked by Claimants).\n\n**(2) Distinction between Indirect Expropriation and Non-Compensable Exercises of the Host State\u2019s Regulatory and Police Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nIn the past, in determining whether a certain government measure qualified as an indirect expropriation, several tribunals have considered principally, at times even solely, the effects the measure had on the protected investment.412 What tribunals have required in application of this approach, as stated for example in *Metalclad v. Mexico,* is that the interference of the host State\u2019s measure with the investment \"has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit.\"413 Other tribunals have used similar formulations that make the existence of an indirect expropriation dependent upon the permanent and substantial deprivation of an investment\u2019s capacity to be employed for economic use and benefit.414\n\nSee eg *Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award (17 February 2000) para. 77 (Exhibit CL-004); *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007) para. 7.5.20 (Exhibit CL-032). For a detailed discussion of arbitral case law endorsing the so-called (sole) effects-doctrine, see August Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments \u2013 The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press 2020) 149-155. The Dissent (i.a. paras. 92-93, 116-117, 120-124, 180-181, 234, 365-366, 375, 384, 387, 449) incorrectly claims that the Tribunal's majority \"absurdly\" only focuses on the \"sole effect\" of the revocation, without taking into account the regulatory powers of ENREJA to lawfully revoke the License. However, as the Tribunal explains in the present section, it does not consider the effects of the revocation of the License to be the sole criterion for the existence of an indirect expropriation, but also requires to factor in an assessment of whether this revocation has been brought about as a lawful exercise of ENREJA's regulatory and police powers. If that had been the case, no indirect expropriation would have been occasioned, and no compensation would be due, under Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award (30 August 2000) para. 103 (Exhibit CL-011).\n\nSee e.g. *Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v.

As confirmed by a large number of investment treaty tribunals, not only the impact on the investment of the measures in question has to be examined, but also whether the host State took those measures in the exercise of its police powers or its right to regulate, which are, as numerous tribunals have emphasized, a recognized component of State sovereignty, safeguarded under both customary international law and the law of investment treaties.415 As stated, for example, by the tribunal in *Saluka v Czech Republic,* \"[i]t is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investment when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.\"416\n\nSee e.g. *Methanex Corporation v United States of America*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits (3 August 2005) Part IV, Chapter D, para. 7 (Exhibit ALRA-77); *Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006) paras. 255, 262 (Exhibit CL-018); *Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award (8 July 2016) paras. 295-301 (Exhibit CL-178). For further detailed discussion of arbitral case law on this point, see August Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments \u2013 The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press 2020) 85-111.\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006) para. 255 (Exhibit CL-018).\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that due consideration must be given to the host State's police powers and its right to regulate in circumscribing the concept of indirect expropriation under investment treaties, independently of whether the treaty text makes express reference to such powers. Police powers and the right to regulate are recognized components of a State's sovereignty and firmly grounded in customary international law.417 Consequently, the State's police powers and its right to regulate are not abrogated merely because a State has entered into treaty commitments that restrict its right to expropriate covered investors and their investment and subject expropriations to certain conditions. Rather, a State's police powers and its right to regulate under customary international law constitute \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT and have to be taken into account in interpreting the provisions in a BIT on expropriation, such as Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. This could only be otherwise if it were shown that the contracting parties to the BIT had had a clear intention of dispensing with such a well-recognized principle of customary international law,418 which is not the case for the BIT applicable to the present proceeding.\n\nThe host State's police powers, which allow the taking of measures affecting a foreigner's property rights without compensation, have been recognized as part of customary international law long before modern investment treaty arbitration, inter alia in the practice of pre-World War I claims commissions, by inter-war arbitration tribunals, by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, and by commentators. See *Bischoff Case*, German-Venezuelan Commission, Decision (1903) X UNRIAA 420; *J. Parsons (Great Britain) v. United States*, Decision (30 November 1925) VI UNRIAA 165, 166; *K\u00fcgele v.

Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award (8 July 2016) paras. 290-301.\n\nCf *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment (20 July 1989) [1989] ICJ Reports 15, 42, para. 50 (Exhibit ALRA-193) (stating that \"the Chamber finds itself unable to accept that an important principle of customary international law should be held to have been tacitly dispensed with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so\").\n\n333.\n\nThe State's police and regulatory powers encompass the right of a State to subject property owned by foreigners to regulation in the public interest and to enforce these regulations against the foreign owner without giving rise to a duty to pay compensation. This is true in particular for domestic regulations that already existed when the investment was made. Such regulation constitutes pre-existing limitations to the rights acquired by a foreign investor. At the same time, it is also clear for the Tribunal that the host State's power to regulate is not unlimited, and regulatory measures and their implementation, including the imposition of sanctions and the forfeiture or revocation of rights granted under domestic law, are not per se carved out as a category from the concept of indirect expropriation. Otherwise, merely by labelling measures as having been taken in the exercise of the State's police and regulatory powers as \"sanctions\" or as \"enforcement of pre-existing limitations\" of an investor's rights, such measures easily could be misused and operate as disguised expropriations that would fall through the safety net offered to foreign investors by the rules on expropriation in investment treaties.419 Authority under customary international law, which only exempts *bona fide,* non-discriminatory measures from any duty of compensation, recognizes such limitations on the host State's police powers and its right to regulate as well.420 While the host State's proper exercise of its police powers or of its right to regulate is a business risk that has to be borne by an investor and does not lead to international responsibility, the improper exercise of such powers constitutes a political risk that international investment law regulates and sanctions.\n\nSee e.g. *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003) para. 121 (Exhibit CL-008) (stating that there is \"no principle stating that regulatory administrative actions are per se excluded from the scope of the Agreement, even if they are beneficial to society as a whole \u2014such as environmental protection\u2014, particularly if the negative economic impact of such actions on the financial position of the investor is sufficient to neutralize in full the value, or economic or commercial use of its investment without receiving any compensation whatsoever\"); *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (31 October 2011) para. 234 (Exhibit CL-016) (stating that the \"Tribunal subscribes to the decisions which have refused to hold that a general regulation issued by a State and interfering with the rights of foreign investors can *never* be considered expropriatory because it should be analysed as an exercise of the State's sovereign power or of its police powers \u2013 emphasis in the original); *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award (26 June 2000) para. 99 (Exhibit ALRA-69) (stating that excluding host State measures from the concept of indirect expropriation by subsuming them under the State's police powers merely \"because the measures \u2026 are cast in the form of regulations \u2026 goes too far\"). The Dissent, paras. 69-73, 91-98, 109-114, 152-154, 176-182, 386-387, by contrast, seems to assume that the imposition of sanctions per se falls under the concept of the host State's police powers and is carved out from scrutiny under the concept of indirect expropriation.\n\nSee the references cited *supra* note 417.\n\n334.\n\nConsequently, in the Tribunal's view, in distinguishing between compensable indirect expropriation and non-compensable exercises of a host State's police powers or its right to regulate regard has to be given both to the intensity of the interference of the measure with the protected investment and to the reason and purpose for which the host State has taken the measures in question. Under this approach, two elements must be fulfilled for a government measure to qualify as an indirect expropriation.\n\n335.\n\nFirst, the measure in question must show a certain severity of interference and permanence. To amount to a measure with equivalent effect to an expropriation, it is not sufficient that the measure has occasioned a mere decrease of the value of the investment, or that additional costs have been imposed on the investor. Rather, as required by a long line of arbitral jurisprudence,421 the measure in question must have affected the investment in a way that the investor has been deprived permanently and substantially of the continued use and economic benefits of his or her investment.\n\nFor references, see *supra* para. 330.\n\n336.\n\nSecond, as equally recognized by a long line of arbitral jurisprudence,422 the measure in question must not be covered by the host State's right to exercise its regulatory and police powers, taking into account both the legal framework in place in the host State when the investment was made and the host State's power to regulate and change this legal framework for the protection of public interests. In order to avoid abuse of the host State's regulatory powers, their exercise must be *bona fide* and in line with principles of international investment law, such as good faith, non-discrimination, and the prohibition of arbitrariness,423 and result in measures whose impact on investments is proportionate to the interest(s) protected.424 While recognized by modern investment treaty jurisprudence, these limits to the exercise of a host State's police powers also find their basis in customary international law.425 Alternatively, the exercise of the host State's police and regulatory powers, the use of which would otherwise be legitimate, can qualify as an indirect expropriation if the host State has made assurances or entered special commitments that the host State would refrain from such regulation.426\n\nFor references, see *supra* paras. 331-333.\n\nSee eg *Saluka Investments B.V. v.

Moreover, in certain circumstances, arguments concerning a partial expropriation of an investment may become relevant.\n\n**(3) Limitations on the Host State\u2019s Exercise of Its Police Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nIn the present case, no question arises as to whether changes to the regulatory framework have been made as part of the host State\u2019s right to regulate. What is at issue is the implementation of the existing regulatory framework. The task of an investment treaty tribunal in distinguishing between a non-compensable exercise of the host State\u2019s police powers and a compensable indirect expropriation in that context, has been circumscribed by the tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia,* in a case dealing with the cancellation of a mining license, as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal must thus consider whether, in light of all the circumstances, the Revocation Decree was a legitimate cancellation of the Claimants\u2019 concessions in the exercise of Bolivia\u2019s sovereign power to sanction violations of Bolivian law and is therefore not a compensable taking or whether it is a veritable taking disguised as the exercise of the State\u2019s police powers. This will depend on whether (i) the Revocation Decree is based on actual violations of Bolivian law by the Claimants; (ii) whether those violations of Bolivian law are sanctioned with the termination of the concessions (whether by revocation, cancellation, annulment or otherwise), and (iii) whether the revocation was carried out in accordance with due process.428\n\n*Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award (16 September 2015) para. 207 (Exhibit CL-030).\n\n339.\n\nAs this statement suggests, the question of whether the host State's measures fall under the host State's police powers, and therefore do not qualify as a compensable indirect expropriation, or qualify as an indirect expropriation that is merely disguised as the exercise of the host State's police power, is an issue that depends on the compliance of the measures in question with both the host State's domestic law and standards of international law applicable under the BIT. While agreeing with the basic test circumscribed by the *Quiborax* tribunal to distinguish between the non-compensable exercise of the host State's police powers and the concept of indirect expropriation when the enforcement of pre-existing limitations of an investor's rights under domestic law is concerned, the Tribunal considers that certain concretizations to both prongs of the *Quiborax* test - compliance with domestic law and compliance with international legal standards - are called for.\n\n340.\n\nFirst, in making the determination whether the administration and implementation of an existing regulatory framework constitutes a lawful exercise of the host State's regulatory and supervisory powers, an investment treaty tribunal will regularly be faced with allegations that the regulatory requirements under domestic law were not met. This could be the case, for example, because of alleged mistakes in the factual basis for a decision taken by the host State's authorities or because of errors of those authorities in interpreting domestic law, the violation of procedural rights under domestic law, errors of form, or errors in the exercise of discretion granted to host State authorities. In assessing these matters, the Tribunal is conscious of the fact that it has to leave the host State's authorities room for appreciation and thus exercise an appropriate degree of deference. After all, the Tribunal's mandate in the present proceeding is not to second-guess the host State's determinations under domestic law and review them *de novo,* as if it was the primary decision-maker or a domestic (first-instance, appellate, or supreme) court in the host State.429\n\nIn this sense, for example, *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Partial Award (13 November 2000) paras. 261, 263 (Exhibit ALRA-64); *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Award (8 June 2009) paras. 779, 805 (Exhibit ALRA-183); *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (14 January 2010) para. 283 (Exhibit ALRA-303); *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products S.A. (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos S.A. (Uruguay) v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award (8 July 2016) paras. 418, 430 (Exhibit CL-178); *Koch Minerals S\u00e1rl and Koch Nitrogen International S\u00e1rl v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/19, Award (30 October 2017) para. 7.20 (Exhibit ALRA-305); *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case ARB(AF)/11/2, Award (4 April 2016) para. 583 (Exhibit CL-203). For further discussion on the need for deference in investment treaty arbitration, see generally Caroline Henckels, *Proportionality and Deference in Investor-State Arbitration \u2013 Balancing Investment Protection and Regulatory Autonomy* (Cambridge University Press 2015).\n\n341.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the degree of deference due is a function of both the applicable law and the cause of action before it. If a cause of action for breach of the host State\u2019s domestic law is brought, and the investment tribunal has competence to entertain such a claim, it could be appropriate for the tribunal, which in such a case in effect substitutes for a domestic court, to adopt the same degree of deference that the host State\u2019s domestic courts would adopt in reviewing the legality of host State action under domestic law. By contrast, if a claim for breach of international law is brought before the investment tribunal, as is the case in the present proceeding, the tribunal will have to adopt the degree of deference that the applicable international law and the tribunal\u2019s function as an international adjudicatory body calls for. As the ICJ has stated in the *ELSI* case:\n\nCompliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of a treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.430\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment (20 July 1989) [1989] ICJ Reports 15, 51, para. 73 (Exhibit ALRA-193).\n\n342.\n\nAgainst this background, an investment treaty tribunal will regularly not be able to review compliance of the host State with its own domestic law *de novo,* but will have to limit itself to verifying whether the host State\u2019s application of the domestic regulatory framework, whether lawful or not under domestic law, resulted in breaches of the international law limitations that fall on the host State under the BIT.\n\n343.\n\nSecond, the international law limitations on the host State\u2019s exercise of its regulatory and police powers when implementing pre-existing limitations to an investor\u2019s rights under domestic law, such as in the present proceeding, is not limited to due process violations, which are mentioned expressly by the *Quiborax* tribunal. Instead, international law requires, as explained above (see *supra* para. 338), that the host State\u2019s implementation of the existing regulatory framework under its police powers complies, in addition to due process, with the principle of good faith, is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, and is otherwise proportionate. Focusing on these limitations of the host State\u2019s implementation of its regulatory framework to determine whether the host State\u2019s police powers have been exercised in a genuine manner, and therefore do not result in a compensable indirect expropriation, or whether the measures qualify as an indirect expropriation disguised as an exercise of the host State's police powers, operationalize the degree of deference that is due in respect of determinations made by host State authorities in interpreting and applying domestic law and avoid that an investment treaty tribunal would review compliance with domestic law *de novo*.431\n\nIn this sense also *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Award (8 June 2009) para. 617 (Exhibit ALRA-183).\n\n344.\n\nWhat is not necessary as a requirement for finding a violation of the international law limits of the exercise of the host State's police powers in implementing the existing regulatory framework is the exhaustion of local remedies.432 The BIT expressly provides for temporal limits to the need for an investor to have recourse before the administrative and judicial jurisdictions of the host State before turning to international arbitration and claim a violation of the BIT. Pursuant to Article 8(3) of the BIT, if no decision on the merits is rendered within eighteen months by the domestic authorities, local remedies no longer need to be pursued. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\nAfter all, the purpose of such a requirement [i.e., recourse to domestic remedies for a period of 18 months under Art. 8(3)] is to give the courts of the host State an opportunity, for a certain time, to remedy the alleged grievance before an international tribunal assumes jurisdiction, thus coordinating dispute settlement between national and international jurisdiction. ... Consequently, if it is clear ... that the period the BIT requires domestic recourses to be pursued has passed without the dispute having been settled, the purpose of the domestic-remedies-first requirement, cannot be achieved anymore.433\n\n*Contra* Dissent, paras. 20-24, 91(iv), 221, 302-306, 380(2), 390-391, 394, 407(7).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 318-319.\n\n345.\n\nRequiring the exhaustion of local remedies as a prerequisite for the finding of a breach of the substantive standards of treatment, in particular a finding that the host State has not complied with the requirements for the legitimate exercise of its police powers, would go against the clear wording of Article 8(3) of the BIT, which indicates that the Contracting Parties to the BIT did not intend to maintain the requirement, which exists as part of the law on diplomatic protection, to exhaust local remedies before having recourse under international law. Consequently, the fact that ENJASA has - on the instructions of the Tribunal and pursuant to Article 8(4) of the BIT - withdrawn its domestic judicial remedies in the Province of Salta, does not preclude the Tribunal from assessing whether the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license breached Respondent\u2019s obligations under the BIT and international law. Furthermore, the withdrawal of the proceedings in Argentina\u2019s domestic courts concerning the dispute between ENJASA and the authorities of the Province of Salta does not have the effect of turning the legality of the License\u2019s revocation under domestic law into a matter of *res judicata* that could not be revisited by the Tribunal as a matter of domestic law.434\n\nThe Tribunal's majority thus disagrees with the Dissent (i.a. paras. 3, 4, 91(iii), 100, 158-159, 206, 214, 233, 385, 390, 394, 407(1)) that upon the withdrawal of the proceedings before the Courts of Salta, ENREJA's decision on the revocation of the License became final under Argentina law and could not be reviewed as the Tribunal is empowered to apply Argentine law pursuant to Article 8(6) of the BIT. See also *supra* note 404.\n\n346.\n\nInstead, deference to the host State\u2019s actions and determinations under domestic law is built into the standards of treatment under the BIT and the international law limitations to the host State\u2019s police powers, in particular as far as the standard of arbitrariness under international law is concerned, which the ICJ in the *ELSI* case defined as \"not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law. ... It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"435\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment (20 July 1989) [1989] ICJ Reports 15, 76, para. 128 (Exhibit ALRA-193).\n\n347.\n\nSimilar definitions of arbitrariness can also be found in investment treaty jurisprudence.436 For example, the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* equated unreasonableness with arbitrariness and explained that \"[u]nreasonable or arbitrary measures ... are those which are not founded in reason or fact but on caprice, prejudice or personal preference.\"437 The tribunal in *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania* elaborated on arbitrariness as involving\n\na. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\n\nd. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.438\n\nFor further discussion of the case law of investment tribunals on the definition of arbitrariness, see August Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments \u2013 The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press 2020) 439-441.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award (27 August 2008) para. 184 (Exhibit ALRA-36) (referring to *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (3 September 2001) paras. 221, 222, 232 and Christoph H. Schreuer, 'Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET): Interaction with Other Standards' (2007) 4(5) Transnational Dispute Management 8-9).\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award (8 October 2009) para. 303.\n\n348.\n\nAs the above definitions show, not every violation of domestic law will *ipso facto* constitute arbitrary conduct under international law. Rather, arbitrariness requires a qualitatively significant breach, an abuse of power, that imposes harm on a foreign investor contrary to the rule of law. Indicators for arbitrariness in this sense can be, for example, a manifest lack of competence of the host State's authority for taking the measure in question, bad faith applications of domestic law, or decisions that appear so manifestly incorrect that they must be deemed to constitute an abuse of power.\n\n349.\n\nAs far as determining whether manifest errors in the interpretations of domestic law constitute an abuse of power is concerned, the Tribunal considers the statement of the ICJ in the *Diallo* case to offer helpful guidance.439 In that case, the ICJ stated:\n\n[I]t is for each State, in the first instance, to interpret its own domestic law. The Court does not, in principle, have the power to substitute its own interpretation for that of the national authorities, especially when that interpretation is given by the highest national courts. Exceptionally, where a State puts forward a manifestly incorrect interpretation of its domestic law, particularly for the purpose of gaining an advantage in a pending case, it is for the Court to adopt what it finds to be the proper interpretation.440\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo)*, Judgment (30 November 2010) (Exhibit ALRA-246).\n\nIbid, para. 70 (internal citation omitted).\n\n350.\n\nSimilarly, in respect of determining whether mistakes made in the factual basis for a decision taken by the host State's authorities or whether the application of domestic law to those facts constitute an abuse of power, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to focus on the manifest character of errors as an indicator for the lack of good faith and arbitrariness.\n\n351.\n\nAs far as the principle of proportionality is concerned, the Tribunal considers that this principle is a recognized limitation on the exercise of the host State's regulatory and police powers so that host State measures that are disproportionate from the perspective of international law cannot qualify as legitimate exercises of the host State's police powers that fall outside the concept of indirect expropriations. Such a limitation, albeit without necessarily using the word proportionality, has been recognized already under customary international law.441 Proportionality is also laid down as a principle of (public) law in the domestic laws of a large number of countries, and in the practice of their domestic courts, and is used and applied as a principle of international law in the practice of numerous other international courts and tribunals, both within the investment treaty context and beyond, thus confirming that proportionality qualifies as a general principle of law in the sense of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute whose purpose it is to reconcile competing interests, such as investment protection, on the one hand, and environmental protection, labor standards, human rights, or any other public interest, including the prevention of money laundering, on the other hand.442 Proportionality requires that a host State\u2019s measures i) pursues a legitimate goal (public purpose); ii) is suitable to achieve that goal; iii) is necessary to achieve that goal in the sense that less intrusive, but equally feasible and effective measures do not exist; and iv) is proportionate *stricto sensu*, that is, that the benefit for the public of the measure in question stands in an adequate and acceptable relationship to the negative impact of the measure on the investment.\n\nFor an early expression of the idea of the proportionality of the exercise of police powers, see *Bischoff Case*, German-Venezuelan Commission, Decision (1903) X UNRIAA 420 (providing that State responsibility would attach to lawful exercises of police powers, if they lasted \"for an unreasonable length of time\").\n\nFor the use of proportionality analysis in domestic legal systems, see in particular Alec Stone Sweet and Jud Mathews, 'Proportionality Balancing and Global Constitutionalism' (2008) 47 Columbia JTL 73; Aharon Barak, *Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and Their Limitations* (Cambridge University Press 2012) 175-210; Alec Stone Sweet and Jud Matthews, *Proportionality Balancing and Constitutional Governance: A Comparative and Global Approach* (Oxford University Press 2019).

Schill, 'Public Law Concepts to Balance Investors' Rights with State Regulatory Actions in the Public Interest: The Principle of Proportionality' in Stephan W.

Two issues are at the core of the analysis: (1) whether the termination of ENJASA\u2019s license has reached the threshold of a substantial and permanent deprivation of Claimants\u2019 shareholdings in L&E and/or ENJASA; and (2) whether, in the present case, the measures imposed by the host State qualify as a regular exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory and supervisory powers that falls outside the concept of (indirect) expropriation.\n\n**(1) Permanent and Substantial Deprivation of Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nAlthough Claimants' shareholding in and control over L&E, and indirectly ENJASA, were unaffected by the revocation of ENJASA's license, Claimants were unable to make use of their investment in any meaningful way. ENJASA's exclusive license, which granted a monopoly for operating games of chance in the Province of Salta, was the heart of its entire business operation, the irreplaceable organ that ensured the functioning and survival of the entire body. Without it, ENJASA's operations in the gaming sector became impossible. What remained was an empty shell of assets, employees, and goodwill, a body that was left to decompose economically. The revocation of ENJASA's license, which was confirmed by Resolution No. 315/13, was permanent and was consolidated by the Province allowing new operators to step into ENJASA's shoes. Similarly, as Claimants' Expert Rosen showed in his Second Report, 98.8% of the value of L&E consisted of ENJASA's license.443 The revocation of ENJASA's license therefore permanently and substantially deprived Claimants of their indirect investment in ENJASA and their direct investment in L&E. Both companies were empty shells after the revocation of ENJASA's license.\n\nRosen II, para. 4.10.\n\n354.\n\nRespondent questioned whether a permanent and substantial deprivation of Claimants' investment had occurred because Claimants could have applied for new licenses after ENJASA's license was revoked, but did not do so. In addition, Claimants were concretely offered to continue operating casinos in the Province of Salta.444 For the Tribunal, this aspect does not affect the conclusion that Claimants have been permanently and substantially deprived of their investment in L&E and/or ENJASA, as ENJASA's exclusive license for the remaining 17.5 years could not simply be replaced by new and less favorable licenses that were still to be negotiated and did not have the same scope as ENJASA's operation and were not exclusive. The fact, therefore, that Claimants did not apply for new licenses and refused to accept a possible offer to operate Casino Salta does not affect the Tribunal's conclusion that the revocation of ENJASA's license permanently and substantially deprived Claimants of their investment in L&E and indirectly in ENJASA. If the License was unlawfully revoked, Claimants were not obliged to apply for new licenses under less favorable conditions or continue to operate Casino Salta, while relinquishing all the other operations that formed part of ENJASA\u2019s exclusivity.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 488-489.\n\n355.\n\nEqually irrelevant in this context is the circumstance that the exploitation of certain assets, in particular the five-star hotel, remained under ENJASA\u2019s control, and could be monetized after the revocation of the License, first by renting the premises of Casino Salta in the hotel to new operators and later selling the real estate and goodwill of the hotel for USD 4.2 million.445 These circumstances do not affect the conclusion that ENJASA\u2019s exclusive activities in the gaming business had permanently ended with the revocation of the License. Whatever financial revenues ENJASA or Claimants could still draw after the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license from their investments, including the liquidation of individual assets that remained, are matters that concern the calculation of compensation or damages, but do not affect the assessment whether a permanent and substantial deprivation of Claimants\u2019 investment has occurred in the first place.\n\nAlthough the Parties agreed that the hotel had been a condition to acquire the License and operated at a loss or was \u2013 at best \u2013 at break even, the Dissent (paras. 132-137) assumes that Claimants were not deprived of the complete value of their investment because they continued to operate the hotel after the revocation of the License.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal consequently decides that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license constitutes a permanent and substantial deprivation of Claimants\u2019 indirect investment in ENJASA and of its direct investment in L&E.\n\n**(2) ENREJA\u2019s Use of Its Regulatory Powers**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is beyond question that the Province of Salta had the power to regulate within its territory the operation of games of chance, including in particular through imposing duties on operators, whether for the prevention of money laundering or otherwise, as well as it had the power to administer and implement these regulations, including the circumscribed sanctions in question, through regulatory authorities and administrative procedures. All of this is undoubtedly part of the host State\u2019s sovereignty and its right to regulate. This is all the more so, considering that the regulation and supervision of gambling operators is demanded by FATF recommendations in order to combat money laundering.446 Consequently, the administration of such regulations, including the imposition of sanctions, even if resulting in the loss of an operating license, does not quality as (indirect) expropriations under provisions in international investment treaties, such as Article 4 of the BIT, provided it is lawful also under international law, that is, made in good faith, is not arbitrary or disproportionate, and respects due process. If the revocation of the License was, in other words, a lawful sanction, it falls under the host State's police powers and does not constitute an indirect expropriation, whereas the revocation of the License would qualify as an indirect expropriation if it was an unlawful exercise of the host State's police powers.\n\nSee 40 FATF Recommendations, Interpretative Note to Recommendations 5, 12 and 16 (20 June 2003) (Exhibit ARA-031) and Interpretative Note to Recommendations 22 and 23 (February 2012) (Exhibit JM-05).\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not question the legitimacy of the regulatory framework set up in the Province of Salta under Law No. 7020, in particular its prohibition to hire operators without ENREJA's authorization and its rules to prevent money laundering. The Tribunal also does not question the sanctions regime established by Law No. 7020, including the possibility provided for in Article 13 of the Law to revoke operating licenses in case of certain serious breaches of the regulatory framework. Similarly, for the Tribunal there is no question that the duties imposed under ENREJA's Resolutions Nos. 26/00 and 90/12 on the modalities of making payments and on keeping records on the identification of recipients of payments and prizes, are legitimate exercises of the host State's police powers.\n\n359.\n\nWhat the Tribunal has to examine, however, is how the regulatory framework in place was applied in the present case, and more specifically, whether ENREJA has properly exercised its regulatory powers under that framework in revoking ENJASA's license. As set out in more detail above, the Tribunal's task is not to review the legality of the revocation of ENJASA's license under domestic law in the same way the host State's administrative courts would. Instead, the Tribunal is limited to reviewing the legality under international law of ENREJA's exercise of its regulatory and supervisory powers, including in particular whether the revocation of ENJASA's license complied with the principle of good faith, the prohibition of arbitrariness, the principle of proportionality, and due process under international law.447\n\nAs clarified above (see *supra* para. 345), the withdrawal by ENJASA of its recourses for judicial review of the legality of the revocation of its License before the courts of the Province of Salta does not have the effect that Resolutions Nos. 240/13 and 315/13, and the revocation of ENJASA's license they effectuate, become *res judicata* and would have to be accepted as being lawful by the Tribunal.\n\n***(a) Plan to Oust ENJASA from Operating in the Gaming Sector***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nOne reason why the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license could fail to qualify as a regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s supervisory powers would be if that revocation was, as submitted by Claimants, the end point of a larger plan of ENREJA and the Province of Salta to oust ENJASA from the gaming business in Salta in order to grant licenses to local companies at conditions that were more favorable to the Province than the fee collected from ENJASA. Such a plan and its implementation would constitute an act of bad faith, arbitrariness, and abuse of power that would be unlawful from the perspective of international law.\n\n361.\n\nTo this end, Claimants allege that already in 2007 the Government of the Province of Salta wanted to \"get rid of the Austrians,\" referring in this respect to the witness statement of Mr. Anselmi, who recalled a suggestion from Governor Urtubey\u2019s brother, Mr. Facundo Urtubey, to this effect, and to take over ENJASA and keep Mr. Anselmi as General Manager.448 Moreover, Claimants allege, the Government of Salta wanted to eliminate the influence of Mr. Garamon, a supporter of the political rival of Governor Urtubey, over ENJASA through his participation in Iberlux. The Province, so Claimants argue, subsequently started to harass ENJASA by renegotiating the license fee, changing regulatory requirements in respect of slot machines, and increasing controls of ENJASA\u2019s operations. These allegations, if true, would indeed suggest the conclusion that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license was not a case of regular exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory powers, but rather a bad faith abuse of those powers.\n\nWS II Anselmi, para. 47 (Exhibit C-292); Mr. Tucek referred to this message. See Cross Examination Tucek, Transcript, Day 2, p. 207.\n\n362.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not find that Claimants have submitted conclusive evidence of a long-term strategy as from 2007, when Governor Urtubey took office, to oust ENJASA of its operations in the gaming sector in Salta. Claimants\u2019 argument about mounting harassment of ENJASA with the purpose of ousting them from the gaming sector following the December 2007 change in political power in the Province of Salta is of little avail. In this context, the Tribunal does not accept Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Acta Acuerdo of May 2008, which changed the fixed license fee into a dynamic fee that depended on ENJASA\u2019s profits, constituted harassment of ENJASA. To start with, ENJASA has signed the Acta Acuerdo and therefore voluntarily accepted, without any sign of duress, that the license fee would henceforth be calculated as a percentage of its net profits.\n\n363.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal accepts Respondent's explanation that the negotiated change in the fee was to be explained against the background of Argentina's 2001/2002 financial and economic crisis and the measures introduced to tackle it, which included amongst others the pesification of US dollar-denominated debt and a significant subsequent devaluation of the Argentine Peso. The Tribunal also accepts that the introduction of the dynamic license fee required a closer monitoring of ENJASA's different operations, which ENREJA implemented through additional technical requirements for slot machines, registration of transactions, and increased surveillance and monitoring of ENJASA's activities. The additional work and investment these changes required on the side of ENJASA cannot be considered as harassment, but were part of the implementation of a reliable system for the calculation of the dynamic license fee.\n\n364.\n\nMore relevant for sustaining the allegation that ENJASA's license was revoked for purposes unrelated to the regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers appears to be the letter of 23 November 2012 that Video Drome sent to ENREJA, in which Video Drome suggested to take over some of ENJASA's operations under conditions that would be economically more favorable for the Province than the fee arrangement with ENJASA.449 In this context, the Tribunal notes that the three formal investigations, which led to the revocation of ENJASA's license, started on 11 December 2013, that is, two weeks after Video Drome's letter. The Tribunal further notes that after the revocation of ENJASA's license, Video Drome, which appears to have been politically well-connected, happened to receive licenses for a large part of ENJASA's former gaming operations, including Casino Golden Dreams, as well as another casino and several slot machine halls.450 Moreover, the Tribunal notes that, whereas ENJASA's license fee consisted of 15-16% of its net profits, the license fee the new operators had to pay happened to be a 20% fee, which is exactly the fee Video Drome had suggested in its letter.\n\nLetter of 23 November 2012 (Exhibit C-171).\n\nResolution No. 334/13 (Exhibit C-036); Resolution No. 339/13 (Exhibit C-041).\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that the Government of the Province of Salta appeared eager to endorse ENREJA's Resolution No. 240/13. Less than 40 minutes after its notification on 13 August 2013, Salta's Minister of Economy informed the public in a press conference of the revocation and declared that ENJASA \"disappears from this story\" in spite of the possibility for ENJASA to request a suspension and reconsideration of the revocation of the License.451 A day later, on 14 August 2013, the Governor of the Province of Salta, in a press interview, considered it appropriate to stretch ENREJA\u2019s allegations about ENJASA\u2019s hiring of operators, stating that ENJASA \"has outsourced 100% of its operations.\"452 The quick and outspoken comments from the Provincial Government on an administrative decision that was not final and most probably would be subject to administrative and judicial review, could be taken as an indication that Resolution No. 240/13 was not so much a legal, but rather a political decision, which was endorsed by the highest authorities of the Province.\n\nPress Conference (Exhibit C-169).\n\nInterview of 14 August 2013 (Exhibit C-212).\n\n366.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s statements could be understood to suggest that ENJASA\u2019s exclusive license was revoked in order to increase the Province\u2019s benefits from the operation of gaming operations by asking for license fees from new licensee that would be higher than what ENJASA paid to the Province. At the press conference of 13 August 2013, the Minister stated that: \"If we negotiate with each manager, we may reach 20% ... an additional amount between 20 and 25 million per year.\"453 The Minister then specified the social projects on which the money could be spent. He also explained that before, in 2007, an increase in the license fee could only be obtained through negotiation \"since [UNIREN] was not aware of any breach of the company.\"454 He added that, at that time, \"we did not have much more since they were complying with a contract.\"455 The Minister thus may be seen as confirming that the purpose of the revocation was to improve Salta\u2019s finances; where in the past this objective had to be achieved by negotiating amendments to the contractual arrangements with ENJASA, the revocation of its License now allowed for the same without negotiations.\n\nPress Conference, p. 4 (Exhibit C-169-ENG).\n\nIbid p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, in 2011 and 2012, ENREJA had only imposed one sanction upon ENJASA,456 but that on 28 May 2013, a few months before the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, it imposed in Resolution No. 161/13 the maximum fine of ARS 200,000 for modifying prize limits without authorization in poker games, as well as the maximum fine of ARS 500,000 for organizing an unauthorized jackpot because of an alleged \"recidivism,\" even though identical infractions had not been committed by ENJASA before.457 Furthermore, the Tribunal observes that the three investigations that ultimately led to the revocation of ENJASA's exclusive gaming license were all started on 11 December 2012, in what appears to be a coordinated manner.\n\nResolution No. 178/ 12 (Exhibit C-166).\n\nResolution No. 161/13 (Exhibit C-154).\n\n368.\n\nThe imposition of the two maximum fines in May 2013 and the earlier coordinated investigations that ultimately lead to the revocation of ENJASA's license may reveal a change in ENREJA's policy towards ENJASA. However, whether this change in policy was motivated by an intention to exclude ENJASA from the gaming sector in Salta and transfer its operations to local companies on terms that were more lucrative for the Province, cannot be established from the evidence submitted by Claimants. In particular, the circumstantial evidence relied on by Claimants, such as the letter by Video Drome, the statements of Salta's Governor and the Minister of Economy, as well as the initiation of coordinated investigations that ultimately led to the revocation of ENJASA's license, with the intervening imposition of maximum fines for recidivism, are insufficient, in the Tribunal's view, to draw an inferences as to the intentions of ENREJA and the Province of Salta in issuing Resolution No. 240/13. The Tribunal will therefore not, on the basis of this circumstantial evidence, speculate what ENREJA's motives for issuing Resolution No. 240/13 may have been.\n\n369.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal considers Claimants' allegation that the revocation of the License was a political plot to harm Mr. Garamon, a supporter of a political rival of Governor Urtubey, as not sufficiently supported by evidence.458 Likewise, the Tribunal accepts that the quick transition of ENJASA's activities to different operators within one week after Resolution No. 315/13 would be justified if the revocation of ENJASA's license was a lawful exercise of ENREJA's regulatory and supervisory powers. After all, it was necessary to ensure the continuance of games of chance operations in the Province and to protect the employment of hundreds of employees.\n\nMr. Tucek, Claimants' witness, stated that in his dealings with ENREJA and the Province, he was told that Mr. Garamon's interests in ENJASA were an obstacle for further negotiations. The Tribunal observes that the allegation that the revocation has been caused by political motives is only based upon Mr. Tucek's testimony, but is not proven otherwise. Moreover, as further developments have shown, the fact that Mr. Garamon was no longer involved after Claimants had purchased all remaining shares in L&E from Iberlux did not lead to a reinstatement of ENJASA's license.\n\n370.\n\nInstead of speculating about ENREJA's and the Province's motives for revoking ENJASA's license, the Tribunal will focus on the facts and the law and assess on that basis whether the revocation of the License as such constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s regulatory powers that complied with international law requirements, that is, as elaborated above, whether it did not violate good faith, was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, complied with due process, or was proportionate.\n\n***(b) ENREJA\u2019s Power to Revoke the License under Article 13***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nOne aspect that would result in qualifying the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license as arbitrary conduct contrary to the rule of law would be the lack of a legal basis on which to base that revocation. Claimants indeed argue that Law No. 7020 did not vest ENREJA with the power to revoke ENJASA\u2019s license. They submit that Article 13 of Law No. 7020, which provides for this competence, was superseded by the new Article 41, which was incorporated into Law No. 7020 by Law No. 7133 of 9 May 2001. Article 41 provides for specific administrative sanctions, but does not encompass the revocation of a license for operating games of chance. In addition, Claimants submit that the License vested the power of revocation in the Government of the Province of Salta, and not in ENREJA.459 Respondent by contrast argues that Article 13 of Law No. 7020 was applicable and provided the appropriate basis for ENREJA\u2019s revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license in Resolution No. 240/13.460\n\nReply on the Merits, paras. 300-304; see *supra* paras. 176-177. See also Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s IV, p. 46 (Exhibit C-300); Transcript, Day 5, p. 18.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 377-378; see *supra* paras. 254-256.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal observes a certain tension in the relationship between Article 13 of Law No. 7020 and the provisions of Articles 40 and 41, which were introduced in 2001. Both Article 13 and Articles 40 and 41 provide for sanctions in case of breaches of Law No. 7020 or of ENREJA\u2019s resolutions. Under Article 13, the most severe sanction is revocation of an operating license, whereas the most severe sanction under Article 41 of Law No. 7020 is a closure for a maximum of 30 days of the specific operation or venue where an infraction was committed. In addition, both Articles 13 and 40 of Law No. 7020 make it clear that infractions may also be prosecuted criminally. This overlap makes the Tribunal wonder what the relationship is between Article 13 of Law No. 7020 and the regime under Articles 40 and 41, which was introduced into that Law in 2001.\n\n373.\n\nRespondent\u2019s expert, Prof. Marcer, argued that Article 13 applied to licensees, while Articles 40 and 41 applied to licensees and other actors.461 The Tribunal, however, fails to understand this distinction, which would imply that until 2001, illegal operators of games of chance who did not have a license, could not be sanctioned under Law No. 7020. Besides, nothing in Article 13 indicates that its scope is restricted to licensees, and that Article 41 would apply to non-licensees. Similarly, Prof. Marcer's explanation that Articles 40 and 41 would set up a special regime for \"administrative\" infractions while Article 13 would allow to sanction \"punishable\" infractions, does not convince the Tribunal either.462 Pursuant to their wording, both Article 13 and Articles 40 and 41 apply to breaches of Law No.7020 and of ENREJA's resolutions.\n\nMarcer II, paras. 43-44.\n\nMarcer II, para. 102.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, furthermore, that in the past ENREJA had relied on Articles 40 and 41 when imposing fines for ENJASA's breaches of gaming regulations. For instance, in Resolution No. 161/13, ENREJA explicitly indicated that the sanctions were taken pursuant to Articles 40 *et seq.* of Law No. 7020.463 By contrast, in Resolution No. 240/13, ENREJA admitted that Article 40 as well as Article 13 conferred it competence to sanction breaches, but relied on Article 13 in order to revoke ENJASA's license, stating that the distinction between the possible penalties the two provisions provided for, was \"imperceptible.\"464 ENREJA did so, however, without acknowledging that there is a crucial difference between the revocation of an exclusive license, covering extensive operations and various sites, for the remaining duration of the term of the License - here 17.5 years - on the basis of Article 13, and the inability to operate specific sites on the basis of Articles 41 and 43, which cannot exceed the term of one year.\n\nResolution 161/13, p. 4 (Exhibit C-154).\n\nResolution 240/13, p. 33 (Exhibit C-031).\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Law No. 7133, while incorporating Articles 40 *et seq.* in Law No. 7020, did not expressly abrogate Article 13 of the latter Law. Article 6 of Law No. 7133, which introduced Article 53 into Law No 7020 and which stated that \"any other rule contrary to the provisions set forth herein shall be abrogated,\"465 did not apply to Article 13, as this Article is not incompatible with Articles 40 *et seq.* and is part of the very Law that Law No. 7133 amended. Besides, Law No. 7020, as published in the Official Gazette of the Province of Salta after the 2001 amendment, still contains Article 13.466 The Tribunal therefore holds that there are no convincing legal arguments to limit ENREJA's competence to impose sanctions for the violation of the regulatory framework established under Law No 7020 to those under Articles 40 *et seq.* and to deny ENREJA the sanctioning powers under Article 13 of Law No. 7020, which include the competence to revoke the License.467\n\nLaw No. 7133, Art 6 (Exhibit ARA-06).\n\nSee also Marcer II, paras. 106-108.\n\nFor the Dissent (i.e. paras. 140-143, 400-401) Arts. 13 and 41 have a clearly distinct scope of application, but the Dissent joins the Tribunal's majority in the conclusion that ENREJA was not prevented in principle to apply Art. 13 and issue the sanctions mentioned therein.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal also has taken note of Claimants\u2019 argument that Article 6 of the License only granted the Provincial Executive Branch the power to terminate the License in case of breach.468 The Tribunal, however, observes that the present case concerns the sanctioning by the regulatory authority, ENREJA, for breaches of the regulations and not the termination of the License for breach of the contractual relationship between Licensee and Licensor.469 Article 6 of the License can therefore not pre-empt ENREJA\u2019s exercise of supervisory and sanctioning powers under Article 13 of Law No. 7020.\n\nGarc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s IV, para. 28 (Exhibit C-300); Exhibit 1 to Decree 3616/99 (Exhibit C-048).\n\nSee also Mercer II, para. 105.\n\n***(c) ENREJA\u2019s Determinations of ENJASA\u2019s Breaches of the Regulatory Framework***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nNot only the lack of a legal basis, or the lack of competence of a domestic agency, for imposing a sanction can lead to arbitrariness under international law. Arbitrariness can also consist of an abuse of power. However, an investment treaty tribunal, which is not assuming the function of a domestic administrative court, but is reviewing the international legality of the administrative conduct in question, will not engage in reviewing the application of domestic law *de novo.* In the exercise of due deference, and taking into account that arbitrariness is more than a violation of *a* rule of law, but rather of *the* rule of law,470 the Tribunal\u2019s examination is limited to the issue of whether the decisions in question appear so manifestly incorrect that they must be deemed to constitute an abuse of power and thus constitute arbitrary conduct from the perspective of international law.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment (20 July 1989) [1989] ICJ Reports 15, 76, para. 128 (Exhibit ALRA-193).\n\n378.\n\nBased on this standard of review, the Tribunal finds a number of errors ENREJA has committed in the three investigations in Resolutions No. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12, and which were subsequently used to justify the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license in Resolution No. 240/13, that are so manifest that they must be considered to constitute an abuse of power and arbitrariness under international law. These errors encompass: (i) manifestly incorrect interpretations of several legal rules that form part of the regulatory framework; (ii) manifestly incorrect findings of fact; and/or (iii) combinations of both types of errors in the application of the regulatory framework in Resolution No. 240/13. Taken together, these errors lead the Tribunal to conclude that ENREJA, in revoking ENJASA's operating license, has abused its powers and acted arbitrarily under international law.\n\n***(i) Allegations in Resolution No. 380/12***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 380/12, in which ENREJA had charged ENJASA with having breached anti-money laundering rules in its lottery operations and by making a payment in respect of a prize won in a slot machine game, the Tribunal is unable to see how ENREJA could plausibly conclude that the rules on anti-money laundering in Resolution No. 26/00 (registration of the payment and of the identity of the winner in the anti-money laundering book) were seriously breached when the payment and registration of a prize of ARS 11,080 were delayed by some six weeks, justifying in combination with other infractions the revocation of ENJASA's license. Similarly, the Tribunal is unable to see how ENREJA could plausibly consider that the same rules on anti-money laundering were seriously breached when a prize of ARS 11,480 won on a slot machine on 14 May 2012, which had not yet been paid out, was only registered in the anti-money laundering book in full on 17 May 2012, after an inspection conducted by ENREJA on 16 May 2012, justifying in combination with other infractions the revocation of the License. In both cases, the Tribunal concludes that ENREJA's finding that ENJASA had breached the regulatory framework on anti-money laundering in respect of these two prizes appears manifestly unsupported in fact and law and must be considered to be arbitrary from the perspective of international law.\n\n380.\n\nBy contrast, as concerns the other two instances investigated in Resolution No. 380/12, that is (i) ENREJA's charge that ENJASA failed properly to register in the anti-money laundering book the payment of a prize of ARS 12,000 won on 30 January 2012, and (ii) the erroneous registration in the anti-money laundering book of an expired prize of ARS 15,000 won on 2 March 2012, the Tribunal is satisfied that ENREJA has committed no relevant errors in its finding of fact and in the interpretation of the regulatory framework. These two instances were therefore not objectionable from the perspective of international law.\n\n***(ii) Allegations in Resolution No. 381/12***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 381/12, which concerned alleged breaches of anti-money laundering rules in live games, the Tribunal considers that ENREJA has based its findings on ENJASA\u2019s breaches on manifestly incorrect interpretations of said rules. This holds true in respect of both the question of whether payments of prizes above ARS 10,000 had to be made by check prior to 1 May 2012 and the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n382.\n\nFirst, to the Tribunal, it is obvious that an express duty to make payments of prizes above ARS 10,000 by check or international money transfer was only introduced in ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 90/12, which became effective as of 1 May 2012. Before that date, the Tribunal is unable to see any legal basis in existing anti-money laundering legislation or regulations for requiring ENJASA to make payment of prizes above ARS 10,000 by check. In particular, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent\u2019s allegation that Law No. 7020 and Resolution No. 26/00, which both did not contain such a duty expressly, should nevertheless, following a \"comprehensive and harmonious interpretation\" be read as requiring the payment of prizes in excess of ARS 10,000 by check because otherwise such payments would be \"suspicious transactions\" that needed to be denounced under the anti-money laundering regulations in place.\n\n383.\n\nAs Respondent\u2019s expert, Prof. Marcer, himself has admitted, Article 13 is a provision that forms part of criminal administrative law.471 Consequently, the basic principle in criminal matters, *\"nullum crimen sine lege\"* should apply. As no legislative text clearly obliged the payment by check of the prizes in question, the payment of such prizes in cash alone cannot constitute a violation of the regulatory framework. This conclusion can also not be changed in light of the fact that ENREJA had imposed, on various occasions, sanctions on ENJASA for not paying prizes exceeding ARS 10,000 by check prior to the entry into force of Resolution No. 90/12,472 and that ENJASA had not only chosen not to contest those fines, but even accepted - through statements of its legal counsel at the time - that it was required to make payments of prizes above ARS 10,000 by check or international money transfer.473\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p.170. See also Marcer II, paras. 29 (stating that \"[f]acts must be analyzed in the light of the principles of criminal law\"), 43-45, 120-122; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 339; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 311-312.\n\nCf Dissent, para. 169 (mentioning that Resolution No. 240/13 lists for 2007-2008 at least 52 payments exceeding ARS 10,000, which allegedly did not comply with the requirements for such payments under Law No. 7020 and Resolution No. 26/00). The Tribunal's majority does not agree that imprecise provisions that carry criminal or criminal-law-like sanctions can be retroactively \"construed\" or \"concretized\" merely through subsequent administrative practice as the Dissent, para. 197 seems to suggest ENREJA was able to do, when it imposed sanctions on ENJASA for having made payments above ARS 10,000 other than through check or international money transfer in Resolutions Nos. 31/08, 32/08, 232/08, 104/10, 106/10, and 161/10.\n\nSee Letter from ENJASA to ENREJA of 30 August 2005 (Exhibit ARA-193); Letter from ENJASA to ENREJA of 14 April 2010 (Exhibit RA-173); Request for Reconsideration of 20 May 2010, p. 90 (Exhibit ARA-239); Respondent Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 156-160.\n\n384.\n\nSuch acceptances - and statements by ENJASA's then legal counsel - may have been made in light of the relative insignificance of the fines involved and may have been motivated by the desire not to cloud or burden the relations with ENREJA. Be that as it may, a subsequent administrative practice, even if accepted by the subjects of the law, cannot, in the Tribunal's view, result in the creation of a primary norm that would impose a legal obligation on ENJASA to the effect that future behaviour that is not forbidden by the letter of the law would turn into a breach of the law that could be enforced through sanctions, including through the revocation of ENJASA's operating license. Consequently, the charge in Resolution No. 381/12 that ENJASA had violated anti-money laundering rules by not paying prizes above ARS 10,000 by check in August and September 2011, lacks any justification in the applicable law and must be considered as arbitrary under international law.\n\n385.\n\nSecond, it is also obvious to the Tribunal that ENREJA manifestly disregarded the explicit one-year time-bar contained in Article 49 of Law No. 7020, as all alleged infractions investigated under Resolution No. 381/12 had been committed more than one year before the investigation started. In this context, the Tribunal does not follow Respondent's legal expert, Prof. Marcer, who argued that the explicit time bar contained in Law No. 7020 would not apply to breaches of Article 5 of the same law, given that the revocation of ENJASA's license was based on Article 13, not on Article 40 of Law No. 7020. Instead, Prof. Marcer argued that sanctions imposed on the basis of Article 13 of Law No. 7020 were covered by the 5-year statute of limitation under Argentina's federal criminal law.474\n\nMarcer II, paras. 43-44.\n\n386.\n\nHowever, there is simply nothing in Articles 5, 13, or 41 of Law No. 7020 that allows such a conclusion. On the contrary, as convincingly explained, in the Tribunal's view, by Claimants' experts, Prof. Garc\u00eda Pulles and Prof. Bianchi, under Argentine law, a shorter time bar, or statute of limitations, contained in a provincial statute prevails in respect of breaches of that statute over a longer time bar, or statute of limitations, under federal law.475 ENREJA could also not rely on ENJASA\u2019s recidivism to get around the applicable statute of limitations as there was no relevant prior unlawful disregard of anti-money laundering rules in the conduct of live games, which is the subject-matter Resolution No. 381/12 concerned. Consequently, the charge in Resolution No. 381/12 that ENJASA had violated anti-money laundering rules was also arbitrary from the perspective of international law because ENREJA clearly and manifestly violated the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nGarc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s IV, paras. 48-63 (Exhibit C-028); Bianchi IV, paras. 159-171 (Exhibit C-301); Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 373.\n\n387.\n\nFinally, in respect of the cash payments made to the two individuals in September 2011 in Casino Salta, the Tribunal observes that, because of the one-year statute of limitation, these payments cannot be the subject matter of an investigation that started in December 2012. However, even if no time-bar excluded the investigation in question, the Tribunal is not able to see which rule would have required ENJASA to make a payment by check in the underlying scenario. It seems that the only basis for an investigation could have been that ENREJA suspected the transactions in question to be part of a money laundering scheme. After all, only a finding of money laundering could have led to sanctions for breach of the regulatory framework in respect of these facts, but ENREJA has not demonstrated in Resolution No. 240/13 in any way that and how this had been the case.\n\n***(iii) Allegations in Resolution No. 384/12***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIn respect of Resolution No. 384/12, which charged ENJASA with hiring third operators without ENREJA\u2019s authorization in breach of Article 5(1) of Law No. 7020, the Tribunal considers that ENREJA has equally acted arbitrarily from the perspective of international law by basing its findings on either a manifestly incomprehensible interpretation of the concept of \"operator\" in the sense of Article 5 of Law No. 7020, a manifestly incorrect investigation into the facts, or a combination of both types of errors.\n\n389.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, ENREJA in a manifestly arbitrary manner considered Emsenor, Prodec, and DEK, as well as Video Dome to be \"operators\" of games of chance in the sense of Article 5 of Law No. 7020. While the term \"operator\" is an indeterminate legal concept, which is not further defined either in Law No. 7020 or any other instrument passed by ENREJA, the type of activities Emsenor, Prodec, and DEK, as well as Video Drome had engaged in, cannot, in the Tribunal's view, plausibly be considered to qualify as operating games of chance, which, as the experts of both Parties agree, requires responsibility for, control over, and exploitation of games of chance:476\n\n- As the factual record laid down in Resolution No. 240/13 indicates, the conclusion that Emsenor was an operator of games of chance was based on a contract with ENJASA in which the rent ENJASA paid to Emsenor for a slot machine hall in Salvador Mazza was calculated as a percentage of the profits ENJASA made from operating slot machines in the hall in question. The conclusion of such a rental agreement, however, does not plausibly turn Emsenor into an operator of games of chance.\n\n- Similarly, as the factual record laid down in Resolution No. 240/13 indicates, Prodec and its predecessor, DEK, had supplied hardware and software to ENJASA for jackpot systems and poker gaming tables for Casino Salta. This activity as well cannot plausibly be considered to turn Prodec and DEK into operators of games of chance.\n\n- Video Drome as well cannot plausibly be qualified as an operator of games of chance just because it provided ENJASA with slot machines for several slot machine halls against a fee that was dependent on the income generated from these slot machines, as Resolution No. 240/13 assumes.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 84 (Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s, stating that an operator is not the one \"supplying the ship,\" but the one \"steering the ship\"); p. 113 (Bianchi, stating \"the operator is the one who is responsible for the business, who runs the business\"); pp. 130, 197 (Marcer, stating that an operator is a person \"who carries out any of the activities of the license holder\", whose function is \"to exploit\", \"to operate\").\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal further considers that ENREJA in a manifestly arbitrary manner qualified Mr. Navarrete, New Star, and Mr. Colloricchio as unauthorized operators of games of chance. To the Tribunal it is clear, that these operators, and in the case of Mr. Colloricchio his two predecessors from whom he had taken over the slot machine halls, had been authorized to operate games of chance by BPAS, before ENJASA had been granted its exclusive license.477 While Respondent alleges that these authorisations had been cancelled, both in law and in fact, once ENJASA received its exclusive license, no contemporaneous document proves this allegation. On the contrary, in the Tribunal's view, ENREJA was aware of the continued activities of previously existing operators, including Mr. Navarrete, Mr. Colloricchio, and New Star, and did not protest against their continued operation.478 ENREJA had been informed by ENJASA that the previously existing operators contributed to ENJASA\u2019s license fee479 and it was informed of the roster of slot machines these individuals and entities operated.480\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62, Claimants Memorial on the Merits, paras. 115-120; Claimants' Reply, paras. 84-109.\n\nFor instance, ENREJA had received a copy of the contracts between ENJASA and Mr. Navarrete, respectively Mr. Colloricchio, and never objected to their continuing gaming operations; Agreement to Conduct Games of Chance of 29 September 2008 (Exhibit ARA-054). See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 188-189.\n\nExhibits C-361, C-319, and C-363.\n\nExhibits C-303, C-397, and C-398.\n\n391.\n\nIn this context, it is also telling that Resolution No. 384/12 now qualified the above entities and individuals as \"operators\" allegedly hired by ENJASA without ENREJA\u2019s authorization, while in earlier resolutions ENREJA had fined ENJASA as operator of the very same sites for breaches investigated under Resolution No. 3 84/12.481 One would assume that the alleged third operators should also have been sanctioned for operating games of chance without license or authorization of ENREJA, but at the time only ENJASA was sanctioned.482 This circumstance already puts into question ENREJA\u2019s thesis that these companies and persons were actual operators.\n\nMr. Collorichio, as per Resolution No. 384/12, allegedly operated the site in Rosario de la Frontera (Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 313), Mr. Navarrete the one in Salvador Mazza (Respondent Post-Hearing Brief, para. 94), New Star allegedly operated slot machines in Salvador Guemes, Met\u00e1n, and Rosario de la Frontera (Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 327) and Video Drome slot machines at Casino Golden Dreams, Met\u00e1n, JV Gonzalez, and Rosario de la Frontera (Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 323, referring to Letter Video Drome to ENREJA, 23 November 2012 (Exhibit C-171)), while Prodec and DEK allegedly also operated at Casino Golden Dreams and Casino Salta (Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 324-326).\n\nSee e.g. Resolution No. 153/10 (Guemes); Resolution No. 129/10 (Salvador Mazza); Resolution No. 200/10 (Met\u00e1n); Resolution No. 161/13 (Casino Salta); Resolutions Nos. 232/08, 46/10, 106/10, 104/10, 106/10, and 286/10 (Casino Golden Dreams).\n\n392.\n\nIndependently of the legal status of these three \"operators\" under domestic law, it cannot be plausibly considered that ENJASA had seriously breached its obligation under Article 5 of Law No. 7020 by hiring these \"operators\" without ENREJA\u2019s authorization. Mr. Navarrete, Mr. Colloricchio, and New Star had been authorized by BPAS and had been operating gaming sites for many years, without ever being disturbed in these operations. Between 1999, when ENJASA became the exclusive license holder, and 2012, that is, for 13 years, these operators frequently had been controlled by ENREJA and their activities had been ratified by ENREJA. After having known and accepted for such a long time these three operators, ENREJA could not in good faith, without any warning and without possibility to amend matters, take the most drastic sanction of revoking ENJASA\u2019s license.\n\n393.\n\nIn sum, of the seven allegedly unauthorized operators that ENJASA had hired, four were clearly not operating games of chance in the Province of Salta, but only rented the premises, supplied hard- and software, or provided slot machines to ENJASA. The three others had been authorized by BPAS to operate games of chance at one point in time before ENJASA had been granted the License. Since ENREJA, at the very least, had knowledge of this situation and tolerated it, if it had not even asked ENJASA to accept the continuous operation of these and other previously existing operators, as Claimants submit, it is a manifestly arbitrary application of Article 5 of Law No. 7020 to qualify ENJASA as having breached its duty not to hire operators of games of chance without ENREJA's authorization.\n\n394.\n\nIn sum, in the Tribunal's view, the investigations resulting from Resolution No. 384/12 clearly did not uncover any serious breaches that ENREJA relied upon in Resolution No. 240/13 to revoke ENJASA's license.\n\n***(iv) Conclusion on Allegations Underlying Resolution No. 240/13***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nIn examining the infractions ENREJA claimed ENJASA had committed in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12, the Tribunal concludes that ENREJA's findings on these infractions in Resolution No. 240/13 were, to a predominant extent, based on manifestly arbitrary determinations of fact and law. This included in particular ENREJA's interpretation of anti-money laundering rules, disregard for the applicable statute of limitations, the legal qualifications of certain facts, and/or disregard of its own long-time acceptance of certain facts. Taken together, these aspects show that ENREJA's overall findings on ENJASA's breaches of the regulatory framework made in Resolution No. 240/13 were arbitrary and not in accordance with the requirements of the rule of law under international law.\n\n396.\n\nENREJA's findings of breach in Resolution No. 240/13 that the Tribunal does not find fault with are essentially limited to certain issues with the registration of payments of prizes addressed in Resolution No. 380/12, namely the failure to properly register the payment of a prize of ARS 12,000 won on 30 January 2012 and the erroneous registration of an expired prize of ARS 15,000 won on 2 March 2012. These breaches, however, hardly could have justified a sanction as severe as revoking ENJASA's exclusive operating license (even if prior sanctions against ENJASA legitimately could be taken into account as indications of ENJASA's recidivism). The conclusion the Tribunal therefore draws is that ENREJA\u2019s determinations on many of ENJASA\u2019s breaches of the regulatory framework, and the consequences ENREJA attached to these determinations, namely the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, were arbitrary under international law.\n\n***(d) Proportionality of Resolution No. 240/13***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nA further aspect militating against qualifying the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license as a proper exercise of ENREJA\u2019s regulatory and supervisory powers concerns the lack of proportionality of the sanction imposed. In this context, the Tribunal notes that proportionality is not only a requirement in order for the exercise of a host State\u2019s regulatory powers to be carved out from the concept of indirect expropriation under international law (see *supra* paras. 336-337, 351); proportionality is also enshrined in the host State\u2019s domestic legal framework, both generally as a principle of administrative law, but also specifically in the regulatory framework governing games of chance in the Province of Salta.\n\n398.\n\nThus, Article 13 of Law No. 7020 explicitly requires that any sanction imposed by ENREJA has to be proportionate to the infractions committed. It states:\n\nThe punishment above shall be applied taking into consideration due proportionality between the penalties and the violation, notwithstanding the criminal liability and misdemeanor liability.\n\n399.\n\nSimilarly, Article 48 of Law No. 7020 not only requests proportionality with \"the gravity of the offense,\" but also more generally with\n\nthe damage caused upon the legal certainty, the morality and good customs, the consequences suffered by the Provincial Government and/or individuals, the social upheaval caused and the infringer\u2019s records of relapses.\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted before that nearly all the alleged infractions, which were the basis for the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, were based on manifestly ill-conceived and arbitrary interpretations and applications of the regulatory framework in place and can therefore not serve as legitimate grounds for the imposition of sanctions on ENJASA. First, many alleged breaches concerned an obligation that did not exist at the time, namely to pay prizes over ARS 10,000 by check. Second, the allegation that ENJASA had involved seven unauthorized operators was baseless: four of them were not operators, but had rented out premises to ENJASA, had provided slot machines, or had supplied software and hardware; the three others were previously authorized operators, which were known and accepted by ENREJA. Finally, all alleged infractions, which had been committed more than one year before ENREJA's investigations started on 11 December 2012 were time-barred under Article 49 of Law No. 7020.\n\n401.\n\nIf one detracts the above alleged breaches of the regulatory framework, what remains for ENREJA as a basis for imposing sanctions are the following minor breaches:\n\n- The failure to properly register one payment of ARS 12,000 for a prize won on 30 January 2012 in the lottery game *\"T\u00f3mbola\";* and\n\n- The erroneous registration of a prize of ARS 15,000 won on 2 March 2012 in the lottery game \"*T\u00f3mbola*\", which had already expired and was never paid.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal admits that these breaches could have been a valid ground for sanctions under the regulatory framework. They do not, however, in the Tribunal's view, indicate any systematic disregard by ENJASA of the regulatory framework, including the rules on the prohibition and prevention of money laundering. The Tribunal therefore considers that the revocation of a 30-year exclusive license, that was still to run for 17.5 years, covering many operations in different gaming sectors, constitutes a grossly disproportionate sanction for such minor infractions, which cannot be considered as complying with the international legal requirement of proportionality for a regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory powers.\n\n403.\n\nWhat is more, even if all allegations concerning ENJASA's breaches of the regulatory framework had been correct, that is, if ENJASA had illegally subcontracted certain of its activities to third operators and breached rules for the prevention of anti-money laundering as alleged by ENREJA, the Tribunal considers a revocation of ENJASA's license under the circumstances of the case to be a sanction that is disproportionate from the perspective of international law. This is so because ENREJA, in a manifestly erroneous manner, has failed to consider whether other equally effective measures had been available to prevent money laundering in the gaming sector short of revoking ENJASA's license and re-allocating its operations to third operators, and has not sufficiently taken into account the legitimate interests of ENJASA to continue exploitation of its exclusive 30-year license for the remaining time in devising the sanctions in Resolution No. 240/13.\n\n404.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that ENREJA had, as confirmed by several witnesses,483 not even considered the suspension of the License as a means to ensure future compliance of ENJASA with anti-money laundering rules, even though this would have clearly been a milder sanction that could arguably have had the same effect of ensuring compliance of ENJASA with the regulatory framework in place. Not considering whether a milder sanction could have been equally effective to ensure ENJASA\u2019s compliance with the regulatory framework is a further indication that ENREJA misused its discretion in sanctioning ENJASA\u2019s conduct in an arbitrary fashion. Furthermore, ENREJA\u2019s complete disregard of ENJASA\u2019s interest in continuing the exploitation, and of the impact of a revocation on the company\u2019s future business as well as on its past investments, indicates, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that ENREJA abused its discretion.\n\nSee Ms. Cainelli, Transcript, Day 7, pp. 16-17; Mr. S. Sylvester, Transcript, Day 7, pp. 211-213.\n\n405.\n\nWhat also needs to be taken into account in the evaluation of the seriousness of some of the infractions ENJASA allegedly had committed, is that ENJASA\u2019s business involved extensive operations and a large number of staff. With 328 employees, ENJASA operated four casinos and 15 slot machine halls with a total of 1,376 slot machines. Its four lottery operations involved the sale of 60,000 lottery tickets per day,484 employed 44 employees, and relied upon 700 lottery agencies; each week there were 17 draws.485 With such host of activities, it is inevitable that sometimes someone makes a mistake or that sometimes some rules are not complied with by someone, without such mistakes or non-compliances indicating or resulting in serious and systemically relevant breaches of the regulatory framework by ENJASA. Besides, the risk that someone sometimes does not apply the rules is the reason why ENJASA\u2019s activities had to be monitored by ENREJA, which had a full array of sanctions at its disposition to secure future compliance that fell short of revoking ENJASA\u2019s license.\n\nWS I Anselmi, para. 41 (Exhibit C-018).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that urgency did not command the withdrawal of ENJASA\u2019s license. ENJASA did not have a bad record at the time the License was revoked: in the two years before the investigations started that led up to the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license ENJASA had only been sanctioned once for negligent conduct in the handling of lottery drawings, which ENREJA admitted was merely imprudent, but not made in bad faith.486 ENJASA was also not engaged in acute money laundering, so that ENJASA's license had to be urgently revoked in order to prevent further money laundering and immediate harm.\n\n28 months between Resolution No. 200/10 of 27 July 2010 (Exhibit C-165) and 11 December 2012. See Resolution No. 178/12 of 10 July 2012 (Exhibit C-166).\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal finally observes that neither before the formal investigations, nor in the eight months between the start of this investigation in December 2012 and the revocation of the License, has ENREJA ever requested ENJASA to rectify the situation.487 For the Tribunal, ENREJA's disinterest in rectification is another sign of disproportionality under international law: it indicates that ENJASA's interests to continue operations for more than 17 years was not taken into account in graduating the sanction to be imposed, but that the interest of the Province was given unwavering priority.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 328.\n\n408.\n\nIn fact, compliance with anti-money laundering rules was clearly not a major consideration for ENREJA during the eight months between the initiation of the three investigations in December 2012 and the revocation of ENJASA's license in August 2013. Had the prevention of money laundering been the primary concern for ENREJA, the Tribunal would have expected ENREJA to take a more pro-active and expedited approach to request ENJASA to remedy whatever was wrong, such as the involvement of unauthorized operators whereby ENREJA could have issued a clear warning that, if the conduct in question was not remedied, ENJASA's license would be revoked. None of this happened. ENREJA's investigations were clearly geared towards stopping the operations, rather than aiming at remediation and ensuring future compliance of ENJASA with the regulatory framework in place.\n\n409.\n\nRevocation was even more disproportionate as ENREJA had not notified ENJASA concretely that future infringements could result in such revocation when sanctions were imposed in 2011, 2012, and 20 1 3.488 The only references to revocation, mentioned by Ms. Courel, one of ENREJA's lawyers, dated from 2010 and were unrelated to the issues under investigation in Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12.489\n\nSee Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 256.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 371-375; WS Courel, para. 36.\n\n410.\n\nRespondent has argued that nevertheless revocation was justified because of ENJASA's recidivism, given that ENREJA had already imposed the maximum possible fine in Resolution No. 161/13 (dated 28 May 2013) and that sanctions did not deter ENJASA, so that there was no other alternative than to revoke ENJASA\u2019s license.490\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 206-207.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Article 48 of Law No. 7020 allowed ENREJA to take into consideration the \"infringer\u2019s record of relapses\" to establish the fine to be imposed and that Resolution No. 240/13 indicated that the penalty was inter alia determined by ENJASA\u2019s \"background,\" listing the sanctions imposed since 2005.491 The Tribunal is also aware that ENREJA has sanctioned ENJASA for some twenty-one breaches of the anti-money laundering regulations, established in sixteen investigations in the years before ENJASA\u2019s license was revoked. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the sanctions imposed by ENREJA in its investigations prior to August 2013 gradually increased because of \"recidivism\" on the side of ENJASA as a graphic presented by Respondent (see *supra* para. 260) demonstrates.492\n\nResolution No. 240/13, pp. 29-31.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal also notes that it is unimpressed by Claimants' argument that these investigations and sanctions were groundless as ENREJA had confirmed in April 2008 that ENJASA had fully complied with its obligations in the Acta Acuerdo. This confirmation only recognized that ENJASA and its controlling shareholder had correctly performed the capital increase and had respected the other terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement of ENJASA's shares; the Acta Acuerdo did not address whether ENJASA had complied with the anti-money laundering regulations and could \u2013 of course \u2013 not cover compliance after 2008.\n\n412.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal finds some inconsistency in ENREJA\u2019s recourse to \"recidivism\" when increasing fines. In Resolutions Nos. 286/09, 39/10, and 46/10, ENREJA made it clear that the provision on \"recidivism\" would only be applied when the same type of infringement had been committed before. On the other hand, in Resolution No. 161/13 of 28 May 2013, which increased sanctions to the maximum permissible under Law No. 7020 in case of \"recidivism\", the original fine of ARS 100,000 for modifying prize limits and organizing a jackpot without ENREJA\u2019s authorization, was increased fivefold to ARS 500,000 because of prior conduct that relate to infringements that seemed to have nothing to do with the setting of prize limits and the conduct of live games.493 Resolution No. 240/13, in turn, should not be able to take into account the violations mentioned in Resolution No. 161/13 as an aggravating factor to justify the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, considering that Resolution No. 161/13 was unrelated to breaches concerning the correct registration and form of payment of prizes or the use of unauthorized third operators by ENJASA without ENREJA\u2019s authorization, which is what Resolution No. 240/13 took issue with.\n\nResolution No. 161/13 (Exhibit C-154) justifies this increase inter alia by referring to Resolutions Nos. 128/10 (Exhibit C-158), 129/10 (Exhibit C-159) (both relating to differences between slot machines in operation and those authorized), and 200/10 (Exhibit C-165) (concerning the opening of a gaming location without prior authorization of ENREJA).\n\n413.\n\nThe timing of the extraordinary increase for \"recidivism\" in Resolution No. 161/13 on 28 May 2013 is also striking, coming well after 11 December 2012, when the three investigations that ultimately resulted in the revocation of ENJASA's license had been initiated, and two months before the actual revocation of the License.\n\n414.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes an inconsistency in the testimony of different witnesses as to whether ENJASA's \"recidivism\" was actually taken into account. Thus, at the hearing, Mr. Sylvester, ENREJA's main legal advisor, who examined the file and recommended the revocation of ENJASA's license, denied that previous infractions were a motivating factor on the side of ENREJA and taken into account,494 while Ms. Cainelli testified that ENREJA took into account \"ENJASA's previous history.\"495 Unfortunately, Respondent has not submitted Mr. Sylvester's legal opinion underlying the revocation nor the minutes of the Board meeting where the revocation of ENJASA's license was decided.496\n\nTranscript, Day 7, p. 190.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, p. 195.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 155.\n\n415.\n\nIt is against this background that the Tribunal is not convinced that ENJASA's recidivism, even if it existed in the sense of the applicable domestic law, could have justified, in compliance with the principle of proportionality under international law, a sanction as severe as the revocation of ENJASA's license in the circumstances at hand, that is, without a clearer warning, and without having considered whether a suspension of the License for a certain time could have been an equally effective means to bring ENJASA back on the right track of complying with the regulations against money laundering in place in the Province of Salta, which ENJASA had left according to Resolution No. 240/13.\n\n416.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that other gaming jurisdictions, judging from their practices as presented by expert testimony during the proceeding, would not have revoked an operating license in similar circumstances. Claimants observed - and were not contradicted by Respondent - that in other major gaming countries, the alleged infractions - even if true - would not lead to a revocation of an operating license for games of chance.497 In this context, Claimants' expert, Mr. Bourgeois, testified that he did not know of any major gaming jurisdiction where the types of infractions ENJASA was charged with, if established, would have resulted in the revocation of an operating license.498 Moreover, in other Argentine provinces, similar infractions had been sanctioned by much milder penalties and not by the revocation of operating licenses.499\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 326.\n\nBourgeois Expert Report, p. 48 (Exhibit C-027).\n\nKusa Expert Report, pp. 22-24 (Exhibit C-302).\n\n417.\n\nIt is against this background that the Tribunal concludes that even if the allegations underlying Resolutions Nos. 380/12, 381/12, and 384/12 had been true, and their legal evaluation under domestic law accurate, a revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license would not have been proportionate under international law and would not have constituted a regular exercise of ENREJA\u2019s regulatory powers that would result in carving out the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license as an implementation of pre-existing limitations of the investor\u2019s rights from the concept of indirect expropriation.\n\n***(e) Respect of Due Process***\n--------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe internationally lawful exercise of regulatory powers not only requires that the measures the host State takes are proportionate and non-arbitrary, but also that due process under international law is respected. As has been held consistently in the jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals, (international) due process applies not only to judicial proceedings, but also to administrative proceedings that implement the regulatory framework in place in the host State, which is at issue in the present proceeding.500 Due process in this context requires, inter alia, that the administrative proceedings respect the right to be heard of those affected and that remedies exist for the review of the legality of the measures in question.501\n\nSee eg *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004) para. 98; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Arbitral Award (26 January 2006) para. 200. For a discussion of arbitral case law applying due process to administrative proceedings, see August Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments \u2013 The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press 2020) 398-402.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the content given to international due process in arbitral case law, see August Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments \u2013 The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press 2020) 420-427.\n\n419.\n\nClaimants claim that due process was violated in connection with the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license because ENJASA was restricted in defending against ENREJA\u2019s allegations. Claimants allege that Respondent breached elementary procedural guarantees by ENREJA, namely: (i) not warning ENJASA about the possible consequences of the administrative inquiries; (ii) completely disregarding without any reasoning the factual justifications brought forward by ENJASA; (iii) failing to respect ENJASA's right to be heard, as ENREJA provided a justification for the sanction imposed by Resolution No. 240/13, without analysing whether the conclusions were legally or factually correct; (iv) depriving ENJASA of a fair opportunity to present its defence, as ENJASA was unable to review the full file relating to the allegations made by ENREJA and was not given adequate time to respond to the administrative inquiries; and (v) revoking the License without adequate reasoning.502\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 328; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, paras. 293-299; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 394-400.\n\n420.\n\nRespondent by contrast submits that ENREJA followed a strict internal procedure with regard to the investigations underlying Resolution No. 240/13 and that the revocation of ENJASA's license itself complied with ENJASA's due process rights.503\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 214-215\n\n421.\n\nCertain of the issues that Claimants claim as violations of due process are matters the Tribunal has already dealt with in a different context. Thus, the Tribunal has addressed Claimants' arguments about the lack of a warning by ENREJA about the possible consequences of continued violations of the regulatory framework in the context of its assessment of whether the revocation of ENJASA's license was proportionate (see *supra* paras. 397-417). Beyond that context, the Tribunal is not able to see how international due process would require an administrative agency generally to give warnings to foreign investors about, or provide them with general information on, what the consequences are, or could be, under domestic law of an investor breaching domestic regulations. Arbitral awards that may be read as requiring such a broad duty of assistance of the host State vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investors, such as that of the tribunal in *Tecmed v. Mexico,**504* would overstretch what international law requires of domestic administrative agencies in terms of due process.\n\nSee *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003) para. 154 (Exhibit CL-008) (stating in the context of fair and equitable treatment that the host State is required \"in light of the good faith principle established by international law, \u2026 to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\").\n\n422.\n\nWith respect to the alleged violation of ENJASA's rights of defense flowing from international due process, the Tribunal notes that ENJASA had the formal opportunity to defend itself. Prof. Garc\u00eda Pull\u00e9s, Claimants' legal expert, admitted at the hearing that, once ENREJA had issued the formal notices of investigations in December 2012, ENJASA had some time to answer to the charges and submit evidence.505 Only as the investigations became more concrete with the months, did ENREJA reject, on 18 June 2013, in a reasoned decision, a request for clarification that ENJASA had submitted in respect of Resolution No. 384/12.506\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 36-47; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 217-218.\n\nRequest for Access and Clarification, 11 June 2013 (Exhibit C-175); Resolution No. 182/13 (Exhibit C-194).\n\n423.\n\nShortly thereafter, Resolution No. 240/13 revoked ENJASA\u2019s license. ENJASA criticized Resolution No. 240/13 because it allegedly distorted the facts and the law and did not address, one by one, ENJASA\u2019s extensive explanations. Claimants object that ENREJA dismissed ENJASA\u2019s explanations by merely considering them to be \"unclear and contradictory, revealing a disturbing anarchy in the management of the license.\"507\n\nResolution No. 240/13 (Exhibit C-031).\n\n424.\n\nENJASA thereafter was able to submit a detailed request for reconsideration against Resolution No. 240/13, but the decision to revoke ENJASA\u2019s license was confirmed by Resolution No. 315/13. For Claimants, Resolution No. 315/13 similarly misrepresented ENJASA\u2019s arguments.508 However, for Respondent\u2019s expert, Prof. Marcer, Resolution No. 315/13 amply addressed ENJASA\u2019s arguments:\n\nBy means of a lengthy resolution, *i.e.* Resolution 315-13, ENREJA analyzed and addressed all the arguments stated in the appeal for review, and denied the appeal.\n\n\u2026\n\nNo further analysis should be made in this regard given the abundant evidence found in the administrative files, which should be finally analyzed by the court; however, it may be concluded from the mere confrontation of the court records and the administrative acts on review, namely the resolution revoking the license and the resolution denying the appeal for review, that said resolutions were supported by the evidence on file.509\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 81.\n\nMarcer I, paras. 60 and 70 (emphasis added).\n\n425.\n\nENJASA then appealed ENREJA\u2019s resolutions before the First Instance Court of Salta, but, while the case was pending, it withdrew this recourse as instructed by the Decision on Jurisdiction in the present proceeding.510 The withdrawal notwithstanding, the possibility existed in principle for the judiciary of the Province of Salta to determine the legality of the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license under domestic law. To which extent this possibility for domestic recourse was effective, as required by international due process, is a matter that has not been made part of Claimants' claim on the merits before this Tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 472.\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal thus observes that, in these circumstances, it is unable to find a violation of any international due process rights, as claimed by Claimants. ENJASA has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to defend itself and to make submissions in the administrative proceedings conducted by ENREJA. ENREJA has also granted access to its files and gave reasons for why it rejected ENJASA's request for clarification. Finally, ENJASA was afforded access to the domestic courts in the Province of Salta to request a review of the legality of the revocation of the License. International due process has therefore been respected in the administrative proceedings leading up to the revocation of ENJASA's operating license and in access to domestic courts being granted for the review of the legality of ENREJA's measures.\n\n***(f) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n427.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has not found a breach of due process, its findings on arbitrariness and the lack of proportionality are sufficient to conclude that ENREJA did not properly use its regulatory, supervisory, and police powers when it decided, in Resolution No. 240/13, to revoke ENJASA's exclusive license and when it upheld that revocation in Resolution No. 315/13. The revocation of ENJASA's license, which inappropriately under international law ended what was left of ENJASA's 30-year exclusive gaming license, destroying both ENJASA's business operations and Claimants' investment in ENJASA and L&E, cannot be considered as a regular exercise of ENREJA's regulatory and supervisory powers that would carve out Respondent's conduct from the concept of indirect expropriation under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Consequently, the revocation and the subsequent transfer of its operation to third operators qualify as an indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in L&E and its indirect shareholding in ENJASA.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds that this indirect expropriation was unlawful as the revocation of ENJASA's license did not comply with the requirements international law sets for an internationally lawful exercise of the host State's police power. Such a measure does not fulfil the criteria Article 4(2) of the BIT sets up for a lawful expropriation, that is, the existence of a public purpose, the implementation of an expropriation in accordance with due process of law, and the payment of compensation.\n\n429.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Respondent is liable for breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n**2. Claim for Breach of Article 4(3) of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nClaimants also request the Tribunal to declare that \"[t]he Argentine Republic has breached Article 4(3) of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the license and the gaming operations of Claimants\u2019 subsidiary.\"511 As explained above (see *supra* paras. 327), Article 4(3) of the BIT allows a shareholder-investor an additional cause of action in case the company in which the investor holds shares is affected by an expropriation*.*\n\nClaimants Reply on the Merits, para. 644 (Request for Relief); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 584 (Request for Relief).\n\n431.\n\nClaimants consider their claim under Article 4(3) of the BIT (concerning a direct or indirect expropriation of ENJASA\u2019s assets) to be of an alternative nature to their claim under Article 4(1) and (2) (concerning an indirect expropriation of their shareholdings in L&E and/or ENJASA), as the claim for breach of Article 4(3) would duplicate large parts of the claim for breach of Article 4(1) and (2).512 Indeed, as an additional cause of action for shareholder-investors, Article 4(3) of the BIT would not give rise to any additional reparation or compensation because the factual matrix on which both claims rely overlap. After all, the compensation Claimants claim under Article 4(3) of the BIT is a consequence of the same measures that the Tribunal has found to have resulted in a breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.513\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 456-459.\n\nAs presented by Claimants, the breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT is the broader cause of action because it covers, Claimants allege, additional heads of damages not covered by Article 4(3) of the BIT, namely costs resulting from the liquidation of ENJASA in the amount of USD 2,753,882. See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 459.\n\n432.\n\nAccordingly, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to make a formal finding on Claimants\u2019 claim under Article 4(3) of the BIT. This claim is consumed by the Tribunal\u2019s findings on Respondent\u2019s liability under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. Against this background, it is also not necessary for the Tribunal to dwell in detail on the issue, which has divided the Parties, as to whether or not ENJASA\u2019s license qualifies as an \"asset\" or \"financial asset\" for protection under Article 4(3) of the BIT in light of the different language used by the Spanish and German versions of the BIT.514\n\nIt would seem, however, to the Tribunal that the German term \"*Verm\u00f6genswerte*\" and the Spanish term \"*activos financieros*\" in Article 4(3) of the BIT can both be read as referring to \"assets\" in the sense of Article 1(1) of the BIT. The additional term \"*financieros*\" in Article 4(3) would simply seem to indicate that the assets of a locally incorporated company that were subject to expropriation have to have a financial value, without however intending to limit the class of protected assets under Article 4(3) to \"financial assets\", whatever that term may mean. Both authentic versions of the BIT would therefore have the same meaning and cover ENJASA's license as an asset with financial value, without the need to have recourse to Article 33(4) of the VCLT to resolve a difference in meaning between both treaty texts.\n\n**C. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nClaimants also request the Tribunal to declare that Respondent has breached Article 2(1) of the BIT by failing to accord their investment fair and equitable treatment. Article 2(1) of the BIT, in the English translation agreed upon by the Parties, reads:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall encourage, in its territory and to the possible extent, the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, admitting such investments in accordance with its legislation and according at all times fair and equitable treatment.\n\n434.\n\nThe Parties have extensively argued in their submissions and at the hearing whether Respondent, through the authorities of the Province of Salta, has respected the fair and equitable treatment standard. They have, inter alia, discussed whether the fair and equitable treatment standard enshrined in the BIT is different from the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, whether the authorities in Salta harassed ENJASA and thereby breached fair and equitable treatment, whether ENREJA had violated due process as required by fair and equitable treatment, and to which extent Claimants were entitled to the protection of legitimate expectations under Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that initially Claimants had argued that ENJASA was not only not treated fairly and equitably in the process directly leading up to the revocation of the License and in the confirmation of this revocation, but that ENREJA's conduct was permeated by a consistent pattern of bad faith and that ENREJA was visibly searching for pretexts to impose fines also in the administrative proceedings conducted between the year 2008 and May 2013.515 However, Claimants ultimately limited their claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment to the question of whether the revocation of ENJASA's license, and the administrative proceedings related to it, have been proper under the BIT. In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants concluded their analysis of the breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT by stating:\n\nThe revocation of the license falls short of the essential elements of fair and equitable treatment. The Argentine Republic has thus breached Art. 2(1) of the BIT and is under an obligation to pay damages to Claimants.516\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 430-433.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 454.\n\n436.\n\nClaimants have not submitted, however, any additional claims for damages or compensation resulting from breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT other than those arising from the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license.517 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the claim for compensation under Article 2(1) of the BIT therefore duplicates Claimants\u2019 claim for compensation for expropriation under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\nThe overview of Claimants' claim for damages considers the claim under Article 4(3) to be an alternative claim for the claim under Article 4(1) and 2 of the BIT, but does not mention the relationship to the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment. See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 456-459. In the discussion on quantum, Claimants state that the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment would entail the same standard for calculating reparation. See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 481.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal, in other words, is therefore not called upon to assess the lawfulness under Article 2(1) of the BIT of any measure taken, or conduct engaged in, by the authorities of the Province of Salta other than those already analyzed above under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. The Tribunal is also not called upon to decide whether the remedies that a breach of Article 2(1) would give rise to differ from those that Claimants are entitled to for breach of Article 4(1) and (2), which the Tribunal has already established.\n\n438.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to make a formal finding on Claimants\u2019 claim for breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT. Although the Tribunal\u2019s findings made in the context of its analysis of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT that the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license did not constitute a lawful exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory and supervisory powers, but was arbitrary and disproportionate, and constituted an abuse of ENREJA\u2019s powers, would translate one-to-one into a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in Article 2(1) of the BIT, this claim is consumed by the Tribunal\u2019s findings on Respondent\u2019s liability under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. As a consequence, the Tribunal makes no formal finding as to a breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**D. Conclusion on Respondent\u2019s Liability**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal therefore finds that Respondent is internationally responsible for breach of Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT because the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s operating license by ENREJA and the subsequent transfer of ENJASA\u2019s business to new operators constituted an unlawful expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment under the BIT.\n\n**VII.** **Q****uantum**\n------------------------\n\n**A. Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nAs a consequence of the Tribunal's finding that Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT by unlawfully subjecting Claimants' investment to an indirect expropriation, Claimants are entitled to full reparation pursuant to the law on State responsibility. As the Permanent Court of International Justice has held in a time-honored statement on the consequences of a State's conduct that breaches international law:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act ... is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.518\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Claim for indemnity) (Germany v. Poland)* (13 September 1928) PCIJ Ser. A, No. 17 para. 47 (Exhibit CL-028).\n\n441.\n\nThis statement of principle reflects the state of customary international law, has been applied in a consistent line of jurisprudence by international courts and tribunals, in the field of foreign investment and beyond,519 and is enshrined in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles. This provision stipulates that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" Since restitution of Claimants to the *status quo ante* by reinstating ENJASA's exclusive license for the remaining term until 23 September 2029 is neither requested, nor suggested by the Parties, nor is it materially possible, the only form of reparation in question in the present proceeding is compensation in the sense of Article 36 of the ILC Articles. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of that provision, Respondent \"is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused\"; pursuant to paragraph 2 of the same provision \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\" Claimants, in other words, have to be put economically into the position they would, in all probability, have been in but for the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license.\n\nSee e.g. *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (2 October 2006) paras. 480-494; *Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award (16 September 2015) paras. 326-328 (Exhibit CL-030); *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, PCA Case No 2009-04, Award on Damages (10 January 2019) para. 108. For case law of other international courts and tribunals, see e.g. *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay)*, Judgment (20 April 2010) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 103-104, para. 273; *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo)*, Judgment (30 November 2010) [2010] ICJ Report 639, 691, para. 161; *Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) (Compensation)* Judgment (2 February 2018) [2018] ICJ Reports 15, 25-26, paras. 29-31; *The M/V \"Virginia G\" Case (Panama/Guinea-Bissau)*, Judgment (14 April 2014) [2014] ITLOS Reports 4, 116-188, paras. 428-433.\n\n442.\n\nRespondent\u2019s duty to provide full reparation encompasses both compensation for the value of the expropriated investment, that is, Claimants\u2019 direct shareholding in L&E and its indirect shareholding in ENJASA, as well as any consequential damages that were caused as a result of the unlawful expropriation and that Claimants would not have incurred but for Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct. In this context, the Tribunal observes that there must be a proximate causal link between the violation of international law and the injury caused to Claimants. Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles confirms that only \"the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\" has to be fully repaired*.* By contrast, hypothetical, speculative as well as undetermined and remote damage cannot be compensated. Moreover, the burden of proof in respect of causation and the amount of damages lies with Claimants.520\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent's position. See Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 633; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 509-511. See also *Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) (Compensation)* Judgment (2 February 2018) [2018] ICJ Reports 15, 26, para. 32.\n\n443.\n\nIn the following, the Tribunal will first turn to the valuation of Claimants\u2019 investment, that is, their direct shareholding in L&E, and/or their indirect shareholding in ENJASA, and make determinations on a number of contested aspects of valuation between the Parties and their experts (B.). The Tribunal will then turn to Claimants\u2019 claim for consequential damages (C.). Finally, questions concerning the payment of interest will be addressed (D.).\n\n**B. Valuation of Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nClaimants and Respondent, as well as their respective quantum experts, Mr. Howard Rosen and Dr. Jos\u00e9 P. Dapena, have extensively and in much detail argued the quantum of the compensation due. They agree on certain issues concerning the valuation of Claimants' investment, namely the use of the discounted cash flow (\"**DCF**\") method.521 This method requires the reconstruction of the lost cash flow over the years reduced by a discount rate, reflecting the financial value of expected future cash flows over the years from the valuation date until the end of ENJASA's license.\n\nIn spite of the Parties' agreement to value the compensation on the basis of lost income and discounted cash flow, the Dissent (i.a. paras. 338-347, 422, 426) considers compensation on the basis of the capital invested and the value of assets more appropriate, inter alia because it considers the assessment of future profits and their discounts to bring them to the level of the Valuation Date as too speculative. The Tribunal's majority, by contrast, follows the Parties' joint approach to value Claimants' investments at the Valuation Date on the basis of the discounted cash flow, discussing and deciding various issues both sides considered relevant for determining the relevant cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. It is against this background that the Tribunal also sees no need to address in any further depth an issue the Dissent raises as a factor that would reduce compensation, which has not been raised by either Party in the context of determining quantum. Contrary to the Dissent, paras. 31-32, 304, 380(6), 439-446, the Tribunal's majority fails to see any indications for Claimants' contribution to injury pursuant to Article 39 of the ILC Articles, either in the form of contributory fault to Respondent's internationally wrongful conduct because ENJASA's prior breaches of the regulatory framework may have contributed to the revocation of its License, or as a violation of a duty to mitigate damages after the revocation has taken place because Claimants did not accept the offer to continue operating Casino Salta and did not participate in the process for applying for new operating licenses. As already stated above (see *supra* para. 354), after ENJASA's license was revoked, Claimants were not obliged to apply for new licenses under less favorable conditions or continue to operate Casino Salta, while relinquishing all other operations that formed part of ENJASA's former exclusivity.\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the DCF approach is the most appropriate valuation methodology to establish the losses suffered by Claimants because of the unlawful revocation of ENJASA's license, which otherwise would still have continued to be in force until 23 September 2029.522 Even though ENJASA remained a going concern for a few months after 13 August 2013, all of its activities finally had to be wound down in November 2013 when ENREJA rejected ENJASA's Request for Reconsideration and the transfer of ENJASA's gaming operations to third operators was implemented. This brought ENJASA's activities in the gaming sector in Salta and its ability to generate cash flows to a halt and directly affected the profitability of Claimants' entire investment, that is, their direct shareholding in L&E, and their indirect shareholding in ENJASA. The capacity of ENJASA to generate future cash flows hinged on the existence of ENJASA's license. Conversely, essentially all of the value of ENJASA, as well as of L&E, was in ENJASA's license.\n\nContrary to the Dissent, para. 427, in the view of the Tribunal's majority, for purposes of determining future cash flows, one has to assume that ENJASA's license continues to exist until its original term in September 2029 and disregard the possibility that the License could be legitimately revoked because of some illegal future conduct of ENJASA. The value of ENJASA and/or L&E at the Valuation Date is based on the assumption of future compliance of ENJASA with the law, so that potential future illegal conduct of ENJASA cannot reduce its value at the Valuation Date.\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties also agree that the compensation due for Claimants' shareholding in L&E and/or ENJASA has to be evaluated at the moment immediately preceding the issuance of ENREJA\u2019s Resolution No. 240/13, which revoked ENJASA\u2019s license and put the indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in motion.523 For Claimants, the valuation date should be 12 August 2013, which is the day immediately preceding the day Resolution No. 240/13 was issued.524 For Respondent, the valuation date should be 13 August 2013 itself, but just before Resolution No. 240/13 was issued.525 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the resulting difference of a few hours is immaterial for purposes of valuation. The Tribunal will therefore adopt 13 August 2013 as the Valuation Date in respect of Claimants\u2019 investment, with the understanding that the projection of cash flows is to be carried out on that day prior to the issuance of Resolution No. 240/13.\n\nThis is also reflected in Article 4(2) of the BIT which states that in case of lawful expropriation \"compensation shall be the value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation \u2026.\". The same date for purposes of valuation must also apply in case of an unlawful expropriation, as in the present case.\n\nClaimants Memorial on the Merits, paras. 456-457; Claimants Reply on the Merits, para. 597.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, footnote 884.\n\n447.\n\nIn the context of valuing Claimants\u2019 investment, the Parties and their experts disagree, however, on a range of issues. These include: 1) the valuation model to be used to determine the value of Claimants\u2019 60% shareholding in L&E and/or ENJASA; 2) the basis for projecting future cash flows, including the relevance of cash flows generated by Cachi Valle from the Joint Venture with ENJASA relating to Casino Salta, cash flows following the end of the Joint Venture Agreement between ENJASA and Video Drome on 31 December 2013, and cash flows relating to the Sheraton Hotel in Salta; 3) the determination of the applicable discount rate; and 4) the applicable exchange rate. After setting out the respective positions of the Parties, the Tribunal will address these issues in turn.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Approach**\n--------------------------\n\n***a) Valuation Model***\n------------------------\n\n448.\n\nClaimants observe that the \"value of the investment\" is the \"fair value\", and not the \"fair market value.\" Their expert, Mr. Rosen, distinguishes the \"fair market value,\" i.e., the price in an arms-length transaction at which a hypothetical and willing buyer would buy from a hypothetical and willing seller in an unrestricted market,526 from the \"fair value,\" which takes into account the respective advantages or disadvantages that the parties will gain from the transaction, including specific synergies, such as those alleged to relate to Claimants' debt/equity ratio.527\n\nRosen II, para. 11.20; Transcript, Day 8, p. 93.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, paras. 477, 484.\n\n449.\n\nClaimants disagree with Dr. Dapena that the valuation of ENJASA's operations is to be based upon the free cash flow to equity holders that was lost from 13 August 2013 until the end of ENJASA's exclusive license on 23 September 2029. They observe that, while a valuation based upon lost dividends as suggested by Dr. Dapena may be appropriate in cases where the continuity of the business is only impaired,528 or where the shareholders are not fully managing the company,529 it is not appropriate for valuing a company, whose business is definitely destroyed and whose activities are stopped, as is the case in the present circumstances where the revocation of the License ended ENJASA's gaming operations and lead to ENJASA and L&E being wound up.530\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 500.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 502.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, paras. 494-499. The Sheraton Hotel Salta continued operations a few years after this revocation, but was sold in 2017.\n\n450.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, Claimants as shareholders in ENJASA and L&E did not only receive dividends, but also a yearly fee as compensation for the use of trademarks and logos and shared know-how.531 To limit the analysis to dividends lost would therefore not fully compensate Claimants' loss.532 Consequently, for Claimants, the value of their investment is best established as a percentage of the value of L&E and ENJASA as a whole, corresponding to their respective shareholding at the Valuation Date.533\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.46-8.51.\n\nRosen, Transcript, Day 8, p. 219.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 456.\n\n***b) Relevant Cash Flow***\n---------------------------\n\n451.\n\nTo determine the cash flow related to Claimants' investment in Argentina, that is, their shareholding in L&E, Mr. Rosen determined the entirety of the cash flows that stem from operations that are connected to ENJASA's exclusive license. This License, Mr. Rosen explained, constitutes almost the entire value (98.8%) of L&E.534\n\nRosen II, para. 4.10: Claimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 471.\n\n452.\n\nIn order to establish the cash flow related to ENJASA, Mr. Rosen offers two valuation scenarios. In his Scenario One, he bases his forecasts, where possible, on actual figures, excluding non-recurring costs and revenues. These include (i) ENJASA's actual results prior to the Valuation Date, and (ii) financial projections that were prepared by ENJASA\u2019s management in the normal course of business (i.e., prior to the Valuation Date), with adjustments where necessary.535 Mr. Rosen observes that his estimates of the actual monthly results of ENJASA for 2013 tied well into ENJASA\u2019s audited statements for 2012 and 2013.536\n\nRosen I, para. 9.22; Rosen II, paras. 2.3, 5.7.\n\nRosen II, paras. 7.19-7.23.\n\n453.\n\nThe forecasts of future cash flows, Mr. Rosen points out, are mainly based upon ENJASA\u2019s monthly results in 2013 and not upon projections founded upon contemporaneous management decisions. Moreover, Mr. Rosen observes that forecasts would be distorted if they were only based upon historical data and not take into account management decisions.537 Mr. Rosen therefore additionally considers management projections, which were prepared in the normal course of business before Claimants or ENJASA had knowledge of the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license; in Mr. Rosen\u2019s view, these projections would be inappropriate to ignore.538 For Claimants, the fact that these forecasts were not audited, does not make them less credible as they are supported by contemporaneous documents, such as historical purchase prices of slot machines and agreements for salary increases.539\n\nRosen II, paras. 5.9, 7.19.\n\nRosen II, paras. 5.9, 7.12-7.15.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, paras. 520-521.\n\n454.\n\nHowever, in order to respond to criticism of Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dapena, concerning the use of actual data from 2013, Mr. Rosen worked out an alternative valuation, that is, his Scenario Two, in which he relied less on projections and was closer to ENJASA\u2019s historical data, in particular ENJASA\u2019s 2012 audited financial statement. However, Mr. Rosen considers his alternative Scenario Two valuation to be incorrect and maintains that ENJASA\u2019s contemporaneous projections must be taken into account.540\n\nRosen II, Schedule 2, paras. A2.13-A2.14.\n\n455.\n\nFor both scenarios, Mr. Rosen made certain adjustments to the future projected cash flows. A first adjustment concerns the termination of the Joint Venture between ENJASA and Video Drome, which was to take place, Claimants claim, on 31 December 2013.541 This termination, for Claimants, was certain by the Valuation Date, as ENJASA and Video Drome had already informed ENREJA of it542 and ENREJA had accepted the termination.543 As a result of the termination of the Joint Venture, ENJASA would have to acquire slot machines, but was going to keep the total income generated by all slot machines formerly operated by Video Drome under the Joint Venture Agreement. On the basis of the financial information of the Joint Venture, ENJASA's projected cash flow included the expenditures for the acquisition of slot machines as well as the increased cash flow that would result from the termination of the Joint Venture with Video Drome from January 2014 onwards.544\n\nRosen II, para. 7.8.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 513; Note from ENJASA to ENREJA of 23 July 2012 (Exhibit ARA-028); Letter from Video Drome to ENREJA of 23 November 2013 (Exhibit C-171); Hearing Transcript, Day 8, pp. 184-189.\n\nENREJA's Interlocutory Order of November 2012 (Exhibit ARA-055); Claimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 513.\n\nRosen II, para. 7.34; Claimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 515.\n\n456.\n\nMr. Rosen's projected future cash flows of ENJASA also took account of a planned new construction to house ENJASA's headquarters and part of the Casino Golden Dreams.545 The implementation of these plans would have triggered non-recurring expenditures in a \"but for\"-analysis, but also account for future savings for rent. Salary increases, agreed for the end of 2013, were also taken into account in Mr. Rosen's projections of future cash flows as they would have had an impact on those future cash flows, a matter that is not reflected in ENJASA's historical financial statements.546\n\nRosen II, para. 7.8.\n\nRosen II, para. 7.54.\n\n457.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Rosen considers that for the valuation of Claimants' investment the cash flows from the Joint Venture between ENJASA and Cachi Valle concerning the operation of Casino Salta had to be included entirely, that is, including the 30% of the cash flows from the joint venture that are allocated to Cachi Valle. The reason for this is, as Mr. Rosen explains, that Cachi Valle was a wholly owned subsidiary of L&E so that Claimants would also be entitled to the share of profits received by Cachi Valle as shareholders in L&E. In order to place Claimants back into the financial position they would be in but for the breaches of the BIT by Respondent, the cash flows that would have been generated through Cachi Valle have to be included in valuing Claimants' investment in L&E.\n\n458.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Rosen did not include ENJASA's non-gaming related operations in his projections of Claimants' future cash flows, most importantly cash flows relating to the operation of the Sheraton Hotel in Salta.547 Mr. Rosen explains that the non-gaming operations had not been impacted by the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license and would therefore not be affected in a \"but for\"-analysis. Moreover, the Hotel, Claimants argue, has always been a \"big loss.\"548 Audited financial statements, Claimants point out, show that the hotel did not generate any profit, neither before, nor after the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license.549\n\nRosen II, paras. 6.8-6.13.\n\nWitness Schreiner, Transcript, Day 2, p. 161.\n\nMr. Rosen's Opening Statement, Slide 80.\n\n459.\n\nIn respect of Dr. Dapena\u2019s determination of future cash flows, Claimants disagree with how Respondent has allocated ENJASA\u2019s expenses between the hotel and the gaming operations on the basis of its 2014 statements. ENJASA\u2019s 2014 financial statements, Claimants point out, contain hindsight information that was not available at the Valuation Date on 13 August 2013. Moreover, ENJASA\u2019s actual monthly results for 2013, as well as the notes to its 2012 audited financial statements, already provide a breakdown of ENJASA\u2019s expenses between the gaming and hotel operations.550 In addition, Mr. Rosen observes that, in his valuation of ENJASA, Dr. Dapena erroneously did not include the revenue ENJASA earned from the sale of food, beverages, and other products in its casinos.551\n\nRosen II, paras. 7.22-7.23, 8.7-8.11.\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.4-8.6.\n\n460.\n\nFor Mr. Rosen, Dr. Dapena\u2019s pro-ration of ENJASA\u2019s forecasted cash flows for the period 2013 to 2029 contains a technical error, resulting in both an understatement and an overstatement of the forecasted cash flows in the relevant period.552 In Mr. Rosen\u2019s view, Dr. Dapena should have carried forward its working capital adjustment beyond 2013, resulting in a mathematical inconsistency that materially understates the valuation of ENJASA.553 Dr. Dapena should furthermore have maintained internal consistency in his financial model and relied upon the most recent financial statements available. He should thus not have relied on ENJASA\u2019s balance sheet of 30 June 2013, but on ENJASA\u2019s balance sheet of 31 December 2013.554\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.18-8.22.\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.19-8.31.\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.32-8.36.\n\n461.\n\nFurthermore, for Mr. Rosen, Dr. Dapena inappropriately assumed that ENJASA would repay all the bank debt that it held prior to the Valuation Date by the end of 2013. The loan repayment schedule, however, showed that the debt would have only been fully repaid by the middle of 2015 and ENJASA's management had decided prior to the Valuation Date to maintain a certain amount of financial debt.555\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.37-8.40; Appendix 2.\n\n462.\n\nMr. Rosen further observes that Dr. Dapena erroneously assumed that the annual capital expenditure between 2013 and 2029 would be consistent with the exceptionally high expenditure incurred by ENJASA in 2012. For Mr. Rosen, Dr. Dapena thus materially overstated the amount of ENJASA's capital expenditures.556 Mr. Rosen also points out that Dr. Dapena incorrectly deducted the Management Know How Fees that ENJASA paid to CAI from ENJASA's net operating profits, because, for Dr. Dapena, a buyer could decide to discontinue the payment of these discretionary management fees after the acquisition of ENJASA. For Mr. Rosen, these fees were, like dividends, a device to transfer funds to CAI and should therefore not be deducted.557\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.41-8.44.\n\nRosen II, paras. 8.46-8.51.\n\n***c) Discount Rate***\n----------------------\n\n463.\n\nTo establish the discounted cash flow, Mr. Rosen first determines the Risk-Free Rate, i.e., the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk, at 3.39%, which is based on the United States 20-year treasury bond yield at the Valuation Date. Mr. Rosen in turn rejects the risk-free rate used by Dr. Dapena, which is based on the average yield on United States 10-year treasury bonds from the years 1962 to 2013 (see *infra* para. 499) as inappropriate, as this risk rate is outdated to assess ENJASA's expected cost of capital for the years from 2013 to 2029.558 On the basis of his own risk-free rate, Mr. Rosen then estimates that the Equity Risk Premium, i.e., the excess return that an investment in stock provides over a risk-free investment, would be 5.46%.\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.12-9.19.\n\n464.\n\nFor the Industry Beta, which reflects the systematic risk that is similar for all businesses in a specific industry, Mr. Rosen retained different Industry Betas for each of ENJASA's gaming operations, namely lotteries, slot machines, and live games. In allocating cash flows, he relies on the breakdown of cash flows to these different business units in ENJASA's financial statements.559\n\nRosen II, para. 7.21.\n\n465.\n\nMr. Rosen considers this approach to be superior to that adopted by Respondent's expert, Dr. Dapena, who did not disaggregate cash flows for the different gaming operations of ENJASA and used one single industry beta for ENJASA as a whole (see *infra* para. 501). For Mr. Rosen, it would be incorrect to consider all activities of ENJASA to form part of one single business unit in the gaming/hotel sector. ENJASA\u2019s hotel and gaming business operations were not horizontally integrated and did not operate in the same industry segment. Only a small fraction of ENJASA\u2019s gaming operation, namely the operation of Casino Salta, which represented less than 5% of ENJASA\u2019s net revenue in 2013, was somewhat integrated with the operation of the Hotel.560 As a result, Mr. Rosen insists on applying different discount rates for each of ENJASA\u2019s gaming segments.\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.20-9.24.\n\n466.\n\nMoreover, for Mr. Rosen, Dr. Dapena fails to consider the different levels of risk associated with ENJASA\u2019s lottery operations versus its operation of slot machines and live games. Mr. Rosen explains that prospective purchasers commonly view companies that engage in different business areas as a collection of different cash flows with different risks attached. With reference to a paper written by Professor Damodaran, Mr. Rosen submits that it is considered preferable among valuation professionals to value different business segments independently, when possible.561 For Mr. Rosen, ENJASA\u2019s lottery operations had a lower risk level; these operations existed independently of the rest of ENJASA\u2019s business and did neither require buildings to be leased or constructed nor the acquisition, maintenance, and replacement of any capital assets, such as slot machines and gaming tables, which were needed in the operation of live games.562\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.3-9.11.\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.10-9.11.\n\n467.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Rosen initially opted for levered Betas, and for unlevered Betas in his Second Report.563 If levered, the expected cash flow to the equity holders is considered and discounted at the cost of equity to provide the value of the equity; if unlevered, the expected cash flow to the company is considered and discounted to provide the enterprise value.564 However, for Mr. Rosen, \"the levered and the unlevered approach should in theory be the same as long as the approaches utilize consistent assumptions about the level of financial leverage.\"565 Therefore, under both approaches, Mr. Rosen concludes that the relevant industry betas were respectively 1.10, 2.51, and 2.44 for lotteries, slot machines, and live games.566\n\nRosen I, Schedule 3; Rosen II, para. 9.45.\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.40-9.41.\n\nRosen II, para. 9.44.\n\nRosen I, Schedules 3; Rosen II, para. 9.70.\n\n468.\n\nThe Adjusted Equity Risk Premium, i.e., the equity risk premium, multiplied by the Industry Betas to reflect how much the stock in specific businesses will outperform risk-free debt instruments, was estimated for ENJASA's operation of lotteries, slot machines, and live-games at 5.98%, 13.73%, and 13.32% respectively.\n\n469.\n\nFor Mr. Rosen, the Country Risk Premium, i.e., the additional premium to compensate investors for the higher risk associated with investing in a foreign country, compared with investing in their domestic market, was 6% for Argentina in August 2013. In this context, Mr. Rosen also points out that he disagrees with Dr. Dapena's approach to determining the Country Risk Premium (see *infra* para. 505). For Mr. Rosen, the Country Risk Premium should not be based upon the return rate of public bonds, but on commercial profits. Moreover, the Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (\"**EMBI+**\") used by Dr. Dapena was too volatile to be a benchmark.567\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.38-9.62.\n\n470.\n\nMr. Rosen used a debt/equity ratio of 75.20%/24.80% to calculate the Weighted Average Capital Cost (\"**WACC**\"). This ratio represented the actual debt/equity ratio of Casinos Austria and should be used because the investment in L&E, and thus indirectly in ENJASA, were made by Casinos Austria.568 Moreover, the actual debt/equity ratio came close to the optimal capital structure for ENJASA and/or L&E, which involves a debt/equity ratio of 75%/25%.569 As the cost of debt in his WACC valuation, Mr. Rosen likewise focused on Casinos Austria and used the interest rate for which Casinos Austria could borrow money on the Austrian market, i.e., 4.12% after taxes. He thus obtained a WACC of 8% for the totality of ENJASA's operations.570\n\nRosen II, para. 9.70.\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.25-9.37.\n\nThis is based on the WACC of 7%, 9 %, and 9%, for lotteries, slot machines, and live games operations respectively.\n\n471.\n\nWith an assumed USD inflation rate of 2.30%, the discount rates obtained by Mr. Rosen were between 5 and 7%, with an average of 6%.571\n\nRosen II, para. 9.68.\n\n472.\n\nMr. Rosen's presentation at the hearing included his Slide 14, which reproduced the above data per business unit, but also gave the over-the-board average for ENJASA:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Rosen Report** |\n| **Lotteries Operation Beta** | **Slot Machine Operation Beta** | **Live Games Operation Beta** | **Average** |\n| Risk Free Rate572 | [A] | 3.39% | 3.39% | 3.39% | 3.39% |\n| Equity Risk Premium573 | [B] | 5.46% | 5.46% | 5.46% | 5.46% |\n| *Industry Beta (Unlevered)* |  | *0.30* | *0.69* | *0.67* | *0.55* |\n| Industry Beta (Relevered) | [C] | 1.10 | 2.51 | 2.44 | 2.02 |\n| Adjusted Equity Risk Premium | [D] = [B] x [C] | 5.98% | 13.73% | 13.32% | 11.01% |\n| Country Premium | [E] | 6.00% | 6.00% | 6.00% | 6.00% |\n| ***Nominal*** **Cost of Equity** | **[F] = [A + D + E]** | **15.37%** | **23.12%** | **22.71%** | **20.40%** |\n| **Debt** |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pre-tax Cost of Debt |  | 4.70% | 4.70% | 4.70% |  |\n| ***After-tax Nominal Cost of Debt*** | [G] | **4.12%** | **4.12%** | **4.12%** |  |\n| **Weighting** |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Debt** | [H] | 75.20% | 75.20% | 75.20% |  |\n| **Equity** | [I] = [1 -H] | 24.80% | 24.80% | 24.80% |  |\n| **WACC - Nominal, rounded** | [J] = [G x H] + [F x I] | 7.00% | 9.00% | 9.00% |  |\n| Less US Inflation |  | -2.30% | -2.30% | -2.30% |  |\n| **Discount Rate** |  | **5.0%** | **7.0%** | **7.0%** |  |\n\nNote: Internal footnotes added to the above Table by the Tribunal.\n\n20 Year T-Bill Yield Data as of 12 August 2013 from the US Treasury.\n\nAugust 2013 ERP data sourced from Damodaran online.\n\n***d) Exchange Rate***\n----------------------\n\n473.\n\nGiven that ENJASA conducted its operations in ARS, a conversion into USD is necessary as of the Valuation Date. For this purpose, Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen, provides two alternative approaches. In his Scenario One, Mr. Rosen makes use of the official ARS-USD exchange rate at the Valuation Date, which is the rate ENJASA used in its financial statements to convert ARS into USD.574 In his Scenario Two, Mr. Rosen uses an exchange rate that was expected in August 2013 to apply for the next three years, as forecasted by multiple banking institutions at the time.575\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 535.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 534; Rosen, Transcript, Day 8, pp. 95-96.\n\n474.\n\nThe rates used by Mr. Rosen rely on Claimants\u2019 instructions. Claimants justify these rates by pointing to the transfer-of-funds provision in Article 5(3) and (4) of the BIT, which states:\n\n(3) Transfers referred to in this Article shall be effected at the exchange rate applicable on the date of transfer.\n\n(4) The exchange rates shall be determined in accordance with the framework of the respective bank system of the territory of each Contracting Party.\n\n475.\n\nClaimants further point out that Article 5 of the BIT covers the transfer of funds in a non-exhaustive list of situations, which includes the repayment of loans, liquidation, partial sale of the investment, or compensation for lawful expropriation (see Article 5(1) of the BIT). For Claimants, also the payment of damages arising out of a breach of the BIT because of an unlawful expropriation should be covered by Article 5.576 In Claimants\u2019 view, it would be inconsistent with the principle of full compensation to apply an exchange rate that is more favorable for Respondent for the payment of compensation for unlawful expropriation than the rate applicable to the payment of compensation for lawful expropriations.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 528.\n\n476.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, the exchange rate referred to in Article 5(4) of the BIT is the official exchange rate applicable on the Valuation Date. The Implied Argentine Peso Rate *(Contado con Liquidaci\u00f3n* (\"**CCL**\")) suggested by Respondent (see *infra* para. 516), by contrast, is applied in the informal market to allow that \"companies could import despite the [Argentine] Central Bank\u2019s failure to offer exchange alternatives so as not to jeopardize its reserves.\"577 Claimants are not impressed by Respondent\u2019s argument that investors would expect the use of the CCL rate, which best reflects the market\u2019s expectations about the devaluation of the ARS. Even if ENJASA had expected the use of the unofficial CCL rate, Claimants as foreign investors legitimately expected the application of the official exchange rate to be used in the banking system in Argentina.578\n\nCEMA I, p. 32, footnote 53.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 533.\n\n***e) Overall Valuation of Claimants' Investment***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nApplying the above to both the valuation of ENJASA's gaming operations, and taking into account the cash flows from the Joint Venture Agreement between ENJASA and Cachi Valle, Mr. Rosen presents the following valuation of Claimants overall investment in L&E as follows:579\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***Fair Value of Gaming Operations*** | ***Scenario One*** | ***Scenario Two*** |\n| *Discounted Cash Flows* |  |  |\n| *Lotteries* | *21,949,376* | *17,037,367* |\n| *Live Games Slots* | *2,363,082 53,544,013* | *1,815,519 41,365,542* |\n|  | *77,856,471* | *60,218,428* |\n| *99.94% owned by L&E* | *77,809,757* | *60,182,297* |\n| *Plus: Cachi Discounted Cash Flows* | *4,133,771* | *3,265,294* |\n| *Total* | *81,943,528* | *63,447,591* |\n| *60% owned by the Claimants at the Valuation Date* | *49,166,117* | *38,068,555* |\n\nRosen II, para. 4.7 and Schedules 1 to 17; Rosen Power Point Presentation, Slide 8.\n\n478.\n\nDepending on whether Scenarios One or Two are followed, for Claimants the value of the indirect ownership of ENJASA and Cachi Valle through L&E on the basis of their discounted cash flow was respectively USD 81,943,528 and USD 63,447,591. Taking into account Claimants\u2019 60% shareholding at the Valuation Date, their loss of value would be USD 49,166,117 and USD 38,068,555 respectively.\n\n***f) Alternative Valuation: The Market Approach***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nIn addition to his evaluation of the value of Claimants\u2019 investment in L&E based on a DCF method, Mr. Rosen also provided a market-based analysis in order to support the outcome of his evaluations. Thus, in his Second Report, Mr. Rosen suggested a market-based valuation to test the reasonableness of the outcome of his primary DCF valuation. Among the transactions that occurred four years prior to the Valuation Date, Mr. Rosen identified a transaction involving a gaming company in Argentina, that he considered to be sufficiently comparable to ENJASA.580 The transaction concerned the acquisition in June 2010 of all shares of Casino Magic Neuqu\u00e9n S.A. by a group of investors led by Casino Club S.A. for approximately USD 40 million in cash.581 Casino Magic Neuqu\u00e9n was a business of the same size and in the same sector as ENJASA, in the same country, which equally operated on the basis of a gaming license provided by a local government.582 Mr. Rosen concludes that this transaction would imply that ENJASA's value would be ARS 243.3 million, respectively USD 43.8 million at the official exchange rate. This amount, Mr. Rosen concludes, is relatively supportive of his DCF valuation of ENJASA and Cachi Valle. It is, however, not determinative of the value of ENJASA at the Valuation Date, which is three years after the Casino Magic583 transaction.\n\nRosen II, paras. 5.25, 11.1-11.49.\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.29-11.30.\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.31-11.38.\n\nRosen II, para. 11.38.\n\n480.\n\nMr. Rosen also considered the February 2007 transaction whereby CAIH purchased an additional 55% interest in L&E from Iberlux and which predates the Valuation Date by approximately 6.5 years. Mr. Rosen admits that ENJASA's revenue has consistently been increasing (in USD terms) between 2007 and the Valuation Date. However, as the 2007 L&E transaction was at arms' length and concerns specifically ENJASA, Mr. Rosen considers this transaction a valid reference point, whose valuation metrics support his DCF valuation. On the basis of this transaction, ENJASA's enterprise value would be ARS 329.6 million, respectively USD 59.4 million at the official exchange rate.584\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.39-11.49.\n\n481.\n\nMr. Rosen, in turn, considers that the references Dr. Dapena makes to two market transactions (see *infra* para. 521) contain errors and flaws.585 First, for Mr. Rosen, Dr. Dapena's reference to an \"Enterprise Value (\"**EV\u2019**)/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation (\"**EBITDA**\") multiple\" for Argentina is irrelevant as ENJASA was not an average company in comparison to the Argentine economy as a whole. The multiple did not reflect the relevant elements that made ENJASA special, such as the industry sector it was operating in and its monopoly in the gaming sector in the Province of Salta.586 Moreover, Dr. Dapena incorrectly deducted ARS 74,246,488 in liabilities, while, for Mr. Rosen, only ARS 9.6 million should have been deducted.587\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.1-11.27.\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.6-11.16.\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.22-11.27.\n\n482.\n\nSecond, Mr. Rosen considers the acquisition of the 40% interest in L&E in November 2013, which Dr. Dapena relied on as a comparator to verify the value of ENJASA at the Valuation Date, to be irrelevant as it took place after the revocation of ENJASA's license. The value of L&E (and by extension that of ENJASA) had dropped significantly with the termination of ENJASA's license, since the business was no longer able to conduct its gaming and casino operations which represented its primary source of cash flow.588\n\nRosen II, paras. 11.17-11.21.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------\n\n***a) Valuation Model***\n------------------------\n\n483.\n\nConsidering that Claimants are only 60% shareholders of L&E and (indirectly) of ENJASA and Cachi Valle, Respondent and their expert, Dr. Dapena, suggest adopting a different model for determining the relevant cash flows. Taking into account that ENJASA was not publicly listed, but had stable business operations and a 13-year record of dividends, which were paid on a regular and audited basis, for Respondent, the most appropriate method to value ENJASA is a Discounted Dividend Model.589 This model predicts the price of a company's stock on the theory that its price at the Valuation Date is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to the Valuation Date.590\n\nCEMA I, paras. 146-151; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 283.\n\nSee www.investopedia.com.\n\n484.\n\nUnder the Discounted Dividend Model, Respondent's expert, Dr. Dapena, in a first step, estimated ENJASA's income and capital increases as well as its operating expenses, including amortisations, depreciations, reinvestment needs, and income tax for the duration of the License, i.e., until 23 September 2029. In a second step, the projected future dividends are discounted in order to arrive at their value at the Valuation Date on 13 August 2013.\n\n***b) Relevant Cash Flow***\n---------------------------\n\n485.\n\nBased upon the historical data for the years 2010-2012,591 Respondent's expert projects ENJASA's cash revenues into the future (based upon an historical growth rate of 22.6%) and expenses (based upon an average revenues/expenses ratio of 89.6%).592 The surplus cash flow thus obtained is the free cash flow to shareholders, paid either as dividends, expected over the years until September 2029, or as ENJASA's estimated residual value in September 2029.593\n\nCEMA I, para. 170. As investments in 2012 included substantial non-recurring components, Dr. Dapena maintained a level of maintenance capital expenditures in time, i.e., in line with projected amortisation and depreciation. See Dapena II, para. 166.\n\nCEMA I, para. 164.\n\nSee Respondent C-033, Excel sheet: Valuation Middle Rate. The residual value at the end of 2029 was estimated to be ARS 33,080,780.\n\n486.\n\nBecause of the valuation model followed, Dr. Dapena's valuation is not reduced by the pro-rata proceeds from the sale of the hotel building and of Casino Salta. Indeed, the applied \"but for\"-scenario, based upon dividends and residual value, implies that the hotel and Casino Salta would not have been sold as long as ENJASA's license lasted.\n\n487.\n\nRespondent and Dr. Dapena criticize Mr. Rosen's basis for his cash flow projections. They point out that only damages that are certain can be compensated and compensation of hypothetical and undetermined damage is excluded.594 Respondent argues that Claimants have based their valuation in Scenario One upon unreliable information, have used a number of unreasonable assumptions and parameters, and have applied an incorrect methodology.595\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 633; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 509-511.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 645-646 and more into detail paras. 647-680.\n\n488.\n\nRespondent does not agree with Mr. Rosen's alternative Scenario Two valuation either, which continues to make assumptions in relation to forecasted capital expenditure (\"**CAPEX**\"), exchange rates, and discount rates and turned the alternative valuation into another speculative projection.596 In brief, for Respondent, Mr. Rosen's alternative valuation in Scenario Two shows the same errors as his original valuation.597 If he had not made these assumptions, his alternative calculation would also be closer to Dr. Dapena's findings.598\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 280. For instance, the forecasted average CAPEX did exclude the 2012 CAPEX and only relied on the 2009, 2010, and 2011 CAPEX. The exchange rate and discount rates remained the same as in the original valuation.\n\nFor Dr. Dapena, Mr. Rosen, for instance, underestimates the expenses associated with the gaming business without support as well as the 8% discount rate while the actual cost of capital to the shareholder was around 22%. The latter shows that Mr. Rosen incorrectly bases his alternative valuation on the same incorrect assumption of a low rate of interest for a substantial share of non-existent debt. See Dapena II, para. 142.\n\nDapena II, para. 142.\n\n489.\n\nRespondent points out that, for a company with a 13-year history, such as ENJASA, business forecasts have to be based on audited accounting information.599 Mr. Rosen\u2019s model of projected cash flows, by contrast, was only based on internal financial projections that ENJASA\u2019s management had prepared for Casinos Austria. These internal projections were neither official nor audited, but mere speculations.600 Similarly, the unaudited 2013 data that Mr. Rosen used as a starting point for his projections were inappropriate; instead, 2012 must be used as the base year.601\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 276.\n\nDapena II, paras. 40-41, 82.\n\nDapena II, para. 76.\n\n490.\n\nRespondent also has the greatest objections to the significant leap in the forecasted income flows that Mr. Rosen assumes for 2014. The 2014 numbers, in Respondent\u2019s view, are hypothetical and speculative; they have no correlation whatsoever with ENJASA\u2019s historical profit/loss as recorded until 2012 and cannot be verified.602\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 284.\n\n491.\n\nDr. Dapena, for instance, observes that Mr. Rosen assumes profits from the termination of the Joint Venture with Video Drome, although the termination at the end of 2013 remains uncertain.603 In the section entitled \"Projections for Upcoming Fiscal Years\" in ENJASA\u2019s financial report for 2012, which were drafted after Claimants\u2019 alleged evidence that termination was certain, its Board of Directors had not mentioned this termination, nor the possibility of alleged additional income.604\n\nDapena, Comments on the Rosen's revised valuation model and adjustments to CEMA Valuation Model, 20 April 2020, paras. 63-68.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 289.\n\n492.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dapena points out that Mr. Rosen bases his assumption about the profits yielded by the termination of the Joint Venture with Video Drome upon a mere, unaudited spreadsheet, which cannot be checked, instead of upon the audited financial statement of 31 December 2012, as Dr. Dapena did. The Joint Venture\u2019s accounting information, on which Mr. Rosen bases himself, was at the time disputed by ENJASA.605 In addition, from the revenues thus obtained, alleged unproven, non-recurring expenses were incorrectly deducted.606\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 292-296.\n\nDapena, Comments on the Rosen's revised valuation model and adjustments to CEMA Valuation Model, 20 April 2020, paras. 60-62.\n\n493.\n\nRespondent furthermore observes that the increased 2014 projected results went beyond the mere fact that the Joint Venture with Video Drome would have been discontinued and included other increases.607 In this context, Dr. Dapena observes that, for instance, because of Mr. Rosen's unrealistic assumptions, the position \"other casino revenues\" jumps 97% from 2013 to 2014, i.e., from ARS 98 million to ARS 193 million, and ENJASA's EBITDA increased 1.5 times between 2012 and 2014.608\n\nTranscript, Day 8, pp. 154-156; Dapena, Letter of 30 December 2019, para. 22.\n\nDapena II, paras. 41 and 59-66; Exhibit C-299\\_48; Transcript, Day 8, pp. 154-156.\n\n494.\n\nRespondent further objects to Claimants' disaggregating alleged cash flows by business unit, while no cash flow for the hotel is examined. As no projected cash flow with regard to the operation of the hotel was ever submitted, the allocation of the expenses of the gaming operations, Respondent criticizes, cannot be checked. Dr. Dapena adds that Mr. Rosen's approach may underestimate the operating expenses of games of chance and overestimate the operating expenses of the hotel.609 The overvaluation of the lost cash flow may result in an overestimation of the alleged damages.610 Claimants may even be implicitly allocating in their projections a substantial part of the total operating expenses to the hotel, thus undervaluing the results of the hotel and undermining the assumption that the hotel was not-profitable or was not at a break-even point.611\n\nDapena II, paras. 2, 47-56; Response to Howard Rosen's Memorandum, 28 May 2020, para. 97.\n\nDapena II, para. 69.\n\nDapena II, para. 85. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 285.\n\n495.\n\nDr. Dapena also objects to Mr. Rosen's disaggregation of cash flows by business operation (lotteries, slot machines, live games) because an investor should assess the value of an exclusive license for games of chance as a whole, considering that the different business segments (lotteries, slot machines, live games, hotel) were all part of the same risk, which was covered by ENJASA's exclusive license.612\n\nDapena II, para. 47.\n\n496.\n\nFor Dr. Dapena, Mr. Rosen's separate analysis of the different gaming activities prevents consistency checks of the various expenses that are allocated to the different gaming units. Furthermore, the disaggregated data have not been audited.613 Separate data per business unit cannot be obtained from audited sources, such as financial statements, as has been acknowledged by Mr. Rosen.614 For instance, in Dr. Dapena's view, the expenses related to lotteries in Mr. Rosen's analysis, are clearly underestimated.615\n\nDapena, Letter of 30 December 2019, para. 22.\n\nTranscript, Day 8, pp. 59-60.\n\nDapena II, para. 142.\n\n497.\n\nMr. Dapena also observes that Mr. Rosen's reference to Professor Damodaran to justify a differentiation between business segments is out of context. When Professor Damodaran states that \"a disaggregated valuation should yield a better estimate of value than an aggregated valuation,\" he refers, Dr. Dapena points out, to multinational companies with multiple businesses, not to various segments of the same business unit in the same geographical location, as is the case with ENJASA.616 For Dr. Dapena, a differentiation would only be valid if (i) the cash flow associated with business segments derived from different licenses or regions, (ii) the company wanted to sell separately one of the segments (which it could not do), or (iii) the cash flow had a different risk profile (which was not the case here, since they were all associated with ENJASA\u2019s gaming operations).617\n\nDapena II, para. 48.\n\nDapena II, para. 50.\n\n***c) Discount Rate***\n----------------------\n\n498.\n\nAs for the discount rate, Dr. Dapena applied a rate of 18.3% and a discount factor that increased from 0.79 in 2014 to 0.06 in 2029.618 On this basis, Dr. Dapena arrived at a discounted equity-value of ENJASA in August 2013 of ARS 104,244,982. Claimants in turn, would be entitled to 60% or ARS 62,546,989.\n\nSee 'Valuation Model, Tab 'Shareholders Return' Exhibit CEMA-31. Respondent considered 20.3% the appropriate nominal rate of expected return and assumed a 2% deduction to reflect US long-term inflation. See CEMA I, paras. 176-177; Dapena II, para. 168.\n\n499.\n\nIn this context, Dr. Dapena does not agree with Mr. Rosen\u2019s first step to determine the discount rate: the selection of a Risk-Free Rate, i.e., the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. Mr. Rosen uses a risk-free rate of 3.39%, which is based on the United States 20-year treasury bond yield at the Valuation Date. Dr. Dapena suggests instead a risk-free rate of 6.56%, which is based on the average yield on United States 10-year treasury bonds from the years 1962 to 2013.\n\n500.\n\nDr. Dapena has no comments on the selection of the Equity Risk Premium, i.e., the excess return that an investment in stock provides over a risk-free investment. Both he and Mr. Rosen thus estimated that the Equity Risk Premium would be 5.46%.\n\n501.\n\nDr. Dapena has, however, serious objections to Mr. Rosen\u2019s selection of different Industry Betas, which reflect the systemic risk that is similar for all businesses in a specific industry, for ENJASA\u2019s operations of lotteries, slot machines, and live games. For Dr. Dapena, it is inappropriate to differentiate the discount rates of business segments that are part of the same corporate and legal vehicle so that no differentiation should be made between different types of games of chance, considering that all segments were (i) covered by the same license, (ii) associated with the same type of risk and geographical area, and (iii) not intended to be commercialized or sold separately. The cash flow generated by one segment serves as collateral for the cash flow generated by the other segments, and they are related from a risk perspective.619\n\nDapena II, para. 98.\n\n502.\n\nAs Dr. Dapena considered all of ENJASA's activities to be part of the same 'gaming/hotel' business for all of ENJASA's activities, the 'gaming/hotel' Beta of 0.55 should be applied.620 Dr. Dapena observes that this global approach ties with the audited financial statements, which did not differentiate between the expenses of the different business units or segments.\n\nExhibit CEMA-33, Tab 'Beta'.\n\n503.\n\nDr. Dapena furthermore objects to Claimants' use of a relevered Industry Beta, which considers the debt of companies within the specific industry. As Dr. Dapena focuses on equity, he uses the unlevered beta, which does not consider the debts of the companies within the sector, in order to remove the impact of debt and to neutralize the company's capital structure.\n\n504.\n\nAs Dr. Dapena disagrees with Mr. Rosen on the relevant Industry Beta, he also disagrees with the Adjusted Equity Risk Premium, i.e., the equity risk premium, multiplied by the levered Industry Beta, which in turn reflects how much the stock in a specific business will outperform risk-free debt instruments. In the present case, Dr. Dapena estimated the Adjusted Equity Risk to be 3% on the basis of the unlevered Beta for ENJASA's gaming/hotel operations as a whole.\n\n505.\n\nDr. Dapena also does not accept Mr. Rosen's determination of the Country Risk Premium, i.e., the additional premium to compensate investors for the higher risk that is associated with investing in a foreign country, as compared to investing in their domestic market. Referring to the annual default spreads published by Professor Damodaran, Mr. Rosen estimated the country risk for Argentina at the Valuation Date at only 6%.621 For Dr. Dapena it should be 10.7%, based on the EMBI+, which indicates the rate of return for US dollar-denominated external debt instruments issued by Argentina.622\n\nRosen I, paras. 10.19-10.23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 308.\n\n506.\n\nAll in all, however, Dr. Dapena\u2019s suggested nominal cost of equity of 20.26% was not much different from Mr. Rosen\u2019s average nominal cost of equity of 20.40% (see *supra* para. 472).\n\n507.\n\nDr. Dapena very strongly objects to how Mr. Rosen established the debt/equity ratio to calculate the WACC. Rather than using Claimants\u2019 debt/equity ratio (75.20%/24.80%), the actual debt/equity ratio of ENJASA should be used.623 For Respondent, in order to establish ENJASA\u2019s value, Mr. Rosen cannot mix up the debt ratio of Casinos Austria in its country of origin with ENJASA\u2019s debt/equity ratio in Argentina. Claimants\u2019 increase in L&E\u2019s shareholding in 2007 - and thus of their indirect participation in ENJASA -cannot be considered as a loan, which would justify to retain Claimants\u2019 debt/equity ratio to establish ENJASA\u2019s indebtedness. Whether Casinos Austria had acquired 60% of L&E shares in 2007 with loaned money, Dr. Dapena submits, is irrelevant for ENJASA\u2019s cost of capital, as the acquisition of L&E shares is not a loan to ENJASA. The acquired shares did not vest an interest-bearing debt on behalf of L&E, nor ENJASA, but only gave rise to potential dividends.624 Claimants\u2019 level of indebtedness in Austria was therefore not relevant.\n\nDapena II, paras. 91, 94, 95, 100, 104, and 109. Dr. Dapena initially assumed a debt to equity ratio of 100% equity (i.e., a debt-free situation), considering that ENJASA's financial debt was paid off after the Valuation Date and cash flows were stable and positive. Mr. Rosen objected that it was irrelevant that the debt was repaid after the Valuation Date: what mattered was the situation at the Valuation Date. See Rosen II, paras. 9.25-9.37. For Mr. Rosen, ENJASA's debt/equity ratio, as presented by Dr. Dapena, was 6%/94%. See Exhibit C-026-64, ENJASA Loan Payment Schedule; Rosen Presentation Slide 14.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 303.\n\n508.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimants can also not apply a fictitious debt/equity ratio of 75%/25% for ENJASA, instead of the actual ratio, based on the argument that the former would be optimal from a financing point of view, or because ENJASA\u2019s low debt/equity ratio and its stable cash flow would allow it to increase its financial leverage and to maximize the value of its enterprise and the return to its equity holders. Claimants are not entitled to assume that Casinos Austria\u2019s structure should equally apply to ENJASA in Argentina. Besides, ENJASA was not planning to incur debts as it was not intending to make substantial investments.\n\n509.\n\nAs Dr. Dapena does not accept that Claimants\u2019 debt/equity ratio would be used, he does not agree that Mr. Rosen used for the cost of debt in his WACC valuation the interest rate for which Casinos Austria could borrow money on the Austrian market, i.e., 4.12% after taxes. In fact, because of the restricted access to the debt market in Argentina, ENJASA's cost of debt was 24%.625 Furthermore, Dr. Dapena points out that Mr. Rosen did not submit evidence that Argentine companies obtained financing in 2013 at the very low rate suggested by Mr. Rosen.626\n\nSee ENJASA's Financial Statements as of 32 December 2012, Note 22 (CEMA 26); Dapena Response to Howard Rosen's Memorandum, paras. 49-50. The sovereign debt in dollars was approximately 13%. See Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 533; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 305-306.\n\nDapena II, paras. 167-175.\n\n510.\n\nAs Dr. Dapena disagrees with the debt/equity ratio and the cost of debt that Mr. Rosen uses to arrive at his WACC, he also disagrees with a WACC of 8% for the totality of ENJASA's operations.627 Instead, for Dr. Dapena, the actual cost of capital for the shareholders was above 20%.628\n\nThe same holds true for the WACC of 7%, 9%, and 9% for lotteries, slot machines, and live games respectively.\n\nDapena II, para. 142.\n\n511.\n\nOn the US inflation rate, Dr. Dapena slightly disagrees with Mr. Rosen. For Dr. Dapena, the rate is 2%, while for Mr. Rosen it is 2.30%.629\n\nRosen II, para. 9.68.\n\n512.\n\nIn brief, Respondent does not accept the discount rates of 5-7% submitted by Claimants. In contrast, Dr. Dapena estimated the real cost of ENJASA's equity at 18.3%. Discount rates of 5-7%, Dr. Dapena points out, are below the return of Argentine sovereign bonds at that time and are close to the interest rate of 6% that Mr. Rosen suggests. Underestimating the discount rate increases the value of the alleged damages.630\n\nDapena, II, para. 140.\n\n513.\n\nRespondent observes that Claimants would arrive at a discount rate of some 20% as Respondent does, if in Mr. Rosen's model ENJASA's actual debt/equity ratio had been followed.631\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 309.\n\n***d) Exchange Rate***\n----------------------\n\n514.\n\nIn respect of the applicable exchange rate, Respondent points out that the exchange rates Mr. Rosen suggests for Claimants were not his personal choice, but followed the instructions of counsel for Claimants. For Respondent, these rates are not valid alternatives for converting ARS into USD.\n\n515.\n\nThe first suggestion, the official bank exchange rate, was, Respondent observes, in practice not used in August 2013 because of the then existing foreign exchange restrictions in Argentina. Respondent can also not accept Mr. Rosen's second alternative exchange rate, which was based upon expectations of analysts in August 2013 about the development of the exchange rate for the three years to follow.632 This alternative rate is only a future, hypothetical exchange rate, not the actual exchange rate in August 2013. The two exchange rates Claimants suggested, Respondent submits, can therefore not be used for a market valuation in August 2013.\n\nRosen, Transcript, Day 8, pp. 95-96.\n\n516.\n\nInstead, Respondent and Dr. Dapena suggest to apply the CCL rate, which is the market exchange rate used for converting cash amounts from ARS into USD in Argentina at the Valuation Date, when exchange controls were in place.633 The CCL rate was, for instance, the implied exchange rate between stock prices on the Buenos Aires and New York Stock Exchanges.\n\nTranscript, Day 8, pp. 161-162.\n\n***e) Overall Valuation of Claimants \u2019 Investment***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nApplying the CCL rate to the discounted cash flows determined through his Discounted Dividend Model, Dr. Dapena arrives as a total value of the loss L&E suffered in respect of its entire shareholding in ENJASA of USD 11,982,182. For Claimants\u2019 60% shareholding in L&E this translates into a loss of USD 7,189,309.634\n\nDapena, Comments on the Rosen's revised valuation model and adjustments to CEMA Valuation Model, 20 April 2020, para. 29. For previous submissions, see Dapena II, para. 188; Respondent's Valuation Sheet \u2013 CEMA 33.\n\n518.\n\nDr. Dapena also supplements his analysis with a much simpler calculation, which is based upon the average dividends paid out during the 2010-2012 period and projecting said value up to September 2029, again discounted at an annual discount rate of 18%. With this calculation, the value of future dividends amounts to ARS 97.2 million of which Claimants\u2019 60% participation equal ARS 58.3 million; converted to USD at the CCL rate, this would result in USD 11.18 million for L&E as a whole and USD 6.7 million for Claimants 60% shareholding.635\n\nDapena, Comments on the Rosen's revised valuation model and adjustments to CEMA Valuation Model, 20 April 2020, paras. 30-32, 101-109.\n\n***f) Alternative Valuation: The Market Approach***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nRespondent observes that Mr. Rosen did not consider a market approach to be decisive - and that Dr. Dapena agreed with him. The specifics of each transaction, the time difference, and the unsteadiness make it difficult to find comparable transactions.636 At most, a market-based valuation can serve as a secondary support of a DCF valuation.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 342.\n\n520.\n\nIn all events, for Dr. Dapena, the 2010 Casino Magic transaction and the 2007 L&E transaction relied upon by Mr. Rosen (see *supra* paras. 479-480) are not comparable to the hypothetical acquisition of ENJASA at the Valuation Date. Both transactions were carried out at times when Argentina's economic conditions were totally different. The average market value of companies was considerably higher in 2007 and in 2010 than in August 2013. The unstable economic context in Argentina makes Mr. Rosen's market approach irrelevant and inconsistent with economic reality.637\n\nDapena II, paras. 178-187.\n\n521.\n\nApart from criticizing Mr. Rosen's market-based analysis as irrelevant for determining the value of Claimants' investment, Respondent points out that Dr. Dapena refers to two market-based elements to support the reasonableness of his own valuation of Claimants' investment, i.e., the 2013 EV/EBITDA multiple and the 15 November 2013 acquisition of Iberlux' 40% interest in L&E by CAI.\n\n522.\n\nThe EV/EBITDA multiple is an indicator for calculating the value of an enterprise based on a company's EBITDA. For the entire Argentine economy in 2013, to which Dr. Dapena refers, the EV/EBITDA multiple was 3.9. Based on this multiple, ENJASA's overall value would be, based on its EBITDA of ARS 36,925,084, ARS 144,377,078. With ARS 38,846,286 cash added and ARS 74,246,488 liabilities deducted, ENJASA's value for shareholders would therefore be ARS 108,976,876 or, at the CCL rate, USD 12,526,078.638 Claimants' 60% share would thus be worth ARS 65,386,126 or USD 7,515,646. The proceeds from the sale of the hotel building would need to be added on top.639\n\nCEMA I, paras. 188-194.\n\nDapena II, para. 135.\n\n523.\n\nFurthermore, for the purchase of 40% of L&E's shares in September 2013, i.e., one month after the revocation of ENJASA's license, Casinos Austria paid USD 2.82 million and was committed to pay USD 1 million more if the gaming license was reinstated. For Respondent, this transaction would imply that ENJASA's whole stock package was worth USD 9.55 million and that Claimants' 60% shareholding thus had a value of USD 5.73 million.640\n\nCEMA I, para. 184.\n\n524.\n\nBoth of these market-based factors, in the view of Respondent and her expert, Dr. Dapena, support Dr. Dapena's DCF approach based on his Discounted Dividend Model.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nAssessing the compensation due is not a pure mathematical addition of certainties, but involves human appreciation. The commentary on Article 36 of the ILC Articles confirms that the valuation of a going concern, as is the case here, involves human discretion.641 This notwithstanding, the valuation of Claimants' investment depends on the different elements that are in controversy among the Parties and their experts.642 The Tribunal will therefore, in the following, address the points that have divided the Parties, namely the valuation model to be used (a.), the determination of the relevant cash flows (b.), as well as the discount rate (c.), and the exchange rate to be used (d.), and on that basis arrive at a valuation of Claimants' investment, that is, its 60% interest in L&E (e.).\n\nComment to Article 36 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\u00a0with Commentaries, 2001, paras. 22 *et seq*.\n\nFor two issues not raised by either Party, which the Tribunal's majority considers not to be relevant, unlike the Dissent, see *supra* notes 521 and 522.\n\n***a) Valuation Model***\n------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe first point in controversy between the Parties' experts concerns the valuation model itself. While Respondent's expert, Dr. Dapena, focused on shareholder value and compared the actual and hypothetical cash flow (dividends and value of non-amortized assets in 2029) to the (ultimate) shareholders, Mr. Rosen, Claimants' expert, focused on the value of ENJASA/L&E, and compared the actual and hypothetical cash flow within those companies.643\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 319.\n\n527.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Respondent opted for the Discounted Dividend Model because it considered ENJASA to be a mature business with regular distribution of dividends with \"a certain stability in the nominal growth of revenues as well as a certain stability in expense and investment/revenue rations.\"644 The Tribunal, however, notes that, although ENJASA's net revenues indeed steadily increased with some 23% per year between 2009 and 2012, which is the base year used by Dr. Dapena for the projection of future dividends, ENJASA's net income followed a more bumpy course. Net profits, for example, increased by approx. 150% between 2011 and 2012, and ENJASA's net worth, which had remained stable between 2009 and 2011, increased by 95% between 2011 and 2012.645 This throws some doubt on the relevance of the stability of dividends paid to the controlling shareholder in the presence of fluctuating income and on whether the dividends would stay stable as assumed by Dr. Dapena.\n\nCEMA I, paras. 146, 156.\n\nNet revenues increased from ARS 157,853,985 (2009) to ARS 290,970,962 (2012), net profits were ARS 9,578,130 (2009), ARS 11,794,744 (2010), ARS 9,126,930 (2011), and ARS 22,852,681 (2012). See CEMA I, Tables 1 and 2.\n\n528.\n\nThe Tribunal, moreover, agrees with Claimants that the dividends (indirectly) flowing from ENJASA to Claimants do not offer an appropriate basis for ENJASA's valuation as Claimants, who are in control as majority shareholders of ENJASA via L&E, also had other vehicles, such as license and managements fees, to benefit from their investment in ENJASA. The Tribunal therefore considers that an informed valuation of ENJASA/L&E on the basis of projected cash flows, as Claimants' expert Dr. Rosen proposes, is the more appropriate approach in the present situation. The projected cash flows have to be construed on the basis of historical data and reliable projections, and subsequently be discounted to the Valuation Date.\n\n529.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that it fails to see any material differences from a legal perspective in the calculation of compensation due under the principle of full reparation that Dr. Rosen attaches to the difference between \"fair value\" v. \"fair market value\" of Claimants' interest in ENJASA/L&E. To the extent that Mr. Rosen suggests that under the idea of \"fair value\" specific synergies for Claimants from the asset under valuation, notable in respect of their own debt/equity value should be considered, the Tribunal will comment on that specific issue below (see *infra* paras. 550-551). This specific issue, however, has no influence on the approach to be taken for valuing Claimants' investment as such. The Tribunal therefore does not consider that the use of the concept of \"fair value\" as compared to \"fair market value\" makes a difference in the approach to adopt for determining the compensation due under the principle of full reparation for internationally wrongful conduct of the respondent State.\n\n***b) The Relevant Cash Flow***\n-------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nIn order to determine the value of Claimants' investment, the Tribunal will establish the relevant cash flow on the date ENJASA's license was revoked, that is, on 13 August 2013, until the original term of the License, that is, 23 September 2029. In this context, a number of issues are controversial among the Parties and their experts. These include: (i) the basis for projecting ENJASA's future cash flows; (ii) the relevance of cash flows stemming from the Joint Venture between ENJASA and Video Drome after 31 December 2013; (iii) the relevance of the cash flows stemming from the hotel; (iv) adjustments concerning the working capital of ENJASA; and (v) the relevance of the cash flows for the benefit of Cachi Valle from the Joint Venture with ENJASA relating to the operation of Casino Salta.\n\n531.\n\nThe first disagreement between the Parties and their experts concerns the basis for projecting future cash flows of ENJASA. While Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dapena, relied on ENJASA\u2019s audited financial statements of 2012, Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen, presented two scenarios. Mr. Rosen\u2019s Scenario One relies on actual cash flows from January to August 2013 and management projections from September 2012; his Scenario Two relied more on historical data, in particular ENJASA\u2019s 2012 audited financial statement and was thus closer to the cash flow basis used by Dr. Dapena. In his Second Report, Mr. Rosen adjusted certain of his projections, resulting in an overall lower valuation of ENJASA, and reducing the difference between Scenarios One and Two to the issue of which exchange should be applied to convert ARS into USD (see *infra* paras.554-563).\n\n532.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal starts out by noting that projections about future cash flows require a basis in historical data and have to consistently follow the reasonable evolution of historical data for the following years. Any deviation in projected cash flows from a consistent evolution requires justification. Having reviewed the various reports of both experts on the appropriate basis for making projections about ENJASA\u2019s future cash flows, the Tribunal accepts the basis on which Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen, made his projections for ENJASA\u2019s future cash flows. In the Tribunals view, it is appropriate to use the actual results for the time from January to August 2013, even though these results had not been audited at the Valuation Date, and complement them with projections for the rest of the year that are based on historical data, including the audited data for 2012, as done by Mr. Rosen.646\n\nSee Dapena, II, paras. 59-66; Rosen II, Section 7.\n\n533.\n\nMoreover, when looking at the cash flows used for the year 2013, the difference between both experts is negligible. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is therefore not material for purposes of valuation, whether projections for 2013 are based only on ENJASA\u2019s audited statements for 2012 or whether they are based on actual results for the first seven months and on projections for the rest of the year.\n\n534.\n\nThe real difference between the cash flow analysis of both experts starts in the year 2014. This difference, however, is principally due to whether cash flows relating to income generated by slot machines operated under the Joint Venture with Video Drome can be included fully in the projections for ENJASA's benefit, as done in Mr. Rosen's analysis, or whether such cash flows should be excluded as uncertain, as done in Dr. Dapena's analysis. That this is the relevant difference among the experts when it comes to the relevant cash flows was convincingly explained by Mr. Rosen at the hearing, when pointing out the differences in cash flow projections between his Second Report and the Opinion of Dr. Dapena.647 This explanation was not seriously challenged by Respondent and her expert, Dr. Dapena.\n\nSee Transcript, Day 8, pp. 215-216.\n\n535.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal is not convinced that the basis for Mr. Rosen's projections for the year 2013 is defective and would lead to inappropriate results. What is more important, in the Tribunal's view, is to address the relevance of specific items for the projections on which the experts disagree.\n\n536.\n\nThe first such item concerns the relevance of future cash flows stemming from the operation of slot machine halls that ENJASA still conducted at the Valuation Date under a Joint Venture Agreement with Video Drome. In this respect, the Tribunal accepts Claimants' position that these cash flows have to be added starting from 1 January 2014. Although the Joint Venture with Video Drome was not yet terminated in August 2013, the agreement was going to terminate as per its terms by 31 December 2013.648 Furthermore, ENREJA had already been informed about the termination of the Joint Venture, both by ENJASA,649 as well as by Video Drome.650 In addition, ENJASA had already made calculations for investing into the slot machine halls operated by the Joint Venture with Video Drome.651 All of this indicates, in the Tribunal's view, that it was sufficiently certain that ENJASA was going to seize the business opportunity that opened because of the termination of the Joint Venture with Video Drome.\n\nAs per its Clause 4, the Joint Venture Agreement between ENJASA and Video Drome of 19 October 2001 (Exhibit C-092) was originally concluded for 5 years. This term was prolonged until 31 December 2013 by a Modification of the Joint Venture concluded by ENJASA and Video on 7 June 2006 (Exhibit C-093). The Modification Agreement provided that the new term could be prolonged \"if both parties so agreed\" (ibid, p. 6).\n\nENJASA had communicated the end of the Joint Venture with Video Drome to ENREJA and its intention to replace the slot machines owned by Video Drome after the end of the Joint Venture in a letter of 23 July 2012. See Exhibit ARA-028.\n\nVideo Drome had sent a letter to ENREJA on 23 November 2012 asking ENREJA to suspend the obligation to exchange old slot machines against new ones given that the Joint Venture with ENJASA was ending in 12 months, that is, on 31 December 2013. See Exhibit C-171.\n\nSee Rosen I, paras. 9.29-9.32; Rosen II, para. 7.27 (relying on Exhibits C-026-39.1 and C-026-41, p. 2). See also WS I Anselmi, para. 104.\n\n537.\n\nFurthermore, given the history of the relationship between ENJASA and Video Drome, which appears to have soured over the years, and which involved Video Drome's refusal to upgrade slot machines to new technical requirements demanded by ENREJA, as well as sharing the dynamic canon fee that ENJASA agreed to in relation to the Province in the Acta Acuerdo,652 the Tribunal considers that the likelihood of a renewal of that Joint Venture was virtually non-existent. From an economic perspective, a willing buyer at the Valuation Date in August 2013 would have taken the income stemming from the operation of slot machines under the Joint Venture with Video Drome fully into account in calculating the value of ENJASA and the amount of cash flow it could generate in the future.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 143-144 (reference to Claimants' argument on past disputes with Video Drome). See also Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 125-127.\n\n538.\n\nBy contrast, it is immaterial, in the Tribunal's view, that the termination of the Joint Venture by 31 December 2013 was not mentioned in ENJASA's 2012 financial forecast, a circumstance Respondent points to. Not only is it unclear to the Tribunal to which extent this circumstance would have had to be included in the financial statements of ENJASA at all, such a failure would, in the Tribunal's view, also be a negligible factor for predicting future cash flows, considering the notifications of the termination of the Joint Venture already sent by ENJASA and Video Drome to ENREJA prior to the Valuation Date, as well as the past relationship between ENJASA and Video Drome. Consequently, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen, that cash flows for slot machines so far operated under the Joint Venture with Video Drome are appropriately to be included in the projections of future cash flows that ENJASA lost because of the revocation of its License. In the Tribunal's view, these future cash flows are not speculative, but constitute part of the injury caused by Respondent's internationally wrongful act in the sense of Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles.\n\n539.\n\nThe Parties and their experts have also debated whether disaggregating ENJASA's cash flows into gaming-related and non-gaming related activities and disregarding the latter for purposes of determining ENJASA's value as of the Valuation Date was appropriate. Non-gaming related activities concern mainly the treatment of income from the Sheraton Hotel Salta which was operated by ENJASA. In the view of Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen, the hotel should be excluded as it was not affected by the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license and continued operating thereafter, albeit without generating any profits. By contrast, Respondent and her expert, Dr. Dapena, submit that such a disaggregation of cash flows could result in shifting expenses from gaming to non-gaming activities and thus overstate the positive cash flows resulting from ENJASA\u2019s gaming-related activities.\n\n540.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, normally the entirety of cash flows should be included to determine the value of a company that was subject to expropriation. In the present case, however, both Parties found a common ground in the assumption that the hotel was operating essentially at break-even and did therefore not affect the cash flow from ENJASA\u2019s gaming operations. The Tribunal agrees that there is a risk that disregarding certain business units of a company, in particular when they are intertwined with cash-flow-generating activities connected to one of the casinos operated by ENJASA, as is the case with the hotel, can result in a distortion of cash flows. However, Respondent and her expert, Dr. Dapena, have not submitted, beyond pointing generally to the existence of such a risk, any reliable data that could have suggested that any such distortion had occurred in the approach by Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen. The Tribunal therefore accepts that the data on which Mr. Rosen projected ENJASA\u2019s future cash flows does not need to be adapted to take account of cash flows stemming from the hotel.\n\n541.\n\nFurthermore, there is also disagreement among the Parties\u2019 experts concerning the treatment of ENJASA\u2019s working capital, i.e., its short-term capital required to continue its operations, and its impact on the company\u2019s projected future cash flows. Increases in working capital in a given year tie up more revenue in current assets and decrease the available cash flow and vice versa.653 In Dr. Dapena\u2019s approach, the forecasted level of working capital was based upon a stable percentage of average revenues from 2009 until 2012, which he considered the optimal balance, without any further adjustments.654 For Mr. Rosen, on the contrary, the level of working capital needed to be adjusted continuously after 2013 and decreased proportionally.655 As Mr. Rosen further convincingly pointed out, Dr. Dapena\u2019s analysis failed to reflect the impact of inflation on working capital, leading to an undervaluation of cash flows.656 The Tribunal therefore agrees with Mr. Rosen's approach to consistently adapt the working capital level in projecting ENJASA's future cash flows.\n\nRosen II, para. 8.23.\n\nSee Rosen II, paras. 8.24-8.27; Dapena II, para. 161; CEMA \u2013 32, Excel Tab \"Forec Financial Statements\".\n\nRosen II, para. 8.25.\n\nRosen II, para. 8.28.\n\n542.\n\nFinally, the Parties do not agree on whether Cachi Valle, the subsidiary of L&E (99%) and ENJASA (1%), which had a 30% share in a joint venture with ENJASA to exploit Casino Salta, has to be included in the valuation. For Respondent, the revocation of the License concerned ENJASA and did not affect Cachi Valle, whose lost profits and expenses, Respondent claims, are unrelated to ENJASA's license. Claimants, on the other hand, include Cachi Valle in their valuation. This concerns both the determination of the basis for calculating the loss of future cash flows and the relevance of post-revocation expenses incurred by Cachi Valle (see *infra* paras. 568, 573).\n\n543.\n\nIn respect of the relevance of future cash flows of Cachi Valle stemming from the joint venture with ENJASA, the Tribunal is of the view that these cash flows must be included in the valuation of Claimants' investment. As a 30% partner of the joint venture that exploited Casino Salta, Cachi Valle was affected by the revocation of the License and lost the respective cash flows. This cash flow, while essentially irrelevant to the valuation of ENJASA, is relevant, however, for the valuation of L&E, considering that Cachi Valle was essentially a wholly owned subsidiary of L&E. The Tribunal will therefore include, in determining compensation for the financial impact of the revocation of ENJASA's license upon Claimants' investment, the cash flows of Cachi Valle from the joint venture with ENJASA relating to the Casino Salta. Claimants, in turn, are entitled to 60% of the resulting value of Cachi Valle, given that they were 60% shareholders in L&E at the Valuation Date. In the Tribunal's view, the future cash flows concerning Cachi Valle therefore constitute part of the injury caused to Claimants' investment by Respondent's internationally wrongful act in the sense of Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles.\n\n***c) Discount Rate***\n----------------------\n\n544.\n\nA DCF analysis of ENJASA's enterprise value requires the determination of its cost of capital and to discount the estimated future cash flows to bring them to what their value was on the Valuation Date, that is, on 13 August 2013. To determine the discount factor, the Tribunal has to decide certain preliminary issues which are in parts in controversy, and in parts agreed among the Parties and their experts. This involves determinations on: (i) the risk free rate; (ii) the equity risk premium; (iii) the relevant industry beta(s); (iv) the country risk premium; (v) the relevant debt/equity ratio; (vi) the interest rate applicable to ENJASA's debt; and (vii) the US inflation rate.\n\n545.\n\nFor the Risk Free Rate, the Tribunal adopts the factor 3.39%, as suggested by Claimants. This rate is based on the US 20-year treasury bond yield in August 2013 and is preferred to the average 6.56% yield for US 10-year bonds from 1962 to 2013, which was suggested by Respondent. Indeed, to calculate a rate for the period of the next 16 years from the Valuation Date, the coming 20 years are more relevant than the past 50 years, especially as interest rates had decreased in recent times.\n\n546.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts an Equity Risk Premium of 5.46% on which the Parties agreed.\n\n547.\n\nWith regard to the Industry Betas, the Tribunal adopts the following approach. The Parties did not agree on whether a DCF analysis should consider the Industry Beta for 'gaming/hotel' for all of ENJASA's activities, or apply specific Betas for lotteries, slot machines, and live games. The Tribunal observes that slot machines, lotteries, and live games represent 69% (slot machines), 28% (lotteries), and 3% (live games) of ENJASA's cash flow.657 The systemic risk of these respective types of gaming operations is different. It thus would be illogical to submit lotteries and slot machines to the Beta for live gaming. The Tribunal accepts the specific Betas for ENJASA's respective areas of operation, which are submitted by Claimants' expert on the basis of the average Betas in similar operations.658\n\nExhibit C-299 \u2013 Summaries.\n\nExhibit C-299 \u2013 Control Sheet, lines 16-19.\n\n548.\n\nFor the Country Risk Premium at the Valuation Date, the Tribunal observes that Claimants admit that a country risk in valuation analyses is usually based upon the default spread, i.e., the EMBI+, which indicates the spread between Argentine government bonds in USD and US treasury bonds. At the Valuation Date, the EMBI+ for Argentina was 10.7%. However, as an exception, for Claimants, the EMBI+ should not be applicable for countries in a default-like situation, such as Argentina around the Valuation Date. The EMBI+ reflects inter alia the State's financial position and concerns bonds, acquired by the market, while in the present DCF analysis, the cash flow was to be transferred between related commercial entities. Claimants therefore suggest a country risk rate of 6%, based upon the annual default spreads published by Professor Damodaran.659\n\nRosen II, paras. 9.48-9.62.\n\n549.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, both the EMBI+ as well as the country risk rate based on Professor Damodaran\u2019s publication of annual default spreads are appropriate indicators of the country risk from a valuation perspective. The Tribunal considers it more appropriate, however, given the rather tumultuous and overall little predictable developments the Argentine economy had taken during the decades before the Valuation Date, to rely on a more conservative country risk premium than the one based on Professor Damodaran\u2019s publication. At the same time, the EMBI+ may not necessarily reflect the view a willing buyer may have taken on the country risk premium at the Valuation Date. The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to average the country risk premiums suggested by the Parties\u2019 experts and round it to half percent marks, and thus set it at 8.5% for purposes of calculating the discount rate.\n\n550.\n\nWith regard to the debt/equity ratio of ENJASA, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen, that ENJASA\u2019s debt, which existed at the Valuation Date, must be taken into account for purposes of valuation. The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that it should adopt either the debt/equity ratio of Casinos Austria of 75.20%/24.80% or an optimal debt/equity ratio of 75%/25%, as suggested by Mr. Rosen. The consideration that a much higher debt ratio would be optimal, can be no basis to establish ENJASA\u2019s actual cost of capital, which is the relevant consideration for valuation. Neither is the debt/equity ratio of its (indirect) shareholder, Casinos Austria, relevant. The cash flow within ENJASA, its debt/equity ratio and the cash flow to the shareholders are not affected by whether Casinos Austria acquired these shares with own capital or loaned funds.\n\n551.\n\nInstead, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the actual debt/equity ratio of ENJASA on the Valuation Date has to be adopted. In this respect, the Parties present two different figures for the actual debt/equity ratio. Thus, Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dapena, states that the actual debt/equity ratio of ENJASA for 2012 is 8.53%/91.47%;660 while Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen, states the actual debt/equity ratio of ENJASA to be 6%/94%.661 In light of these differences, the Tribunal will adopt, in favor of Respondent, the lower debt/equity ratio of 6%/94%.\n\nSee Dapena II, paras. 91, 103.\n\nSee Rosen, Presentation, Slide 16. Possibly, the difference between the Parties' experts results from the fact that Dr. Dapena bases himself on 2012 numbers for ENJASA, whereas Mr. Rosen uses 2013 numbers as a basis for his cash flow calculations.\n\n552.\n\nIn respect of the US inflation rate, which is used to reduce the discount rate, the Tribunal retains an inflation rate of 2%, as suggested by Dr. Dapena. The 2.30% inflation rate proposed by Claimants is neither supported by the Forecasted Consumer Price Index nor the Core Consumer Index from the second half of 2013 until 2015, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, nor by the more recent inflation rates.662\n\nRosen II, para. 9.68. In fact, the Forecasted Index for 2013-2015 is closer to 2.10%. See Exhibit C-026-53, p. 12. The inflation index from 2016-2020 is under 2%; see www.USinflationcalculator.com.\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that a cash flow analysis also has to be applied to the exploitation of Casino Salta by Cachi Valli, as Mr. Rosen did.663\n\nSee Rosen II, para. 12.6 and C-299, Excel sheet, Schedules 2D and 15.\n\n***d) Exchange Rate***\n----------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 compensation calculations start from financial data expressed in ARS. Both Parties, however, agree that the compensation has to be paid in USD and has to be converted from ARS into USD at the currency exchange rate applicable on the Valuation Date on 13 August 2013. The Parties, however, are not in agreement on what the applicable exchange rate is.\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, in this context, that Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Rosen, admitted at the hearing that most foreign exchange transactions at the Valuation Date adopted the CCL rate and recognized that Dr. Dapena\u2019s arguments in support of the use of the CCL rate were not incorrect as a matter of economic expertise.664 The Parties\u2019 disagreement therefore boils down to the question of whether the BIT requires the use of the official exchange rate, as argued by Claimants and as used by their expert, Mr. Rosen, or whether a rate that is in fact used in commercial transactions between market actors, as is the case with the CCL rate used by Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dapena, reflects the requirements of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\nTranscript, Day 8, p. 222 (Mr. Rosen stated: \"I appreciate Dr. Dapena's point of view that the market place at the exact valuation date is a consideration \u2026 I don't find fault in what he's done; I've just taken a different point of view.\").\n\n556.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments related to an investment, without undue delay and in freely convertible currency ...\" This right applies, inter alia, to \"the proceeds from the liquidation or total or partial sale of the investment [and] compensations due under Article 4, paragraph 2, of this Agreement\" (Article 5(1)(e) and (f) of the BIT). The provision also applies, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, to the transfer of funds a covered investor is to receive in compensation for host State conduct that is contrary to the obligations laid down in the BIT. Otherwise, compensations for unlawful conduct, such as unlawful expropriations, would be treated worse in respect of the transfer of funds, from the perspective of affected investors, than compensation for lawful expropriations. Furthermore, the list of transactions in Article 5(1) to which an investor\u2019s right to free capital transfer applies is not a closed list, but merely illustrative: it provides that the guarantee of the free transfer of payments applies \"particularly but not exclusively\" to specifically listed items. Compensation for the host State\u2019s unlawful conduct can thus also be subsumed as falling under the right to free capital transfer under Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n557.\n\nHowever, while Article 5(1) of the BIT guarantees that the relevant transfers have to be made \"without undue delay and in freely convertible currency,\" Article 5 does not guarantee a specific exchange rate. In this respect, Article 5(3) of the BIT merely requires that the exchange rate on the day of the transfer shall be relevant. Article 5(4) of the BIT provides that \"[t]he exchange rates shall be determined in accordance with the framework of the respective bank system of the territory of each Contracting Party.\"\n\n558.\n\nBy referring to the exchange rate being \"determined in accordance with the framework of the respective bank system of the territory of each Contracting Party,\" Article 5(4) of the BIT does not guarantee a right to transfers at an official exchange rate. While it prohibits the use of an exchange rate that is less favorable for the investor than the rate used by banks for commercial transactions, it does not positively authorize an investor to invoke an official exchange rate that is more favorable to the investor than that which banks apply to commercial transactions, for instance because of existing foreign exchange restrictions.\n\n559.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal also observes that, if Austria and Argentina had had the intention of requiring that the official exchange rate be applied to convert compensation for unlawful expropriation for purposes of the transfer of payments, they could have stipulated so - as, for instance, Austria did in the bilateral investment treaty with the Czech Republic one year before it concluded the BIT with Argentina.665 Instead, the Contracting Parties to the Argentina-Austria BIT limited the provision on capital transfer to the rather vague reference to the exchange rate applicable in the banking system of the respective countries.\n\nBIT between Austria and the Czech Republic, signed 15 October 1990, Art. 5.\n\n560.\n\nMoreover, it was not argued that the foreign exchange restrictions that applied in Argentina in August 2013, and that may have been responsible for a market-going rate to diverge from the official exchange rate, were themselves in breach of Article 5 of the BIT, with the consequence that the official exchange should be applied in order to absorb the effects of unlawful exchange restrictions. Instead, what the BIT merely requires is that the Tribunal select an exchange rate to convert the compensation due to Claimants from ARS to USD that is \"determined in accordance with the framework of the respective bank system of the territory of each Contracting Party.\"\n\n561.\n\nThe official exchange rate of 5.55 ARS/1 USD,666 which Claimants suggests to make use of, was not in fact applied by commercial actors to business transactions or currency conversions at the Valuation Date.667 Moreover, as Respondent correctly observes, at the official exchange rate of ARS 5.55/1 USD, the USD was not \"freely convertible currency,\" as Article 5(1) of the BIT provides. In brief, the official exchange rate of 5.55 ARS/1 USD is not the rate which is established by the banks for commercial currency conversions between commercial entities.668 The official exchange rate is therefore not the exchange rate commonly applied within the Argentine banking system for currency conversions at the Valuation Date.\n\nRosen I, Schedules 2A to 2D.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 315.\n\nIbid.\n\n562.\n\nOn the other hand, an ARS/USD rate of 7.23 on the basis of a three-year forecast by 19 reputable analysts made in August 2013, which is also suggested as an alternative to the official exchange rate by Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen, cannot be considered either.669 Indeed, the relevant rate should not be the average of the forecasted - and therefore uncertain - interest rates of the next three years, but the actual rate as applicable on the Valuation Date of 13 August 2013.\n\nRosen I, para. 9.47.\n\n563.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the exchange rate actually applicable to currency conversions therefore is the CCL rate of ARS 8.7/1 USD suggested by Respondent and her expert, Dr. Dapena. In August 2013, the use of this exchange rate was free, unrestricted, and completely legal.670 In the Tribunal's view, the CCL rate was the exchange rate commonly applied within the Argentine banking system to \"freely\" convert ARS into USD in August 2013.\n\nDapena, Transcript, Day 8, p. 169.\n\n***e) Value of Claimants' Investment at the Valuation Date***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nBased on the determination of the various issues that were contested between the Parties' experts, the Tribunal is now in a position to calculate the value of Claimants' investment, that is, its 60% direct shareholding in L&E. To do so, the Tribunal bases itself on the tool provided by Claimants' expert, Mr. Rosen, as part of his updated Control Sheet.671\n\nRosen II, Schedule for Sensitivity Analysis (Exhibit C-299).\n\n565.\n\nAccording to that Control Sheet, and using the debt/equity structure that is more favorable to Respondent (6%/94%), an averaged country risk premium of 8.5%, a USD inflation rate of 2%, and the exchange rate proposed by Respondent of ARS 8.71/1 USD, the value of Claimants' 60% interest in L&E on the Valuation Date on 13 August 2013 is calculated as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 60% interest in participation in ENJASA | USD | 20,510,000 |\n| 60% interest in participation in Cachi Valle | USD | 1,150,000 |\n| **Total** | USD | 21,660,000 |\n\n**C. Consequential Damages**\n----------------------------\n\n566.\n\nClaimants do not only claim compensation for the loss of their investment in L&E, they also claim for consequential damages, in particular costs for closing down ENJASA\u2019s operations.672 In Claimants\u2019 view, these costs are part of full reparation: had the License not been revoked, they would not have been incurred.673 Respondent, by contrast, rejects the claim for consequential damages as unfounded. In Respondent\u2019s view, the balance of ENJASA\u2019s expenses and income after the revocation of the License was positive, so that no compensation for post-revocation expenses was due; any post-revocation expenses of Cachi Valle, in turn, could not be included, as only Claimants\u2019 investment in ENJASA should be valued.674\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 459; Rosen II, paras. 1.4-1.5.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 542-546.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 335-339.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n567.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claim for consequential damages includes the operating costs, overhead expenses, and administrative cost for the period from 13 August to 19 November 2013, i.e., from the revocation of the License by Resolution No. 240/13 until ENJASA\u2019s activities came to a definitive halt. Moreover, Claimants\u2019 claim the additional costs, such as severance costs and restructuring fees, that were caused by the revocation of ENJASA's license and the consequential winding up of Claimants' business in Salta.675 These costs were partially set off by income earned from the operation of the License between 13 August and 19 November 2013, as well as by cash flows generated from the liquidation of gaming-related assets after 19 November 20 1 3.676\n\nExhibit C-299, Excel Sheet, Schedule 4, 4A, 4B, and 4C; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 540-546.\n\nRosen II, para. 13.1. The setoff with income still earned from the License does not contradict the valuation of lost income from the License for the same period, which is the difference between a \"but for\"-income from 2013-2019 minus the actual income between 13 August and 19 November 2013. See Rosen II, para. 13.3.\n\n568.\n\nMr. Rosen concluded in his Second Report that after the revocation of the License, ENJASA and Cachi Valle incurred USD 2.8 Mio in losses, i.e., expenses above revenues. In his calculations, although for ENJASA revenues would still surpass expenses by USD 235,000, the net costs for Cachi Valle for winding up its operations would have been at USD 2.988.878.677 The basis for his calculations, Mr. Rosen states, are the audited financial statements for 2013 and 2014 of ENJASA and Cachi Valle.678\n\nRosen II, Schedule 4; Report, para. 4.7.\n\nRosen Hearing Presentation, Slides 44 and 45; Transcript, Day 8, p. 34; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 546.\n\n569.\n\nAlthough Claimants owned only 60% of L&E when ENJASA's license was revoked, they deducted 100% of the relevant post-revocation expenses because, in their opinion, their acquisition of the remaining 40% of L&E in November 2013 was also caused by the revocation of ENJASA's license.679 Moreover, Mr. Rosen opines that if he were to follow Dr. Dapena's suggestion to only include 60% of the additional costs incurred after November 2013, he would also include only 60% of the additional revenues and not deduct USD 4.6 million net credit received from the transaction with Iberlux. The net impact of doing as Dr. Dapena suggested would, in Mr. Rosen's opinion, increase the amount of consequential damages.680\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 402.\n\nRosen II, paras. 13.1-13.18; Exhibit C-299, Excel Sheet, Schedule 4, notes 7-10.\n\n570.\n\nMr. Rosen did, however, not include in his valuation ARS 38 million of cash and short-term investments as these amounts represent, he opines, redundant assets that were not required for ENJASA's gaming operations. ENJASA would have held the same amount in cash and investments in both the \"but for\" and the actual scenarios.681\n\nRosen II, paras. 13.9-13.10.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n571.\n\nRespondent rejects the claims for the compensation of additional post-revocation expenses. In Dr. Dapena's view, it is incompatible to add post-revocation expenses that are based on the assumption that related costs are caused by the revocation of ENJASA's license, while calculating the value of Claimants' investment in L&E and ENJASA on the assumption that the gaming activities would continue.682\n\nDapena Presentation, Slide 21, Transcript, Day 8, p. 163.\n\n572.\n\nDr. Dapena further notes that there is no documentary support for the allegation that the expenses after the revocation of ENJASA's license actually were incurred, that they were linked to the revocation and that they were actually paid. Mr. Rosen's estimates, Dr. Dapena points out, are based entirely on statements of ENJASA's management. For instance, Dr. Dapena points out that the \"Additional Costs Net of Additional Revenues\" have been multiplied by seven between Mr. Rosen's first report (USD 0.4 million) and his second report (USD 2.8 million) without any documentary support.683\n\nDapena II, paras. 13 and 142. Compare Rosen I, Figure 1 and Rosen II, Figure 2.\n\n573.\n\nDr. Dapena also points out that, when ENJASA was liquidated, Claimants actually recovered the net book value of its assets and that ENJASA did not lose any money; on the contrary, ENJASA's post-revocation income was above its costs in the amount of USD 0.23 million.684 Dr. Dapena thus opines that, as ENJASA sustained no post-revocation loss resulting from its liquidation, no compensation was due. The post-revocation additional revenues offset the post-revocation expenses.685 Moreover, expenses in the amount of USD 2.99 million claimed as consequential losses were related to Cachi Valle, not to ENJASA. As Respondent considered Cachi Valle not to be affected by the revocation of the License, these expenses should not be taken into account.686\n\nTranscript, Day 8, pp. 165 and 223.\n\nDapena, Letter of 30 December 2019, para. 22, referring to Exhibit C-299, Report Schedules \u2013 Tab 1, Summary, line 27.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 334, 337-338.\n\n574.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent does not agree that, because Claimants had obtained 99.94% of L&E's shares in November 2013, they would also be entitled to deduct 99.94% of any post-revocation expenses. In Respondent's opinion, at most 60% of the post-revocation expenses could be taken into account, corresponding to Claimants' ownership share in L&E at the time ENJASA's license was revoked in August 2013.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already pointed out (see *supra* para. 442), Claimants\u2019 entitlement to full reparation for Respondent\u2019s internationally unlawful conduct also encompasses consequential damages that Claimants would not have incurred \"but for\" Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct. This follows from Article 31 of the ILC Articles, which provides that \"any damage ... caused by the internationally wrongful act\" has to be compensated. This encompasses also consequential damage that occurred after the internationally wrongful act occurred.687 Against this background, Claimants would be entitled to compensation for any additional costs caused by the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license and incurred by Claimants after 13 August 2013, provided these costs were not included yet in the valuation of Claimants\u2019 investment at the Valuation Date. Furthermore, consequential damages would not be limited to costs incurred by, or in relation to, ENJASA, but also by, or in relation to, Cachi Valle, given that this company is a wholly owned subsidiary of L&E and that Claimants\u2019 shareholding in L&E was the investment wrongfully expropriated by Respondent.\n\nFor support in prior jurisprudence, see eg *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award (6 February 2007) para. 352 (Exhibit CL-034); *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award (5 October 2012) paras. 792-797 (Exhibit CL-022).\n\n576.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, is not convinced that any additional post-revocation costs relating to L&E, ENJASA, or Cachi Valle have been successfully proven by Claimants. What Claimants and their expert, Mr. Rosen, have failed to consider are the financial benefits Claimants potentially received via ENJASA through the sale of the hotel for ARS 20,590,902 and via Cachi Valle for the sale of the premises of Casino Salta for ARS 16,133,635, which both took place in 2017.688 Both of these transactions are not taken appropriately into account by Mr. Rosen in valuing the post-revocation consequential damages.\n\nSee Exhibit C-299-32, pp. 19 and 53 (ENJASA 2017 Financial Statement); Exhibit C-299-42, p. 21 (Cachi Valle 2017 Financial Statement).\n\n577.\n\nWhile it is true that both of these assets - that is, the real estate of Casino Salta and of the hotel - would have survived the end of ENJASA\u2019s license and could have been sold in 2029, it is not appropriate to exclude the amounts received from the sales of these assets in 2017 completely. Instead, what Claimants would have needed to show in order to exclude both assets is that the value received in 2017 was smaller or equivalent to the value they would have likely received for a sale of both assets in 2029, taking into account that the 2029 value must be discounted to a 2017 value. In other words, Claimants would only be entitled to disregard the proceeds from the sale of the hotel and of Casino Salta, if it was sufficiently certain that the money they received in 2017 for the sale of both assets would have, when invested at a risk free rate, taking into account the country risk, inflation, etc, resulted in an amount that was lower than, or at the most equivalent to, the likely sales prizes they could have achieved in 2029.\n\n578.\n\nClaimants have not shown that, under these assumptions, the sale of the hotel and of Casino Salta in 2017 did not generate any profits because they realized value from both transactions that they may not have realized in 2029, for example, because the real estate value could have declined between 2017 and 2029 and/or the value of the assets depreciated. The Tribunal could well envisage that Claimants were able to realize gains from the 2017 sales of both assets that they would not have been able to realize from sales in 2029. Since the Tribunal is not able to attribute a precise value to these financial gains, given that Claimants have not met their burden of proof in this respect, the Tribunal assumes, in favor of Respondent, that the value of financial gains covered the post-revocation costs claimed by Claimants. Consequently, the Tribunal declines to award any consequential damages to Claimants.\n\n579.\n\nAgainst this background, it is also not necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether Claimants are able, as submitted by Claimants, to claim for 100% of the post-revocation expenses given that they had purchased 40% of shares of L&E from Iberlux in November 2013, or whether their claim would be limited, as submitted by Respondent, to 60% of the expenses in question. In this context, the Tribunal observes that the price itself, which was paid by Claimants to Iberlux in return for obtaining 40% of L&E, was not claimed by Claimants as consequential damage and that, in the event Claimants were entitled to claim 100% of the post-revocation expenses, they also would have to include 100% of any profits they may have made from the sales of the hotel and of Casino Salta in the computation.\n\n**D. Interest**\n---------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n580.\n\nThe Parties also differ on questions relating to pre- and post-award interest. While they agree that interest is due as from the Valuation Date,689 they have different positions on the applicable interest rate and on whether interest should be simple or compounded.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 539-564; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 700, 703.\n\n581.\n\nClaimants point out that Article 4(2) of the BIT specifically states that in the event an investment is legally expropriated, \"compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall bear interest until the date of payment, at the customer bank rate of the State in whose territory the investment has been made.\" However, Claimants maintain that this provision does not apply to cases of unlawful expropriations. For Claimants, the rationale for awarding interest is to put the investor in the position he or she would have been in \"but for\" the breach of the BIT, by awarding a fair and reasonable amount for lost return opportunities. For Claimants, an interest rate of 6% is reasonable from a legal as well as an economic viewpoint.690 Many awards, Claimants point out, have applied such a 6% interest rate.691 For Claimants, an interest rate of 6% also is reasonable and adequate, considering inter alia the amount of inflation in Argentina. They thus instructed their expert, Mr. Rosen, to apply an interest rate of 6%.692\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 550.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, paras. 555-556 (referring inter alia to *S.S. Wimbledon*, PCIJ (17 August 1923) Series A No. 1, p. 32 (Exhibit CL-043); *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007) para. 9.2.8 (Exhibit CL-032)).\n\nRosen I, para. 12.3.\n\n582.\n\nAddressing a question from the Tribunal at the Hearing, Claimants' expert rejected the US inter-bank prime rate, because that rate is unrelated to investments, but applies to low-risk bank loans; besides, it too is lower than the inflation rate.693 Whenever investment tribunals have applied the prime rate, they have increased it by a margin of 2 to 4%, Claimants point out.694\n\nTranscript, Day 8, pp. 44-46.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, paras. 564-567.\n\n583.\n\nClaimants further observe that the current position of investment tribunals is to award compound interest in connection with breaches of international law. Only compound interest can put the investor in a situation as if the breach had never occurred. Whether compound interest is allowed or not under Argentine law, Claimants argue, is irrelevant for any compensation due under international law, as was confirmed by the Tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia.*695\n\nRosen II, paras. 14.1-14.14; *Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award (16 September 2015) paras. 520-524 (Exhibit CL-030). In *Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award (17 February 2000) para. 97 (Exhibit CL-004), quoted in Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 542, compound interest was granted.\n\n584.\n\nRespondent, by contrast, considers the 6% interest rate that Mr. Rosen was instructed to apply by Claimants to be too high in the current market scenario.696 Also the prime rate is, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, too high.697 Instead, Respondent suggests to apply a short-term, risk-free interest rate, such as the rate of six-month or one-year US treasury bills. The average interest rate from 2014 until 2020 was 1.1% for a one-year treasury bill and 1% for a six-month one.698\n\nRosen, Transcript, Day 8, p. 103; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 558.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 539.\n\nCEMA 31, Valuation Model, Tab 'T bills'; Dapena II, para. 201.\n\n585.\n\nMoreover, for Respondent, the interest should not be compounded. Compound interest should only apply when interest obtained is actively reinvested. Moreover, for interest on compensation to be paid, Argentine rules and regulations provide for a simple interest rate.699 Simple interest moreover complies with US procedural guidelines.700\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 700-705; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 540-550.\n\nDapena II, paras. 197-211.\n\n586.\n\nClaimants, in turn, consider the short-term risk free US treasury bond rate inappropriate, as also was decided in *L&E v. Argentina*701 and *PSEG v. Turkey.**702* Indeed, Claimants submit they would not have invested the compensation for unlawful expropriation in risk-free bonds if received in 2013, but would have put it in their businesses with a greater return. Besides, the yield on a one-year US treasury bill was in 2013 for instance 0.13% and on a six-month bill 0.09%, while the US inflation rate at the valuation date was 2.3%.703\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT indicates that compensation as part of a lawful expropriation will \"bear interest until the date of payment.\" Although the BIT does not state that explicitly, also for unlawful expropriation, compensation under the principle of full reparation for internationally unlawful conduct has to bear interest from the Valuation Date until the date of payment. This is what follows from general international law concerning State responsibility. As Article 38 of the ILC Articles provides:\n\nArticle 38\n\nInterest\n\n1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.\n\n2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\n\n588.\n\nIn order to ensure full reparation of a private investor for breaches of a treaty protecting his or her investment the computation of compensation requires that from the date the expropriation occurred, i.e., the Valuation Date, until the day the award is rendered, pre-award interests are added to the compensation, while from the date of the Award until the date of actual payment, post-award interests have to be paid in addition. Without the payment of interest, full reparation cannot be achieved as the investor would be deprived of the time-value of the compensation due as of the Valuation Date.704\n\nAlthough none of the Parties alleged that the payment of interest would lead to double recovery, the Dissent (paras. 36 and 431) alleges that this is the case. However, future profits are discounted to the Valuation Date, as from which date they bear interest until the date of payment. This excludes double discovery.\n\n589.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, which is shared by the Parties,705 the same interest rate should be granted for the pre-award as for the post-award period. The Parties disagree, however, on the interest rate to be applied. Claimants suggest 6%; Respondent suggests 1%. The Tribunal considers an interest rate of 6% on the USD too high, considering inter alia the present decade of low inflation in the United States. The four ICSID awards cited by Claimants, which granted 6% on the USD all cover the period of the late 1990s to the early 2000s, when USD interest rates were substantially higher than in later times, especially in the period from 2013 to 2021.706\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 549 (expressly stating that the same rate should apply); Respondent Post-Hearing Briefs, paras. 350-356 (treating interest as one issue without distinguishing pre- and post-award interest).\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB 99/6, Award (12 April 2002) para. 175 (Exhibit CL-044); *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award (30 August 2000) para. 122 (Exhibit CL-011); *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. AR(AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003) para. 197 (Exhibit CL-08); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB /97/3, Award (20 August 2007) para. 9.2.8 (Exhibit CL-032).\n\n590.\n\nOn the other hand, for the Tribunal, the 1% interest rate suggested by Respondent, which is based upon the interest of one-year risk-free US treasury bonds, is too low in staying below annual US inflation since 2013. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants would not have been likely to invest the compensation received in 1% risk-free US government bonds, but in their own business.\n\n591.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in the context of applying the DCF method to valuing Claimants' investment, for Claimants considered 3.39% a reasonable risk-free rate, while for Respondent that rate was 6.59% (see *supra* paras. 463, 499). Taking into account their respective positions and the fact that Claimants could have invested the funds worldwide, the Tribunal considers an annual interest rate of 4% to be fair and equitable and sufficient, but also necessary, in order to ensure full reparation in the sense of Article 38 of the ILC Articles.\n\n592.\n\nClaimants have requested that the interest should be compounded annually, while Respondent argued that interests should not be compounded. The BIT does not contain an express provision on compound interests. The Tribunal, however, considers compound interest to be consistent with economic reality and therefore necessary in the sense of Article 38(1) of the ILC Articles in order to ensure full reparation of an investor for breach of a treaty that aims at protecting his or her investment.707 The Tribunal agrees in this respect with what has been stated in *Gemplus v. Mexico:*\n\n[I]t is the universal practice of banks and other loan providers in the world market to provide monies at a cost amounting to or equivalent to compound rates of interest and not simple interest. In addition ... it is current practice of international tribunals (including ICSID) to award compound and not simple interest. In the Tribunal's opinion, there is now a form of 'jurisprudence *constante\"* where the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest, rather than vice-versa.708\n\nThe Dissent (paras. 38 and 432) considers that the Tribunal's majority is not entitled to grant compound interests. However, the Tribunal's majority is not convinced that the 1925 award in a State-to-State arbitration in *Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol* (1 May 1925) II RIAA 615, 650-651, which dismissed compound interest, is still relevant. Moreover, the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility only considered the exclusion of compound interests to be \"the general view\" at the time of its adoption. Since then, several investment treaty tribunals have granted compound interest, which better compensates for the time-value of money and better helps prevent delays of payment than simple interests does. Furthermore, for the grant of compound interest the position under the host State's domestic law is irrelevant, despite the reference in Article 8(6) of the BIT to domestic law, as the interest in question here is granted under the international law governing State responsibility as part of consequences of Respondent's breach of the BIT.\n\n*Gemplus, S.A., SLP S.A., and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/04/3, Award (16 June 2010) para. 16-26.\n\n593.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal therefore decides that interest of 4% per annum, compounded annually is due to Claimants on the amount owed by Respondent as compensation for the unlawful expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina as from the Valuation Date of 13 August 2013.\n\n**VIII.** **C****osts**\n-----------------------\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n594.\n\nThe Parties agreed to submit costs statements accompanied by affidavits signed by counsel. The Parties further agreed that they would provide their costs statements in different currencies and that they would use different breakdowns of their respective costs, according to which (a) Claimants would use the categories \"Arbitrators Fees and Administrative Costs, Legal Fees and Expenses, Expert Fees and Expenses, Hearing Costs, Travel Costs and Accommodation Costs\"; and (b) Respondent would use the categories \"Personnel, Experts, Airplane Tickets, Hotels and Travel Expenses, Translations, Stationery, Shipping, and Payments to ICSID\".\n\n595.\n\nClaimants contend that they should be reimbursed for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration, including internal costs, as well as \"appropriate interest thereon\".709 Regarding the jurisdictional phase in particular, Claimants argue that since they \"were successful in the jurisdictional phase, they should be awarded all costs incurred in the jurisdictional phase.\"710\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 584.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 581-582.\n\n596.\n\nIn their costs statement, Claimants specify the costs incurred in connection with the arbitration, including internal costs, that they claim to amount to the total sums of EUR 3,725,134.37 and USD 1,767,984.65, plus interest,711 broken down as follows:712\n\ni.

Respondent further considers that Claimants have included costs corresponding to an expert in the amount of EUR 56,700.00 and a law firm in the amount of EUR 4,667,40 that did not appear in the present proceeding or in the written record submitted to the Tribunal. Finally, Respondent contends that certain items included by Claimants under \"travel costs\" are not reasonable, namely costs incurred for travel for the preparation of Claimants\u2019 case.714\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 357-358.\n\nRespondent's letter of 17 August 2021.\n\n598.\n\nRespondent claims the total sum of USD 1,523,439.48 plus interest,715 broken down as follows:716\n\ni.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention addresses the assessment and allocation of the costs of an ICSID arbitration as follows:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n600.\n\nThis provision, as is widely recognized in ICSID practice, gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties.\n\n601.\n\nAs both Parties have requested the Tribunal to order the other Party to bear the costs of the proceeding, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to exercise that discretion so as to require Respondent to pay the entire costs of the arbitration, including the lodging fee, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, as well as those reasonable costs that Claimants have incurred in respect of the proceeding.\n\n602.\n\nThe main consideration for the Tribunal in exercising its discretion in this way is that Claimants have prevailed in respect of the preliminary objections raised by Respondent, except, primarily, for the objection for lack of a *prima facie* case relating to the claim for breach of the BIT\u2019s national treatment provision, which was an issue that did not materially affect the dispute and the time and cost spent by either Party or the Tribunal, as well as on liability and - to a considerable degree - also on quantum. Awarding costs for the arbitration and attorney fees and other expenses also ensures that Claimants receive full reparation for the unlawful expropriation they suffered as a consequence of the revocation of ENJASA\u2019s license, as they would not have needed to incur any of the costs necessary for the present proceeding without Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct.\n\n603.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Arbitrators' fees and expenses* Prof. Dr. Hans van Houtte | USD 314,878.00 |\n| Prof. Dr. Stephan W. Schill | USD 376,300.39 |\n| Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez | USD 526,318.56 |\n| *ICSID's administrative fees* | USD 264,000.00 |\n| *Direct expenses* | USD 454,796.99 |\n| **Total** | USD 1,936,293.94 |\n\n604.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties, with Claimants having contributed USD 1,000,000.00 and Respondent USD 1,000,000.00. Therefore, each Party has contributed USD 968,146.97 to the expended portion of the advances made to ICSID. As a consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to allocate costs to Respondent, Claimants are therefore entitled to the payment of USD 968,146.97 by Respondent.717 Claimants are also entitled to the payment of the lodging fee (USD 25,000.00) by Respondent. Accordingly, Respondent shall pay to Claimants USD 993,146.97 for the expended portion of Claimants\u2019 advances to ICSID and the lodging fee.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n605.\n\nAs for the costs that Claimants have incurred for the present proceeding in respect of legal fees and expenses, expert fees and expenses, and costs for the hearing, travel and accommodation, the Tribunal is aware that these costs represent some 10% of the amount initially claimed and some 25% of the amount ultimately awarded. This notwithstanding, the Tribunal is of the view that these costs are reasonable and therefore appropriately allocated to Respondent.\n\n606.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the costs do not appear excessive, neither in relation to the sum claimed, nor in relation to the costs incurred and claimed by Respondent. As regards the latter aspect, the Tribunal is aware that Claimants could not rely on the administrative structure that Respondent has built up over the course of a large number of investment cases, but had to retain specialized outside counsel to conduct the proceedings. Moreover, the cost-structure of in-house counsel within a State\u2019s administration is not comparable to that of outside counsel. The Tribunal also acknowledges that the fees of Claimants\u2019 experts and advisors were higher than those of Respondent\u2019s experts, but considers these fees not to be unreasonable, but within market level.\n\n607.\n\nAs for the costs of the expert in the amount of EUR 56,700 and fees for a law firm in the amount of EUR 4,667,50 that have neither appeared before the Tribunal, nor have been mentioned in the record, the Tribunal sees no reason to exclude those as costs incurred by Claimants \"in connection with the proceedings\" in the sense of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention is not worded narrowly to cover only costs for legal and expert advice that has been presented in written submissions or in oral hearing to the Tribunal. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention instead covers any \"expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this would also cover expenses for expert and legal advice received in the preparation of the claim (or its defense) by law firms and experts other than counsel of record in the present proceeding and experts that have either appeared before the Tribunal or made written submissions. Since Respondent does not challenge that the costs in the amount of EUR 61,367,50 in question have actually been incurred by Claimants, the Tribunal considers that these expenses have been reasonably incurred.\n\n608.\n\nFinally, for the Tribunal, not only the travel expenses to attend the hearings may be reimbursed as costs of the proceeding, but also those travel costs incurred to investigate the facts and interview witnesses in preparation of the hearing. These expenses as well are covered by the wording of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention as \"expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings.\"\n\n609.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal awards Claimants the costs incurred in connection with the proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre in the total sums of EUR 3,725,134.37 and USD 1,736,131.62, broken down as follows:\n\ni. Expended portion of Claimants' advances to ICSID and the lodging fee: USD 993,146.97\n\nii. Legal fees and expenses: EUR 2,556,246.71 and USD 228,178.50\n\niii. Expert fees and expenses: EUR 991,913.17 and USD 514,806.15\n\niv. Hearing costs, travel costs and accommodation costs: EUR 176,974.49.\n\n610.\n\nAs far as the award of interest on costs is concerned, the Tribunal is of the view that, even though Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention does not mention the payment of interest on costs, these costs are part of the Award and should be covered by the interest provision of the Award, if so requested by the Party in question. Full reparation of Claimants in the sense of Article 38 of the ILC Articles requires, in the Tribunal's view, that interest is due also on the costs of the proceedings from the date the Award is rendered. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention is no bar to an award of interest; this provision only addresses the allocation of costs between the parties, but is silent as to whether allocated costs are to accrue interest as from their allocation or not.718 As for the interest rate, the Tribunal adopts the same interest rate as that adopted for the amount of damages awarded, that is, 4% per annum compounded annually, with interests running from the date of the Award until full payment thereof.\n\nOrdering the payment of interest on costs is also not unusual in ICSID practice. For a few recent examples, see *State General Reserve Fund of the Sultanate of Oman v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No ARB/15/43, Award (13 August 2019) para. 82; *Bridgestone Licensing Services, Inc. and Bridgestone Americas, Inc. v. Republic of Panama*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/34, Award (14 August 2020) para. 589; *UP and C.D Holding Internationale v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/35, Award (9 October 2018) para. 622. The Dissent (para. 447), by contrast, is of the view that no interests are due on costs because Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention does not provide so.\n\n**IX.** **D****ecision**\n------------------------\n\n611.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides, by majority, as follows:\n\n(1) Respondent has breached Article 4(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Austria BIT by subjecting Claimants to an unlawful expropriation.\n\n(2) The Tribunal makes no findings as to the claimed breaches by Respondent of Articles 4(3) and 2(1) of the Argentina-Austria BIT, as any such breaches would be consumed by the finding under (1).\n\n(3) Respondent is liable to pay compensation to Claimants in the amount of USD 21,660,000 plus interest at a rate of 4% per annum compounded annually from 13 August 2013 until full payment thereof.\n\n(4) Respondent shall pay to Claimants for the costs incurred in connection with the proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre (i) USD 1,736,131.62 and (ii) EUR 3,725,134.37, plus interest at a rate of 4% per annum compounded annually on both (i) and (ii) from the date of the Award until full payment thereof.\n\n(5) The Tribunal rejects all other claims.\n\n612.\n\nArbitrator Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez appends a Dissenting Opinion to the Tribunal\u2019s Award."}]}
