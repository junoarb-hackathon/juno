The critical part of this provision is its final sentence which reads:\n\n*\"Le consentement des parties \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI ou du m\u00e9canisme suppl\u00e9mentaire, selon le cas, requis par les instruments les r\u00e9gissant, est constitu\u00e9 pour la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire par le pr\u00e9sent article, et est exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment pour la personne concern\u00e9e. \"*\n\n3.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the quoted language means that the Respondent, the Republic of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, has consented to ICSID arbitration. The question now before the Arbitrai Tribunal is whether the Claimants have consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nWhilst Article 20-including its final sentence - is not a wonder of clarity, it is in my view clear that the quoted text also requires an investor to consent to ICSID arbitration at some point, in connection with the application for approval of the investment in question *(\"demande d agr\u00e9ment\").* It follows from this, that it is not sufficient for purposes of Article 20 of the Code to submit a request for ICSID arbitration once a dispute has arisen. Such a request does not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 20 of the Code.\n\n5.\n\nThe jurisdictional requirements to be analyzed by the Arbitral Tribunal are set forth in Ivorian municipal legislation, i.e. the Code, and must therefore be interpreted based on Ivorian principies of statutory interpretation At the same time, since we are dealing with a jurisdictional issue under an international treaty - the ICSID Convention - rules and principles of interpretation under international law must be applied, to wit, rules and principles relating to the interpretation of unilateral acts of States. This is so because the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 20 of the Code constitutes a unilateral act. a unilateral declaration by the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The combination of these two approaches to interpretation results in my view in the following four key interpretative elements: good faith; the plain (ordinary) meaning of the words used; the context in which the words are used; and the intention of the State in issuing the unilateral declaration.\n\n6.\n\nLet me start with the context in which the words used in the last sentence of Article 20 of the Code are found.\n\n7.\n\nArticle 20 of the Code as a whole deals with various forms of dispute settlement mechanisms. The second paragraph of the provision states that disputes between individuals, or legal entities, and the Republic of Cote d\u2019Ivoire concerning the application of the Code are to be resolved by Ivorian courts, or by an Arbitral Tribunal *(\"est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par les juridictions ivoiriennes ou par un Tribunal Arbitral\").* It then goes on to describe how the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals is to be determined. It is thus in the context of making a choice of a dispute settlement mechanism that we find the last sentence of Article 20 of the Code. An investor has the choice between, on the one hand, Ivorian courts, and on the other hand different forms of arbitration, including an arbitration mechanism specifically agreed between the parties in question.\n\n8.\n\nAs far as the choice of ICSID arbitration is concerned, it is regulated by the last sentence of Article 20. The unilateral consent thereto by the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is provided by the provision itself. The consent of the other party *\"est exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment...\".*\n\n9.\n\nIn my view the plain and ordinary meaning of the quoted words is that such consent is to be expressly stated in the application for approval of the investment (*\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\")* by the investor. I hasten to add that in my view this is also the natural meaning of the words in question resulting from a good faith interpretation of them.\n\n10.\n\nI am reinforced in my view when I analyze the plain and ordinary meaning of the three critical elements of the text viz., 1. *\"est exorim\u00e9\";* 2. *\"express\u00e9ment\";* and 3. *\"dans la.\"* I will address each of them.\n\n1. *Est exprim\u00e9'.*\n\nIn the context in which these two words appear, their plain and ordinary meaning is: *\"to be expressed\".* In other words, even though the present tense is used *(\"est\"),* the words indicate the imperative, i.e. something that is to be done. *\"Exprim\u00e9\"* is of course derived from the verb *\"exprimer\"* the dictionary meaning of which is *\"faire conna\u00eetre par la langue\".* In other words, make something known using language, as opposed to other means of communication. The two words thus mean that something is to be expressed by using language.\n\n2. *Express\u00e9ment:*\n\nThe plain and ordinary meaning of the adverb *\"express\u00e9ment\"* is: *\"en termes expr\u00e8s, form\u00e9ls\",* or in English: *\"expressly\", \"in an express manner\",* or *\"explicitly\".* To put it differently: whatever is to be done *\"express\u00e9ment\"* must be done in such a way so as to leave no doubt with respect to the act, choice or declaration in question. In my view, the requirement for an express choice is particularly important in the context of Article 20 of the Code, dealing, as it does, with the choice of a dispute settlement mechanism.\n\n3. *Dans la:*\n\nThe words *\"exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment\"* are followed by the words *\"dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* The word *\"dans\"* serves as the preposition in the sentence leading on to, and indicating where the consent *(\"le consentement\")* is to be found, i.e. in the *\"demande d\u2019agrement\".* Whilst it could perhaps be argued -as Claimants have done - that *\"dans\"* and *\"par\",* from a grammatical point of view could have similar functions, they do not normally have the same meaning. The natural - and in my view the only reasonable - meaning of *\"dans\"* in Article 20 of the Code is *\"in\",* i.e. indicating that the consent must be set forth in - dans la - *\"demande d\u2019agrement\"*\n\n11.\n\nThis analysis leads me to conclude that the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the last sentence of Article 20 of the Code is that in order to properly to consent to ICSID arbitration, the investor, ie., the Claimants, must expressly select ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\".* It is undisputed that the Claimants have not done so.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that the submission itself of the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* satisfies the requirements of Article 20 of the Code. I do not agree with that argument. First, it is not reconcilable with the interpretation of Article 20 of the Code that I have explained above. Second, accepting the Claimants\u2019 argument would mean that every investor who submits a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\" -* and which is eventually accepted by the relevant Ivorian authorities -would be deemed to have consented to ICSID arbitration. That cannot be right. In my view this is not a reasonable - nor the natural - interpretation of Article 20 of the Code.\n\n13.\n\nHaving thus taken into account three of the four interpretive elements mentioned above - good faith; the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used; and the context - it is strictly speaking not necessary to dwell on the fourth element - the intention of the State issuing the unilateral declaration. In its briefs and at the hearing, the Respondent explained the purpose and intention behind Article 20 of the Code. I do not intend to - nor do I need to - review the policy goals which prompted the regulation in Article 20 of the Code. Suffice it to say that I find no reason to doubt them, nor do I find them unreasonable. The intentions as explained by the Respondent seem to be reflected in Article 20 of the Code, including the last sentence of it, particularly in light of the context in which the last sentence appears.\n\n14.\n\nBased on the foregoing, I am of the view that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to try the claims put forward by the Claimants."}], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** pursuant to Ordonnance N\u00b0 2012-87 of 7 June 2012, *Code des Investissements* **(\"2012 Code\"),** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n2.\n\nThe Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has objected to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the ground that the Claimants failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 20 of the 2012 Code which, according to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, requires foreign investors to expressly declare their consent to ICSID arbitration in their request for investment authorization *(\u00bf'demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\")* which the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire claims that the Claimants failed to do.1\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to ICSID dated 5 December 2016.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Resort Company Invest Abidjan, Stanislas Citerici and G\u00e9rard Bot against the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire accompanied by factual exhibits 1 through 54 (the **\"Request\").**\n\n6.\n\nOn 29 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as supplemented by the Claimants\u2019 letter of 17 March 2016, submitted with factual exhibits 55 through 67, and the Claimants\u2019 letter of 25 March 2016.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 16 June 2016, the Claimants informed the Centre that the Parties were attempting to agree on a method of constitution of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and decided to postpone the constitution of the Tribunal until 1 September 2016.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 6 September 2016, the Claimants informed the Centre that the Parties had agreed to constitute the Tribunal pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, composed of three members nominated pursuant to Rule 3 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****).** The Claimants indicated that they wished to appoint the Honorable L. Yves Fortier QC as arbitrator, and that the Respondent wished to appoint Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r as arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, the Centre invited the Respondent to confirm (i) its agreement with the method proposed by the Claimants for the constitution of the Tribunal which, if confirmed, would constitute an agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal for the purposes of Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention; and (ii) to confirm its appointment of Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r as arbitrator. The Centre also noted the Parties\u2019 disagreement as to the language of the proceedings and the place of arbitration, and informed them that these questions would be discussed at the First Session.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 13 September 2016, the Claimants confirmed their request that the Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants appointed the Honourable L. Yves Fortier QC, a national of Canada, as arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nOn 14 September 2016, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Claimants\u2019 letter of 13 September 2016, and informed the Parties that the Tribunal would be constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Centre noted that the Claimants had nominated the Honourable L. Yves Fortier QC, a national of Canada, as arbitrator and invited the Respondent to confirm its nomination of Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r, a national of Sweden, as arbitrator.\n\n12.\n\nOn 23 September 2016, the Respondent (i) confirmed its agreement that 'the *Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to a mechanism identical to that provided for in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention\"* (ii) confirmed its appointment of Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r, a national of Sweden, as arbitrator; and (iii) invited ICSID to \"*appoint the third arbitrator who will serve as President of the Tribunal\".*\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that the Honourable L. Yves Fortier QC had accepted his appointment as arbitrator in this case.\n\n14.\n\nBy email of 26 September 2016, the Claimants requested that the President of the Tribunal be designated by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.\n\n15.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r had accepted his appointment as arbitrator in this case.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 14 October 2016, the Centre invited the Parties to consider a list of seven candidates for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 21 October 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that they had agreed to appoint Professor Zachary Douglas QC, a national of Australia, as the presiding arbitrator in this case.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 27 October 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1) notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ella Rosenberg, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 10 November 2016, further to several exchanges with the Parties, the Tribunal proposed that the First Session be held by videoconference on 16 December 2016.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 21 November 2016, the Centre circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to help the Parties prepare for the First Session and set out the Tribunal\u2019s views on certain matters raised in draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, The Respondent submitted (i) its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction; (ii) a request to bifurcate the proceedings; and (iii) its comments on draft PO 1.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of 9 December 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the issue of whether the Respondent\u2019s Objections would be decided in a preliminary phase of this arbitration and whether the proceedings on the merits should be suspended in accordance with Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules would not be on the agenda for the First Session scheduled to occur on 16 December 2016. The Tribunal further invited Claimants to submit a response to Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceedings by 19 December 2016.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 12 December 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that given that there was no agreement on the language to be used by the Tribunal for the First Session, a coin would be flipped to determine whether it would be English (as requested by the Respondent) or French (as requested by the Claimants). The coin flipping would occur on 14 December 2016, via telephone conference, between the Parties and Ms. Ella Rosenberg, Secretary of the Tribunal, who would flip the coin.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 December 2016, the coin toss was held to determine the language to be used by the Tribunal during the First Session. It resulted from the coin toss that it would be French. The Centre transmitted the video and audio recordings of the coin toss to the Parties and the Tribunal on the same day.\n\n25.\n\nAlso on 14 December 2016, the Tribunal circulated a proposed agenda for the First Session scheduled for 16 December 2016.\n\n26.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, the Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties by videoconference. The Tribunal members participated from London and used French, the Claimants participated from Paris and also used French, and the Respondent and Ms. Rosenberg participated from Washington D.C. and used English.\n\n27.\n\nDuring the First Session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted, that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal and that they agreed on the application of the 2006 version of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They also agreed that the place of the proceedings would be Washington D.C.\n\n28.\n\nOn 19 December 2016, the Claimants submitted a response to Respondent\u2019s Objections and a request to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties the executed versions of Procedural Order No. 1 in French and English, as well as the procedural timetables.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 December 2016, Respondent submitted a Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Response of 19 December 2016.\n\n31.\n\nAlso on 26 December 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that it had received an application from Mr. Oulepo Nemlin Hie for leave to file a non-disputing party submission on behalf of the ex-employees of the \"Caf\u00e9 de Rome\", and invited their comments by 17 January 2017.\n\n32.\n\nOn 10 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, whereby it decided that \"the *preliminary objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction raised by the Respondent in its letter of 5 December 2016 shall be determined in a preliminary phase of these proceedings and that the proceedings on the merits shall be suspended pending the Tribunal\u2019s determination\".*\n\n33.\n\nBy letters of 17 and 18 January 2017, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively, objected to Mr. Oulepo\u2019s request to intervene in these proceedings as a non-disputing party.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of 18 January 2017, the Respondent stated that it intended to file an expert opinion that would address issues of international investment law together with its Memorial on Jurisdiction and that it *\"may rely on expertise in the area of Ivorian law\"*\n\n35.\n\nOn 19 January 2017, the Tribunal took note of the Respondent\u2019s intention to file an expert opinion on *\"issues of international investment law\"*. The Tribunal also indicated that while *\"it is ultimately for the parties to decide how to present their cases\"* it had *\"a strong preference for points of international investment law to be made by submission rather than by expert evidence\".*\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of 1 February 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would reserve its position on Mr. Oulepo\u2019s request to intervene as a non-disputing party, as it considered the question to be premature.\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, Mr. Oulepo wrote to the Tribunal to request access to the Parties\u2019 comments on his application to intervene in these proceedings as a non-disputing party.\n\n38.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction along with factual exhibits R-l through R-10, the expert opinion of Professor Sohuily Felix Acka and the witness statement of Mr. Esmel Emmaniel Essis.\n\n39.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits along with factual exhibits C-69 through C-99.\n\n40.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they did not consent to Mr. Oulepo\u2019s request to access the Parties\u2019 comments on his application to intervene in these proceedings as a non-disputing party.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of 9 March 2017, the Tribunal informed Mr. Oulepo that his request to access the Parties\u2019 comments on his application was denied.\n\n42.\n\nOn 17 March 2017, the Claimants submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction along with factual exhibits C-100 through C-108, and an expert opinion by Professor Emmanuel Gaillard.\n\n43.\n\nOn 20 March 2017, The Respondent wrote that in submitting Professor Emmanuel Gaillard\u2019s expert opinion with their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants had failed to follow the instructions conveyed in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 19 January 2017. Subsequently, the Respondent requested leave to submit a draft opinion of Professor Christoph Schreuer into the record.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of 21 March 2017, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n45.\n\nOn 21 March 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm, by 23 March 2017, their availability for a pre-hearing organizational meeting, to be held by teleconference. The Tribunal also circulated a draft agenda and invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal confirming their points of agreement, or their respective points of disagreement no later than 27 March 2017. The Tribunal further informed the Parties that it would revert to them in due course concerning the Respondent\u2019s request of 20 March 2017 to submit Professor Schreuer\u2019s draft Opinion into the record.\n\n46.\n\nOn 22 March 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to file a signed and dated report by Professor Schreuer by no later than 27 March 2017. The Respondent did so on 24 March 2017.\n\n47.\n\nOn 29 March 2017, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference. Minutes of the pre-hearing organizational meeting were transmitted to the Parties on 4 April 2017.\n\n48.\n\nOn 4 April 2017, the Parties submitted their respective skeleton arguments.\n\n49.\n\nThe Hearing on jurisdiction (the **\"Hearing\")** took place on 6 and 7 April 2017 at the World Bank offices in Washington, D.C. In attendance at the Hearing were the\n\nMembers of the Tribunal, the Secretary of the Tribunal, and the following Party representatives:\n\n*On behalf of Claimants*\n\nMs. Dany\u00e8le Palazo-Gauthier, Cabinet Tour Maubourg Ms. Marie P. Michon, Cabinet Tour Maubourg Mr. Francois Tosi, Cabinet Tosi\n\nMr. Jean-Chrysostome Blessy, Cabinet Blessy Mr. Alain F\u00e9n\u00e9on, Cabinet F\u00e9n\u00e9on\n\n*On behalf of Respondent*  Mr. Lee Capian, Arent Fox Mr. Timothy Feighery, Arent Fox Mr. Gerard Levai, Arent Fox Ms. Laure Hadas-Lebel, Arent Fox Mr. Hady Gouda, Arent Fox intern\n\n50.\n\nThe Hearing was sound recorded and the audio recordings were made available to the Tribunal and the Parties on 19 April 2017, on the Box platform created for this case. Verbatim transcripts of the Hearing were made available to the Tribunal and the Parties in real-time.\n\n51.\n\nOn 28 April 2017, the Parties submitted their respective submissions on costs, and their comments on the decision issued on 8 March 2017 in the case of *Vladislav Kim and others* v. *Republic of Uzbekistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6), as requested by the Tribunal during the Hearing. On the same date, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to submit the revised versions of the Hearing\u2019s transcripts on 9 May 2017.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter of 9 May 2017, the Claimants submitted the Parties\u2019 revisions to the transcripts. The only disagreement between the Parties regarding the transcripts related to the translation into French of the terms \"*state\", \"asked', \"spell out\", \"set forth formally\"* and *\"perfected'* which had been translated as *\"exprim\u00e9\".*\n\n53.\n\nBy letter of 10 May 2017, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter of 9 May 2017, and requested that the Tribunal let the French translation stand and reject the Claimants\u2019 proposed modifications.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 May 2017, the Parties submitted their respective replies on costs.\n\n**III.

THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Respondent\u2019s position\n--------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the ground that the Claimants allegedly failed to meet the consent requirements of Article 20 of the 2012 Code requiring an investor to expressly state its consent to ICSID arbitration in the application for authorization *(demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment)4* According to the Respondent, since the Claimants never properly accepted the Respondent\u2019s offer to consent to ICSID arbitration, no agreement to arbitrate between the Parties ever formed and the Claimants\u2019 claims should be dismissed in their entirety.5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 1-2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 6.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objection focuses on the language of the last sentence of Article 20 of the 2012 Code which states:\n\n*Le consentement des parties \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI ou du m\u00e9canisme suppl\u00e9mentaire, selon le cas, requis par les instruments les r\u00e9gissant est constitu\u00e9, pour la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire par le pr\u00e9sent article, et exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment pour la personne concern\u00e9e.6*\n\nExhibit C-77: Publication au Journal Officiel en date du 20 septembre 2012 de l\u2019Ordonnance n\u00b02012-487 portant nouveau Code des Investissements du 7 juin 2012.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that by its own clear terms, Article 20 imposes unambiguous conditions on an investor\u2019s ability to perfect its consent to ICSID arbitration.7 According to the Respondent, an investor may only accept the Respondent\u2019s offer of consent to ICSID arbitration by expressly indicating so in the *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment.* The Respondent\u2019s position is that the consent of the investor does not arise impliedly through the submission of the *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment.8* The Respondent submits that it is undisputed that no express consent to ICSID arbitration was given on the part of the Claimants in their *demandes d\u2019agr\u00e9ment* dated 22 April 2010 and 11 December 2013. Based on its interpretation of Article 20 of the 2012 Code, therefore, the Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 5.\n\nExhibit R-l: Claimants\u2019 Application for Authorization (April 22, 2010); Exhibit R-2: Claimants\u2019 Application for Authorization (December 11, 2013). See also Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 20-27.\n\n60.\n\nWith respect to the standard of interpretation that should be adopted by the Tribunal, the Respondent submits that provisions on consent to ICSID arbitration under a national investment law, such as Article 20, are to be interpreted in accordance with rules of international law relating to unilateral acts, and Ivoirian principles on statutory interpretation.10 In support of its position, the Respondent submitted the expert Report of Professor F\u00e9lix Acka, who opined that under Ivorian law, in the absence of ambiguity, the interpreter need not look beyond the plain meaning of the text. According to the Respondent, Ivorian law is *\"consistent and complementary to the interpretive approaches followed in the international law, and otherwise accepted by both parties \"11*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 34.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument, p. 2. See also English Transcripts DI: P19:L8-22.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent submits that *\"[t]he Parties\u2019 basic views on the applicable standard of interpretation are not far apart. Both accept the non-restrictive standard of interpretation adopted in Tidewater v. Venezuela. Both have cited in their memorials the same passage of this case which provides that unilateral declarations should be interpreted 'in good faith 'as it stands, having regard to the words actually used'; 'in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.'\"12*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument, p. 1. See also English Transcripts DI: P14:L3-P16:L12.\n\n62.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions differ with respect to their interpretations of Article 20 of the 2012 Code. For the Respondent, the text is clear and unambiguous.13 It argues that *\"under both international and Ivorian law, the plain meaning of the law to be interpreted is the critical point of departure in the interpretive analysis. The context and purpose of the text may be considered, but such examination is less important where the text is clear and unambiguous\"14*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 55, 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the plain meaning of Article 20 restricts the investor\u2019s means of consenting to ICSID arbitration to the selection of ICSID expressly in its application for authorization.15 According to the Respondent, the State\u2019s offer of consent to ICSID arbitration is subject to certain formalities for perfecting the investor\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.16 For the Respondent, Article 20 establishes both the manner and the mode by which an investor can express consent to ICSID arbitration.17 An investor can only accept the Respondent\u2019s offer of consent if the investor\u2019s consent is expressly stated*(\"exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment\")* in the investor\u2019s application for authorization *(\"dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\")*.18 The Respondent argues that since the plain meaning of the text of Article 20 clearly requires the Claimants to expressly state their consent to ICSID arbitration in their *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment,19* which they did not do,20 the Claimants have not complied with Article 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument, p. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 50.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 17.

The Respondent submits that *\"'[a]vantages\u2019 are economic incentives, such as reductions in or exonerations from taxes and customs duties, which an investor may benefit from for a limited period of time in order to maximize its profitability as a business venture. 'Garanties\u2019 are fundamental investment protections for investors designed to create an open and fair marketplace for foreign direct investment in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\"22*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument, p.3. See also Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 65-84.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 66.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, under the 2012 Code, ICSID arbitration is a *\"garantie\"* not an *\"avantage\"*. It points out that recourse to ICSID arbitration falls under Title II of the 2012 Code entitled *\"Garanties Accord\u00e9es Aux Investisseurs,\"* not Title IV entitled *\"R\u00e9gimes d\u2019incitation\"*,23 According to the Respondent, *\"the 2012 Code is designed and structured in a way such that when an investor submits an application for authorization to seek to obtain 'avantages,' it does not automatically obtain the 'guarantie' of ICSID arbitration when the investor\u2019s application is approved. Rather, as the context of the Code demonstrates, to be entitled to ICSID arbitration, an investor must take the additional step of expressly stating its consent to ICSID arbitration in its application for authorization \"24*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 67.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the 2012 Code has two separate regimes which serve separate purposes: one which regulates the availability of certain economic benefits *(\u00bf'avantages\")* and the other which regulates consent to ICSID arbitration (a *\"garantie\").* If an investor wishes to benefit from the Code\u2019s *avantages,* it must submit its application for authorization to the CEPICI *(Centre de Promotion des Investissements en C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire),* pursuant to Article 40.25 If, however, an investor wishes to choose ICSID arbitration, the 2012 Code regulates consent to ICSID arbitration as a *garantie* in Article 20.26 The Respondent further explains that:\n\n*While the same document (the application for authorization) is used to effectuate each choice, the result of those choices is determined in accordance with entirely different terms and conditions. To obtain 'avantages\u2019 under Part IV of the Code, an investor must provide detailed information in its application for authorization that demonstrates its corporate bone fides and the nature and scope of its investment. To obtain the 'garantie' of ICSID arbitration under Part II of the Code, the investor simply must expressly state its consent to ICSID arbitration in its application for authorization.27*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 68-76.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 76-84.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 82.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the existence of separate regimes under the 2012 Code confirms the plain meaning of the consent requirements established in Article 20.28\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 84.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the purpose and intent behind Article 20 confirms its plain meaning. First, according to the Respondent, in establishing a process by which the investor must inform the Respondent of its consent to ICSID arbitration, Article 20 furthers the Respondent\u2019s policy goals of \"*ensuring that the parties enjoy a reciprocal right of arbitration; providing both parties clear notice as to when consent to ICSID arbitration is perfected; and allowing Respondent the opportunity to assess and manage its exposure to ICSID \"29* The Respondent submits that it also serves the policy goals of \"*clarity with respect to the timing and efficacy of the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration\"30* and allowing the Respondent to manage its litigation risk.31\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 86.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b691.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 95.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the 2012 Code. According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 argument that the filing of the *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment* constitutes consent on the part of the Claimants cannot stand because, if adopted, the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 20 would (i) render the consent requirements in Article 20 meaningless; and (ii) deprive all investors of their right to choose between domestic courts and international arbitration.32 The Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 20 would reverse its alleged presumption from one where investors must opt in to ICSID arbitration to one where investors must opt out of ICSID arbitration if they do not want it, which is not how the 2012 Code should be read.33\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 108-109.\n\nEnglish Transcripts DI: P53:L5-17.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument that their 2013 *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment* constitues consent to ICSID arbitration since they requested *\"tous les avantages qui d\u00e9coulent du r\u00e9gime de l\u2019agr\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019investissement en vertu de l\u2019ensemble du Code des investissement\",34* According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 2013 *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment* cannot be construed as the Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration because *\"not only did Claimants not request all of the benefits under the 2012 Code, but, as explained, ICSID Arbitration is not an economic benefit under the Code in any event\"35* The Respondent further points out that the Claimants\u2019 2013 *demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment* did not contain a reference to ICSID arbitration.36\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 131-132.

The remaining text of Article 20, however, relates only to foreign individuals or legal entities *(\u00bf'les personnes physiques ou morales \u00e9trang\u00e8res\")* which will be referred to collectively as \"foreign nationals\". The term \"investor\" *(\"investisseur\")* is not retained.\n\n105.\n\nParagraph 2 appears to set out two possible *fora* for the resolution of disputes with foreign nationals: the courts of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire or an arbitral tribunal. It does not expressly confer a right of election on either party to the dispute in respect of either *forum.* The subparagraphs of Paragraph 2 then purport to regulate the *\"comp\u00e9tences\"* (plural) of the arbitral tribunal (singular). Once again, however, no right of election is expressly conferred on either party in relation to each possible type of arbitral tribunal defined in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Paragraph 2. Each subparagraph is instead formulated as a different basis for vesting an arbitral tribunal with jurisdiction or *\"comp\u00e9tence\"* and each sets out a particular condition for the vesting of that jurisdiction.\n\n106.\n\nParagraph 2(a) refers to bilateral investment treaties. The condition is that the foreign individual or legal entity is a national of a State which has concluded a treaty with the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\n107.\n\nParagraph 2(b) refers to a procedure of conciliation and arbitration which the Parties have agreed to as \"defined\" *(\u00bf'une proc\u00e9dure de conciliation et d\u2019arbitrage dont les parties sont convenues est d\u00e9finie\").* The present tense of the verb *\"\u00eatre\" (\u201fest\")* is used here and thus can mean \"is defined\"\u2014as a statement of fact, or \"shall be defined\"\u2014as a modal phrase. The latter use of the verb *\"\u00eatre\"* is common in statutory texts but both meanings are formally correct and only the context can reveal the statutory intention.\n\n108.\n\nParagraph 2(c) refers to the ICSID Convention by its full title and also references the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s ratification instrument for the ICSID Convention. Following those references, there is a comma followed by the words \"is applicable\" or \"shall be applicable\" *('est applicable\")* depending, once again, on which meaning of the verb *\"\u00eatre\"* is to be preferred.\n\n109.\n\nThe first sentence of Paragraph 2(d) provides that where the person in question does not satisfy the nationality requirements in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, then the ICSID Additional Facility Rules apply. This sentence implicitly supplies the condition for Paragraph 2(c): the foreign national must satisfy the nationality requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention for the ICSID Convention to be applicable.\n\n110.\n\nOnce again, the structure of the first sentence of Paragraph 2(d) is perhaps unusual: the first clause is in the form of a statement \"the person concerned does not satisfy the nationality requirements\" *('la personne concern\u00e9e ne remplit pas les conditions de nationalit\u00e9\").* It is clear that the use of the present tense in this clause must be as a statement rather than as an obligation as the latter would not make sense. The second clause of the first sentence of paragraph 2(d) is another statement\u2014referring to the application of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules *('la personne concern\u00e9e ne remplit pas les conditions de nationalit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la convention susvis\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des r\u00e8glements du m\u00e9canisme suppl\u00e9mentaire, approuv\u00e9 par le conseil d\u2019administration du Centre international pour le R\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements, en abr\u00e9g\u00e9 CIRDI\")*\n\n111.\n\nThe final sentence of Paragraph 2(d), to which the Parties in these proceedings have devoted most attention, clearly applies both to arbitration under the ICSID Convention as well as under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. It provides that the consent of the Parties *\"requis par les instruments les r\u00e9gissant est constitu\u00e9, pour la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire par le pr\u00e9sent article, et exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment pour la personne concern\u00e9e.\"*\n\n112.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 differing interpretations of this final sentence of Paragraph 2(d) of Article 20 can be stated succinctly: the Claimants maintain that a foreign national\u2019s filing of a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* is sufficient to manifest its consent to ICSID arbitration; whereas the Respondent argues that the foreign national must expressly record its consent to ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* itself. It is common ground that no express mention of ICSID arbitration is to be found in the actual *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* filed by the Claimants and that there is no express reference to the possibility of ICSID arbitration in the model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* published by the responsible national authority of the Respondent.\n\n113.\n\nBefore the Tribunal embarks on its analysis of the critical final sentence of Article 20, it is important to expose the internal contradictions in the text of Article 20 as a whole. These contradictions are best illustrated by an example. Whichever interpretation of the manner in which consent on the part of the foreign national to ICSID arbitration is to be manifested, both interpretations offered by the Parties require consent to be perfected at the time that the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* is filed. Assuming that the foreign national has manifested its consent to ICSID arbitration either by filing that document (the Claimant\u2019s interpretation) or by including an express reference to ICSID arbitration in that document (the Respondent\u2019s interpretation), a question then arises as to the impact of that binding ICSID arbitration clause and the possibility that the foreign national may wish to resort to international arbitration under an applicable bilateral investment treaty (Paragraph 2(a) of Article 20). That bilateral investment treaty may provide for ICSID arbitration or arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, for example. If the foreign national institutes arbitration proceedings under the bilateral investment treaty, could the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire contest the jurisdiction of that tribunal on the basis that the foreign national has already consented to ICSID arbitration?\n\n114.\n\nThe Parties were confronted with this problem concerning the internal consistency of Article 20 at the hearing. The Respondent\u2019s counsel\u2019s answer was that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention would prevent the foreign national from resorting to international arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty if consent to ICSID arbitration had already been given under Paragraph 2(c) of Article 20 of the 2012 Code.93 The Respondent\u2019s counsel was fortified in this response by virtue of the fact that, according to the Respondent\u2019s research, all the States that are parties to bilateral investment treaties with the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are also parties to the ICSID Convention.94\n\nEnglish Transcripts D2:P146-150 (Caplan/Douglas).\n\nEnglish Transcripts D2:P152 (Caplan/Douglas).\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s attempt to make sense of Article 20 in this way is problematic for the following reasons.\n\n116.\n\nFirst, Paragraph 2 of Article 20 defines the *ratione materiae* of disputes that can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal as those *\"relative \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code\".* If the Respondent were correct, then by consenting to ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment,\"* the foreign national would be simultaneously waiving any right to bring an investment treaty arbitration in respect of a future dispute unrelated to the application of the 2012 Code. The Respondent confronted this difficulty by submitting that the protections afforded in Title II of the 2012 Code are *\"broader than a BIT'95.* Whether or not this argument holds water on the basis of a textual comparison of the protections in Title II versus those offered in the BITs ratified by the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, it is plain that protections in an investment treaty cannot be unilaterally withdrawn by the State as their legislative counterparts could be and are thus different in juridical nature for that reason alone. The Respondent\u2019s conclusion that a foreign national forsakes reliance on an applicable BIT by consenting to ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* is thus rather drastic: it would be a surprising result in the absence of any express wording in Article 20 that would put a foreign national on notice of these consequences of consent to ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\".*\n\nEnglish Transcripts D2:P155 (Caplan).\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s conclusion is also inconsistent with the terms of the bilateral investment treaties ratified by the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The most recent such treaty, with Canada, was signed on 30 November 2014 and hence after the 2012 Code was promulgated.96 The Canada/C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire BIT confers *ratione materiae* jurisdiction only in relation to claims for a breach of an investment protection obligation in the BIT itself.97 A tribunal constituted on the basis of the Canada/C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire BIT would not, therefore, have jurisdiction over the application of the 2012 Code.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for the Respondent confirmed that in addition to offering ICSID arbitration, that BIT also offered arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: English Transcripts D2:P158:Ll-3 (Caplan).\n\n*See* Article 20 of the Canada/ C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire BIT. This BIT was referred to at the Hearing *see* English Transcripts D2: P 157 L3-P158 L3.\n\n118.\n\nSecond, it is by no means clear that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention extends to remedies conferred by other international instruments. Would a foreign national be precluded by Article 26 from bringing a claim under a regional human rights treaty, for example?\n\n119.\n\nThird, Article 20 of the 2012 Code was obviously drafted to cater to a situation where the ICSID Convention (and thus Article 26) would not be applicable: this explains the reference to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. In that scenario, a conflict between consent to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules (ultimately subject to a national law at the seat of the arbitration) and consent to arbitration under a BIT could not be resolved by reference to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention (which would not be applicable) and it would be impermissible for a provision of domestic legislation to have the effect of abrogating or modifying rights granted under an international investment treaty.\n\n120.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that Article 20 lacks coherency. Without determining how an election is to be made among different types of arbitration and by whom, Paragraph 2 of Article 20 is formulated as if a single tribunal might be vested with jurisdiction on the basis of each type of arbitral consent, which would actually be consistent with the *chapeau* of Paragraph 2\u2014 *\"Les comp\u00e9tences du tribunal arbitral sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es dans les conditions ci-apr\u00e8s:\"\u2014* with its use of the plural for *\"comp\u00e9tences\"* and the singular for *\"tribunal arbitrar.* In other words, Paragraph 2 is drafted as if a single tribunal could be vested with as many *\"comp\u00e9tences\"* as the circumstances permit: one *\"comp\u00e9tence\"* under a bilateral investment treaty (where applicable) and another under the ICSID Convention (where applicable). But *\"comp\u00e9tences\"* cannot, of course, be aggregated in this way: if the foreign national selects UNCITRAL arbitration under the BIT and at an earlier point in time consents to ICSID arbitration by filing a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* then the result is not an aggregation of \"*comp\u00e9tences\"* in a single tribunal but the creation of several tribunals with overlapping *\"comp\u00e9tences.\"*\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus faced with a text that it cannot make sense of as a whole by resorting to the usual canons of interpretation. It is important to record this impediment at the outset because it would be highly artificial, in the Tribunal\u2019s estimation, to proceed to the interpretation of the critical final sentence of Article 20 as if the anterior text were flawless in conveying the true and coherent intention of its drafters.\n\n122.\n\nAs was previously stated, the *ratione materiae* scope of arbitral jurisdiction contemplated by Paragraph 2 of Article 20 is \"[t]uot *diff\u00e9rend ou litige entre les personnes physiques ou morales \u00e9trang\u00e8res et la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire relatif \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code.\"* The inclusion of the reference to bilateral investment treaties under this *chapeau* in Paragraph 2(a) makes little sense because at least some of those treaties ratified by the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (including at least one treaty ratified after the Code was promulgated) do not contemplate that an arbitral tribunal could have jurisdiction over disputes concerning the application of the 2012 Code. The same can be said for the reference to an agreement to a procedure for conciliation and arbitration in Paragraph 2(b). Whether or not such a procedure would extend to disputes relating to the 2012 Code would depend of course on what the foreign national and the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire negotiated in their specific agreement. It cannot be taken for granted that any such agreement would include the scope of disputes contemplated by the *chapeau* provision in Paragraph 2. (Another surprising aspect of Paragraph 2(b) is that only an agreement to both conciliate and arbitrate is permissible as a potential forum for disputes relating to the 2012 Code.)\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers that the different arbitral mechanisms set out in Paragraph 2 are not listed as alternative *fora* to resolve the same type of disputes; viz. *\"tout diff\u00e9rend ou litige entre les personnes physiques ou morales \u00e9trang\u00e8res et la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te D'Ivoire relative \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code.\"* An arbitral tribunal established pursuant to at least some of the bilateral investments treaties ratified by the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire cannot have jurisdiction over such disputes and it is by no means certain that an arbitral tribunal established pursuant to a contractual agreement between a foreign national and the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire would have such jurisdiction either. Moreover, as has already been stated, there is no text in Article 20 that would serve to vest a choice among the different arbitral mechanisms in Paragraph 2 in either the foreign national or the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\n124.\n\nThe references to ICSID arbitration in Paragraph 2(c) and (d) are different. Unlike the preceding references to arbitral mechanisms in Paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b), the references to ICSID arbitration in Paragraphs 2(c) and (d) appear to be specifically tailored to the disputes specified by the *chapeau* provision in Paragraph 2 (i.e., \"[t]out *diff\u00e9rend ou litige entre les personnes physiques ou morales \u00e9trang\u00e8res et la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire relatif \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code\")* This is because the consent of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to ICSID arbitration (either under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules) is actually fixed by Article 20 of the 2012 Code itself. It follows that such an ICSID tribunal will undoubtedly have jurisdiction over a dispute *\"relative \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code.\"*\n\n125.\n\nIt thus appears that ICSID arbitration has a privileged place in Paragraph 2 as the only arbitral forum that is certain to have jurisdiction over a dispute *\"relative \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent code\".* Indeed, it is possible to infer that ICSID arbitration would be the primary, perhaps even exclusive, forum for the resolution of disputes between foreign nationals and the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire relating to the 2012 Code for the following reasons.\n\n126.\n\nFirst, in contradistinction with the arbitral mechanisms in Paragraphs 2(a) and (b), the ICSID Convention is stated in Paragraph 2(c) to be *\"applicable\"*. The use of the present tense of the verb *\"\u00eatre\" (\"est applicable\")* is consistent with the modal expression \"shall be applicable\" or with an expression of a statement to mean simply \"is applicable\". In either case the same inference should be made: unlike the arbitral mechanisms in Paragraphs 2(a) and (b), ICSID arbitration either \"is\" or \"shall be\" *('est\")* applicable.\n\n127.\n\nSecond, the reference to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules in Paragraph 2(d) conveys the intention that ICSID arbitration (whether under the ICSID Convention or not) should be available in all circumstances for disputes arising out of the 2012 Code; *i.e.* both when the foreign national is a national of a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and otherwise. The Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration in Paragraph 2(d) is, therefore, provided in relation to both possibilities. As an arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules has no special status vis-\u00e0-vis any other form of contractual arbitration that is already covered in any case by Paragraph 2(b), the intention appears to be to create a comprehensive regime for the arbitration of disputes under the 2012 Code in Paragraphs 2(c) and (d).\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the final critical sentence of Article 20 of the Code, which is reproduced again for convenience:\n\n*Le consentement des parties \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI ou du m\u00e9canisme suppl\u00e9mentaire, selon le cas, requis par les instruments les r\u00e9gissant est constitu\u00e9, pour la R\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire par le pr\u00e9sent article, et exprim\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment pour la personne concern\u00e9e.*\n\n129.\n\nIt was common ground between the Parties that the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, by virtue of this final sentence of Article 20 of the 2012 Code, has perfected its consent to ICSID arbitration. The preliminary issue under consideration is, therefore, whether the Claimants have perfected their consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal records at the outset that the final sentence of Article 20, consistent with the remaining text of the Article, is fraught with ambiguities.\n\n131.\n\nThe consent to ICSID arbitration, by the *\"personne concern\u00e9e\",* is stated to be manifested in some way by the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\".* Both Parties have assumed, based on their different interpretations of the requirement in the final sentence of Article 20, that the mere filing of the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* (with or without an express election of ICSID arbitration) would be sufficient to constitute a binding arbitration agreement. But that cannot be right because the national organ of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire designated in Article 39 of the 2012 Code ultimately has the discretion not to accept the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\".*\n\n132.\n\nIndeed, the foreign national only becomes an *\"investisseur\"* under the 2012 Code, and entitled to rely on the guarantees in Part II of the 2012 Code, in the event that approval is given to the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*. Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that the foreign national is not referred to as an *\"investisseur\"* in Paragraph 2(d) but as a *\"personne concern\u00e9e\"* : the *\"personne concern\u00e9e\"* only becomes an *\"investisseur\"* under the 2012 Code if the national organ\u2014here the *\"Centre de Promotion des Investissements de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\"\u2014* approves the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\".*\n\n133.\n\nPart IV Section II of the 2012 Code, entitled *\"R\u00e9gime d\u2019agr\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019investissement\",* is not the only regime for making an investment under the 2012 Code. Part IV Section I of the 2012 Code contains a separate *\"R\u00e9gime de d\u00e9claration\",* which, as the title suggests, does not envisage an approval process by the national organ but rather the mere acknowledgement of receipt of the declaration. ICSID arbitration in Paragraph 2(d) does not appear to be contemplated for investments made under this regime because the last sentence refers exclusively to a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* and not to a *\"d\u00e9claration\".*\n\n134.\n\nTo conclude this point, ICSID arbitration only applies to investments made under the regime set out in Part IV Section II of the 2012 Code and an ICSID arbitration agreement (whether in respect of arbitration under the ICSID Convention or under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules) will only come into force if the designated national organ of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire approves the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*. This conclusion militates in favour of interpreting the use of the present tense of the verb *\"\u00eatre\"* in Paragraph 2(c) to mean *\"is applicable\"* rather than *\"shall be applicable\".* There can be no categorical obligation to resort to ICSID imposed by Article 20 because it will ultimately depend upon whether the foreign national\u2019s *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* is accepted by the designated national organ of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire under Article 39 of the 2012 Code. If the use of the present tense is to be interpreted consistently throughout, it follows that the present tense of the verb *\"\u00eatre\"* in the final sentence of Article 20 is to convey a statement rather than an obligation.\n\n135.\n\nWhen the final sentence of Article 20 is interpreted against this background, it is clear that its object and purpose is to set out the manner in which the requirements for consent to ICSID arbitration are to be ascertained consistently with the applicable ICSID Convention or Additional Facility Rules. The final sentence does not impose obligations on either party to take certain steps to conclude an ICSID arbitration agreement. That is consistent with the fact that ultimately the designated national organ of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has the power to accept or reject the foreign national\u2019s *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* and thus determine whether a binding ICSID arbitration agreement will actually come into effect.\n\n136.\n\nThis conclusion also disposes of one of the Respondent\u2019s arguments for its interpretation of the final sentence of Article 20 as imposing an obligation upon the foreign national to include an express stipulation in favour of ICSID arbitration in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*. The Respondent reasoned that this is necessary to allow the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire *\"the opportunity to assess its exposure to ICSID claims\"98* But, as we have seen, the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has that opportunity at the time its designated national organ is considering whether or not to approve the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* pursuant to Article 39 of the Code. If, consistent with the Claimants\u2019 submissions, the final sentence of Article 20 simply records the fact that the foreign national\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration is deemed to have been given by the filing of a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*, then the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire would be on notice that if it approves the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* then it will be *\"exposed to ICSID claims\"* in the future.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 95.\n\n137.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is thus persuaded, subject to the remaining linguistic points to be considered below, that the legislator intended by the final sentence of Article 20 to set out the manner in which an arbitration agreement may be constituted to satisfy the requirements of the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. The Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s consent is constituted by Article 20 itself, whereas the foreign national\u2019s consent is constituted by the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* to be filed in accordance with the regime set out in Part IV Section II of the 2012 Code. The final sentence of Article 20 thus stipulates that the substantive requirement of consent to arbitration is satisfied for ICSID arbitration (each Party is deemed to have expressed its consent to arbitration) as well as the formal requirement (that such consent to have been expressed in writing). If the national organ of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire then approves the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*, there will be a perfected ICSID arbitration agreement.\n\n138.\n\nBut this finding does not finally resolve the issue of contention: are the formal requirements for consent by the foreign national satisfied by the act of filing the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* (as the Claimants maintain) or is it incumbent upon the foreign national, in addition, to insert specific language into the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* to the effect that it consents to ICSID arbitration (as the Respondent maintains)?\n\n139.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers that, in this context, it is highly material that the Respondent\u2019s model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* makes no reference to ICSID arbitration or Article 20 of the 2012 Code. Moreover, the provision of the 2012 Code that regulates the contents of the *dossier* to be submitted with the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* makes no mention of ICSID arbitration or Article 20 either. Article 40 of the 2012 Code provides:\n\n*Tout investisseur d\u00e9sirant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des avantages particuliers, pr\u00e9vus par le pr\u00e9sent code, est tenu de d\u00e9poser un dossier de demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019organisme national charg\u00e9 de la promotion des Investissements vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 39.*\n\n*Le dossier vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent comporte, outre la demande, des renseignements pr\u00e9cis sur les investisseurs, des informations sur le programme, notamment sa nature, son montant ainsi que toute information n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de l\u2019agr\u00e9ment et \u00e0 son suivi.*\n\n140.\n\nThese omissions strongly support the thesis that the act of filing the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* is the manifestation of consent to ICSID arbitration on the part of the foreign national. On this view, there would be no reason for the model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* or the provision regulating the contents of the *\"dossier\"* accompanying the *\"demande\"* to refer to ICSID arbitration because the national organ would be on notice that if it approves the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* then there will be an ICSID arbitration agreement.\n\n141.\n\nThere is, however, one matter that the Respondent maintains points in the other direction. If the filing of the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* were to be sufficient to manifest the foreign national\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration, it would follow that the foreign national would be deprived of a choice of the local courts in the Republic of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which appears to be contemplated in Paragraph 2 of Article 20. This is an important counterargument but one that the majority of the Tribunal ultimately rejects for the following reasons, which have already been alluded to in the preceding discussion.\n\n142.\n\nFirst, there is no express language in Article 20 that would serve to vest a choice in the foreign national (or indeed to vest a choice in the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire). In the absence of such language the majority of the Tribunal cannot infer that Article 20 is a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision requiring an election between different *fora* for the resolution of disputes.\n\n143.\n\nSecond, the ICSID Convention is expressly stated to be \"applicable\" unless the foreign national\u2019s State is not a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention in which case the ICSID Additional Facility Rules are to apply. There appears to be a clear intention to create a comprehensive arbitral regime for disputes relating to the Code in Paragraphs 2(c) and (d).\n\n144.\n\nThird, the *ratione personae* scope of Paragraph 2 is different to Paragraphs 2(c) and (d). Paragraph 2 refers to foreign nationals generally whereas Paragraphs 2(c) and (d) refer to a subset of foreign nationals who are submitting a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\",* which can only mean a reference to the investment regime in Part IV Section II of the 2012 Code. It is thus plausible that the statutory intention was to carve out disputes with foreign nationals investing under Part IV Section II of the 2012 Code from the general *chapeau* provision in Paragraph 2 of Article 20 and refer that subset of disputes to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Paragraphs 2(c) and (d) in all cases.\n\n145.\n\nFourth, it would be artificial in the circumstances to interpret the foreign national\u2019s silence in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* as an election of the local courts as the forum for the resolution of any disputes relating to the 2012 Code given that there is no reference to dispute resolution in the model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* or the provisions of the 2012 Code regulating the application process and there is no express language in Article 20 conferring a right of election upon the foreign national in the first place. There is, in other words, no reason to treat the local courts as the default forum for dispute resolution given the structure of Article 20. To the contrary, the ICSID Convention is stated to be *\"applicable\"* in Paragraph 2(c) of Article 20.\n\n146.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s point concerning the access to the local courts has not dislodged the majority of the Tribunal from its interpretation of the final sentence of Article 20.\n\n147.\n\nThere are, finally, certain linguistic ambiguities in the final phrase of the final sentence of Article 20 that must be confronted.\n\n148.\n\nThe first relates to the word *\"dans\",* which the Claimants have submitted, in French can mean either *\"\u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de\"* or *\"marque la mani\u00e8re\"* depending on the context.99 This is indeed confirmed by the extracts from leading French dictionaries that the Parties\u2019 have relied upon.100 The Respondent prefers the former meaning, which it says is consistent with the use of the word *\"par\"* in the previous phrase. In the Respondent\u2019s view, if the legislator had intended *\"dans\"* to mean the same as the proposition *\"par\"* in the previous phrase, then it would have been straightforward to use *\"par\"* in the final phrase. According to the Respondent, the use of *\"dans\"* with its preferred meaning is more consistent with a requirement that the foreign national\u2019s consent be recorded by specific text in the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* itself. The Tribunal accepts that the use of the word *\"par\"* would have made the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the final phrase of Article 20 stronger. But the majority of the Tribunal cannot accept that the use of the word *\"dans\"* in and of itself, and in an article that is fraught with both textual and substantive ambiguities and inconsistencies, favours the Respondent\u2019s interpretation.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 111-114.\n\nExhibit R-7, Le Petit Robert de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise (2017): *\"dans\"* is defined as either *\"1. Marque le lieu \" or\"2. Marque la mani\u00e8re.\"* Exhibit R-8, Le Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise (2017) defines *\"dans\"* as *\"I. Marque un rapport de lieu [...] A. Indique le rapport d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une chose a ce qui la contient. A l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de* [...]\" and also as *\" B. Par ext. S'applique \u00e0 des termes qui d\u00e9signent une situation, un \u00e9tat, une disposition, etc. \u2022[...]\".*\n\n149.\n\nThe second linguistic point relates to the word *\"express\u00e9ment\"*. The Respondent must be right that the inclusion of this word is consistent with a requirement that the foreign national inserts specific language into the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*. But there is an alternative explanation, which is that the legislator is trying to make it abundantly clear that the formal writing requirement in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is satisfied by the filing of a written document\u2014the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"*. Like the word *\"dans\",* there are alternative dictionary meanings *of \" express\u00e9ment\",* each of which is capable of introducing a nuance in support of either Party\u2019s interpretation.101 Once again, the majority of the Tribunal cannot accept that the inclusion of this word can be dispositive in favour of the Respondent\u2019s interpretation against the other factors that point towards the correctness of the Claimants\u2019 approach.\n\nExhibit R-7, Le Petit Robert de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise (2017): *\"express\u00e9ment\"* is defined as *\"1. En termes expr\u00e8s, formels. Explicitement, nettement, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment* [...]\" and also as *\"2. Avec une intention, une volont\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale bien d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Expr\u00e8s, sp\u00e9cialement* [...]\". Exhibit R-8, Le Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise (2017) defines *express\u00e9ment* as *\"1. En termes expr\u00e8s* [...]\" and also as *\"2. Tout expr\u00e8s ; dans une intention particuli\u00e8re bien d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. [...] \".*\n\n150.\n\nThere is no doubt that the final sentence of Article 20 could have been drafted less ambiguously to convey the meaning advocated by the Claimants. An example of a more precise formulation can be found in the investment law of the Democratic Republic of Congo:\n\n*Le consentement des parties \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI ou du M\u00e9canisme Suppl\u00e9mentaire, selon le cas, requis par les instruments les r\u00e9gissant, est constitu\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo par le pr\u00e9sent article et en ce qui concerne l\u2019investisseur par sa demande d\u2019admission au r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou ult\u00e9rieurement par acte separe.102*\n\nExpert Report of Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, \u00b6 33 (quoting Article 38 of Law No. 4 dated 21 February 2002 of the Democratic Republic of Congo).\n\n151.\n\nIn the majority of the Tribunal\u2019s view, the linguistic differences between this text and the final sentence of Article 20 of the 2012 Code cannot be interpreted as manifesting a different statutory intention against the background of the Article as a whole.\n\n152.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that there are also very clear examples of statutory texts that would be consistent with the meaning ascribed by the Respondent to the final sentence of Article 20. The investment law of Cameroon, for example, provides:\n\n*ARTICLE 45*\n\n[...]\n\n*(3) Le choix d\u2019une des proc\u00e9dures ci-dessus doit \u00eatre express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9, soit dans la demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment de l\u2019entreprise concern\u00e9e. Dans ce dernier cas, la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage ou de conciliation est indiqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019acte d\u2019agr\u00e9ment.103*\n\nExhibit C-102 : Ordonnance n\u00b090/007 du 8 novembre 1990 portant code des investissements du Cameroun.\n\n153.\n\nThe express conferral of a choice *('choix\")* together with the use of the modal expression *\"doit \u00eatre\"* and the final sentence prescribing how the choice is to be manifested in *\"l'acte d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* make it plain that *\"l'entreprise concern\u00e9e\"* would have to record its choice in *\"l'acte d\u2019agr\u00e9menf* expressly to consent to ICSID arbitration. On balance, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the linguistic differences between this text and the final sentence of Article 20 are significant and do evidence a different statutory intention.\n\n154.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal, on the basis of a thorough and detailed analysis of the 2012 Code and Article 20 in particular, concludes that a valid and binding arbitration agreement for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention came into force when the *\"Centre de Promotion des Investissements de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\"* approved the *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* filed by the Claimants. Article 20 of the Code records the Respondent\u2019s prospective consent to ICSID arbitration but a valid and binding ICSID arbitration agreement comes into force only if two conditions are satisfied: first, the putative investor must file a *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* and, second, that *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* must be approved by the *Centre de Promotion des Investissements.*\n\n155.\n\nTwo further considerations support the fairness of this conclusion for the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n156.\n\nFirst, if the *Centre de Promotion des Investissements de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire* shared the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 20 of the Code in these arbitration proceedings, then it would follow that the Claimants\u2019 *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* was defective in the sense that it did not express a choice between local court procedures or ICSID arbitration. (There is nothing to suggest in the text of Article 20 that local court procedures would apply in default of a choice; to the contrary, Paragraph 2(c) of Article 20 states that the ICSID Convention *\"est applicable\"*.) The Respondent\u2019s national authority had an opportunity to correct what would have been a defect in accordance with this interpretation by requesting the Claimants to make an explicit choice or otherwise raising the issue with the Claimants but they did not do so. To the contrary, they approved the Claimants\u2019 *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment.\"* The fact that there is no mention of dispute resolution procedures in the Respondent\u2019s model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9men\"* or in the provision of the 2012 Code regulating its contents suggests to the majority of the Tribunal that the conduct of the Respondent\u2019s national authority in approving the Claimants\u2019 *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9men\"* was not an error.\n\n157.\n\nSecond, as both Parties have emphasized in their pleadings and submissions, the 2012 Code is a unilateral act on the part of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. It is not an international treaty between two or more States in which textual ambiguities can sometimes be attributed to a failure to reach a consensus on all issues (hence the epigram that a treaty is a disagreement reduced into writing). The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has complete control over its own text and complete freedom to amend its text as and when it sees fit. It cannot be reasonably claimed that the final sentence of Article 20 is a model of clarity and indeed the Tribunal has identified several other serious difficulties with the remaining parts of Article 20 that are liable to generate unnecessary controversies in the future. As this is reported to be the first ICSID arbitration arising on the basis of the 2012 Code, it may be that the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has not yet had the occasion to revisit the text of Article 20 since its promulgation. If the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, upon receipt of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, maintains its disagreement with the majority of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, then its remedy can be swift and straightforward: it can introduce amendments to Article 20 of the 2012 Code and to its model *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* with the effect that prospective investors will be in no doubt as to manner in which they are to convey their consent to ICSID arbitration. This will not, of course, shut out the Claimants from pursuing their claims against the Respondent in the present proceedings. But that, in the estimation of the majority of the Tribunal, is a small price to pay when compared with the injustice of informing the Claimants at this point in time that, despite the Respondent\u2019s approval of their *\"demande d\u2019agr\u00e9ment\"* in accordance with the provisions of the 2012 Code and despite their filing of a Request for ICSID Arbitration, they cannot be deemed to have consented to ICSID arbitration after all. And all the while the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration is not contested.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A.** The Respondent\u2019s position\n--------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent submits that under Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention the Tribunal has broad discretion to apportion costs. It identifies two relevant factors, (i) the extent to which a party has prevailed on its claims or defenses in and proceeding; and (ii) the extent to which a party\u2019s conduct in the proceeding has unnecessarily added to the other\u2019s expense.104 The Respondent further stated that \"[t]he *types of conduct resulting in apportionment of costs against a party include: (1) filing baseless claims; (2) deficient argumentation; and (c) procedural misconduct\"105*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6 9.\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in the event that it prevails on its jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal should consider the following circumstances in rendering its decision on costs:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants presented a series of allegedly unfounded legal theories, devised *ex post facto,* in order to avoid the consequences of their own failure to expressly state their consent to ICSID arbitration in any of their applications for authorization;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 legal theories are *\"inconsistent, convoluted and legally incoherent\" ;*\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 argument that its Request for arbitration constituted its consent was based on ICSID awards that in the Respondent\u2019s opinion have no relation to the Claimants\u2019 asserted legal theory;\n\n\u2022 Claimants mischaracterized key evidence on which their case relied;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants mischaracterized the standard in *PNG* v. *Papua New Guinea* at the Hearing on Jurisdiction. The Claimants quoted only one sentence from the decision in that case: *\"States should be presumed to desire the effective and just resolution of international investment disputes, in a manner that enhances the prospects for foreign investment and confidence in the rule of law. \"* Based on that sentence, the Claimants concluded: *\"cette pr\u00e9somption est un peu l\u2019\u00e9quivalent du principe contra proferentem \" ;*\n\n\u2022 With respect to venue and language, the Respondent was exercising its rights under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent argues, however, that the Claimants ignored the Tribunal\u2019s strong preference for points of international investment law to be made by submission rather than by legal experts in filing an expert opinion by Mr. Emmanuel Gaillard; and\n\n\u2022 The Claimants repeatedly and baselessly accused the Respondent of acting in bad faith.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6 21.\n\n160.\n\nIn Response to the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should reject the Claimants\u2019 submission that the Respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to (i) the First Session; (ii) the place of the proceedings; and (iii) the language of the proceedings, created costs that were *\"inutiles et suppl\u00e9mentaires\"*107 According to the Respondent, holding the First Session via video conference actually resulted in lower costs than if there had been an in-person first session in London. In addition, it argues, the Respondent should not be penalized for exercising its procedural right to have Washington D.C. be the place of the proceedings and to have English be one of the official languages of the proceedings.108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs dated 12 May 2017, pp. 1-3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs dated 12 May 2017, pp. 2-3.\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent also claims that:\n\n*Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs seeks reimbursement of many cost items that do not relate to the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings. These include Claimants\u2019 ICSID registration fee in the amount of $25,000. These also include 130,172.00 \u20ac in costs relating to:*\n\n*Ensemble de la proc\u00e9dure, notamment analyse de dossier, Requ\u00eate d\u2019arbitrage, constitution du Tribunal, suivi de la proc\u00e9dure, \u00e9changes de courriers relatifs \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re session, premi\u00e8re session, excluant la r\u00e9daction du M\u00e9moire sur le fond du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2017.109*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs dated 12 May 2017, pp. 4.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in the event the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction, it should either defer its decision on these costs until the end of the proceedings or, at most, make an award as to costs incurred exclusively relating to the jurisdictional phase of the case.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs dated 12 May 2017, pp. 4.\n\n163.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Claimants failed to demonstrate that they were actually billed by the Claimants\u2019 counsel for the total amount that was claimed in their Submission on Costs.111\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs dated 12 May 2017, pp. 4-5.\n\n164.\n\nIn light of the above, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs and requests the Tribunal to:\n\n*(a) order [...] Claimants to pay all of the costs of the ICSID proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and all administrative costs; and*\n\n*(b) order [... ] Claimants to bear Respondent\u2019s legal costs and expenses in the amount of $747,529.112*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6 25.\n\n**B.** The Claimants\u2019 position\n------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal has the discretion to allocate costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.113\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 2.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute the Respondent\u2019s submission that in allocating costs the Tribunal should consider the following factors, (i) the extent to which a party has prevailed on its claims or defenses in and proceeding; and (ii) the extent to which a party\u2019s conduct in the proceeding has unnecessarily added to the other\u2019s expense.114\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 3. Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimants, however, submit that the cases relied on by the Respondent to argue that the Claimants should be ordered to pay the Respondent\u2019s costs are irrelevant because they relate to decisions made at the merits phase.115 They argue that given the ambiguity of Article 20, even if the Tribunal were to decide that it did not have jurisdiction, it would be unjust and inequitable to order the Claimants to pay the Respondent\u2019s costs. If, however the Claimants are successful, they argue that it would be just and equitable to order the Respondent to pay their costs because the law in question was drafted by the Respondent.116\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 10.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants further take issue with the Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs for the following reasons.\n\n169.\n\nFirst, they argue that the Respondent wrongly used its Cost Submission as a posthearing brief, which the Parties and the Tribunal had agreed would not be filed.117\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 24 and \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\n170.\n\nSecond, the Claimants dismiss the Respondent\u2019s claim that the Claimants\u2019 arguments were unfounded, inconsistent, convoluted and legally incoherent. According to the Claimants:\n\n*L'argumentation juridique des Demandeurs est fond\u00e9e, consistante, claire et coh\u00e9rente. Ce que la D\u00e9fenderesse soul\u00e8ve, c'est seulement son pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9saccord avec les arguments des Demandeurs: ce qui ne peut absolument pas \u00eatre un facteur pertinent concernant la r\u00e9partition des frais.*\n\n*La D\u00e9fenderesse ne soul\u00e8ve d\u2019ailleurs aucun argument auquel les Demandeurs n'auraient pas r\u00e9pondu.118*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n171.\n\nThird, with respect to the alleged mischaracterization of the standard in *PNG,* the Claimants submit that in their view, *\"surtout dans le contexte o\u00f9 on analyse le consentement de l\u2019investisseur et non celui de l\u2019Etat\"* the statement *\"States should be presumed to desire the effective and just resolution of international investment disputes in a manner that enhances the prospects for foreign investments and confidence in the rule of law\"* constitutes an objective approach not *\"une approche extensive au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019investisseur*\"119 The Claimants argue:\n\n*En effet, dans le contexte o\u00f9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 20 du Code, l\u2019Etat consent \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage CIRDI et cr\u00e9e, par sa propre r\u00e9daction une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re pour l\u2019investisseur d\u2019exprimer son consentement, il demeure tout \u00e0 fait objectif de dire que cette loi, en application des trois principes susmentionn\u00e9s ou m\u00eame si on n'applique pas ces principes, doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e 'en faveur' de l\u2019investisseur.120*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 61.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 62.\n\n172.\n\nFourth, the Claimants dismiss the Respondent\u2019s allegation that they mischaracterized evidence in order to attempt to fill in the gaps of their arguments.121\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 42-62.\n\n173.\n\nFifth, the Claimants maintain their argument that the Tribunal should take into consideration the inappropriate behavior of the Respondent. The Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s insistence that the hearing take place in Washington D.C. and that English be one of the official languages of the proceedings resulted in additional expenses, in particular with respect to interpretation, court reporting and translation of documents.122 The Claimants thus request that in the event that the Tribunal dismisses jurisdiction, the Respondent provide *\"plus de d\u00e9tails concernant ses frais et honoraires, et notamment, mais non-exclusivement, d\u2019indiquer la portion qui porte sur la traduction fran\u00e7aise de tous documents, courriers, pi\u00e8ces, m\u00e9moires, etc\"123*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 6-12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 73.\n\n174.\n\nSixth, with respect to the behavior of the Parties, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent\u2019s behavior was in bad faith.124\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 67.\n\n175.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that \"[l]es *honoraires des Conseils de la D\u00e9fenderesse de 708,993,00 USD sont exorbitants et d\u00e9raisonnables \"125*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 72.\n\n176.\n\nFor its part, and as set out in the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, the Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n*Condamne la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 verser 225,000,00 USD aux Demandeurs, correspondant \u00e0 la part les Demandeurs de la provision pour honoraires et frais des membres du Tribunal arbitral et frais administratifs du CIRDI;*\n\n*Condamne la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 verser 357,437,00 Euros hors taxe aux Demandeurs, correspondant \u00e0 ses honoraires et frais de Conseil ;*\n\n*Condamne la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 verser 30,000,00 Euros hors taxe aux Demandeurs, correspondant aux honoraires et frais de son expert juridique ; et126*\n\n*Ordonner le paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simples aux Demandeurs par la D\u00e9fenderesse sur les sommes \u00e0 \u00eatre vers\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de remboursement des frais et honoraires et ce, \u00e0 compter de la date de la d\u00e9cision ordonnant le paiement desdits frais et honoraires jusqu'au jour de leur paiement au taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat LIBOR - 2.127*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs dated 28 April 2017, \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs dated 12 May 2017, \u00b6 75.\n\n**C.** The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal has resolved to reserve the issue of costs in respect of this jurisdictional phase of the proceedings until such time as it renders a final award.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n178.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\na) By a majority of its Members, dismisses the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection to jurisdiction on the basis of Article 20 of the 2012 Code;\n\nb) Reserves the issue of costs in respect of this jurisdictional phase of the proceedings until such time as it renders a final award."}]}
